{"text":"Outstanding -- 5 Star All the Way !!!!! My Wife and I returned this week from an outstanding time at the Excellence Punta Cana. We arrived on February 28 and departed on March 07. The Staff and the resort were exceptional. I want to acknowledge Francisco, Juan Miguel and Isabel from the entertainment Team. They were engaged, polite and ready to serve. Francisco greeted us and welcomed us daily on the beach. He encouraged us to join in the activities and fun daily. Before I write about the resort I want to acknowledge some additional people for their attention to detail and the service they provided. Sarah-She is a waitress. She was always happy and willing to get us what ever we needed.Benjamin, He is the Bartender at the Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ Kaf√ã√\u2022√ñ Bar. He was very good, and very funny and he always kept our glasses full. That was one of our favorite hangouts. Marlin-He is the nighttime bar tender at the stage area bar. Very kind and friendlyMercedes-She is with housekeeping. She maintained the bathrooms during the week near the Casino and Italian restaurant. She was off the day we left and I noticed the difference. The bathrooms were impeccable. Manny-He was the pizza delivery guy at the pool area. He provided outstanding service and made sure my wife and her sister had food to eat every afternoon. The food, drinks and grounds were excellent. The room was clean and spacious. The French Restaurant was very good, but the service lacked due to the fact the waiter was more concerned with watching the show then waiting on the table. The Grill was top shelf. The staff was kind and attentive, and the food was great. The other restaurants were very good with no real issues with the exception of the Lobster House. The Lobster was over cooked and very hard to remove from the shell. The entertainment was first rate √à√\u2020\u2022?The Michael Jackson review and Chris Blizzard√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ singing was the best shows we attended. The saxaphone player entertained most nights and he was amazing. All the shows were of a very good quality, but we liked these best. The beach and beach area were wonderful. It was clean and we were not hassled by the beach vendors all week. They were nowhere to be found. The shopping, just north of the resort on the beach had all the typical trinkets you would expect. The Shop Owner\/ Dealer named Nancy was very kind, fare and to the point. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel \/ resort we have ever stayed in on vacation. Thanks again to the Excellence Staff and Management team. We really enjoyed our time and we will stay at one of your resorts again. We feel that the extra touches made this a true five star.
