{"text":"A maze of twisty little passageways You are in a maze of twisty little passageways, all alike, but fortunately help is at hand in the shape of Stefano and Suzanna, our excellent hosts at Hotel C√ã?¬© de Dogi. Nothing seems to be too much trouble, and we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe had a very relaxing and enjoyable week. We rented their Apartment Sole (Sun Apartment) on the top floor of a small building just across the twisty passageway from the main hotel. Its quite a climb to the top (78 steps) but well worth it, comprising a modern well equipped living room\/kitchen\/diner, shower\/bathroom, small cosy bedroom with a wide king-size bed and a terrace looking out over the rooftops and the Bridge of Sighs to the Dogi's Palace.As I type, the air conditioning refuses to go cold, but I'm sure its operator error and Stefano will be able to tell me what I'm doing wrong tomorrow after breakfast, which incidentally is most Venetian (coffee how-you-like-it and brioche) plus fruit salad, juice, and yoghurt. Omelette is on offer too. Anyway, for now, I just open some windows which are rather splendid powered velux affairs. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ hard resisting the temptation to play.The kitchen has most things you need for home-made snacks and take-aways if you want to reduce your dining-out budget. In fact, I'd say its probably the cheapest way of staying in the heart of Venice for a week costing about the same as a hotel room per night but affording much greater comfort (as long as you don't mind the stairs). We've been able to have some meals in and some out. When it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ very easy to spend √à√\u2020√ü?0 on a modest restaurant meal around here, the occasional take-away pizza helps balance the finances. There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a good but small supermarket a few streets away in San Lio and SS can provide directions.The weather has been mixed this week (April 9-16, 2008) and we've been able to enjoy the sun terrace as well as dry-out the wet shoes, coats and trousers much more easily than in a hotel.Other reviews here have fully described the marvelous location so I won't go into that except to say that its quite magical being able to just pop out for ten minutes for a stroll around San Marco.What else can I add?: If you are going in the near future be aware that building work is happening next door at the same level. So Mon-Fri there has been constant noise of drills, saws and shouting. Having said that, we've not found it obtrusive as it is going on inside the building rather than on the scaffolding outside. In fact, it's provided some entertainment, especially when nobody could find Giovanni one day.Also, if you like long drinks of tea or coffee take your own mugs. Italians don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ do long hot drinks its not part of the culture and Suzanna didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have anything that would suffice in the restaurant either. We eventually tracked some down in a local hardware shop.Other recommendations: There's quite a bit of debate, I notice, as to whether a Venice Card is worth the √à√\u2020√ü?0 (orange variety). I'd say most definitely yes, especially now that single journey rate is √à√\u2020√ü?.50 and the loos cost √à√\u2020√ü? per pee. Pre-book it on the web anyway and pay up front as well, if you trust the rather idiosyncratic ACTV web site.I read a review that stated restaurant owners in the vicinity of San Marco view their clientele as √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬∂ne-shot√à√\u2020\u2022?prey and consequently there is no need for them to provide value for money. Sadly it seems to be true, at least, in our experience this week. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° single some out but it seems unfair. Basically take what you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° pay in UK pounds for any item (even coffee) double it and that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ what you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l pay in Euros in the San Marco area. But head away from that area and you will eventually get value for money. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° wholeheartedly recommend the Taverna San Trovaso near the Accademia bridge, which although not cheap you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mind parting with the cash as the ambience and food are superb.Lastly, your average Venetian is a really nice patient, tolerant and pleasant guy. We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been immensely impressed with the helpful way the public transport staff, museum people and locals put up with hordes of √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√Ütrangeros√à√\u2020\u2022?like us invading their wonderful city and fumbling about with their magnificent language.
