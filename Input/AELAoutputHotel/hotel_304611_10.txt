{"text":"Great hotel but it can be a hit and miss! I travel to Singapore many atimes and only once stayed at another hotelI will give its pluses first, before giving the negativeThis year (2008) I stayed there 3 times in the space of the first 6 months of the year. (I travel Tiger Air - from Perth to Singapore I find deals for about 300 return inc taxes - as an aside I love travelling Tiger, small planes but very efficent ground service)Overall, I am very happy with the Hotel. Location is great - mostly why I stay here.Not much else I can say on that matter. But top stars!Food is well we usually only have breakfast, but highly recommend it, although sometimse it can be very busy especially on the weekendHeat bar is nice to sit over the window stools and enjoy the world passing by. Go for happy hour.But the best singapore sling is at the Marriott near by. The have a highest alcohol level! Its our tradion to have one there before we leave singapore. (And so much cheaper than the Long Bar at the RAffles - but you must go to the Raffles fro one singapore sling at least once! T^he High Tea at the Royal Plaza is good, but we usually have only gone to the Raffles High tea. The rooms are clean and tidy. The house keepers very friendly when we pass them at the corridorThe concierges are excellent. I have never had a problem with any requests I may have. Eg carrying my bags, calling for taxis or whateverSadly its the front desk staff that always let me down.At all times that i have stayed there, I have had a battle with my checkins. I have to brace myself to approach them. (eg I was travelling wtih my elderly mum, we arrvied late at night and I had emailed them earlier to ensure that we were going to have triple share, so please have a bed ready. They said they would, they even quoted me triple share rate. But wehn wearrived - no third bed was ready and we had to wait for a bed to be made up for us. We told them we were going to come again the following weeknd very late at night and please have athird bed ready! But when we arrived - no triple bed was ready nor a notation to that request!! (I had told the concierge and the front desk staff the previous week but to no avail)The front desk tend to not have any friendliness about themApart form the front desk staff, everything is faultlessAlthough, now we dont include breakfast, nice as it is. We like to eat out like a local. The breakfasts are so good, you eat too much to go out and about to eat outside.Having said all this, we have booked ourselves in the hotel again, when we go to Singapore mid January next year (2009)I am mostly curious as to how the front desk will take us!!!!
