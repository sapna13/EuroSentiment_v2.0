{"text":"Great hotel, Great owners! We stayed at the Hotel Europa for 5 nights in early November. The hotel is located on the 2nd  3rd floor of the building. The location was great, very central to everything. About a 5 minute walk to the Duomo. We walked all over the city with no problems. The street that the hotel is on is fairly busy, but we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hear any noise from inside the hotel. There is someone at the desk from 7am to 1am which was also nice. We had the Raphael suite. It was nicely decorated and fairly large. There was plenty of room for 2 large suitcases with room to move around. The room was very very clean as well. There is also a computer to use by the reception desk, free of charge, which was really nice.Miriam  Gassim were wonderful. They bent over backwards to make our stay pleasant. Gassim greeted me every morning by name. Miriam recommended a company to use for a day trip to Siena, which was great. She even made all the arrangements. She also made museum and dinner reservations for us during our stay. They really work hard to make sure all your needs are met.The breakfast was good. I loved the coffee machine. Breakfast included cereal, croissants, bread, hard boiled eggs, cheese and fruit. They also had nutella, my favorite!! I had it every morning on my croissant. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel. The location is great, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ very clean and most of all Miriam  Gassim were just so nice and eager to make our stay great.Try the Accademia restaurant just down the street. It was the best meal we had in Florence.Thanks Miriam  Gassim!
