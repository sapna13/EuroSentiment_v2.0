{"text":"Most Holiday Inn Express are better than this Holiday Inn I always hit the gym for a workout even during business travel, so I always pay attention to the gym\/fitness amenity and consider it an important factor when I book my hotel. The hotel website's picture showing the fitness room has a variety of equipment, including a multi-station weight machine. My experience is completely the opposite.Don't let the million-dollar lobby fool ya, the rooms are horrible. They are dated and dirty, nothing like the lobby. I was assigned to a room where the bed was not made, the garbage can is still full and only the bathroom seems to be cleaned. After I brought this to the staff's attention, the reluctantly gave me a different room. This one was unvacuumed and had colorful Peanut MMs all over the places. The bathroom amenities are so cheap, the items are from different collections, and NOTHING matched. Shampoo from one brand, lotion from another, and soap from yet a third source that doesn't even have Holiday Inn logo.The gym is also old and dated. It did not have the multi-station equipment as pictured and barely had a couple of half broken threadmills and a few unpaired free-weights. Except the lobby area, the rest of the hotel give me a yucky unclean feeling. This was a Wyndham at one point, but this Holiday Inn is soo cheap, they never bothered to replace some signage with Wyndham's name. Instead, they used a black marker to black out Wyndham's name. How tacky.Overall, this is definitely NOT what I expect from a Holiday Inn, I had way better experience at Holiday Inn Express or low-end places like Comfort Inn and etc. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":777,"mention":"Peanut","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Circus_Peanuts"],"startOffset":771},{"endOffset":1623,"mention":"Comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":1616}]}
