{"text":"Better than the old Hilton Over the years I had stayed at the old Hilton many times. Its very central location and reasonable price was the only attraction as it had become very shoddy. After spending my last two trips at thePark Hyatt (hated it) and Four Seasons (still my favorite)I decided to revisit this old friend and see what had changed. The lobby is certainly impressive and gives easy access to both Pitt and George Streets. Staff all seemed capable and refreshingly free of attitude. Well it is a Hilton. Rooms have not changed in size (small) and bathrooms are still cramped and basic but the decor has been refreshed and if one likes the austere then it will appeal. It is certainly uncluttered. Very good internet service (AU$25 per 24hrs). The small sofa is almost impossible to lounge on but it looks kind of nice. Now one has a small cramped room that by some standards, smartly decorated. The most disappointing change is the loss of the very old fashioned traditional beef palace; San Francisco restaurant. It has given way to a mediocre, overpriced and highly pretentious place called Glass. Asking for a booking for 7:30 we were told one was only available at 8:30 but if we rushed down at 6:50 we could be seated. The place was, deservedly, almost empty and by 7:30 no more than 1\/3 of the tables were occupied. Food is forgettable but decor is quite spectacular. Prices high. We longed for the good old days of Caesar Salad mixed at the table and the wonderful roast beef trolley and tuxeoded waiters. This is an unfussy hotel for someone who is happy not to have the Sydney Experience found near the harbor. Beds are wonderful to sleep in, prices are reasonable. A decent option when one is not looking for excitement. Avoid Glass and enjoy a drink in the wonderful Marble Bar where despite the loud music one can still stir memories of old historic Sydney when convicts roamed the streets.
