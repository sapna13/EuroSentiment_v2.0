{"text":"Skip this resort My husband and I are easygoing travelers and found this resort based on the recommendation of a few friends who absolutely raved about it. The resort has some good qualities, but it one of the worst value vacations we have ever experienced. It has the ambiance, food quality, and feel of a mid-range Sandals type resort, but is priced like a Ritz Carlton. We spent almost $3000 on a 4 day trip there, with a middle-road Ocean View room (actually we were given a blocked view, but that's another story). Bottom line - 4 days in Hawaii could be done for this price, or 2 weeks in a similar quality all-inclusive adult or family resort.The problems seemed to be mainly service based, rather than facility based (other than them giving us the wrong room and refusing to acknowledge it). We are very seasoned travelers and have spent time in the Carribean, Mexico, Africa, Europe, and all over small towns in the US - so we are not sheltered Yankees with bad attitudes - I promise. We maintained our patience the whole time but by the end of the trip we were ready to go home, which is not typical for a 4 day weekend in a supposed luxury resort. Waiters\/waitresses were understaffed, had bad attitudes, and were not attentive. Pricing throughout the resort was ridiculous (every meal was $50 for two people, usually a salad and sandwich with soda). On top of that, there was no authentic Puerto Rican twist, not even a local type restaurant, on the resort. It could have been located anywhere. I would suggest to the resort that they space out their conventions or add a convention wing to separate convention guests from other guests. They actually closed the main pool on 2 out of the 4 days we were there for the corporate parties, which for us was pretty disheartening. There were 2 conventions while were there - Chase and B of A, back to back. This was a big spring break week, too, so it was 100% capacity. The resort should not have booked the hotel to 100% capacity, as the restaurants and staff were not able to handle it. Again, attitudes were poor, guests were grumbling, and many people's room bills had invalid charges.I would recommend spending 4 days at the Mirage or Caesar's in Las Vegas, or heading to an all inclusive mega resort in the Carribean or Mexico instead of spending your money at El Conquistador. It is a terrible value for a similar experience.
