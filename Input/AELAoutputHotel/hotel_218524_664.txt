{"text":"An excellent vacation.. Just returned from 11 days in paradise and can't wait to return to the Excellence Punta Cana. My friends and I travel extensively and we go to the DR at least twice a year. Normally, we stay at the Paradisus, but decided to try something new. The Excellence Punta Cana fit all of our requirements. From the moment we arrived at the resort it was paradise. I stayed in the Excellence Club and it was well worth the money. Service was good everywhere at the resort, but within the Excellence Club - they went that extra mile. Many, many thank you's and gracias to NICKI, MARIA, ROBERTO and ANA from the Excellence Club. All I had to do was ask and they made it happen - from having my jacuzzi run at a specific time to making my spa appointments. Even decorating my room on my birthday.My room was located in building 10 and offered a wonderful oceanview. I was impressed that the safety deposit box was large enough to hold my laptop. There is wireless service available (but the signal is strongest in the main lobby and the Excellence Club lounge). The rooms have a stocked mini bar which includes (gin, bourbon, rum, vodka, beer, sodas, and water) - PLUS snacks. Thank you to MARIO, ILBON AND KELLY from the Mini-Bar team - they kept me stocked with Oreos, Red Bull and Licor 43.I'm a picky eater and the resort offers so many choices - I was always able to find a great meal. There is a breakfast and lunch buffet available at Toscana, but I never tried them. Room service will deliver a great breakfast and lunch at the Grill or on the beach should not be missed. For dinner I visited all of the restaurant's and really enjoyed Agave and Spices. Reservations are not taken at the restaurant's, but I found that the wait time ranged from 15 - 30 minutes. They give you a disc that glows when your table is available, that way you can go to Martini or Cafe Kafe while you are waiting.Service at the pool at times was hit or miss, but the pizza delivery hits the spot around 1:30 in the afternoon. We never had any problem finding a desirable location by the pool. There were always chairs, the fabulous beds and pool floats available.Loved that the resort is ADULTS ONLY. There is a one hour transfer to the hotel by car and next time I will take the helicopter transfer. I travel extensively and on average spend 80 - 100 nights a year in hotels. The few concerns that I had while at the hotel, were quickly resolved. They met and exceeded my expectations and look forward to returning this and the other Excellence Resorts.
