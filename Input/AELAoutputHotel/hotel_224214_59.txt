{"text":"Great experience, with a few small gripes. My husband and I stayed (and are still staying) at the Bryant Park Hotel. We booked for a week. The hotel room is very very nice and spacious, and the location is perfect. However, next time I'm in NY, I would try one of the more 'traditional' hotels like the marriott perhaps... somewhere where the hotel staff are warmer and where the lobby feels more friendly... but that's just personal taste. Overall, the Bryant Park Hotel is great. I've listed some of my experiences below.Check-in: was quick, efficient, though impersonal. The lobby: Smart, clean and modern, but small. Was not quite comfortable - they've gone 'modern' and contemporary to the point you somehow just don't feel comfortable hanging around. There's no traditional lobby lounge or seating to wait or get cosy in. Room: Excellent size and furnishings, bed was comfy. Bathroom was big, clean and modern, and bath products were very lovely. We were on the 18th floor and it was pretty quiet. There was some reno being done in the top floors of the hotel but that didn't disrupt us much... only heard the occasional bump during the day. Only gripes are that the walls are waaaayy tooo thin (I can faintly hear next room occupant talking\/watching tv. In fact, while I sit in the comfy bed typing this review, I can hear the room occupants next door faintly moaning and their bed squeaking from their evening exertions..... oh dear). Also, next room's door opening\/shutting actually does reverberate through our room, which can be slightly annoying if you like to sleep in. The only bathroom gripe would be the shower - they have one of those 'rain water' drippy showerheads that means it's virtually impossible to have a quick shower.Doorman\/men: are usually present and polite, but they don't do much. There are 2 sets of doors leading from the street to the hotel lobby. One set of doors is usually left open, and the doormen often just stand around chatting. Half the time, they do greet you. They are all dressed in black tees and pants and look more like bouncers than proper hotel doormen. Once you get through one set of doors, you normally have to open the second set of doors yourself, as all 2 or 3 doormen will be gathered only at the first set of doors chatting. House keeping: is EXCELLENT. Your room gets cleaned and tidied twice a day, and there's a privacy button should you wish. In the evenings, they turn down your bed, turn on the therapy machine (fills your room with soothing noises :), put choccies on your bed and positions slippers next to your bed, fill your ice bucket. It's all very very lovely!!In Room Dining: Too too expensive. Add 20% tax to cost of food, plus a $4 delivery fee. We had a turkey club sandwich and fruit salad delivered at midnight once, and it was of acceptable quality. We did dine at the Koi Restaurant downstairs one evening and the quality of the food was good. Service in Koi was standard (good), like you would get in most of Manhattan. The only downer at Koi was the very VERY FROSTY hostess who had forgotten how to smile, even when smiled at! She came across snobbish and cold, with not even a response to our goodnight when we left. To be honest, for Koi's prices, you would do better trying nobu \/ nobu next door \/ the london. The image Koi projects is also somewhat contradicting - for a restaurant that charges top price, they give you wooden 'takeaway' chopsticks. Also, the decor mixes casual bamboo with funky ceilings. It's not a cohesive mix. Internet access: They charge you for it, even though in the park across the road and the cafes next door, it's free. Makes you feel a little ripped off for what you already pay to stay there. Health club on level 5: Was great! They had a great range of equipment and the room was large. There were also towels provided there, a basket of apples, a water container, a TV, and a toilet just in case. It's clean, presentable, quiet - very user friendly.
