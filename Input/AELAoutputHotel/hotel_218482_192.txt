{"text":"The Second Time was Good, but... This is the second consecutive Christmas we spent at this resort. We loved it so much last year that we had to go back. There have been some improvements made since last year. The snack bar at the pool add a wood-fired pizza oven and that was great for a snack while at the beach. I think the overall food was improved and I noticed less flies around the buffet. Our room this time was nicer since the shower and the toilet were part of the overall large bathroom and not separate. The pillows were bigger and more comfortable. The staff was nice and friendly and we had a great time. The Christmas show was completely innappropriate and disappointing. They didn't even wish us a Merry Christmas. The live nativity was very nice.Then, something I ate gave me amoebiasis and I had to be hospitalized for two days in the local hospital. You don't want to do that. The doctor at the medical center was great. She treated me and arranged for me to go to the hospital. I only rate our experience as above average because of the treatment my wife got while trying to rearrange our plans. We were to leave the day of my hospitalization and my family had to stay an extra two days at the hotel. In that moment of crisis, the staff didn't seem to care that I was sick and that we needed to quickly make new arrangements. My advice: Be very careful with the food. I let down my guard and ate a salad and the next thing I know I'm in the hospital. If you can get some kind of optional health coverage you may not be stuck with a hospital bill on your credit card.
