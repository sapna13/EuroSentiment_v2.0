{"text":"Good for our needs We stayed in ESJ Towers at the end of January. We wanted a place that would accomodate our family comfortably (2 adults, a 12 year old and a 16 year old), have kitchen facilities, be conveniently located, have some resort amenities, and be reasonably priced. ESJ towers met these needs. We booked through a realtor and were very satisfied withour 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit. The apartment was very clean, was decorated attractively, had plenty of clean towels and linen, and a kitchen fully equipped with dishes and appliances. We even had a washing machine and dryer in our unit. I think the condition and decor of the units vary, but we lucked out.The pool was nice with plenty of lounge chairs surrounding it and a hot tub nearby. The pool was a plain shaped pool without fancy landscaping, but it was a nice size and clean and there was a kiosk by the pool which served pretty good drinks. Plenty of towels were available for quests at the pool and at the fitness center.The beach was nice except that for part of our stay there was a lot of sea weed in front of our hotel. It was not only our hotel, but some of the adjacent fancier resorts also had the same problem.The staff at ESJ were very helpful and friendly. The staff at the front desk, the concierge, the minimart and the restaurant were all very friendly and accomodating. My children enjoyed the ping-pong tables, the game room and the pool tables during our stay. I was glad to see that the hotel offered internet service 24\/7 at no extra cost to its guests.The location of ESJ was central to a lot of the tourist sites in Puerto Rico as well as casinos, golf courses and night life.Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to families who are looking for a nice, convenient place to stay with the understanding that the facilities are not fancy, resort level facilities. We would consider a return trip to ESJ Towers in the future.
