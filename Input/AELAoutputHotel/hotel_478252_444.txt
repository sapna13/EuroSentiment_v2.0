{"text":"Incredible weather, food, and overall holiday experience. We just got home from this incredible resort and I thought I would write a review, as it was important to me to read the reviews before we went. The four of us (hubby, myself and kids, 11  8) stayed Nov. 29-Dec. 6\/07. The food was fabulous.(trust me, we went to Mexico last year (Grand Oasis) and have never had such bad food) The buffet had numerous choices available being club diamond we also had access to the Italian restaurant for breakfast and lunch, as well as four alacarte choices. We tried the Cafe de Paris, Brazilian, Italian and Le Gourmet restaurants. Cafe de Paris and Le Gourmet are virtually the same, including menu if I had to choose one it would be Le Gourmet (a little more fancy). Brazilian was located outside which made for an interesting dinner as it was EXTREMELY windy the night we went.Italian was pretty good too, I had the lasagna.Actually some of my favorite meals were from the main buffet (bavaro side).Pool- was great, spent most of our time here with the kids, we were always able to find somewhere on a beach chair in the sun.Ocean-clean white soft sand, numerous beach chairs and palapas,always really wavy so we didn't snorkel at the resort.Excursion- We did the Carribean Festival ($79 Adults $39 Kids) It was fun, about 30-40 min. snorkeling, then off to the nurse shark area to snorkel with the sharks and finally the sting ray interaction area, where you can touch and eventually hold them while the photographer takes your picture ($10) to buy them when your done. Weather-had a couple nights of rain, but it was late and we were already in our room for the night. Had hot sunny weather the entire week about 29 or higher each day. Only had a couple afternoon showers, but they literally last for only a few minutes and the sun comes out again.Staff-So friendly, and accomodating, really good with kids, very pleasant people.Tipping-We tipped at the alacarte's and a couple times at the main buffet. We tipped for pool side drink service and at the swim up bar.We tipped our maid $3\/day and $5 the last day. The room was always very clean with new towel creations each day, lots of fresh towels and bottled water. They don't expect, or require tips, and actually the service was the same whether we tipped or didn't tip, but do tip well, they work so hard.Extras-Daughter had her hair braided for $50, we had it done at the Pueblo market area in one of the shops as the pool side braiding wanted $69, or more. Also, do barter with the market vendors, or just get souveniers at the stores at the pueblo, because they start out with crazy prices like $45 for cheap necklaces that we eventually paid $10 for. Hamburger restaurant at the Pueblo is quite good, (opens after 10:00pm,included in all inclusive price).Gym- Visited on 3 occasions, watch the equipment, most is in pretty rough shape, use the first treadmill closest to the entrance and the one and only eliptical, or the bikes, as the other treadmills are broken (loose belts, or don't go fast enough) good free weight area, with two benches, a decline ab bench and a few universal machines available.Busses-Yes this resort is huge, (two resorts in one), but we never waited longer than 2-3min for a bus. They go all over the resort quickly, good walking paths if you happen to miss the bus, or wait a few minutes longer for the next one.That's all I can think of, I would not hesitate to return to this resort, we had an excellent time. Enjoy!!
