{"text":"A lovely stay in the center of it all! My husband  I spent a great three day weekend at the Westin New York. We stopped by the hotel on Saturday morning to check our bag until we could check in, and the lady who helped us kindly upgraded us to a room on the top floor with a great view of the river and let us check in to our room at the early hour of 10 am. She was the first of the great service we received; they have everything you'd ever forget at home. We were so impressed by the decor, cleanliness and size of the room. The king-sized Heavenly bed was perfect after a long day of sightseeing, and the Heavenly bath is luxurious as well (great bath products!). Elevators work out very well, with four dedicated to the upper floors, running express for about 20 floors. The TVs in the elevators were a neat touch. Don't worry about getting a good night's sleep in this hotel! Between the blackout shades and the great soundproofing, we didn't really hear a peep from the craziness of Times Square, nor the elevator even though we were adjacent to the elevator shaft. We loved the location - close enough to Times Square, but you can leave the hotel and not feel like you're going to get run over by the crowds. The subway is within two blocks, as well as the Port Authority Bus Terminal. We didn't spend too much time in Times Square, but it's definitely convenient for getting around. We walked most of the big sites in midtown without feeling exhausted. Just make sure to wear your walking shoes!I'm not for sure if we'd pay full price, but our Priceline rate of $150 a night was a STEAL! You can't get much of anything that isn't seedy for less than that, so I thought it was a smart splurge. Enjoy your trip to the Westin. I'll upload pictures of our room once I get the camera out.
