{"text":"So called luxury with a huge price First of all I have to say that the lobby was astonishing. Unfortunately other things about this hotel weren't as good. The staff was extremely friendly. Friendly to the point that it seemed extremely fake. There was one exception: at the business center we got treated extremely coldly and arrogantly.I have been travelling around the world a lot and I have to say that the worst and the most expensive breakfast that I have ever had was served here. First the quality of the food, just horrible. I only once tried the continental breakfast which was included in our fare. It Included The worst tasting muffin I have ever had with few croissants. All this for a ridiculous price of 50 dollars for two (plus tax + 15% service). So after that horrible experience we tried the American breakfast. Not much better but at least you got your stomach full and of course had to pay more (64 dollars for 2 plus tax + 15% for the service). The scrambled eggs were tasteless and about half of the time cold. They were overcooked all the time. The potato rosti they had was also cold almost every time. And everything needed salt and pepper to taste anything at all. You would expect the food to be better quality or at least fresh when they prepare it just for you. Or that they should be doing but the quality of the food tells otherwise. Every breakfast buffet even in the cheapest hotels has been so much better than this. For me good food means better mood. So my every morning was ruined with this junk.We had our room in the 21st floor. It was a corner room so very spacious and nice. There was nothing spectacular though. The bathtub was small for two people. So no romantic baths together. The main complaint about the room was noise. The street below is very busy so bring your earplugs. I think the noise isn't that much of a problem higher up. Now that we are complaining I must add that the TV was extremely poor quality. The image was extremely distorted at the sides. I wouldn't expect poor quality in a 5 star place.As an American Express Platinum\/Centurion cardholder do not expect too much of the room upgrade promised in the Fine Hotels  Resort -program. Although the hotel had a higher catecory rooms available we weren't upgraded to that (only given spacious corner room). After complaining about it they promised to upgrade us to higher room gategory but no amenities included in that room gategory wouldn't be given. So in our case it would have meant only a smaller room few floors higher up. So we decided not to 'upgrade'.So if you have plenty of money to waste and don't mind spending like crazy then this is your place. But if you want value for your money then you could choose so much better. One example of their outrageous prices was the use of internet. 19 dollars for 5 minutes of internet + 2 prints. One last warning that I can't emphasize enough. Avoid breakfast here at all cost!
