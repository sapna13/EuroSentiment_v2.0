{"text":"Nice clean and comfortable hotel Had a comfortable and pleasant stay at this hotel which is about a 10-15 minute walk from the city centre. It is located next to the River Arno and there is a riverside cafe opposite where you can sit out for a cool drink in the evening. The bedroom was clean and comfortable as was the bathroom which appeared to be newly refurbished.Breakfast time is busy. It's a help yourself buffet style with lots of choice (hot and cold). The hotel seems popular for coach parties and if you are not part of a group tour you need to make this clear at breakfast as there are two dining areas for tours and others. The breakfast room for people who are not part of a tour is available until 10 am whilst the one for tour groups closes at 9.The hotel has internet facilities (5 Euros for half an hour if you don't have your laptop with you).You can book the open top bus city tour from the hotel reception which takes you round the major sights and you can hop on and off as you like.The major attractions are very busy during the day but queues for the galleries die down from 4 p.m. onwards when the tour groups leave.Overall a very pleasant hotel in good location. We didn't use the dining room for dinner as there is an excellent italian restuarant next door.No tea and coffee making facilities in the bedrooms so take your travel kettle.
