{"text":"Stunning holiday Me and my partner stayed at grandparadise bavaro for two weeks. It was the best two weeks of my life. On arrival we were greeted with a refreshing coctail and were checked into our rooms within 5-10 minuets. The room was clean and tidy and the air-con had been put on ready for our arrival which was brilliant as the weather was so hot. The room came with a beautifull view of the beach which is absolutly stunning.The rooms also come with a mini fridge wich is filled up everyday. There are 2 main pools that are huge and finding a sunbed was never a problem at any time of the day. Round the pool there are plenty of activities that include water sports, bowls, shuffle board and table tennis. People also walk around with animals and will take pictures of you with them which is good fun for the kids. Moving onto food we never went hungry. The grand Buffet changes its theme everyday and there is always a wide variaty and choice. The beach bar serves pizza,chips, burgers and hotdogs basically all day then turns into a restraunt at night wich is a definate must to visit. I recommend the itialian and the grill as the food is simply superb.alcohol is all inclusive 24 hours a day and there is loads to choose from. Becarefull as everything contains rum and lots of it. :) the beer is good over there too. The weather was brilliant but beware it does rain for short periods of time most days. This is very refreshing and only lasts for 10 minuets most storms and heavy showers happend at night. At night there is plenty to do. There is a show, a night club and a sports bar. The sports bar is open 24 hours and serves sandwhiches,nachos and popcorn through the night. The staff are very very friendly and a small tip wont go a miss.in the sports bar they make a wonderfull cocktail called ohmygod. I wouldnt ask what is in it but its fab. If you are staying at the resort for two weeks it might be a good idea to take some trips with your travel company. Thomson offerd a wide range of trips and we went on two of them. One was swimming with the dolphins and the other a trip to saona. Both wonderfull once in a life time expriances which were great fun. Beware of the people walking on the beach offering you trips because you wont be insured on them. I hope this is enough information for you. You will have a great holiday. We are hoping to return sometime next year. Just a little reminder that it isnt a fully developed country and everything isnt perfect but its very near.
