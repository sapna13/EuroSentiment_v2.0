{"text":"A Fantastic holiday We had a fantastic stay and were lucky to be upgraded as originally we were staying at Caribe Club Princess. The place is beautiful and has everything you want and need.We were so glad we ignored the bad reviews on Trip Advisor as if you do not enjoy this holiday then you need your head read. It seems that a minority of our friends over the pond seem to think that every country in the world should have a fake smile, empty pre practised phrases and 1st class silver service - FYI the Dominican Republic is a beautiful yet very poor country, it is a third world country and comparing a resort such as this to a top North American or European resort is pathetic.  Maybe some of our North American friends have not experienced some of Europe that is hundreds of years old as complaining about rust and a bit of paint is absurd. Too many holidaymakers were worried about filling their bubba kegs or being able to fit pizza, waffles, chips\/fries, rice, burgers and ice cream all on one plate. We were also mistaken for Europeans or goddamn Europeans on numerous occassions and often heard phrases such as There are too many goddamn Europeans here. I wondered to myself what these peoples' surnames were as i presume the majority of them have grandparents with pesky European surnames. When we commented on the fact that our friends on the continent (Europe) often speak fantastic English some were a bit confused and embarrassed but still resented the fact the resort was being shared - i dont wish to tar every one with the same brush but some people need to get over themselves and enjoy wonderfully friendly staff (English is often their second or third language), superb grounds, beautiful wildlife, an incredible beach, good enough food for the price you pay and great friendly restaurants.The place is beautiful and if you are a pesky european i am sure you will love it but if you are fussy and go on holiday to eat and take photos of bathroom furniture and peeling paint then you are better off not going as you get what you pay for which is exceptionally good value.I honestly think some on this site would label Florence shabby and complain that the pyramids don't have flatscreens embedded in them advertising sausage biscuits.
