{"text":"Perfect stopover We stayed at the Keio Plaza for 4 nights on our way to a Niseko for a skiing holiday. We are a family of 5 and had 1 twin room and a triple. The rooms were in the main building. The rooms are renovated, very neat and functional. The triple room is adequate in size rather than generous as it has to accommodate 3 oversized single beds. The twin room was more spacious. Bathrooms were small but functional. We were 34 floors up and the views were quite nice. There are quite a number of restaurants within the hotel complex but most are very expensive for dinner, however, you get what you paid for. We had the best Korean meal there one evening. Interestingly, even the most exclusive restaurant offers set lunches at a fraction of the evening prices.Staffs there are very polite and helpful but language is still a barrier. You can survive on English alone but if things get complicated then expect some slow, simple speaking and gesturing.The hotel's location is excellent. Shinjuku station is only 5 mins away on foot (or 10 mins if you actually follow the signs from the station!). All the major electronics\/camera and departments stores are represented within a few blocks of the hotel.One word of warning. Neither of our rooms are marked smoke free (nor our friends so I assume it is not a house rule) but each room has a very elaborate air purifier in the room and a call to the front desk will have housekeeping running with a can of air freshener.
