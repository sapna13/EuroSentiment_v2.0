{"text":"This hotel may be small but it makes up for it in character. Loved it! This hotel treats you like an invited guest, always ready to help you. If you have any doubts about understanding the language, the people who work here speak fluent English. One tripadvisor's suggestion to bring a printed out map of the location helped our cab driver find it, as there are many Best Westerns. One look at my map and he took us right to the hotel. The rooms are small, but very comfortable and recently decorated. The bathrooms are very up-to-date, bright, and lovely. The location is ideal, very close to the Boulevard Saint Michel, Boulevard Saint Germaine, and a short walk to Notre Dame on the river. The Louvre is a 20 to 25 minute walk. There are lots of great cafes to choose from and we were very pleased with several that we stopped at. A small market is just down the street from the hotel where we bought cheese, crackers, fruit, wine, etc. Our whole experience couldn't have been better and we felt very welcome. The breakfast was fairly expensive - 13 euros each - but even if you try it once, it's an interesting experience. The internet is available at a small fee, and we used it several times. One suggestion - if you get a chance, visit the small side street off of Boulevard Saint Michel in the eventing (after 8:00) where locals go to visit the many bistros and brasseries - it's the place to go at night. You can really enjoy the French atmosphere here. All in all, we had a great time and I would highly recommend this hotel for the price. ","annotations":[]}
