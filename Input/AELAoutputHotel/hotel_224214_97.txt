{"text":"Perfect weekend at a perfect hotel As a travel agent for the past 30 years, we are always looking for a hidden gem and this is it. The location is perfect. The staff was wonderful. (special thanks to Chris-manager, Paul in reservations, Loretta in accounting- I talked to them so many times before arriving -I felt like we were family). Justin and Lloyd were excellent bellmen -with loads of information.Please keep in mind we were 2 women traveling with our kids-ages 11 and 15 and they LOVED it. This past weekend was a little cloudy and rainy and taxis were just not available. We were able to walk (or subway) everywhere. (Subway station three doors down).Three years ago we stayed at the Plaza and thought that was a great location--this beat it by far. Bryant Park is very charming and right across the street. PAX -great deli food- down the street . The rooms were spacious, neat and clean. Special thanks to the hidden maid for room 1502.Try Da Nico's in Little Italy for great food at an affordable price. Take the subway train F to SOHO to enjoy a new shopping experience. Little Italy is great but Chinatown for purses is very overwhelming and not at all a bargain. The purses are just not that great anymore and look fake--so we pasted on those.Don't just take my word for it--the next time you are planning a trip to NYC -try this great little hotel. (no big lobby--but who stays in their hotel lobby when they are in Manhattan.) Bryant Park Hotel----see you again in 2008!!! ","annotations":[]}
