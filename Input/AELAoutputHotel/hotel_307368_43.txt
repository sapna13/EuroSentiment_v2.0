{"text":"A haven within the urban jungle of Tokyo A six-night stay at the hotel was something we had looked forward to for several months - reading several reviews on Trip Advisor in advance simply whetted our appetite. Having been to Japan several times I was aware of the expected levels of service and was not disappointed at the Park Hyatt Tokyo. From stepping out at the front door to leaving after 6 nights the staff were exemplary - never intrusive and extremely helpful. It makes staying at any hotel in the west see simply awful.After being taken up to reception and then our room we were simply amazed by the view, the comfort and the bathroom. Despite some serious jet lag we could not wait to explore the hotel and its amenities. The pool on the 47th floor is simply wonderful - swimming with TOkyo stretched out beneath you is surreal. The bar, although expensive, was worth it for the treat. Given the exchange rate for the Yen at the moment it was not too bad. Breakfast and other meals were always fabulous.Although we were out and about most of the time it was always a joy to come back to the comfort and reassurance of the hotel. I felt like the staff were our friends at the end. Only small gripe was the distance to walk to public transport. However, a taxt to Shinjuk station or the subway rarely cost more than √ä√£¬¢5 - which is not too bad. I would return again if ever I am in the city.
