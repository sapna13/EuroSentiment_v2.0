{"text":"Clean, good value - one problem We stayed at Cow Hollow for 4 nights in May - 2 nights before we went to Yosemite and 2 nights after. The price was very reasonable (especially with the free parking). The room was VERY clean. They had free wireless internet. Others here have complained about the noise, but even though we had a room facing Lombard, we were not bothered by the noise (and we come from a quiet town of 16,000, so we are not used to the traffic sounds). We also liked the location - it felt very safe and there were lots of places to eat nearby (we liked the Bay Watch next door for breakfast). We walked to Fisherman's Wharf from here - a long walk, but very doable.Our only problem - on our third night here, the toilet clogged. My husband called the front desk and asked that they send someone up with a plunger to fix it - he was told no they wouldn't, but there was a plunger available if he wanted to come down and get it and fix the clog himself! When I stay at a hotel, I expect the plumbing to work and if it doesn't I certainly don't expect to have to fix it myself! It was late (about 10:00) and it just seemed easier to plunge the toilet ourselves rather than argue with the front desk, so we did, but the whole incident certainly lowered my overall opinion of the Cow Hollow.That being said, I would stay here again.
