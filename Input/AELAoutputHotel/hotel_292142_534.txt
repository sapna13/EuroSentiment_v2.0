{"text":"You'd better believe it! We chose this hotel based on the reviews on Trip Advisor - it was rated the 2nd favourite hotel in NY. Having booked it, I then had second thoughts because I'd never heard of it and we've previously stayed in the places like the Waldorf Astoria.On arrival, first impressions were not good - a very small reception area with some tired chairs, it looked more like an office block than an hotel. However, this is the only tiny negative niggle about the whole experience.The staff were unfailingly cheerful and helpful. I requested a room on a high floor (as recommended in one of the reviews) and we were allocated a Junior Suite on the 20th floor. A corner room, it had huge windows on two sides - one with views of the Chrysler Building and one with the sunrise over the East River. The room was huge, well equiped with a huge wardrobe (with an iron and ironing board!), lots of drawer space, a desk area and a seating area. A small kitchen contained a kettle and coffee machine with complimentary tea and cofffee (as well as an oven and microwave).The bed was very comfortable. They have nice linen and a pillow menu offering three very different types of pillow! Despite the large windows the blinds had blackout linings and were very effective at keeping out the light.Despite taking our exercise kit to try out the extensive exercise facilities, we never entered the gym. The 34th Street location of the hotel meant that we could walk to Central Park and Bloomingdales in one direction and Soho and Greenwich village in the other so we had more than enough exercise.Do believe all the reviews - this hotel is a great find. The Junior Suite cost less than a double room in the Paramount which was the size of a small double bed with about 2 feet on each side! We will definitely stay there again. The Affinia Dumont is especially suitable for families and we are recommending it to all of our friends.
