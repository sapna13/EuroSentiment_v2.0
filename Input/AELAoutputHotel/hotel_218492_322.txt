{"text":"The Best Ever Holiday- (please read) I want to go to the same resort every single year every month if I could.I loved it so much I cried when I left it.I have never ever wanted to stay somewhere for more than two weeks but this hotel I could live there.I have read some of the reviews and alot of you are picking on little things like the food.the food is really good I think:American grill- get given margarita's to start and you have a choice from a amazing range of food from starter through to dessertBeach restaurant- this is the same sort of way as the American grill except you are over looking the sea under a large cabana.Demarco√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂- is a very posh Italian and again it has a very good variety of food.Windows- this is a buffet that you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ need to book for and it has a lot of choice of food for you to choose from and it isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ the same all the time it had different night√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ like a Spanish night etc.Beach party- this isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a restaurant but it us the night that all of the above restaurants are closed and all the staff spend all day preparing for the part very Thursday it is amazing fresh meat being carved, home Dominican stew simmering in a large cauldron above the ground, the entertain ment is amazing.The rooms are immaculate and very clean they get cleaned every day and are done to a high standard when you first go into your room it is presented beautifully with towels made of swans and decorated by fresh flowers. The mini bar gets filled every day and you get more coffee if needed. No need to bring a iron or hairdryer as they have one there, the room has plenty of storage, and the entertainment in the room is given by a large TV which has a number of channels in different languages. In the room they have a laundry bag if you fill it up and seal it then you get it back the following day. You can have room service from anytime you like and it will reach you within 30 minutes.There are three pools:Adult pool- over 18s and it has its own bar and Jacuzzi.Main pool-family pool which has a swim up barSide pool- for everyone too.The beach is seconds away from wherever you are in the hotel and is stunning.It is alright saying all about the hotel but I am missing out the best part if the hotel this is the people. They are so caring, friendly and so fun to be around. The staff made my holiday and are the main reason why I would like to return I am missing them all already and I have only just got home.thank you for readingNicciAge-14xx ","annotations":[{"endOffset":486,"mention":"starter","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pre-ferment"],"startOffset":479},{"endOffset":486,"mention":"starter","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pre-ferment"],"startOffset":479},{"endOffset":1545,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1539},{"endOffset":1545,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1539},{"endOffset":1545,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1539}]}
