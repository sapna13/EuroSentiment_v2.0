{"text":"Not as wonderful as Amandari If we had come from the airport right to this hotel at the start of our Bali trip, I would be writing a much different review. However, after six days at Amankila on the coast, we had a more conservative view of Bali luxury, and this property was sort of too tricked out for us. In addition, we failed to see why the Four Seasons (which we have frequented at many locations in Europe over the years) would ask us if we had any special events that formed a basis for our visit when we made the reservation, and would then ignore it. We told the hotel it was a significant birthday for my wife, and our 20th anniversary that led to our trip. On arrival, we were shown to a pretty basic suite, that wasn't in a great location, and our apparent acknowledgement of our special circumstances were some rose petals sprinkled in a bathtub. We asked to see a nicer suite, and we were shown to a wonderful riverview room, but they insisted on a higher payment for it, despite our long history with the company and our reservation information. The same thing happened at the Four Seasons Singapore, at the end of our trip-they didn't even acknowledge our circumstances, let alone that we were dedicated prior customers of the chain.In any event, after dinner at Amandari, that property offered us an upgrade to a pool suite at less cost than the Four Seasons room, and at a much nicer property. Rather than a tricked-out somewhat artificial farm experience at Four Seasons, we had a real village farm right outside our suite, with trails and walks down to the river, and the highest level of personal attention one could ever ask for. We went from a hundred or more rooms on the property to one of just 20 to 30. So we left after one night at Sayan, and spent our next six days, and all of our dough, at Amandari. You can check out our reviews of Amandari and Amankila elsewhere on Trip Advisor. We didn't regret our move for one second. We have a full photo blog link of our time on Bali on the Amankila posting.
