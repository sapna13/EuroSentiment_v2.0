{"text":"Convenient location in Phoenix This was our first time at a Hilton Garden Inn and we stayed two nights and enjoyed the experience. All the staff were friendly and professional and the front desk people had good knowledge about places to eat nearby. We booked a king room which was quiet, and the d√ã√\u2022√ñcor was nice, everything was clean and the Internet access was good. The made-to-order omelets at breakfast were great. The guest laundry was clean and well maintained.We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° been told these hotels are aimed at business travelers and we found this to be true. There were function rooms with company meetings taking place, but the guest rooms were at the back and we weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ disturbed at all.We found it tricky to get to the hotel. The Phoenix light rail construction is not yet finished and some intersections are still closed. The building is part of a corporate square on Central Avenue and we drove by it, thinking we had the wrong street number because you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see the hotel from the main road. Guest parking was free, but in the central square carpark next door. This is OK as long as you unload and load your bags at the hotel entrance instead of parking first.We ate across the road at Fez √à√\u2020\u2022?great food and atmosphere and reasonable prices. Some people said it was a bit noisy, but this is a popular Phoenix after-work meeting spot and we found the music and general liveliness OK. It was worth it for the food. ","annotations":[]}
