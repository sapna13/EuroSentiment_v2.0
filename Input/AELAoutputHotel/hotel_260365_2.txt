{"text":"Not bad for a business trip but where's the food? This hotel isn't too bad: I didn't have many choices as there were a number of trade fairs and other events on in Berlin at the time I needed to be there for a conference. I found the room fairly comfortable, the female staff helpful, the male staff generally arrogant and annoyed about needing to provide service, the location convenient. A few small niggles- a double room with two single beds pushed together is fine, but putting two single-bed duvets on it does not a comfy night's sleep make- I tried a number of configurations and none of them really worked. On the other hand, I've never experienced such fluffy comfy pillows. They offer very expensive wifi access in your room- but I found a strong connection to T-mobile from my room that saved me a lot of money. The thing I couldn't get was: where's the food? You arrive late and want something to eat- if you know what to ask for, you can go for a 10-minute walk to a supermarket- but there's no kettle or mugs to make a hot drink, no room service, no minibar- nothing but a very expensive bottle of water. There is a restaurant and a cafe\/bar downstairs, but these are not really comfy, they are a bit dressy and expensive; when I travel for work I like to slob out in my room and work or watch TV. Otherwise- nice, and a very convenient location for Berlin's fantastic transport system- and they will sell you travel tickets at the reception desk. ","annotations":[]}
