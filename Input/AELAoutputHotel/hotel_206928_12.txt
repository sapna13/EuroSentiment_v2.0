{"text":"Perfect location and great apartments! Stayed here for a long weekend with a group of girls and couldn't have been more pleased with the accommodation. we had a one bedroom apartment which had a double bed and a sofa with a pull out bed beneath it so it was quite a sturdy bed (not the usual rickety camp bed you'd expect). Dining table and chairs, lots of cups and cutlery etc, a mini dishwasher (nice!) fridge, toaster, kettle so if you were mad enough to eat in you could. Bathroom had a good powerful shower (with shower curtain - agree with an earlier reviewer that it's a luxury!) hairdryer was fine although precariously placed above the loo so close the lid first just incase you drop it! ah yes, tv (with a few english language channels) and a cd player and a free safety deposit box. Towels were included.It's my understanding that the apartments aren't cleaned\/sheets changed etc during your stay but I guess if you're staying longer they will do this for you. It's quite normal in Spain for hotel sheets to be changed just once a week, and let's face it environmentally it makes sense too. Location wise it's perfect, roughly halfway along the Ramblas, opposite the Boqueria market and the Liceu theatre. Close enough to explore the Barri Gotic, Cathedral, Placa Catalunya etc without taking the metro or a taxi, and about 30 minute walk to Barceloneta beach. I hope to return to Barcelona again very soon and will definitely be booking in here! ","annotations":[]}
