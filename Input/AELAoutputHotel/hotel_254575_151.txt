{"text":"Super hotel Just returned from a four night stay at the Luna Simone. We booked this hotel on the strength of reviews and were not disappointed. Upon arrival we were welcomed and given the downstairs room which we had requested. The room was not as small as we had expected, and was immaculately clean and well kept. Everything we needed for our short stay. Tea and coffee replenished every day, and extra pillows provided when we asked. Despite the room being directly onto the street, we were not affected by any unreasonable noise.The ensuite looked as though it had recently been refurbished, and like the room, was beautifully clean. Fantastic power shower. Fresh towels provided every day.My husband enjoyed the cooked breakfast every morning, and said that it was freshly prepared and lovely and hot. Best pot of tea in London! I am not a breakfast person myself, but when we were leaving the owners said that they had missed me, and did I not like the breakfast. I thanked them for their concern, and how thoughtful of them to ask.The staff are the backbone of this lovely hotel, so kind and helpful. Answering questions about our visit and providing information to make our trip more enjoyable.Travelling around London is no problem from the Luna Simone. Excellent bus service (24 hours) outside the hotel, running every ten minutes or so. Also tube connections from either Pimlico (which is slightly nearer) or Victoria.You will not be disappointed if you book a stay - exceptionally good value for central London.
