{"text":"More than pleased ! My husband was scheduled to attend a conference at the New Orleans Marriott on Canal St. Since his employer decided not to pay the lodging expenses, we looked for a nearby hotel that was more affordable. How delighted we were to discover that Country Inn and Suites offered much better rates and more and better ammenities to serve our needs, and it was only a block from Canal S. ! . Not only was the suite larger and more comfortable than the rooms his collegues had at the Marriott, but the expanded continental breakfast saved us time and money every morning. The in-room refrigerator and microwave enabled us to keep our special dietary items and snacks. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful and seemed proud of their hotel. The smaller size of the hotel was more desireable than the tall high rise. Although the C.I. S had good elevators, we opted to use the stairs more often because it was not too much effort for just one floor or two floors. We did not use the small pool or the fitness facility which looked clean and well-maintained.  One of the best restaurants for Louisiana cooking, the historic Bon Ton Cafe, is just a half block from the hotel. A well-established Cuban restaurant with a good reputation is next door to the hotel. There are many fine restaurants and stores and malls within easy walking distance. The French Quarter, the Riverfront walk, the canal street ferry, the aquarium and the casino are all close enough to walk to.  We plan to stay at Country Inn and Suites the next time we visit New Orleans.
