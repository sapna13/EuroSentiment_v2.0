{"text":"Could not fault them! I've stayed at many 5 star properties around the world, this one has to be my favourite. Everything about this hotel is effortless, luxurious and total bliss. From the inital meet at the airport, the transfer to the airport in a private car was all class. Hong Kong greeted us with a torrential downpour but the driver drove so smoothly that it was a pleasure to be a passenger. Cool bottled water and mints that were offered in the car were a pleasant surprise.Upon reaching the hotel, bags were immediately taken care of by the staff and we were greeted by our very friendly Guest Relations staff member. Taken up to our room on the 48th floor and was checked in from there. The staff noticed that we had a late flight back to London and immediately offered a late check out. The Harbour View from the room was magnificent. Welcome tea was provided for us as was a fresh bowl of fruit everyday.I had previously arranged to have a bottle of champange waiting in the room upon check in and it was definitely there chilled and waiting for our consumption. Service at this hotel was excellent. No request was ever too much of a hassle. All staff were extremely friendly and made our stay totally memorable.The rooms are very comfortable and nicely furnished. Huge beds, great bathroom products. Ok, so the Conrad may have newer rooms but the Shangri-La is by no means ugly, far from it. Breakfast buffet at Cafe Too was sensational. So many choices for breakfast, we took our time having breakfast and was never hurried along so that they could get more people into the restaurant and once again service levels were exceptional.Location wise, the Shangri-La is perfectly situated in Admiralty, just above Pacific Place Shopping Centre (along with the Conrad and JW Marriott). I never found the wait for lifts ever that long (as mentioned by previous reviewers). This was a perfect stay and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone to wants an exceptional property to stay in whilst in Hong Kong. The property speaks for itself but the staff and their level of professionalism and friendliness can't be faulted and its them who make the Island Shangri La a great hotel. I can't wait to come back.
