{"text":"Beach was Beautiful We travelled to the Dominican Republic from April 10 - 24, 2008. We stayed at Grand Paradise Bavaro on a friend's recommendation. We were disappointed with our accommocations. The air conditioning only cooled off half of the room. The maid service wasn't too bad, had to wait for clean towels and difficult to get a new box of Kleenex. Water pressure was pretty good.The only staff that were helpful were the ones anticipating a tip. The front desk people weren't too bad. The only problem we had with them was the fact that they couldn't always cash a Travellers Cheque. I had to go back five times in order to cash a $100 TC. The staff in the little souvenir shop were rude and didn't even smile. They were not equipped to give proper change with anything you wanted to purchase.The bartenders at the beach were hot and cold. Some friendly and others indifferent.We never swam in the pools as we could never find chairs and the pools didn't look very clean.The beach was very beautiful and clean, but once again, difficult to find chairs. It would be nice to have bar service at the beach!The noice factor -- loud at night with the young drunks wandering the grounds. Not a place for a quiet relaxing vacation. No personnel wanding the premises to enforce the property rules.The Food: We enjoyed the Buffet and we not too bored. The staff was very attentive once they were tipped and they remembered you and your likes the next time you arrived for a meal. The Sea Scape food was good, but the service was bad. The Grill was excellent and we had two really good dinners with good service.All in all, a good vacation, but would not return to this resort. ","annotations":[]}
