{"text":"Please read this before to book a trip at the Barcelo! I Traveled to The Barcelo a week ago... After reading the reveiws i was very sure it wasint going to be a good trip, but my mother who traveled there last year told me everything would be perfect. When we arived there at 11:00 pm we where greeted ,and they took our bags...everything seemed beautiful and perfect... when we got to our room everything changed! Our rooms doors didnt lock....our bags didnt get to us until and hour later ... the beds where horrible the blankets and sheets where thorn and dirty..the room was out dated and poorly cleaned... there was mold and bugs! So we made our way back to the front desk it was now 11:30pm.....It took until 3:00am of us waiting, arguing and begging them for a new room. We finaly got one...once we got in it... there was the same problems...tired...and fustrated we desided to make due....three other couples that arrived the same night had the same problems....the room had more mold then the first and the sheets where damp.....this was my first time traveling anywhere...im not a picky person nor do i complan but i couldnt help it in this situation. The week we stayed was not the best...the pool was dirty..same with the beach...the food was okay..but we seen a rat near the buffet and a cocroach....and to top everything off i got food poisoning the last day....Althought there was alot of bad we did make alot of friends with the staff that we will never forget...they made the trip barable..when we tried to check out ...the front desk try billing us for phone calls we didnt make!...my mom told them we had no money no visa...so they asked us to give them somthing of value! and then they waved the bus ticket in our faces and told us we couldnt leave until we payed!.....the mangment is serious messed up!....almost everyone we talking to didnt like the resort so think twice before you book with them please!
