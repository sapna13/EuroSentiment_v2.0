{"text":"Great Stay Wonderful visit to Dreams. Spent the week of May 3 to May 9 there, so Im just recently back.The good - Entertainment Staff - These folks show you a really good time. They are always out at the pool and beach trying to get people involved in activities. These included darts, croquet, beach and pool volleyball, and many other activities. You play for Dreams money to be used at an auction.The people my group got to know were 50 Cent and Stephanie, as they were around the middle pool often, which is where we were. Very nice people and I wish them nothing but the best. Stephanie, if you do read these, I hope your leg has improved since you joined the pool volleyball game.The surroundings - Ahh the pool, what can i say? Gorgeous, nice rap around pool that is shallow enough for all kids to enjoy. Plenty of floats to go around. Plenty of bars around the pool area, be sure to try the Drink of the Day. Give the Dirty Monkey a try, delicious. The beach is also beautiful. Great snorkeling, no need to pay for excursion to do this. Stay on north side of the beach to avoid rocks.The not so good - The food - to be honest, I had no problem with it, didnt expect gourmet, but my wife didnt care for it. Nice variety of restaurants. Stay away from beef dishes, they overcook everything.The bad - The room - Im just referring to the basic rooms. Ive heard the suites were great. Had water problem in the bathroom of our first room, safe and bug problems in the second room we switched to because of the water problem. Small and cramped, musty. Wouldnt recommend a room on the first floor. If you can swing it, go for a suite and get a deal from the travel company you work with that booked your trip. They will ask for 100 dollars a night extra if you want to upgrade.Overall - I would recommend this to all as its a great time and I will be back.
