{"text":"Smack dab in the middle The prior reviews were on the money. There are aspects that were good and others not so good.Having stayed in multiple solMelia properties, we were fairly confident of what we would find. First, understand that the grounds are huge. This is 2 resorts situated together, the caribe side and tropical side, each with 20 buildings. Melia√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ other chain, the Paradisus, is right next door.We were a family of five, including kids, ages (9-4). The family suites are conveniently located near the pool and the beach, unlike Royal Service which is near the lobbies and requires a train or golf cart ride to get to the beach (5-10 min. walk). Kids and evening meals - The Agora, bar\/food service, claims to only serve breakfast and lunch, but they also serve a kids buffet at night. The other half of the facility is a for pay seafood restaurant. This is a bonus and you can sign your kids into the kids club there and they will be taken to the main lobby for the kids mini disco or evening event. FYI, you pick them up at the main lobby, unfortunately, they are not returned to sender.Towels √à√\u2020\u2022?you will need to learn that there are no fresh towels available after 3pm or so. Everyone seems to get new towels in the morning, so plan ahead.Water activities √à√\u2020\u2022?nice stuff, but you need to reserve a day ahead if you want a sailboat. On days with a nice breeze, you most likely will not be sailing as they do not seem to allow the boats out.Sales people √à√\u2020\u2022?There are lots of people always milling about trying to sell you something. They are relentless in their efforts and really quite a detraction.Charging √à√\u2020\u2022?The hotel seems to believe all travels have rolls of cash on them. There are nice activities and items for sale, but credit cards are rarely accepted. The water sports folks will not allow you to charge anything under $100. It costs $95 for parasailing, $85 before 11am, but you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ pay with a credit card, only cash since it is less than the minimum. Want to get the kids out on a banana boat ride, oops, hope you have the $40 cash on the spot. You get the pointBaby sitting √à√\u2020\u2022√ä√®√ºhe rates are $10 per hour for the first child, and $5 per hour for each additional child. So our going rate was $20 per hour for a sitter who could not understand our children. Very frustrating for them and us. As stated before, at other solMelia properties, we were provided with higher quality staff.Rooms √à√\u2020\u2022?perfectly decent. Good size and outfitted well.Reservations √à√\u2020\u2022?good luck if you want a reservation for a big party, say 8 or more people. They will insist the only times available are 6 or 9pm. We finally worked around this by making 2 reservations under different rooms for the same time and location. You will also have to be a real phone jockey to get decent times. You can begin to make reservations at 9pm the night before, but be fore warned, you will be pressing the redial button a lot. Internet - $4 for 15 minutes or you can purchase an all you can eat pass for $50. There is wireless available in some of the buildings, but they are located adjacent to the business center lobby. Forget about the emails from the balcony while admiring the beach.Extensions to remember:6313 √à√\u2020\u2022?reservations3000 √à√\u2020\u2022?service expressIn summary, the staff really does try to serve you, but you will be disappointed sometime. Set your expectations accordingly, bring more cash than normal and you will have a perfectly fine time. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ forget the Pepto, you will most likely need it!
