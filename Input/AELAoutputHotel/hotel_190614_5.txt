{"text":"Beautiful hotel but bad location for seeing amsterdam The hotel is sensational (huge rooms, great service, great view) but in a terrible location if you're there to sightsee or otherwise enjoy the canal zone. Also no alternatives to the amazingly overpriced Intercontinental breakfast - more on that later. It's just too far away - can't walk, and you have to take two trams get back to the hotel from the center. When we tried to take the trams back to the hotel the second tram didn't come and we ended up walking a long wy. The hotel will call a taxi, but we had to wait 5-10 minutes for one to come. We moved to a more central hotel and enjoyed being able to drop in to the hotel when we needed a break, or to run out to shop or grab a bite to eat. About breakfast - we have stayed in several Intercontinental hotels in Europe and have been appalled by the outrageous high prices at breakfast. (Think 25-35 euros) Previously, the hotels have been near other breakfast places so it was no big deal. Once, in Rome, we got breakfast included as a promotion. The problem with this Intercontinental is that you have to walk a long way - at least a mile and a half to find a breakfast place. It's just too much of a hassle to stay here. We moved, to a small canal zone hotel, and by the way the price per night went from 500 Euros to 210, and although our rooms were smaller we were very happy there. ","annotations":[]}
