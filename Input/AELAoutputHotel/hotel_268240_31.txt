{"text":"Convienent and clean I stayed at this hotel for a conference at the Moscone Center; it was significantly less expensive than the hotels closer to the Moscone Center even with the special conference rate.I arrived quite late the first night and was given a room at the very end of the hall; it was a smoking room, despite having requested a non-smoking room through Expedia. There were no more non-smoking rooms available that night. However, the front desk called the following morning by 8 am to let me know a non-smoking room had become available for me.The rooms here are definitely small, but it also seems to be dependent on where the room is located. My first double was so small that the bathroom door, room door, and closet door all opened into the same space, but my second double was quite comfortable, albeit still on the smaller side. Cable TV is a plus, as well as the complimentary wireless Internet access (which, incidentally, may vary in signal from essentially nonexistent to reasonably strong.)A significant perk of the hotel is the complimentary refillable water bottle dispenser near the elevators on each floor. These are plastic sealed bottles which can be opened and filled with cold filtered water. Another perk is the club room on the ground floor, where I was able to use the complimentary computers with Internet access and also print documents, including ones that I sent to the printer via laptop while in my hotel room and then used a unique document code to print out once I was down in the club room.It was about a 10 min walk to the Moscone Center from the hotel and about 3 min walk to Chinatown. The nearest BART station was about 5 min away, even with luggage. I would easily choose to stay at this hotel again.
