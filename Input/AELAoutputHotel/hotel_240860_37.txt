{"text":"NOT 5 star, Horrible service, Unbelievably expensive I just got back from the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel and I am very relieved to be back home. I was in Barcelona for a large conference and I was eagerly looking forward to a stay in this 5 Star GRAND LUXE property. I had stayed there for a couple of days back when it was brand new and it was pretty nice then.  Boy was I disappointed! The prices had shot up to absolutely unconscionable levels and the property is now showing its age with shabby dings and dents on the furniture, nasty muddy stains on beige bedroom carpets etc. This is definitely not a 5 star grand luxe property in any way, shape or form. It's facilities are a generic, trendy restaurant and a lobby. No spa, no amazing pool, no choice of bars. In short, a generic, modern 4 star business hotel. If you compare this to even a 4 star hotel in say, Singapore or Hong Kong, you will come away shaking your head in disbelief.If the blah facilities were the only issue, I would have ranked this place a neutral\/average --after all I have stayed in FAR worse in Europe but it was in the area of the absolutely uncaring and snotty service that I think moved it's rating one step above terrible. The heating was turned on full blast at night, for example, and when I complained that I needed some cooling in my room, the lady at the service desk said that I should just open the window.... OK... except that there was a 110 decible Telecom Rock Extravaganza put on by some company in the courtyward ! I just sweltered until 1AM when the rock music finally stopped blaring. The next night, I had to put up with hammers and machine tools being used to take apart the rock stage from midnight to 2AM. The management took a who cares, this situation can't be helped attitude! While this is understandable for an IBIS or MOTEL 6 type place, it is ludicrous treatment when one has paid EUR 900 \/ night (they jack up the rates during the GSM conference). I don't know about you but at this kind of price, I expect very courteous and responsive treatment, not some kind of insulting manana maybe shrugging. I don't care if there's a conference going on: if you can't take feed your guests even tuna, don't charge them caviar prices! The Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel, I am afraid, is a bit of a dud. Greed, apathy and rudeness characterized my stay there. Save your money, nerves and aggravation and consider staying elsewhere. Certainly for the money I paid, I received probably the worst price\/performance ratio in terms of quality of stay of my entire working life.
