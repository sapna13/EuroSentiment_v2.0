{"text":"The Park Hotel - Well, We Got to Laugh A Lot! Oh, the Park Hotel, what memories you have given us. This was not our first, second, third, fourth, fifth, etc. choice. But we chose to go to Amsterdam during the International Broadcast Conference, and really, it was nearly impossible to find a room. Because of the conference, the prices were ludicrous. The first night was about $500, with each successive night a little less expensive.The art deco lobby was cool, and you think, wow, this might be neat. Then you hear the directions to your room. You literally turn the corner and leave the art deco behind and arrive in a dinghy, scary hallway. Then the elevator is pretty much an old freight elevator converted for guests. Then it's another flight of stairs up to the fifth floor where our room was.Upon entering the hallway, the first thing I noticed was the smell. To me, it was like stale trash lingering in the hallway. It never went away.The room was ... interesting. The bed was amazingly comfortable, and it had funky lighting so you could sleep in your own private red light district, or blue light, or yellow, or green, or white. You get the idea. The bathroom area was cramped, and the shower -- yes, it's exactly as everyone says ... flood, flood, flood. We tried everything, but the most we got was ... less flooding.We had a room overlooking the road, so it was very noisy. And, it just didn't feel clean, I wanted to walk through the room with an antibacterial wipe, and believe it or not, I am decidedly not a germaphobe.The location was extraordinary ... you can't fault that, and if you don't mind the smell, the shower, etc. this is a good place. It is kind of funky. But weirdly, this was our last stop on our European honeymoon, and this was the only place we met rude staff. But we laughed it off, things like, you can only get the full breakfast buffet in MOMO, you can't get just a coffee, well, you can, but they'll only serve it to you in the lobby. But did I mention the bed was super comfy? I can't say this place was horrible, only that we would never stay here again. But it was kind of funny.
