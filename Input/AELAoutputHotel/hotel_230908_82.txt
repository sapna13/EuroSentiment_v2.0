{"text":"Location, Location The best feature of this hotel is its location. You can walk to most major attractions in Amsterdam. We arrived early after an overnite flight, and were told to come back at 3pm for check-in. I was placed in the older part of the hotel and my friend scored a room in the newly renovated section. Once I saw HER room , I went to reception and asked to change if possible. By then, the evening shift reception came on duty and they could'nt have been more pleasant. The receptionist switched me to the same floor as my friend, and in a newly renovated room. The old rooms are drab, boring and I almost can't believe they give these rooms to people. The newly renovated ones have a gorgeous new bathroom, LCD TV on the wall and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on in a hotel. Noise was not a problem for us as well. The breakfast buffet was average, but since it was included in the price no complaints. One strange feature is the elevator, it holds only 4 people and there is only one. For a hotel of this size, thats nuts. Also, for you Americans- there is no washcloth in the bathrooms. I brought my own after reading previous reviews. They give you a large thin towel of sorts to use. There are plenty of restaurants in the area, cheap and expensive alike. The conceirge was great and told us of a great deal for meals by the floating flower market....the VD department store has an amazing food court! We also found a chinese restaurant that had a buffet , its all you can eat in one hour! Amsterdam is a lovely city, the people are friendly, and go when the tulips are blooming at Keukenhof !I would stay here again, but only in the new section. ","annotations":[]}
