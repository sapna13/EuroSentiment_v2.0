{"text":"Will stay here again The airport limo bus dropped us of in front of the hotel after an hour drive from Narita. The main lobby is very modern. Of the many people available for check-in, I noticed only 2 people who could speak fluent English. We had 2 rooms which were very clean and modern. Both rooms had ethernet cable for our laptops. There was a nice sized flat screen TV and a wide assortment of Japanese channels. There was a long desk along the window. This was also where the hot water pot, free tea, tea mugs, and mini refrigerator was located. My husband prefers coffee every morning so he bought a small jar of instant coffee at the 7-11 down the street.My husband  I had the room with the double bed which was a little on the small side. It did not have a closet or dresser. There was a clothes rod hung by the door with a few hangers which I used. My husband lived out of his suitcase. We had brought two 21 suitcases, anything larger would have made the room difficult to navigate around. My children (17, 20) had a room with 2 twin beds. Their room was a little larger and even had a small closet. I asked that their room be close to ours,  this was accomplished w\/o any problems.This hotel is in a great location just 5 min. from the south exit of Shinjuku station. There are a lot of restaurants and shopping malls like Takashimaya Times Square, Odakyu, and Keio. These places also have large food markets if you just want to have a meal or dessert in your room. (They'll provide you w\/ eating utensils if you ask.) We spent our first night walking the vibrant restaurant alleys a couple of blocks from the hotel. We paid $115 for the single and $140 for the double. We would definitely stay here again. The location, price and cleanliness of the room can't be beat .
