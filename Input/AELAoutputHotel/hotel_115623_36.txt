{"text":"Good for business travel I stayed at this hotel for two nights during a recent business trip. My colleague and I were attending a seminar being held at the Fairmont SF on Nob Hill. The Mark Hopkins is directly across the street from the Fairmont but rooms were available for about $60\/night less. The Mark Hopkins is a classically decorated, stately hotel. For the most part, it is in very good repair with the exception of the windows which were rather loose in the casings and did not provide good sound insulation from the street down below. Good touches include wireless in the rooms, available for a fee, a well-stocked mini-bar (somewhat better than usual), and 24-hr room service. One thing I really have to mention because it's a personal pet peeve of mine is the in room coffee. This hotel has a dedicated station with one of the best stocked supplies of sugar (including sugar in the raw), dry creamers, coffee and tea. I always run out of creamer at other hotels and really dislike when the coffee pot is in the bathroom. This was a nice touch. Ironically, our colleagues who were staying at the pricier Fairmont reported that they had no coffee in their rooms at all. Service is very good at the hotel. The door staff in particular were very good, including providing access to the town car for local restaurant trips on a couple of occasions. Desk staff were good and accommodated our need to check out later in the day owing to the illness of my colleague. Downsides are that this is an older hotel with sash windows that lack screens and do not lock. I would not stay there with small children. More importantly, the street is very noisy. I was staying on one of the lower floors (around 4) and was bothered by the street noise. It is worthwhile to pay a little extra for an upgraded business room on a higher floor. My business associate was around the 10th floor and was not bothered by the street noise. Her room was about $20 more per night. I would stay here again for business in this part of town (on a higher floor) but not for personal travel.
