{"text":"Canalside taste and quality This hotel is a high quality experience and offers something different to a larger, more corporate style of hotel. It is sited on what is usually described, with justification, as the prettiest canal in Amsterdam. The tour boats actually stop at the end of it to give passengers the chance to take photos. It is close to everywhere you are likely to want to visit, and yet we found it to be very quiet. The only use we made of public transport in a 5 day stay was the tram to and from the station at the beginning and end.It is a canalside house. We had a beautiful canal view room on the 2nd floor. It is bright, having 3 largish windows,and has lots of mirrors. The room is as tastefully furnished as any I have ever had. We had a nice Sheraton style table and 2 genuine Louis XV fauteuils - armchairs. The receipt of purchase from the dealers at 4000 euros was in a drawer. There is also lovely art work in the rooms and other areas. As mentioned elsewhere a good continental style breakfast is brought to your room at a time you choose - they ring you 10 minutes before to check that you are ready.The bed was very comfortable - in fact on our first night we overslept, having slept through for 9 hours (something we have not done for years!).I think this place would suit people who put tasteful ambience above someof the things you take for granted in larger hotels. There is no bar or even useable lounge. no sauna etc. Nevertheless there is all that you will need, and everything is cared for and clean.We never saw (or even really heard) other guests. The narrow steep stairs would make it difficult for elderly or infirm visitors, and I would be worried about having children in the upper rooms, as great care is needed near to the windows - the sills are at about knee height.Our room was superb. We also peeked in other rooms and the style and quality was obvious in all of them. Of course being a house there will be rooms , eg at lower ground level that could not offer the superb outlook that we had.We have visited Amsterdam before and this will now be our preferred option when next we want to go there.We had great meals very close by - including Indonesian at Tempo Doeloe, and a very good French style bistro on Prinsengracht - Le Zinc et les Autres (or Zinc et Les Dames). Also very close are Rembrandtsplein and the Muziektheater, and the famous bridges of Magere Brug and Blauwe Brug.In short a wonderful stay in a lovely house with hosts whose anxiety to please was evident.
