{"text":"Of all the bars in all the world you gotta walk into this one..! We have just returned from our first ever visit to the USA. Our trip involved a three week itinerary in a wide area of locations one of which involved the very necessary visit to New York City. We did our homework at the planning stage and having read favourable reviews of The casablanca, we booked to stay for 5 nights.This is New York City, one of the great cities of the world and as such, hotel prices are not cheap. The Casablanc isnt cheap either but there are times when it really is worth investing in quality and a visit to NYC is such a time and the Casablanca is such a place.The Casablanca is conveniently and centrally situated in a street just off times square. even so it is an oasis of peace in which to seek refuge from the mad ,crazy bustle of NYC. The staff are incredibly friendly, welcoming and accomodating. The hotel sells itself as a themed boutique style hotel and it does it very well with good quality and stylish equipment and decor. True the rooms are small by European standards but then most rooms in NYC are of similar dimensions unless you pay an absolute fortune.Our room was well equipped, clean and comfortable. breakfast is served in a nice comfortable residents lounge and is of good quality, well prepared with a good choice. Coffee etc are available all day and there is the included wine and cheese reception in the afternoon.We can recommend the Casablanca as a great place to stay for your visit to NYC.Joe  Judith, Manchester UK ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1162,"mention":"fortune","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fortune_cookie"],"startOffset":1155},{"endOffset":1162,"mention":"fortune","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fortune_cookie"],"startOffset":1155},{"endOffset":1162,"mention":"fortune","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fortune_cookie"],"startOffset":1155},{"endOffset":1162,"mention":"fortune","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fortune_cookie"],"startOffset":1155},{"endOffset":1243,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1239},{"endOffset":1243,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1239},{"endOffset":1243,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1239},{"endOffset":1337,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1331},{"endOffset":1337,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1331}]}
