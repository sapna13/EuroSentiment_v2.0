{"text":"Impeccable Service The Park Hotel is the second hotel we stayed in during our recent Tokyo holiday, and it matched the excellent experience we had at our first hotel (Cerulean Tower Tokyu Hotel) in virtually every respect. We stayed at two different hotels because we bookended Tokyo stays with a five-day trip to Osaka and Kyoto. Our bifurcated itinerary enabled us to visit sights near our hotels (Shibuya, Harajuku, and Shinjuku while at the Cerulean; and Asakusa, Imperial Palace and Tsukiji while at the Park) without spending time and money travelling around Tokyo. Even though Tokyo has an excellent transportation network, getting from Point A to Point B can still be quite time-consuming.As far as the Park Hotel is concerned, we had a lovely corner room with a stunning view of Tokyo Tower. Though not overly large, our room was very well-designed and fully-equiped with LCD-TV, mini-bar and, best of all, free high-speed internet. Our bath was spacious and was stocked with a full array of amenities. Service from every hotel employee was gracious and polite. And, location-wise, the hotel is about a seven-minute walk from the Shibuya station on the JR Yamanote line.One tip: We did not think the 2200 Yen cost for the Park Hotel's breakfast was worth the price (the Cerulean's breakfast offerings were far superior), so we decided to eat breakfast at the nearby Conrad. We agree with other posters that the Conrad is a spectacular hotel visually and will only add that its breakfast is also superb. Though the Conrad breakfast was not cheap (3400 Yen), the wide array and the excellent quality of the offerings lessened the sting on the wallet.
