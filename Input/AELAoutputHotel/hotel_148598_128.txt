{"text":"expensive My boyfriend and I stayed from the 16-20 of March. The food was expensive and mediocre at best. $50 for hamburger and chicken wrap sandwich w. 2 drinks...ouch! The beach was rough and the sand reminded me of dirt. They charge $25 to rent a fridge. Twice by accident. ( was credited afterwards). Was charged for parking when we didn't have a car. (was credited afterwards) Went on a wonderful horseback ride ($72\/person for 2 hours). When we got there, they asked if we were going on the 1 hour or 2 hour ride. My boyfriend and I looked @ ea. other because we were under the assumption that the 2 hr. ride (booked through the hotel) was our only option. Enjoyed the ride but later complained to Raquel\/Rachel in which she credited us 10% of the bill. She was very nice and professional. Unlike the lady at concierge w. the short hair cut. She practically ignored me when I approached her at the desk....kept her head down and was typing while I stood there for atleast a minute. Finally, another concierge assisted me (only after the rest of them were confused about the whole ordeal). I complained about her unprofessionalism to Rachel as well. She assured me that she would handle that.  Bedding was another issue. Gross.... blood and other stains on the comforter inside of the duvet. Give me a break! Spoke to Ana (head of made service). After a few weak attempts to correct the problem, I finally called her up to see for herself. Finally, everything was re-placed with fresh and clean linen; straight from the dryer.  We rented an expensive car( but managed to get a discount from my job $56 \/15% off...highly recommend trying to get a discount from AAA or wherever) on the 3rd day we wanted to go to Old San Juan, parking is free the 1st night. Next day a bill for $15 parking. Spoke to Carrol (this is a man with waxed eye-brows... how U doin?) Anyways, he had the audacity to say that he never heard of parking being free the first night and he's been there 4 a year. Needless to say, my boyfriend and I had enough with the shenanigans from this hotel and wanted to break his neck. He was very arrogant and treated us as if we were lying. (We were right and he was wrong). It was removed from the bill. Needless to say, seconds later, another guests was up and arms with him.  Went to timeshare presentation, stayed an hour, wanted to leave, received $75 but no trip. Went back the next day and the lady said she forgot... oh brother! Chose Hawaii over Florida but the hotel in Hawaii does not look good. So, we'll see!Recommendations: Antojitos, Carabali Bar n Grill - Rio Grande area (this also has the horseback riding with a stop at the Mamayes River) food was great...gotta go there! Angus steak and lobster tail $30. Old San Juan, Castillo Fort, Old Harbor Restaurant-OSJ. Rent the car by the day so that you can get the 1st day of free parking as it is expensive as well to park at the hotel.I do not recommend Wyndham Rio Mar. If you do stay check your bill and be prepared to pay $$$ especially the taxi and deal with arrogant people :(PS. The Timewarner people were chanting 7:30 in the morning. Just because you guys didn't pay for your trip, does not mean that you should wake all the other paying guests up in the morning with your noise!Adios!
