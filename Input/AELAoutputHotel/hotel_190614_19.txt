{"text":"What a fantastic hotel My wife and I have just stayed stayed three nights at the IC Amstel. What a wonderful hotel. We stayed at the hotel using Priority Club rewards Points, and ww were upgraded to an Executive Suite.Our room was fantastic - antique furnishings - our room had a wonderful sitting area including a small library- partioned off sleeping area and had separate bath, toilet and shower areas.The staff at the hotel were excellent and treated us as if we were royality.The hotel is situated on the Amstel. It is sited to the south east of the centre of the City. I would say it is about 35 minutes walk to central railway station. However there are some lovely canal walks from the hotel, and the main theatres and opera house are only a few minutes walk away. For example Cats was on at the theatre. Some of the main museums are nearby and if you dislike walking and don't want to take a taxi, one of the tram lines is very close to the hotel which we used to travel to Anne Franks House - cost 1.60 euros. There is also an underground station nearby which takes you directly to central Railway station (north) or to Amstredam arena (Home of Ajax) in the South.The hotel offers an airport collection service. The cost of this service is 101 Euros each way (75 Euros if a loyality club member)We took a taxi from the hotel to Keunkenhof Gardens - cost 75 Euros each way (make sure you agree a fixed rate).The hotel has a fantastic restaurant La Rive - yes it's expensive but we felt wour visit was worth the money - check reviews.
