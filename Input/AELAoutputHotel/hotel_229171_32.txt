{"text":"Fantastic hotel in an ideal location! I stayed at this hotel in January 2005 for a 4 night city break with my boyfriend and we couldn't have enjoyed our stay enough!The hotel is located overlooking the canel down a quiet backstreet in the centre of the city. We had a room overlooking the road on the otherside of the canal which was fine and I didn't notice any noise like other tripadvisors did.The room itself was a little bit small but the decor and furniture were all to the standard of what you would expect from a 4* hotel!Breakfast was exceptional with everything you could want from cereals, yoghurt, fruit, cooked, continental etc and there was even champagne and classical music playing in the elegant dining room while you ate!It is situated about an hours drive from the airport but the easiest thing to do is to head to the train station at the airport and head straight to the city centre and its about a 15 minute walk to the hotel or you can simply hop in a cab or on a tram and it will drop you right outside!Amsterdam is a fab city and everything is best explored on foot with the red light district, city centre and Ann Franks house all with easy walking distance. The arts quarter is about a 15\/20 minute walk away however but its a lovely stroll so we didn't mind!I thoroughly recommend the canal boat rides and Ann Franks house for things to do but I did find the Van Gogh museum a bit overpriced (but thats my opinion!)Overall this hotel is great if you want to see the sights and sounds that the city has to offer!
