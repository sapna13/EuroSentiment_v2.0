{"text":"Great hotel - absolutely useless concierge As so many of the reviews say, this really is a fantastic hotel. It is well thought out, the service is great - it is definitely on Island time but then you should be too while you are here so relax.The only thing I would complain about is the concierge service. I travel a lot and am used to being able to go to the concierge and asking my question - usually I get a wealth of informaiton including timelines, recommendations, directions etc. The concierge at the Ritz(all of them) are rather ditzy individuals from whom extracting any meaningful data is rather like pulling teeth. Then when you do get some informatoin you feel so happy that you don't realize they neglected to mention the most critical item that later comes back to screw you. In short, don't use them!Can't recommend BLT Steak highly enough - what a fantastic experience. Also liked Il Mulino though the Italian food is just a little too heavy for me and the wine list is quite a bit more expensive than the BLT menu.We did the rum tasting in the lobby lounge and the gentleman who helped us there was lovely - highly receommended if you want to learnmore about rum and taste some great ones too.From what we saw, the beach at the hotel is the best you will find on teh island, so almost don't bother going anywhere else. This is given every guide book tells you Luquillo beach is one of the nicest on the island and we visited there.Finally, DO the bioluminscent tour at Fajardo - it was EXCELLENT - especially watching those who normally don't leave their armchairs trying to canoe upsream - hilarious!
