{"text":"Be treated like royalty We have only just gotten home from our stay in Bali. After reading reviews here on trip advisor and finding out that our other two choices were fully booked, we decided the weekend before we flew out to stay at the Patra. BEAUTIFUL! We were truly treated like royalty. My husband, daughter (7) and myself booked a Deluxe suite and were upgraded when we arrived to an embassy suite (2 storeys). When we first arrived they welcomed us with a nice cold towel to wipe our faces and a cold drink. I read a few negative reviews here before going and was a little worried about the aircraft noise, but I can honestly say that I thought it was louder when I went to the green day spa and had a massage I could hear them lounder overhead as they were directly over than I could at the patra. They don't fly directly over the hotel. It's quite a bit further down the beach. We did notice mainly Taiwanese and Indonesians staying at the hotel with only a couple of Australians and a few Europeans. I'm actually glad it's this way as I hate to be embarrassed by fellow Australians who write themselves off drinking as I've seen in some hotels in Bali. We celebrated our 9th wedding anniversary and had Tina from the kids club baby sit our daughter while we went out to La Lucciola's for dinner. We got home from a gorgeous night out to have someone from the hotel knock on our door with a cake incribed happy 9th wedding anniversary and signed card from the staff. They had been waiting for us to return to the hotel to give it to us all night. They are just gorgeous staff.I'm not sure if the hotel has read the reviews from here but everything I've read I can truly say didn't happen to us. We did notice a couple of ants, but it IS Bali, and it's impossible to stop them getting in if you have food around. We had a nice platter of fruit when we arrived, and they'd covered it with plastic so we didn't have that problem I guess the other reviewer here complained about with the ants on her chocolate. No problems with ants and food for us. Our room cleaner must've realised we had our daughter staying with us after day 1 and we were treated to little folded animals with a handtowel in the bathroom when we'd return to the room. Loved the elephant! haha.Eating in the restaurants were cheap also. We had the theme nights, (Balinese and Mongolian BBQ) and I still say they're cheaper than any mean you'd get in Australia. My favourite meal of all was the fettucine misto de mare in the italian restaurant, OMG I've never had one like it. My mouth is watering just thinking about it, And the pizzas are yummy too, cooked in a woodfired oven.The lounge and sunken bar have happy hour from 5-7 every night, (don't worry, you won't miss it, they ring a bell so you can hear it if you're in the pool area) 2 for 1 drinks. We tried the japanese restaurant, which was great, but on the pricey side (again, not for Australia, more the pricey side of Bali)Most guests we spoke to have tried other hotels in Bali and are very loyal to this one. I think we're going to be another loyal guest as I couldn't fault it. Another Australian couple we spoke to even asked the italian restaurant for a special order. They were only too happy to cook them lobster thermidor. Will be back to see Dwi, Tina and Sylvia for sure.NOTE: Complaints about the different prices in taxi fares are not the fault of the hotel either. Stick with bluebird taxis. Their taxis are metered and it never cost us more than AU$2 to get to Kuta. Just ask concierge to order you a bluebird taxi, sit in the lounge and they will come let you know when it's arrived and even open the door for you. How easy is that.
