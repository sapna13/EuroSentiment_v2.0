{"text":"OK, but preferred Marco Polo My husband and I have been to Mexico City several times and always stayed at the Catedral (would still do so because we love that hotel). However, this trip we decided to venture out and try a different hotel - so we tried two based on the tripadvisor reviews. One was the Emporio Reforma and the other was Marco Polo. Though the location of both hotels was excellent, we enjoyed our stay at Marco Polo much more than Emporio. The staff was friendly, the hotel room was very large and comfortable and the location was amazing. For the price, our experience and research shows that you can't do much better than Marco Polo. We paid about $80 and the room came with breakfast (which I had read was mediocre, but I found to be very good-the breakfast which includes all you can eat and drink self-serve breakfast bar and made to order eggs, beans and chiliaquilas). From the moment we walked into the hotel, the staff was friendly, helpful and made us feel at home. Also, the business center was free with computer access and a printer and was really easy in the event you need it. Our flight was in the late evening, and the hotel staff allowed us to check out late (at 5 pm) at no extra charge and without hesitation.Our experience at Emporio was very different. There was a problem with our room reservation and we found the staff to be unfriendly and not very helpful. At first, we thought it was just the front desk staff, but we also found this to be the case at the cafe and computer center. Also, the rooms at Emporio were very small and cramped and did not include breakfast which made a big difference since we paid $95 just for the room.I am sure we will travel to Mexico City again and again and there is no doubt in my mind we will return to Marco Polo. I would have to say that if you are first time traveler to Mexico City, I would also recommend Catedral based on its location to the zocolo and historical sites. ","annotations":[]}
