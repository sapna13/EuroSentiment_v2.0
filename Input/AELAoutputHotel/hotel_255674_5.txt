{"text":"A Few Tips I stayed at this Marriot for business for one week. I would come back for both business or pleasure. Definitely a place you could come for business and bring the family as there is plenty to do and see. I can echo what others have said in that the location is unbeatable along with the stunning views. I'll skip repeating what has already said and try to give a few helpful hints.A few tips:1. Do eat at the Sydney Cafe Restaurant. It's a short 5 minute stroll. It has indoor\/outdoor seating on the roof with an breathtaking view of the harbor. The food will please and the mixed drinks are unique and well executed. The service was good but American's beware they serve at a European pace (slow). The atmosphere is excellent and not too formal but you shouldn't wear too casual clothes (no jeans and sneakers). A polo and khakis will do just fine. If you have business colleagues in town this is the perfect place to take them. If you want to try the native Rocks oysters (no much brine, a little sweet) go the Waterfront restaurant - they were better there. Pricewise the entrees are all about 35 Australian Dollars or about 25 US. 2. Try the Kangaroo! It's sort of like venison but not as gamy. The Marriot has it on the room service menu. 3. Opt for the rate that includes breakfast. The breakfast buffet is $35 AUD each if purchased at the restaurant but if you opt for the rate that includes it when you book it's only $20 per day more for two adults.4. Jet lag? Head to the spa for the Jet Lag package ladies! It includes a facial and massage. They use dermatologica products and seemed to have a good amount of experience. The spa is not luxorious by any means. Just little rooms off the gym, the prices were average but the service was excellent. 5. The gym is well equipped for a hotel. Free weights, check. Cardio machines, check. Weight machines, check. 6. The business center has a small conference room with seating for 4 around a small table. You can book it thru the front desk or if you only need it for a short time just walk in and use it. No one seemed to mind. The bar staff will bring food\/drinks in their for you if you ask. 7. Beware of the phone. You can only make credit card or collect calls. No simply dialing and seeing it show up on the bill. For whatever bizarre reason you cannot make a 1800 call even if you try to pay for it. Not such a big deal until you need to call American Airlines to reschedule a cancelled flight on a Saturday and the Australian office is shut! Had to have the hubby deal with it from the US. Also, the phone in my room did not work properly. They never did fix it. It seemed to be a line issue. People would just cut out or their was a huge amount of noise on the line.
