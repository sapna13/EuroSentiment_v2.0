{"text":"A solid buy if you get a good deal $$$ This hotel has been recently renovated, and the furnishings inside the room are very West Elm or Pottery Barn chocolate black looking. I really liked the change from the usual hotel furnishings that one would find. I stayed in a king non-smoking room on the second floor, and my bed was absolute heaven. Crowne Plaza makes sure you get a good nights sleep with comfortable beds and down comforters as well as free earplugs and eye mask. In addition, they also give you a sleep CD which you can put into the CD alarm clock radio they have next to the bed for a good nights rest. On the CD you will find several tracks of relaxation exercizes to help you get a good nights rest.One word to the wise, the HOT water in this hotel is SCALDING hot. Enough that they could be opening themselves up to a lawsuit, it's practically boiling hot temperature, so if you have kids traveling with you, be cautious of the hot water!!I did not use the pool or jacuzzi, but they are both outdoors and open 24 hours, which is a nice change from the usual closed at 10 attitude that most hotels have. The work out room, which I did use, is also open 24 hours, and has 2 treadmills, 2 bikes, and 1 eliptical machine. The cardio equipment seemed nice, but the weight equipment was limited and a bit dated. Checkin was fast and easy, I didn't have to wait long, and was given my request for a room on a lower floor.This is a mid-rise hotel, and the parking garage is DEATCHED from the hotel so you have to take the elevator down to the ground floor and then walk a few short steps into the hotel lobby. This could be an inconvenience for those traveling with pets, although I can't say what the hotel's policy is for pets, there is no easy access from parking to your hotel room, it all flows through the lobby.There is a huge light rail construction going on out in front of the hotel property. This makes access to the hotel a bit of a pain, as well as having to deal with some construction noise during the day time. For those who don't like construction, I would stay elsewhere, or call ahead and ask the hotel if the construction is complete, but I don't think it will be finished until mid-2008.In addition, this hotel is close to the airport, so you will hear planes taking off from your room. If this is a problem, stay elsewhere. I was so tired, and the bed so comfortable, i was able to fall asleep and tune out the airport noises.Aside from the construction and the airport noise, this hotel is a great buy, I got it for $52 a night on Priceline, and the little Crown Plaza touches are nice.
