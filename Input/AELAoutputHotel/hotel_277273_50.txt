{"text":"Fun taste of old Madrid Despite being known as the hotel with the prostitutes across the street, the Senator Gran Via is actually a good place for families. You enter the double doors, go past the front desk, around the corner, and you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e in a whole new world. Welcome to old Madrid; relax and enjoy it for what it is. You can still see the flash of what this hotel must have been years ago in its prime. Now it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a slightly worn, smaller version of a Hyatt Regency with glass elevators, interior courtyards and grand marble stairs. The kids are safe inside and there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ space to run around a bit with nothing to break. ROOM: They are on the small side, just barely big enough to hold our two twin beds. But we liked those beds; they were cozy and moved up and down with a button like at the hospital.BATHROOM: Our shower didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ work well and the maid accidentally broke my daughter√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ eye shadow compact, but they left us a nice note and a fruit basket to apologize--a sweet gesture. MINI-BAR: Like everyone else, we loved the free beverages, re-stocked daily. In fact, we left a note (in Spanish) requesting more of the bottle water and Coca-Cola Light and less of the beer, and we got it, for free. I left some coins for the maid in fridge when we left. BREAKFAST: A busy place with lots of families and frantic staff trying to keep up with it all. Good variety of meats, breads, juices, fruits, cereals, yogurt, egg dishes, coffee, etc. Plus notes warning you not to take any food out with you.FRONT DESK: Friendlier than most Madrid hotel staff, good English, helpful and prompt. INTERNET: To get Internet coverage, you pay 18.22 euro per 24-hour period√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√´retty expensive. HOOKERS: Think of them as the ultimate reality television. If you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a good view of the action from your balcony, go across the street to McDonald√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ and watch them from the second floor dining area through the tinted windows. Just be careful not to let your own daughters outside alone; they won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be mistaken for the working girls but there some shadier older guys hanging around who like to cat-call. OVERALL: We paid about 100 euro per night with breakfast included√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√Ö good value. If I were traveling with a family, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° stay here again; it was a clean and friendly place. Otherwise, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° stay at the new, chic Hotel de las Letras down the street again instead.
