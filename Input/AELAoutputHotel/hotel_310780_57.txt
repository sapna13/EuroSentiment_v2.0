{"text":"Good value The Europa is a pretty good hotel. We got into a deathtrap of an elevator to ascend to the second floor, where upon check-in the man behind the desk asked for our passports, then told us he'd show us our room -- while leaving the passports on his desk. We were a bit unnerved by this, so we asked if we could stay while he took our information, but he refused this and started walking towards our room anyway. We followed him, then returned to the desk, where he copied all of our information and asked me to sign a sheet in Italian. We asked what it was for, and he simply said, For terrorism. You register with the police. Then, a sarcastic sorry. Not the warmest of welcomes!As it turned out, he was a nice man, but was very set in his ways and didn't like to be questioned. He did let us hang out in the lobby for a few hours after our checkout before we took a train out of town, and he even brought us bottles of water.Anyway, the location of this hotel is superb. Five minutes to the Duomo, ten to the Uffizi and the Arno, ten to Santa Maria Novella train station.Our room was nice and spacious. The decoration is nice, very Tuscan. Our window opened up to a quiet courtyard. Unfortunately, our TV was so old it didn't turn on, the windows had no screens (so we suffered through mosquito infestations), and the bed was not very comfortable.The bathroom was okay -- the shower inexplicably sprayed out into the center of the bathroom and blew through the non-waterproof shower curtain. This resulted in a huge puddle in the middle of the bathroom, and the shower could not be adjusted. The bathroom was, however, a good size.Breakfast was okay -- croissants, bread, yogurt, and fruit -- and was included. The meal is served in a charming room with a reproduction of Boticcelli's The Birth of Venus on the wall.Bottom line: the Europa is a value stay with good service. If you only want to spend 100-150 euros, consider the Europa for its location -- but don't expect the amenities to blow your mind.
