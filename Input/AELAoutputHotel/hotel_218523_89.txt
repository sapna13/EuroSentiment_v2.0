{"text":"You get what you pay for We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go to the Riu Naiboa expecting a 4 star hotel, but this place was just awful!! First of all the rooms smelled like mildew (we had to ask for a different room because the first one smelled so bad). Even when we got home and washed all our clothes we still could smell it. The rooms do not have irons or hairdryers in them√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√ºou have to borrow them from the front desk. Most of the time when we asked for one, they told us to come back in an hour because other people have already borrowed them!The balcony door did not lock because it looks like it was broken into a few times from the outside√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√≠ike it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hard enough sleeping at night on the rock hard bed with rock hard pillows!! The phone and TV worked when they wanted to, and the power in the hotel went out many times during the week!! I recommend taking the stairs in the hotel rather than the elevator because they are ridiculously slow and hot, and if the power goes out you are in trouble.One night I had to take my girlfriend to the clinic because she got sick. They took her blood pressure and told her that she was dehydrated, and then they charged me $100 for the consultation!!! AND it took me asking three times for a glass of water before they gave her one!! (She finally got the water after I paid the fee)To top it all off, the people at the front desk ripped me off when I checked out. I specifically asked when I checked in how much it would be to make a phone call using a calling card I had brought with me. The guy told me $3 to connect and that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ it√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√\u2022ine. So why did I get a bill for $190 for the 5 phone calls I made? They told me it was because only 1-800 numbers are toll free, not 1-888 numbers!! Are these people for real?? I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ going to dispute it on my credit card, and won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to pay this, but come on now!!Bottom line is YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√≠esson learned ","annotations":[{"endOffset":720,"mention":"rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rock_candy"],"startOffset":716},{"endOffset":739,"mention":"rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rock_candy"],"startOffset":735},{"endOffset":739,"mention":"rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rock_candy"],"startOffset":735},{"endOffset":1115,"mention":"blood","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Black_pudding"],"startOffset":1110},{"endOffset":1115,"mention":"blood","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Black_pudding"],"startOffset":1110},{"endOffset":1741,"mention":"toll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_chip_cookie"],"startOffset":1737},{"endOffset":1741,"mention":"toll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_chip_cookie"],"startOffset":1737}]}
