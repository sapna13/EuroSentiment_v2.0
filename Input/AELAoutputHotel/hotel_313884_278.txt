{"text":"Luxurious Peace Booked this hotel as a last minute holiday, hence had very little time to research our options before we booked. The hotel was a class above many of the other hotels in the area (we went exploring and had a little nosey around some other pool\/reception areas). The hotel's ground are split with its older sister hotels - this makes for a nice walk in the evening when visitng some of the speciality restaurants.This hotel mainly catered for the Spanish. Most of the evening entertainments was for them, but was in fact quite small comapred to the main events that occured in the sister hotel.The rooms were very nice (split level), we had a slight musty smell when we arrived so the hotel installed a dehumidifier in our room which stayed with us for the week.The room was cleaned daily although initially this did not happen until very late in the afteroon when we were returning from the pool area. A quick word with guest relations resulted in earlier service.The food in the restaurants were very good. The all-inc choice was limited compared to some other hotels we've been to, but the quality was far superior. The speciality restaurants were slightly dissapointing, especially the ones in the other hotel. Superb fish restaurant, don't waste time with the itallian and chinese.Staff very courteus, getting served at the bars was easy and the drinks were of a high quality (fizz also available on request).Pools were clean (and constantly cleaned).Beach was the same as the rest of the area - very nice, and nice to stroll allong - shame there's no sunset visible from this side of the island.If you go with Airtours \/ MyTravel from the UK you will get a ground floor room - its what's been agreed\/contracted for with the hotel.My final thoughts on this hotel compared to the Riu's\/Iberostars (which we have prevsiously experienced) is that it is smaller, more relaxed, more luxurious, quieter, better buffets - but am not sure which I prefer. It doesn't get 5\/5 as it was lacking something - hard to say what - possible character \/ identidy - something that was strong in the Riu's for instance.
