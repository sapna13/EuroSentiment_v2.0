{"text":"good location and nice decor, some problems with service I stayed at this hotel for three nights while attending a conference. Although my employer was paying for the hotel, I just want to remark that, in my view, the rate ($400 per night for the standard room) was too high in my opinion. I would not have paid that amount if I were paying for the room.The location is great, right next to the Lafayette park behind the White House. The hotel lobby is very small, but pleasant. I used the internet a couple of times and did not have to wait.  The check-in was fast (no line at 7pm on Tuesday). I asked for a room with a view, if possible. I was given one on the 4th floor (no view), right next to the elevators and opposite the ice machine. I did not hear much noise throughout my stay, but I spent a rather small amount of time in the room.The gym is in the basement and is adequate. There are towels, fruit, and water there. The machines have TVs.The room did not have a bath robe and the phone was broken, but both problems were quickly fixed. Other than that, the room was fine. The bed was very comfortable, the comforter and the pillows --heavenly. The bathroom was not large, but had a glass shower and a separate shallowish tub, a nice marble vanity area and a mirror with a handy light around it.The room did not have a coffee\/tea maker (which I typically like to have), but had a mini bar, a safe, and an ironing board.I did not dine at the hotel, but ordered room service several times. As everywhere, it was fairly expensive, with all sort of charges added on. Breakfast typically ran me over $30 for an egg-white frittata ($18), served with tea\/coffee and juice, and fruit ($6). Two of the three days, it was served on time (important, because I had to run to my meetings). On the third day, it was served late and was not what I ordered at all. By the time they fixed it (took a couple of tries), I barely had time to eat it. Do not order crepes here. I thought they would be good, because this is a French hotel, but I was wrong. They were very small and not at all what I expected.I ordered dinner once ($53 for a plate of risotto, priced at $18, shrimp cocktail $15 and tea), and late night snacks (tea, water, and fruit, $30 or so).I would probably stay here again if my firm is paying, but would look elsewhere for my own money.
