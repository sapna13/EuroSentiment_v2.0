{"text":"For the most part a good deal for the money spent. Location of resort was not in the hotel zone therefore unless you booked an excursion or took a taxi very little shopping (alot of paintings) was found except on beach on either side of resort and some drugstore items at entrance.. A sore spot with me was at the drugstore, personal items were 4 TIMES the amount you'd pay at home. (Guess they knew they had you over a barrel if you needed it or forgot something ) Both beach shopping areas had pretty much the same trinket stuff. Sunday and Friday a couple merchants will set up in hotel. Mostly jewelry,  cigas. Don''t wait and try to pick sourvigners up at the airport. Very expensive and extremly limited supply. Local rum was very expensive. I remember it use to be $8:00 or so at Brugal Rum tour. Here it was $20.00.Rooms were satisfactory. Very nice balcony, clean except beds are very very firm! We padded ours with the other set of linens!Even though the guest directory said no saving of chairs or huts down by the pool and beach that was done on a continueing basis. Had to get there to reserve your chair with a towel if you have a requested location or need shade from a hut, by at least 7:15 am or you will not get anything. Keep your towel overnight, towel exchange does not open until 10:00 am. Pool was the largest one I ever saw and had 2 swim up bars. Drinks were pretty good with a large selection. Actually had pretty much booze in them as compared to others! Many topless women on beach as well as pool (another rule that was broken. Was only suppose to be on beach) If I would of had children along I would of been uncomfortabe with that. Casino and theatre was older and could use some updating. Food was satisfactory. Large selection, specialty restaurants had it's ups and downs. Did not care for Seafood one but Italian was very good! Internet connection was good. Very fast, $10.00 for a hour, right in the lobby . Beach was awesome. Went on forever. Rained a couple days but only for a few minites then sun came out and weather was great again. Everyday in mid 80's.
