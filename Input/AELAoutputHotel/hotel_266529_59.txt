{"text":"Great for shopping; dislike guest policy We stayed at the Europa hotel for six nights between 22 February through 3 March. The hotel is located right on the popular Puerta Del Sol and just across from Cortes, a large department store with a supermarket at the basement. So getting food\/ drinks is not a problem, particularly since there is also a coffee shop next to the hotel.It is worth mentioning that if you're unfamiliar with the area, you might have a little bit of trouble finding the hotel after being dropped off by the cab driver (who's most likely not able to converse in English) for a short walk. Please note that the taxi can NOT stop right in front of the hotel so a little bit of walking is required. I would suggest that you bring a suitcase that have wheels. If you like shopping and crowd watching, this is definitely the hotel for you - it is also a short walk to Grand Via, where there are plenty of shops like Zara as well as some theaters. However, if you require peace and quiet, this is not the hotel for you, as it could get pretty loud particularly on Friday and Saturday nights with the noise continuing till dawn. I was disturbed a little and we stayed on the third floor.We also didn't like the fact that we were charged 2 euros per day for the use of the safe deposit box.But the biggest minus for this hotel is its guest policy, which does not allow for any guest at any time to come up to your room. In fact, we had to leave our room keys at the reception each and every time we leave the hotel.We had a couple of friends who were staying in another hotel at Grand Via come over as they wanted to compare the rooms. After explaining the situation, our friends were allowed up to see our room, but after just a couple minutes, the front desk rang and demanded that our guests leave the room.Overall it was an ok experience, and we would stay there again simplybecause of the convenient location and the reasonable price.
