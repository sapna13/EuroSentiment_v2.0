{"text":"Good but not great We stayed in deluxe room at Nusa Dua Beach for 11 Nights 8-19 Aug. It is a nice hotel (and probably nicer than most in Nusa Dua), but I don't believe very good value. Prices for spa, meals and drinks etc are expensive. Even snorkles etc have to be hired too.The hotel felt crowded and there was an early morning race to try and get a sunbed (many failed as not enough).It is a shame that you DO NOT get extra little touches like: flowers in room, chocolate on pillow or fruit by pool (unless you pay of course). I believe Palace Club do get extra flourishes, but why not everyone? It surely would cost little, but in general think they would rather make the extra money from their guests.Our room was slightly on the small side and noisy.Pools were fine (although busy) and beach ok. Gardens good.There are many places to eat within walking distance for 1\/4 price of hotel. Kendi Kuning 600m left up the beach past Club Med is good.Bali Romantic (081338507291) do a good day long private tour incl lunch for only $25 US per person.Don't pay more than $15 US for taxi to Hotel from Airport.Weather was good, hot and sunny during the day with welcome breeze and occassional rain at night.Consider staying a few days at Kajane Mua Villas in UBUD which excellent. You get your own Villa with small pool in lush garden setting with extras you don't get at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for $200 per night and much much better value spa ($25 US for 2 hours), food and drinks etc. Only downside was wetter.
