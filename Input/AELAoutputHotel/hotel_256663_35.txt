{"text":"not that good. fairly well equipt clean room,but beds were on huge wheels and if you moved too quickly they skated across the room,we were on the 7th floor at the front overlooking the road junction,lovely view in to a block of flats to one side of us. !!..we were only here for 2 nights so it was ample for our needs which was basically a bed and shower really,3 of us shared a room so it was cheaper.there is a lovely hotel\/pub about 500 yards away that did lovely food and they were really friendly,there is a shop just across the junction but they have no prices on the produts or shelves so beware they could charge over the top if they dislike you.we walked from our hotel to the harbour bridge and opera house a distance of about 2.5 kms one way! ( we would have gone by bus if we had realised but there was lots to look at in the CBD(central business district)so it was a gentle stroll.it was a good stoll in the rain too.we probably would'nt stay here again,but it was ok at the time.we were on a stop over from nz to the uk,they have a shuttle bus to take you to the airport and it goes through chinatown which was amazing.if you like ice in your drinks ask for a room on the 9th floor cos there is an ice machine there,you can buy most things in the hotel from various vending machines but beware they don't give change,the reception desk has very helpful staff and they can direct you and give you a map to wherever you want to go.there is a lift to all floors,although one night we ran down the fire escape stairs cos the lifts were very busy,(you can use these stairs if you don't like lifts)none of the windows open in the rooms so they all have air-conditioning,which is fairly quiet,room has a tv and direct dial phone,overall not too bad,bus stops to more or less anywhere in sydney are about 200 metres from front of hotel.bondi is about a 25 minute bus journey which was well worth the effort.in fact bondi made the whole trip worthwhile!!
