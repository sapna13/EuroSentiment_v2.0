{"text":"Who gets the good rooms? Traveling to San Francisco a few times a year for business, we are still trying to find the right hotel. This was our second try for Hotel Vitale, and we are not sure whether we'll give it another. We were arriving in SF from overseas, and requested a quiet room. Our flight was 8 hours late, so we arrived exhausted. At the front desk we asked if the room was quiet, and was assured that it was. Well, when we opened the door to the room, we were assalted by the bass from the bar downstairs...not even close to quiet. We called downstairs and they showed us a room in the back corner, where it was quiet, but dirty, broken closet doors. The third room we were shown was right on Mission street, and the valet assured us that it would be quite noisy in the morning. Choosing sleep, we opted for the quiet room.The next morning we asked for a better room and for $60 extra (making the room charge over $400) we were moved to a room on a higher floor, remarkably cleaner and with a great view of the Bay.Our take on this hotel is that if you pay the big dollars, the rooms are quiet and clean. If you choose a more inexpensive room, expect it to be noisy and not as clean as you would like it to be. San Francisco is very expensive, but there has to be a hotel where if you pay $300\/night, you can expect a clean room and a good nights sleep. Unfortunately, Hotel Vitale is not it.The positives for this hotel are its location and friendly staff. ","annotations":[]}
