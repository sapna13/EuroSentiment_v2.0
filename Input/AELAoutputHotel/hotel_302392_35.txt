{"text":"Definitely the Oberoi!!! We went to the Oberoi in Bali for our honeymoon and got back about 2 weeks ago. The Oberoi is cultural and traditional yet modern. The grounds are perfectly kept. Lush green gardens and set right on the beach. We had a garden lanai room which has ample room, a big, high bed and an amazing bathroom! From the sunken bath to the shower, which opens on to an enclosed open air area all made of marble. The staff are so lovely. We were privileged to have met the manager who speaks perfect English and is very knowledgeable about the island. He and the rest of the staff ensured that we were treated like absolute royalty from the minute we got there, from beside the pool to the room service. By the pool, your sunglasses are cleaned, you are given cold towels and cold water, free ice cream and little slices of pizza. Tea and cakes are put on everyday in the afternoon. It was perfect. And to add to this, the manager offered us an Oberoi transfer for a night to the neighbouring island Lombok, so that we could experience another Oberoi and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ location. (see separate review) Idyllic! The food in the restaurant was absolutely amazing but expensive. However there is an abundance of surrounding bars and restaurants, which are very cheap and have great food. We are so glad we chose the Oberoi for our honeymoon, because a little bit of royal treatment and being made to feel like you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e the only ones there is so satisfying. We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° recommend it to anyone.
