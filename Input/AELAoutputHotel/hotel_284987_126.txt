{"text":"great place, loved it!! I am presently staying at the gran melia, and I have to say that we all were hesitant about coming here with all of the bad reviews that we were reading on the web site, but I can honestly say 110 percent, that this place is BEAUTIFUL, we have had nothing but nice people wanting to help us and get us drinks, and take care of us. We arrived on Thursday April 17 at about 2 am and the pull out couch in our room did not have sheets or blankets for my kids to sleep on, we called the front desk and within 5 minutes there were two ladies at my door with the sheets and blankets, and I told them that I would fix the bed, and they said no that they would do it, then they went and got ice for us, all of this at now about 2:30 am. I can't say enough about Rafil at the wet pool bar, he is the absolute BEST!!!!! We were playing volleyball down the beach a ways, and he came down with a tray of ice water for all of us, we had about 8 kids with us, and nobody told him to do this, he took it upon himself to do this. Manuel is another one that is great in the Royal Service lounge , he will get you whatever you want whenever. The only thing that I could agree with regards to some of what other people wrote was the restaurant service, we went to cafe solei and it took about 1 hour to get our salads, and the whole process took about 2 and half hours, and we had 9 kids with us. But you can eat up to 6 pm at the pool bar and that was great, you just tell Rafil what you want and he brings it right over to you, and your lounge chair. We are traveling with a group of 18 people and we all feel the same exact way. We all give it two thumbs up and like I said earlier we all can't say enough about Rafil at the pool and Manuel at the royal service lounge. Don't believe what other people are writing, it is them not this place, and we are from New York, we know good service.
