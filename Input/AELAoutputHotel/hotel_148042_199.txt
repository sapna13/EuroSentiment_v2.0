{"text":"Excellent Stay at the Ritz √à√\u2020\u2022?highly Recommend. We stayed at the Ritz for 5 nights in Feb. This was our first time staying at the Ritz at PR. We have traveled all over the world and have stayed in Ritz√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, 4 seasons ,etc..so in this review I will try to compare this to similar hotels in this category. Overall, this was an excellent resort and made our stay very relaxing. We went withour 15 month old and the staff couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have been any nicer. Here is the skinny:Room √à√\u2020\u2022?we paid for a Club Level room with a Balcony, Ocean View. The room they gave us was a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√®r suite√à√\u2020\u2022? It looked to be about 550 sq feet..vs 400 for the regular rooms. As other posters have mentioned, the regular rooms are on the small side. The room was extremely clean, maid service was excellent. Bathroom was very nice and ultra clean. Everything looked new. Very nice plasma TV in the room, plenty of drawer space, closet space, etc. one huge negative with the room, the crib they gave us was not good. It did not seem safe and it was dirty, scratched up, etc. It was the second crib they had rolled into the room, so there wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ much we could do. Next time we go, I would bring a pack n play. Didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ use the balcony too much, as there were no lights for night-time use.Club Level √à√\u2020\u2022?We ate breakfast and lunch everyday there. it was excellent. The staff goes out of their way to make sure you are happy. It was extremely easy to manage since we brought our 15 month old. They also had high chairs. At night, they have deserts, wine, beer, mixed drinks, etc. coffee and tea all day long. they have 4 food presentations\/day. Well worth the extra money, especially if you are bringing kid(s). They have concierge services and can check you out of your room. We used them for reservations. Staff went out of their way to provide food for child (even saved some bread and cream cheese from breakfast for us each day for our son). The club level made our stay! It was so convenient to just roll in have all the food right there, eat a light lunch and go back to our own thing. Much quicker than sitting at a restaurant, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ sure.Pool √à√\u2020\u2022?is extremely nice..perfect size..no problems getting chairs, with lots of shaded areas. Servers don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ start until noon, it would have been nice if they started earlier. Most people are down at the pool between 10-11am. The pool was not heated..and surprisingly enough, the water was chilly! Tip to management, heat the pool! The hotel has a small shop near the pool with any outdoor necessities, like sunscreen, bucket and pails for children, etc. it did rain off and on a couple days of our trip. Ocean √à√\u2020\u2022?excellent. Very nice strip of beach..again, plenty of chairs and lots of shaded areas. Water was warmer than the pool. The beach right in front of the hotel is private, but keep in mind to each side of the hotel, the beach is public. Keep in mind for walks on beach.Food √à√\u2020\u2022?we ate at Mares (hotel restaurant)√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√\u2022ood was good. BLT Steak - very good..just like any other steakhouse, staff was eager to please. Il Mulino √à√\u2020\u2022?excellent. Highly recommend. Again, service at all 3 restaurants were excellent..very friendly. Room Service √à√\u2020\u2022?we ate twice..food was OK and very expensive. Spa√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√™n the small side, but luxurious and treatments were very good, relaxing, on time, professional. Locker room, showers were clean and stocked. 20% gratuity is added to all services, which you can adjust when you check out of the spa. I added on gratuity in each case. Very pleased with therapists. However, the quiet room was NOT quiet as it over looks the lobby of the spa.Casino √à√\u2020\u2022?larger than I expected..very nice. I was impressed. It was crowded at night..lots of locals play there..and it gets smoky!Noise Levels √à√\u2020\u2022?There is SLIGHTTTT noise in your room. And you hear a little plane noise in the pool\/beach area. Coming from the NYC area, the noise didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother us. The planes take off AWAY from the hotel and do not fly right over the hotel. One night during our stay there was a wedding in the courtyard, and we heard noise\/band music from that. Otherwise, a very quiet hotel stay. We did not hear any noise between rooms. Felt like we were in our own private place.Overall, we had an excellent time and would highly recommend. Easy flight to get to PR, no passport needed and 5 mins from Airport. Staff was top notch.
