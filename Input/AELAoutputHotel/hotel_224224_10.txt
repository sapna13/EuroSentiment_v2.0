{"text":"Excellent Service Excellent service from the moment my wife and I arrived. The entire staff was very attentive and accommodating. I booked through American Express Platinum Travel and was able to obtain upgrade upon request while checking in. The room was true Ritz Carlton decor. Marble bath with a separate water closet. Original room was shower only with a view of 6th Avenue.Traded back down for a separate shower and tub. Concierge was absolutely great. Abraham gave great suggestions for places to eat and party. He was able to get my wife and I on the list to get in a club called Room Service. He suggested Scalinatella and Remi for dinner (both Italian). Morimoto's on 10th Ave is definitely a must do if you like sushi and Seafood. Also if you like fish and chips A Salt and Battery in Greenwich Village is necessary. They were featured on Bobby Flay's Throwdown. He lost (so what does that tell you). True Brits - past the accents. This hotel is very convient to the subway and directly across the street from Central Park. Fifth Avenue is one block away - most of the shopping stores are within a four block radius. My wife had spa services at La Prairie and absolutely loved it. Her technician was Jaimie (guy). He was highly recommended by the Ritz. She had the 30 min. massage and the Luxe Moisture Indulgence and she raved about it. She said it was the best spa treatment she had ever had and my wife is very well traveled and has had numerous treatments here and abroad. The BLT restaurant was ok. It is very overpriced for what they serve. Having routine breakfasts and brunches at the Ritz Carlton in Buckhead (Atlanta) my expectations were high for this restaurant based on the location and reviews. It didn't overshadow the experience and service from the Ritz. If you are looking for consistency in wonderful service and attentiveness then you won't be disappointed.
