{"text":"Eh, not really for tourists OK,1. Hotel is not near anything really. I am not sure why on the map and in reviews and on the website it says it's close to the musuems. I mean its not FAR, but it's not across the street either.2. Since trains shut off at midnight, and you're not going to walk here from the main attractions\/ nightlife, you are forced to take a cab. The cabbies are actually quite scary. One of them was so sexually offensive to us (to put it incredibly mildly) that we made him pull over and got out asap, after he grabbed 20 euros out of our hands of course, and I left my bag in the cab with 500$ worth of stuff (glasses, etc.).3. These same sketchy cabbies will drive you around Amsterdam for a while running up the meter because they are so desperate for money. In the case of the very scary situation above, we probably would've at taken the cab to the hotel IF he hadn't been driving us in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION. I mean honestly, I felt we were going to some warehouse to have our kidneys removed. It was terrifying (once again, putting it mildly).4. The restaurant, um, sucked. I'm from Manhattan and after reading the reviews expected something exceptional. The creme brulee was disgusting. The appetizer of venicen and cod was dilicious. the entree of sea bass was bland. For 40 euro, go someplace else, like THE GARAGE or BARK, both of which were booked all night when we tried to walk in off the street. These places are right near the hotel and open till midnight. The hotel told us everyplace closes at 10 except Bark. They should've told us about the GARAGE also (both places were really bustling and fancy) and made us a reservation or something but they didn't. Oh well.5. The exterior or the hotel will not impress you. DO NOT expect a five star experience. Like the review below, maybe 3 stars.Overall, if you're a tourist, stay someplase else. You want to be able to pop into the hotel mid-day to freshen up, etc. ","annotations":[]}
