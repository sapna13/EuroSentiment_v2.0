{"text":"Good value for money My friend and I stayed at this hotel over Easter in 2008. We are both in our mid 20s and booked the hotel through a travel agent. We were really pleased with the hotel.Location:Very well located, off a side street, close to La Rambla. I would recommend organising a pre-arranged airport transfer however, as our taxi-driver from the airport dropped us some distance from the hotel and we had to walk around to find it.Hotel:Generally well run, clean and organised with a 24 hour check in desk. The service level is good overall. The receptionists all speak English and are friendly. They don't go out of their way to give advice on restaurants etc, but there are maps and brochures available.Breakfasts:Nice hot and cold breakfasts available at the ground floor restaurant. The restaurant itself is basic but it is clean with a good selection of buffet-style food (eggs, bacon, toast, cereals, pastries, fruit).Rooms:Our room was a standard double room on the 3rd floor with 2 single beds and a bathroom. The room was pleasant and modern, and had some atmosphere too which was nice. There was a good sized wardrobe, a safe, and also a set of drawers. We had a TV but no fridge\/minibar. However, there are a lot of small corner-stores nearby so we bought some water and snacks for the room easily. The bathroom had a bath and shower, with one towel each. The rooms have daily house-keeping service and are very clean. Our room opened onto a small communal patio which was nice. There is also air-con. We found the noise level from the hotel corridor to be a little bit invasive, but nothing too bad.Overall:We thought this hotel was very good value for money. I went on to recommend the hotel to a close friend who is going to Barcelona with her brother.
