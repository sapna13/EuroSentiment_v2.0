{"text":"Spacious, qulaity and location What a nice place, well located, nice appartment with some views and some surpises. My 71 year old mother was visiting from UK, so we booked into an appartment where we could have some privacy and still explore the city.The visit started badly when the exasperated reception advised that rooms were not ready at 3pm. We later discovered some families had been waiting 3+ hours for their room and this was an on-going issue throughout our stay. Apparently there is a staff shortage and so room preparation and cleaning is late, rushed and unreliable. However having got into our appartment in only 15--20 minutes we were luckier than most. One day the cleaner arrived late to service our appartment and was in and out in about 10 minutes. While we're not dirty visitors, this seemed less than even a cursory clean. If they keep this up the place will start to look grubby.The car park \/elevator arrangement is also strange and a bit complicated for the novice. The reception has to issue you with an electronic key, which activates the roller doors in the adjacent car park at the lowest levels (1  2). It also is required to activate the elevator everytime, even if people are already in the elevator, unless of course they've already selected your destination floor.I overheard one guy requesting additional electronic keys as they only had one for a family of 5, which seems a bit of an oversight from the reception on check-in, but maybe demonstrates how stressed they were with the room availabilty situation. One elevator seems to be permanently reserved for top floor permanent residents, so everyone else has to wait longer for the 3 other elevators, which at times got overcrowded.The views from the gym and pool area on the roof are exceptional, even better at night. The views from harbour facing rooms are better than the others, so request this at the time of booking. The hotel seemed to have guests made up of mostly young groups or young families who went out evenings to the local city nightlife.The appartment itself is well catered, with a full kitchen, diswasher, microwave, stove, crockery, cutlery etc.. the fridge leaked at one time and it took 12 hours for the cleaners to mop up the mess, after several calls, but that goes back to the staff shortage issue.The lounge was very spacious for 2, maybe only adequate for 5+, with tv and stereo. The bedrooms were nice, clean and spacious. Each had either an ensuite or the use of the main bathroom. A laundry is located in an alcove that can be shut off in the main bathroom, with washer and dryer.The only other issue was the location is very noisy at night, constant cars, trucks, clanging of bins, street noise and revellers. It didn't keep us awake on the 7th floor, but would not impress light sleepers and the water takes a good 5-7 minutes to come through hot first thing in the morning.The rooms were nice, clean and well appointed overall and the staff although friendly were stretched beyond the norm. There are no restaurant facilities, but plenty just locally in Darling Harbour or next door in Ibis or Novotel. The Sydney one-way system around Darling Harbour makes it quite complicated to enter or exit where you want to be, but after a day or 2 you get the hang of it.
