{"text":"Excellent accommodations! We chose this hotel based on the reviews here and couldn't have been happier with our decision. We stayed at the Porta Faenza in Mid-august with our 8 and 12 year old. The hotel has a great central location, but is still in a quiet area. We could and did walk all over the entire city with no problems and no complaints from the little ones. It was extremely convenient since we arrived and left by train as it is very close to the station. Florence was our favorite part of our Rome\/Florence\/Venice trip this summer. The staff were courteous, breakfast adequate (no hot foods, but still plenty of delicious items to fill you up) and it was a nice treat to have the free interent desk in the lobby.  There was some street noise early in the morning, but we found that in every city and not sure if that's entirely avoidable anywhere as people always seemed to be rolling carts. The prices was very reasonable and the room very spacious.  Our favorite restaurant was a few doors down - Pizzeria Navone and we went back there a few times. The prices were better then tourity restaurants and the food was delicoius and fresh.  We walked around day and night and felt very safe. We rented a car one day and took a tour of Wine Country, and Siena. It was our favorite part of the trip.  We had a wonderful stay and lots of fond memories of Porta Faenza.
