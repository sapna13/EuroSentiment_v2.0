{"text":"The good, the bad and the ugly A group of us (5 women friends) stayed a the Grand Palladium Punta Cana for 2 weeks in March. The hotel location is perfect and the beach is awesome! However, it's not very wide as some people commented, so you sometimes feel like sardines on top of one another. And a big problem is finding chairs in the morning. Luckily, we were early risers so were always able to always find a nice spot.Most employees are nice and friendly. However, the hotel management at the reception is not very helpful if you have problems. For instance, they put us in the Bavaro section at first and gave us a room far from the beach. We immediately asked to be relocated but were told we would have to come back the following day as they were overbooked. We specifically had booked with the Punta Cana section because it is closest to the beach and one of my friends has mobility problems so it made getting to the beach very difficult for her. The following day, it was again another hassle to try to get them to change us rooms, but they finally did later in the day after we complained enough (but we ended up losing 2 days over this). We also found the staff at reception to be rude with us even though we are all professional women and were very respectful with them.The hotel grounds are very beautiful and well kept and the beach is cleaned daily. We are not pool people so cannot comment on its cleanliness other than to say that it seemed nice when we walked by.The rooms were well maintained but no extras (no nice towel decoration, for instance) despite the huge tips and gifts we left daily. Also the rooms and amenities could use some updating. It was difficult to get extra towels and some of them were old and ripped at the edge, the shower leaked all over the bathroom, there was mold on the bed covers and on 2 of our pillows, etc.. The rooms had a musty smell and sometimes we did not get the room cleaned before quite late in the day, which was a nuisance since we liked taking our showers around 4 or 5 p.m.We ate at most A la carte restaurants, but the food was not much better than at the buffet restaurants, which was not that great. There was always something good to eat but not what you would expect at a 4 or 5 star hotel (I am comparing this to other hotels in Punta Cana where we have stayed in the past). The food at the Bahia Principe, for instance, was by far much better, (and so were the rooms and the service).One thing I would like to comment on is the constant sexual sollicitation by some male employees at the Palladium. I have vacationed with my friends before at other hotels, and the Palladium is the worst when it comes to sexual harassment. I noticed some comments about this below and I have to agree with Kathy1241. It was very annoying and sometimes scary as the males are very persistent, do not take no for an answer and will even try to follow you to your room, despite our saying NO to them. I personally witnessed a reception employee relentlessly follow a female tourist to her room, and they did not seem to be talking business (it was obvious there was inappropriate touching). It seemed like a disgrace for an employee to conduct himself this way. My friends and I are all married and have never encountered this problem when we travelled with our husbands nor when we travelled at other hotels by ourselves. Overall, this hotel has a lot of potential if they updated the rooms a bit and improved the service at reception and the quality of the food, as well as educated their male staff on how to treat women travellers. It is unfortunate that the sexual harassment is a deterrent for us to return to the Palladium, because the price is very good despite the few negatives I mentioned. But my friends and I agree that for now we would rather pay extra money to get better service and have peace of mind from getting sollicitated constantly (whether on the beach or just walking back to our rooms at night). I know that I would never send my daughter alone at the Palladium.If it had not been for the harassment and the bad reception manners, I would have given this hotel a 3.5 star.
