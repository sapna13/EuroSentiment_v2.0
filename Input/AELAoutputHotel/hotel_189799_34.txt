{"text":"Very Nice Hotel But Substandard Beds and Pillows This hotel has a lot going for it. There are 3 common areas in the lobby to sit and read the multi language newspapers they provide for free or have a drink at the honor bar and meet other guests. It is quite lovely. The staff from the concierge to Nishan who serves breakfast to the maids are incredibly friendly and helpful.We were here for 7 nights and had a junior suite facing the back of the hotel. There were two large French windows overlooking a quaint church steeple and a rather ugly modern building. However we chose this room for the extra room and because we wanted a quiet room. That it was√à√\u2020\u2022?.exceptionally quiet. One of the quietest hotel rooms I have ever had and I truly appreciated the quiet. We slept each night with the windows wide open and were not disturbed.The maid did show us other rooms as we spoke a great deal to her in French. By the way everyone at the hotel with the possible exception of the maids spoke exceptional English. The other rooms were much more charming than the junior suites which another reviewer pointed out although the suites had the larger bed (actually two beds pushed together with a barely perceptible crack between them).Breakfast was quite good and in relation to the cafes in the area I found it to be worth the money√à√\u2020\u2022?14 euros for a baker√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ basket, fresh orange juice, unlimited coffee and tea, yogurt and cereals and 3 euros more for bacon and eggs. They will also give you extra croissants and pastries at no additional cost. The cafes nearby charged anywhere from about 6 euros and up for one cup of coffee (extra cups at about 3 euros a piece) one croissant and a cup of juice. So if you eat a large breakfast the hotel breakfast is worth it. We only went elsewhere because we wanted a change of pace since we were at the hotel for 7 nights. Most days we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat again until dinner because we were so full.You are quite close to the Place St Augustin metro station and the metro in Paris is very comprehensive and easy to use. However we walked quite a bit√à√\u2020\u2022?.to the Arc,, Tour Eifel, Louvre, D√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√Ørsay and left bank. These are far walks but great exercise and very interesting walks. The hotel is quite close to the Opera Garnier and Gallerie Lafayette. There are also several cafes nearby most of which we found to be relatively pricey and so so. The best of the lot was caf√ã√\u2022√ñ St Augustin which was pretty good, great French fries and we thought worth the money for what you got. We also had Won Ton Soup at the Asian restaurant next door and it was very good soup. Most other meals we ate out of the area using the Zagat guide as our source which was dead on.....[--].As many other reviewers noted there is a Monoprix in the next block where you can buy water and sodas and other things at normal prices. There is no refrigerator in the room but you can get ice downstairs at no charge.The only criticism I have of this hotel is as other reviewers pointed out we found the mattress to be lumpy and not as comfortable as they should have been. The pillows were also fairly hard foam like pillows and when we asked there were no other pillows√à√\u2020\u2022?ie feather or down. I would not say the bed was incredibly uncomfortable and we did get used to it and slept very well. We are relatively young however and I am not sure others who might be older of have bad backs, etc would be as adaptable to the beds as we were. We were scheduled to only stay here for 5 nights and then check into the Grand Hotel for 2 nights but rather than repack and move hotels we cancelled the Grand and stayed at Lavoisier for an additional 2 nights so obviously the beds were livable. However it would have been nice to look forward to a very comfy bed and pillows to sink into at night.I would most likely stay at this hotel again if I want to be in the 8th Androissment. After checking things out and walking around I think quiet parts of the 7th might be very appealing as well. Overall this is a very nice hotel for the money with a very friendly and helpful staff and perhaps they will improve on the bed situation in the future.
