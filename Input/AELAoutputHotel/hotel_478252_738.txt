{"text":"Huge Resort- but veryyy well kept We just got back from the Bahia!. Our weather was so so which was a disspointment. We had sun and rain almost every dayFirst and foremost. This hotel is enormous!!I There are many villas that you have to take a trolley to get to. WE upgraded to golden which I highly recomment for a few extra $. BY being a golden member, we were closest to the beach, had our beach towels replaced every day by the staff, two Bottles of water!! and our own reception area to make reservations, checkout, etc. If you speak english, please brush up on your spanish because the staff speak littler english. We especially had a problem when asking quesitons on how to use our safe, and transportation to the airport Our room was umbelievable! Very spacious( golden room) jacuzzi, shower, big vanity. We loved our room! FOOD- The food was decent, buffets were geared towards european but being from america, we were able to make due. The breakfast was great, lunch everything is the same no matter where you ate. That was a negative. You couldnt go anywhere diffrent for lunch. I am not a fan of eating hot food when I am in the sun all day so I felt there wasnt enough variety .We did ala carte dinners all week. The restaurants were very good! We ate at four places: Japanese, Steak, Italian, and Mexican. Mexican was our favorite! The Italian was good too!Drinks- As stated in another review, The drinks were extremely watered down. You have to tell the bartenders more alchohal. The Mexican restaurant had the best margaritas !BEACH- excellentBeach pool- very good there are lots of pools. we stayed at the one closest to the beach!We didnt have a problem finding chairsNightlife- There are theme shows everything. This huge hotel has its own village of shops during the day and entertainment late at night. The casino is not worth visiting and the disco was a great time.The only negative is, it opens at midnight and closes at 2. The disco has its own dancers to dance with guests. We felt like were at the resort in the movie dirty dancing!! Positives- rooms, a la carte dinners, pool, beach, breakfast buffetnegatives- way too big, confusing, we didnt know there were two lobbies until day two of our vacation- the lobbies are identical mirror images of eachother, lunch buffet ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2013,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":2009},{"endOffset":2013,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":2009}]}
