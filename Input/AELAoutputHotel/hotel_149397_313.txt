{"text":"Re-book Now Four restaurants burned down the week of 3\/19 - and we were not informed until we got there. As a result, we were given the option to eat at two other facilities (Punta Cana Princess and Caribe Club Princess) via a golf cart shuttle. It was inconvenient, to say the least. However, you did have extra options of restaurants that otherwise would not have been available.The building that housed the four restaurants that burned down is between the pool and the beach. As a result, pool-goers suffered from incessant hammer-banging all day long, as well as flying bits of ash to mix in with suntan lotion. Beach-goers were only burdened by the hammering. Also, the number of restrooms located at the building were reduced by half.The food was mediocre. Side dishes at restaurants were routinely cold (vegetables, potatoes). Buffet food was generally the wrong temperature: eggs, pancakes, and potatoes were cold, while cheeses and sauces were hot and melted. Stick with salads, fruits and meats, as well as freshly made-to-order options like omelets and pasta.Service was better. Wait staff and bartenders were friendly. Good luck getting a cocktail -- you go to them, they don't go to you, unfortunately. Oh, speaking of cocktails, don't go here expecting top shelf. The premium drinks that cost extra were Absolut, Smirnoff and Budweiser. The included drinks were all D.R. national brands. Stick with fruity, frozen drinks or the one draft beer offered. And don't order a mojito -- it has no mint leaves; just mint liquor. Caipirina was a nice option (white rum, lime juice and sugar).Hotel was clean, trains run regularly throughout, gardens were gorgeous. Overall, a nice setting and beautiful beach.
