{"text":"Phenomenally good experience Cannot praise the Langham Place highly enough. Hotel staff extremely polite, welcoming and efficient. I'd booked a car to collect me at the airport - the hotel has a desk in arrivals, and there I was met with smiles and presented with a soft drink and a Sony PSP playing an informative video about the hotel, which I watched in a very nice Mercedes during the half-hour transfer to the city. We upgraded our room on arrival to a Club room - this was located on the 35th floor with views out over Kowloon and the harbour. The upgrade also gave us access to the Club L lounge on the 36th floor, which more than offset any extra costs associated with the upgrade as it served light breakfasts and snacks throughout the day, as well as complimentary drinks, tea and coffee. Club L also has free internet access and its own concierge\/receptionist. Room was lovely - a tad smaller than I'd expected but with top-quality features. Bathroom lovely with a big shower and a deep bath which was very welcome after long days spent sightseeing. Nice toiletries, and stuff like combs, shaving kits, toothbrushes etc available. Room had an iron and ironing board as well as a little laundry basket. Didn't need to get any laundry done so can't comment on the prices. Bed was extremely comfortable and great selection of pillows available, including hypoallergenic. An iPod dock with speakers was provided, as was a DVD player. Flat screen TV was impressive and channel choice very good, but took some time to respond to remote control! Phone system very swanky but watch out for very high costs when calling internationally. We felt safe in Mongkok although there are a few back streets that might be a little dodgy after dark if female and walking alone. Hotel is beside a huge shopping centre which has a supermarket in the basement and a 7-11 on the ground floor. It's also very close to some of the night markets - the hotel operates a free guided tour every evening at 6pm which lets you get your bearings as regards local shopping. Would recommend the Temple Street night market which is a little way from the hotel but well worth seeing. For electronics go to any branch of Fortress - they are excellent.Getting to\/around Hong Kong from the hotel was simple - there's an MTR (metro) station in the basement of the adjacent shopping centre and HK Central is just a few stops south. Buy an Octopus transport card in any MTR station for 150 dollars (about 14 euro) and it'll last you several days\/trips and can be topped up with cash. Tip - there's another Langham hotel in Kowloon so do make sure to bring the hotel address with you in both English and Chinese if you're planning on taking taxis as sometimes the drivers get them mixed up. I had need of a dentist on the third day of my stay and the assistant manager personally lined up an appointment for me - this was scheduled for just 90 mins after my having phoned reception for help. (Dentist in question was excellent and very reasonably priced). Finally, hotel spa was absolutely wonderful. It's on the top two floors of the hotel and there's a lovely outdoor heated pool with a small bar, as well as a very well-appointed gym. I booked a flight recovery massage for the night I arrived and it was great; also had a facial done later in the week. All in all, super service and a very relaxing stay at the Langham Place. Would definitely stay there again.
