{"text":"Ideal Hotel I stayed at the Kimberley Hotel for 6 nights. I took the option of booking the airport to hotel bus which dropped me off right infront of the hotel. Porters took my bag to my room, while I checked in at reception. The staff were friendly and spoke English very well. I was on the 19th floor which was very quiet and eaily accessible by the hotel elevator. My room had a double bed, tv, shower\/bath, fridge and coffee making facilities. I'm surprised at previous reviews stating that the rooms were quite small, as although I was the only one staying in the room I found it to be quite spacious. The tv has a number of channels including many english channels. The hotel is ideally located to access the MTR, about a 5 min walk. The harbour can be reached in about 15 mins. As a young, single female traveller I found the neighbourhood to be very safe even when coming home late at night. The only downside are the Indian men along the street who hassle you by wanting you to go to their tailor. Best thing to do was to ignore them or simply say no. The price of catching the train from the nearest station from the hotel to the airport was $90HK, however for convenience I took the bus from outside the hotel for $100HK and I was there in just under an hour. Overall I would definately recommend the hotel and will stay there again. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":428,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":422}]}
