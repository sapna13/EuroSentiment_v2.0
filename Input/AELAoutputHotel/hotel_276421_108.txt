{"text":"Good Value for the money This Hotel is a good value for your dollar. The rooms are a little outdated but if you ask for a change they are very accommodating. The resort itself it Huge and has a vary nice beach and very nice pools. Plenty of places to eat and plenty of bars with great drinks. The resort is lively great animation team, entertainment everywhere and lively music. The nice touch is the bar in the villas section with Jacuzzi's around it for a nice relaxing afternoon. Surprisingly the Japanese restaurant was my favorite it was amazing they were really on point as far as Japanese food and decor I was really pleasantly suprised. Great service all around, and for the people complaining about Spanish speaking staff HELLO you are in a Spanish speaking country next time go to FLORIDA. As far as excursions go I will defiantly recommend cave fun it is an extreme sport excursion and defiantly not for kids or elderly. It is hard to find because only a few representatives offer it but it is defiantly worth going through the trouble of finding it. you drive about 2.5 to 3 hours but it is worth every minute of the drive upon arrival you are given breakfast fruit coffee and fresh juice and are geared up and introduced to the horses which take you on a 30 minute ride through the national park towards the cave. from that point on you hike through the national park for about 45 Dominican minute and you reach the cave. When you do reach the cave the only entrance point is a block hole that's about 60 feet deep and you have to be dropped on a line and little by little escort your self down in total darkness just with the little light on your helmet but the view is amazing. Then you get to explore the cave and it is Huge with beautiful lime stone droppings and beautiful under water streams that you get to swim through and at one point even dive and swim under the tunnel it is total amazing. When you finish exploring and hicking through the cave (about 2 hours) your horses are waiting to take you back to the ranch where you have an amazing Dominican lunch and a cold beer or soda. The excursion is the best I have ever done and I would recommend it to anyone the guides on it are wonderful and full of information. I will definatly be going back to visit Dominican Republick because it is a beautfiull country full of wonderfull culture and people.
