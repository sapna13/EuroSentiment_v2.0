{"text":"NO! NO! NO! I really wished I had read these reviews BEFORE I booked with the clemens hotel!Like previous reviewers have said it looks at least on its website like a great place to stay - not cheap - but centrally located and friendly, looks can be deceiving!The rooms here are incredably small. OK we booked in a budget room (this basically meant shared bathroom), but got outsize coffin. And the room wasnt even cheap, I dont think 75 euro is good value and we have travelled all over europe.The shared shower and toilet are also VERY small, sitting on the toilet I struggled to close the door as my knees were in the way. The shower room you step straight in to the shower basin from the corridor so have to dress and undress stood in the shower.The staff to be fair WERE (see later) nice and friendly and spoke english and offered directions. The breakfast (had to pay more!) was a bit lacking and could get a lot more quantity and quality nearby.Hotel was very central, 5 mins from dam square and near tourist attractions such as cathedral and anne frank house and pretty canals.All would of been fine but for second to last night - THEFT! we returned to room and found things missing. Nothing of dramatic value but stuff that could of easily not have been missed or you would think you had lost it. But I knew that things were in certain places when I left the room on the morning and they were not there on the evening.We informed the management who in time became very unfriendly and basically accused us of lying. I am not a lier, I am a registered nurse, I am an angel! The cleaner (obviously main suspect) gave me evil looks. We made a police report and eventually they refunded cost of stolen items but didnt admit anything and held to the idea that we had lost things. Not that easy to lose things in a room about 8 foot by 6 foot! Basically DO NOT stay there, you will not find cheap accommodation in amsterdam, its a place you need to spend more and youll enjoy it, its a beautiful place.
