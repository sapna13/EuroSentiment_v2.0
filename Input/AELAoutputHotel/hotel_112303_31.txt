{"text":"Okay hotel with Great location, will choose different hotel next time We stayed at the Diva from March 24-28, 2008. Upon arrival, I can see how this hotel would be easy for cab drivers or anyone to miss, as there is not a big sign at all. Check in went great, David, the front desk clerk was very nice and even offered us a hopon\/hopoff tour of the city. We passed b\/c I had already made arrangements for a city tour the next day. Our room was very small and had a strange almost metallic odor so we switched to a slightly bigger room that had a desk. We could still smell the odor a little but not as strong. I will say the bed was extremely comfy with nice down pillows and soft sheets.The pictures on the website definitely make the place look better. We also found that the computers in the business center and on the floors were extremely slow if they were working at all, which did not please my husband at all. The drink machine also took our money on 2 seperate occasions. The coffee in the morning on the 6th floor was delicious, but it would have been great to have a continental breakfast like the folks in the larger rooms on the diva 7th floor. The rooms are very, very minimalistic.Our room was facing Geary street, which made for a lot of noise every night, including the garbage trucks that came through at 5:30 or so. The location right near the trolley car and Union Square was hard to beat. It was an easy walk to the financial district, China town, and even the Ferry building. All in all, the hotel was just ok, the service was really good, but I will probably choose a different one next time I go to the City that has a little more ambiance and amenities.
