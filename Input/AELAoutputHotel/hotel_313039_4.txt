{"text":"If you like Minimalism! In some areas this hotel takes minimalism a little too far - a complete lack of drawer storage space in the bedroom and no character to the bedrooms - white blank walls with no pictures or adornments. There is also a shortage of plug sockets and quite what the socket 5 foot up in the middle of a blank wall is for we could not work out!The rooms themselves are clean and very functional although if you take a triple room and have a child with you (as we did) be prepared to fall over yourselves. We were spending a few days in Barcelona after a cruise and there was more storage and hanging space in our smaller cabin on the boat that there was in this hotel room.On the pictures the bathrooms looked fabulous - however what looks like marble is actually plastic tiles and some of the fittings are cheap and falling apart. The hot water regulator in our room didn't work properly and the shower only varied between hot and boiling - and changed of its own accord!!The hotel is however clean and pleasant and the staff friendly and helpful. The restaurant was good (the menu was a little limited) and reasonably priced.In positional terms its a little too far form Catalunya Square and Le Rambles - its an OK walk in the morning when you are fresh and its not too hot - but after a tiring day sightseeing its seems a long way back to the hotel. A bit off the beaten track and not in the most solubrious surroundings - not really positioned where we would expect a 4 star hotel to be.I would not rank this as a four star hotel (more like 3 and a half - we were never offered any help to get cases to and from our room and had to put them into and get them out of the storage cupboard ourselves). Really more a business man's hotel than a family hotel - you will be relatively comfortable here and we have stayed in far worse!
