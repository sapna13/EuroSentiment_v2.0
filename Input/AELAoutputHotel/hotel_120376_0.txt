{"text":"No Empathy I was talking to a friend who is planing to visit the Miami area and I was telling her about my experience and she suggested this site to share my story. My husband and I went to visit our son and his wife they just had a new baby, my first grand child. We planned to stay for a month. We booked the Fortune House because it was the most convenient. On one of our earlier visits we looked at the Hotel and thought the lobby was very nice and noticed that there is a 24 hour security desk. We thought the rooms would be just as lovely.We had the most rotten time staying in the unit they gave us. The view was good but the room was so awful and smells as if it hadn't been cleaned for months. There were no towels in the bathroom. The bed was not made there were no sheets or blankets on it. The pillows had no pillow cases on them. I called the desk for bed linens and towels and was told I had to come to the desk for them. The floors needed vacuuming, the washer\/dryer did not work. The washer had standing water in it when we checked in. There were loose wires hanging from the bedroom, bathroom and living room ceilings. There were no TV remote control and they said they didn't have any to give me till the next day. By the way, this is not a cheap hotel. It is located in a very nice part of Miami.I asked for another room and they told me they did not have any more rooms. So we had to stay in that awful room. In eight days I checked out. At check-out I expressed my experience but there were no apologies or compensations, basically, just an I don't care attitude. I am not saying the entire Hotel is awful but the room I had was truly awful and the staff did not seem to care. The manager and staff showed no empathy.
