{"text":"More than good but not excellent Stayed 5 nights at Imperial Hotel Tokyo for my business trip in Feb and have some comments as follow :Location : excellent location if you work around Tokyo and Ginza Station. But it is not convenient going to shopping and leisure places in Tokyo downtown, ie, Shinjuku and Roppogi.Reception : Most of them can speak excellent English upon check-in. They were fast and efficient but without any warm greeting. Ladies at Guest Relations are supreme - could answer me every single questions. If they were not sure, they checked with the collegues or searched at the internet to find it out. And they helped me book an excellent Japanese restaurant with my boss in the evening. Conceige : I needed to be patient with them as some of them cannot speak English well. The day I left was the day of Tokyo Marathon, most of the roads around the hotel were blocked for the Campaign. I was told I needed to take Limo bus at the temperory bus stop at the back entrance upon check-out. When I asked to get back my lugguges after going back from lunch, the bell boy brought them to the front entrance but he could not explain it to me very well so I needed to ask couple staffs to find out the campaign was finished and every arrangement was back to normal. Room : Our rooms are located at the top floor of New Wing. We thought we were upgraded to the better room category. Unfortuately, they are same quality as the rooms at the other floors. The bell boy told us we would be upgraded if we becomes members of the hotel. Room is spacious and clean but with 80's deco. I think it matches with the overall deco of the hotel. Bedding is a concern - mattress and pillow are too soft to me. They do not provide duvet during winter (I have requested about it) and it's polyester\/cotton heavy qulit with the small cotton flat sheet underneath which made me uncomfortable and needed to adjust it all over the night to avoid any contact with the quilt. Restaurant : average quality but expensive, cheese platter (with 3 half finger size cheese and it's not tasty) at about 1800 yen plus tax ; about 1500 yen plus tax of a glass of house wine. Fortuately, I got a 20% off coupon for the meal or beverage during check-in. Tips : I found aroung 40-50 restaurants and bars at the road just in front of the hotel. Most of them closed late and food is reasonable and not expensive relatively.
