{"text":"European 4 star I booked my travel through the American Express travel. First mistake!! I was intially booked for the Bernini Hotel. One day beforeI was scheduled to leave, my hotel was swtiched to the Plaza Lucchesi. This is an old restored 18th century hotel. The rooms are adequate, however a superior room is two twin beds pushed together that separate easily during the night. The location is very nice. The roomhad a nice river view. Not a four star, maybe 2 or 3.The staff was helpful. However, one particular English speaking conceirge was extremely rude!! For the most part the staff was very helpful, however one conceirge when asked to assit with transportation directed me to use the pay phone. The breakfast was okay, however the restaurants dinner was terrible!!!! I found a nice restaurant 10 minutes away, DINO's, the food was superb. Florence is very crowed, however it is an exciting and glorious city. The artwork alone makes the entire trip worthwhileas well as all the inconviences. As a side note Vivtor tours provides a very good day trip wine tour and museum tour.I actually checked out the Bernini Hotel, I can not speak for the rooms however the lobby and location are prime. The price of merchandise is high in Italy and the dollar is devalued against the Euro. You can still find bargins if you shop around. Also be sure to see the gardens owned by the Medici family, they are spectacular.Pickpockets abound in the city and many of the tourist are very rude!! They will actually knock you off the sidewalk, or reach over you and bump into you. Be prepared to walk, walk and walk, Enjoy your stay in Florence.....
