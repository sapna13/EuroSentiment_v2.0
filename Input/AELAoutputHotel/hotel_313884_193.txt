{"text":"MOST amazing honeymoon EVER My new hubby  I went to the Punta Cana Princess Resort from July 3 to July 9th and we had the BEST time!!! We took the VIP package (since so many ppl raved about it) and it was absolutely, completely, one hundred percent worth it. Just the 24-hr free room service made it all worth it!!! One night, around 2 am we ordered 3 desserts, 2 sandwiches  salad (we were famished from doing honeymoon activities ;) and the guy brought it to us with a smile!!! Even though the tip is included  they don't expect tips, we would always tip ones to the maid, room service guys, the customer service men  women, and the bartenders. Everywhere we went staff smiled at us, shook my hubbys hand, patted him on the back - it was fabulous! One thing we were amazed about was that there were no bugs! We couldn't figure it out! They must spray for them all the time (altough we never smelled anything chemical) but when we got back home to Texas, we found more mosquitos in our back porch than on our whole 7-day stay!! Another perk is that it is adults-only and a lot smaller than the two sister resorts (although it was fun to go there for the shows, the a la carte restaurants, and walk through their park with random peacocks roaming the landscape! ). At night it's much quieter  most of the time, in the evening, you have like the entire beach to yourselves to take romantic walks, with our toes in the wet sand  hear nothing but the roar of the ocean waves... it was amazing. Also, the VIP beach beds ROCKED. It didn't matter what time we woke up (8 am or 11 am) there was always one available! All the food was AWESOME, especially all the fresh fruit  I loooooved the grilled chicken! My bubby loved the burgers  DEFINITELY loved the size of the steak at La Cava. The only problem we had with the food was that we always ate too much! Also, my hubby (from Brasil) thought that Rodizzio (the Brasilian a la carte) was good food, but not Brasilian by any means. The drinks were amazing too. I should note though, that neither of us drink alcohol so it took some convincing of the staff that we really, truly wanted our drinks sin alcohol, virgin . At first, many thought we were kidding. and I had to throw away a few drinks (I just can't stand the actual taste of alcohol, I know, it's weird) but they'd always make me another one without alcohol, laughing in disbelif ;) We did the parasailing (not included) and it was totally worth it for my hubby  I thought it was really neat too, but I got kind of motion sick towards the end  I felt gross on the boat ride back. We also went to Manati Park (not included) and swam with the dolphins! That was AWESOME! We also loved the other shows! It was all GREAT fun! We really had a great time  it was always easy to book the a la cartes for dinner by phone in the mornings. But truthfully, I really liked the all day Casabe buffet the best!!! There was just so much variety  you didn't have to choose just one thing! That probably relates more to my personality preferences than the actual food itself! They were both about equal in quality (for my middle class taste anyways! ;) but I enjoyed the variety and flexibility more of the buffet. We only have one warning for fellow Americans who don't travel all the time (like ourselves) , the Europeans are very flexible with their bodies  exposure! Even the old men (...in string thongs!) it was funny, but awkward to see at first... lol - we got used to it by the end of our trip though. Overall, we want to send every honeymooning couple there - it was AMAZING.
