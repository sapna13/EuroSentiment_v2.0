{"text":"Too far and little to do. My friend and I were looking forward to our first trip to Puerto Rico, after researching several hotels we decided on the Courtyard Marriott which had a decent price and walking distance. We stayed at the Courtyard from Agust 28-Sept. 1. The noise from the airport did not bother us and we slept soundly. Where do I start..... Check- in went really smoothly and we had a nice room with a view of the ocean. The room is clean and spacious, the bathroom is large yet the bathtub was moldy, had soap scum and mold starting to form on the ceiling. Our housekeeping did a wonderful job making sure we had clean towels and came to clean up the room daily. Most of the staff is nice and always had a smile. One problem I encountered was at the Banana Cafe in the lobby, the young lady was counting her cash register and we were standing in front of her waiting to be served, I did not want to disturb her since she was in the middle of counting and figured she will acknowledge us once she finishes the set of change she was counting...well she went to the next set without bothering with us. I asked her is she is going to serve us and she said just a minute meanwhile the other person working with her, passed us several times didn't bother either....Breakfast was too expensive at the hotel so we ate at Denny's most of the timeThere was a wonderful friendly hardworking young man named Marcelino who set up a chairs ($6)and umbrella ($9) and can get quite expensive, which mean 21 dollars a day. The pool was nice although we never used it since the beach is right there and beautiful to see, it is not white sand, a lot of seaweed and very sandy, I would rate it a C. and THERE ARE SAND FLEAS!!!! At first I thought I was getting bitten by mosquitoes (I am allergic, swells almost like a welt and turns red blue), which did not happen, then I thought they were bed bugs, that was not the case either, and recalling some of the reviews regarding Sand Fleas, I figured that must be it...I am not a doctor yet it is a good speculation.Since my friend and I do not drive, taxi fare was turning out to be expensive, 20 dollars (one way) to go to Plaza Las Americas which is a 10 minute cab ride. We tried to save by taking the bus to Old San Juan which was 75 cents and get a chance to see the inner barrios. The hotel is far from the nearby restaurants, and NOT walking distance as many claimed. I'm from NY and I am not afraid to walk long distances in a fast pace, yet restaurants are not close. We ate at the Oyster bar which was not that great and that the Mexican restaurant on the rooftop at the El San Juan Hotel which was reasonably price and the food was good. Some cab drivers charge you different rates as well. The cab going to El San Juan hotel charged us $5 on our way back another cab driver charged us $8....the cab ride being 3 minutes away! The cabs we used are designated for Tourists to avoid being scammed....well I can't help but wonder if this really works!The entertainment at the hotel needs improvement and for two young women on vacation, much is left to be desired. The bar Picante was very stingy with their alcohol and PR being the main distributor of Rum, they seemed very cheap and their drinks ranging from $7-10, was watered down...We were also wondering were everyone was there was no more than a handful of people in the bar it started getting better by Thursday...we assumed they were saving the rum for the weekend. Located in a quiet location, the hotel is better for business travellers and families or for those that have a car rental. Otherwise it gets expensive and the nightlife is not that great.I will not return to this hotel for vacation, it is far from most attractions and restaurants. We were looking forward to a Caribean island and found ourselves in a replica of Miami with a Burger King at every street corner. The locals are really warm and friendly and always there to help and give you information; we enjoyed talking to many of them.
