{"text":"Nice resort, but not a true 5 star! We have just returned from a 2 week stay at the Grand Bahia Principe resort. The resort is huge but well organised and you never have the impression that it is over-crowded despite +4000 guests staying there (1880 rooms!). The pools however do get very busy and many people have the nasty habit of reserving their space early in the morning.The grounds are very well kept and all areas are very clean. The staff is motivated.Grand Bahia Principe claims to be a 5 star resort but it is not. It is a strong 4 star compared to other 5 star hotels. You shouldn't expect to pay for the safe, the pool at the spa, the toiletries are basic....The gym is a real let down. I tend to exercise daily and was looking forward to be able to do so during our stay. The gym is small, dark and damp and way too small for the size of the resort. The 2 rowers were broken, so was one of the treadmills and a few of the bikes. Despite reporting this to the manager nothing happened. A lot has been written about the food. We found the food choice to be better than in other all inclusives we stayed in. The kitchen team do an incredible job at feeding thousands of people several times a day. The food was not always warm but the vast choice compensated for this.Overall a positive experience but there is still room for improvement at the Grand Bahia Principe to be able to claim the full 5 stars.
