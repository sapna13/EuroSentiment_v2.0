{"text":"Overall, An Excelent Choice The Hotel David was the best hotel we stayed at during a two week trip. The room was quite large with a balcony. Breakfast consisted of sweet croissants (cornettos), fresh baked rolls, deli-ham, cheese, yogurt, cereal, fresh fruit, orange juice and coffee. Evening snacks were pizza slices, olives, peanuts white or red wine or orange juice. Everything at the hotel was just like all the other reviewers stated. I did well by reserving through the hotel's web site. I got a cheaper rate and I got a package which included a wonderful tratoria lunch near Ponte Vechia. Lunch was two plates (Plate one was a choice of five pastas, plate two was a meat and vegetable dish). Dessert, wine and bread included. I even got 5% off my hotel rate just because my name was David.If you arrive by train at SMN station it can be a little tricky getting the bus to the hotel. First, buy a few bus tickets at the bus office just outside the station. It is cheaper than buying on the bus and saves alot of hassle. Disregard the sign for bus #23 by the bus office since it is going the wrong direction. Instead, walk past the taxis in front of the station and cross the street to a major bus stop. Wait for bus 23 or 23A. it should come by in ten minutes or less. Once on the bus stamp your ticket. The bus will first swing by the Duomo before crossing a bridge over the river. Once you cross the bridge, it should be the third stop (I think). Look for Orsini on the bus stop sign. The hotel is right around the corner from the cafe. If you need a few items from a grocery store it is a ten minute walk across the bridge in front of the Hotel David to COOP supermarket. Ask at the front desk for a map and directions.  Florence is truly a very beautiful city. Just allow at least three full days just to hit the main sights. One thing to be forwarned about are the professional beggers. They seem to be all over the touristy areas. I got a kick out of one older lady whose territory is the Ponte Vechia. Every time I walked over the bridge there she was walking around saying grazzi in a raspy voice. You can't miss her.All in all, the Hotel David is an excelent choice!
