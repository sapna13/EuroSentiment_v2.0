{"text":"Better than Hawaii!!! What a wonderful trip and hotel!! We just got back June 18-22, Friday and can't imagine how anyone could ever say anything negative about the Punta Cana Princess. The staff was WONDERFUL, friendly, generous, thoughtful and all of this with no additional tipping!!! The food was all wonderful, there was always something great to eat! Breakfast is spectacular and a most enjoyable meal. Lunch out by the beach was terrific with sandwich items, hot items, fruits, desserts, salads, salad bar, barbeque grilled hamburgers, chicken, pork and steak. There was a delicious rice dish with lots of fresh seafood at lunch also. At night, all of the a-la-carte restaurants were great but the grilled lobster at the Mare Noistrum was fantastic, anything we raved over, they bought us another one. If you walk over to the sister resorts, you really appreciate the quiet atmosphere when you return. Romantic music was always pumped thru the speakers in the gardens in the evenings and very pleasant island music in the daytime. No kids! We left 6 at home so it was a nice change for some romantic , stressfree time away. I honestly can't say enough good about this resort. Beach was beautiful! Everything was very clean and immaculate ALL OF THE TIME our room, the grounds, buffets, restrooms, beach, everything, much cleaner than the US. Couldn't believe that we got all that for such a terrific price! If more people knew about this, Hawaii would go out of business! Enjoyed it so much more and can't wait to go back again next summer!!!!!
