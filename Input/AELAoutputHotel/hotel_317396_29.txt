{"text":"Huge key fob Not as well located as it seemed - it lay midway between Tsim Tsa Tsui and Mong Kok, where not much goes on. You will need to walk to the nearest MTR station (Jordan), and catch a train every time you want to go any where unfortunately, unless you want to check out Temple Street Markets.We stayed in a room in the middle of the fourth floor, where there were no windows, so we had no idea what the weather was like outside. The lifts only went up to the third floor, so we needed to climb an extra flight of stairs each times... imagine carrying your luggage up stairs!The room was spacious for three people though, and was clean. The beds were firm, and we had no issues with the bathroom. Good value compared to other more expensive places such as the Stanford Hillview Hotel.We had free internet access, which was cool, although the machines may have been loaded with spyware, keyloggers, and viruses. The free breakfast was very ordinary, and the breakfast room was so tiny, that we often had to share tables with other guests (each table sat 3-4 people). Use of the laundry room was free.The staff was very polite and quiet and was helpful when possible. Almost all of them had only basic English skills though. Housekeeping was really polite by clearing the way whenever you needed to pass them through the narrow corridors.The worst thing about staying here was the size of the key fob attached to the room key! Shaped to look like an Evergreen tree, it was the size of an open hand. Luckily, one of us always had baggy pockets or a bag with us. We tried removing the key from the key ring, but it was soldered closed.Overall, I would stay here again, simply because of its good value. It's not a 3 or 4 star hotel, but it was cosy and very adequate. I would recommend this hotel for most travellers. ","annotations":[]}
