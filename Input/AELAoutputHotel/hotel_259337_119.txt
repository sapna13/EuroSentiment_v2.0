{"text":"Amazing Resort Since I relied so much on previous reviews, I figured that it was my duty to return the favor. The grounds on this resort were unbelievable. Gorgeous foliage, beaches, pools, etc. I don't want to repeat much on what everyone else has said; food is not great, but much to choose from, Americans are the minority and close to 50% of the women on the beach were topless, etc. For $80 pp. we went scuba diving. I would recommend for anyone who hasn't ever been. The training took less than an hour, and the rest of the time was in the ocean. Also took the Saona Island excursion. It was fun to see the country on the drive to the marina, and the sailboat catamaran was a blast, but not much to do on the island once you are there. For the negatives: The salesmen will drive you nuts trying to sell excursions. Trying to relax on the beach, I had to tell the same guy 10 times that I did not want to go on an ATV excursion. It was very annoying while trying to have a good time. The bar selection is bad. Once choice of beer (Presidente on tap), and all liquors are the cheapest available (except for Hemingway's Bar, they had a bottle of Skyy and Contreau). Don't buy any souveniers from the vendors or market on the beach until you price the gift shops at the hotel....you will likely get a much better deal here, even with bartering involved. On the plus-side, you are allowed to go to any restaurant on any night that you want (unlike older reviews mention), without making reservations. I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone, just remember to bring some Pepto-Bismol, as you will definitely need it. ","annotations":[]}
