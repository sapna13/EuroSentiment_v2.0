{"text":"Peaceful... The Alimara is a quiet hotel. It is sort of isolated from the city centre and therefore quite peaceful without the bustle or crowds of the city. The good thing is there is a Metro Station (Mundet) just next to the hotel which easily leads you to most attractions and the city centre. The metro is very regular and takes less than 20 minutes into the city centre. Just remember the last train is at 12 am Sunday to Thursday but on Friday and Saturday the last train is 2 am.The rooms were adequate in size. The bathrooms were clean and had good showers. We too had problems with the air conditioning but we simply left the windows open overnight and had no trouble sleeping. The rooms were cleaned everyday. There was an electronic safe in the room which was very handy. The TV in the room only has news channels in English (CNN and BBC World). There was no tea\/coffee provided in the room.The breakfast buffet was a simple average continental spread. Our breakfast was included in the price of the room and had no problems with the bill. There was plenty of space at breakfast and we had no problems with coffee or tea with the waiters.The staff at the hotel could generally understand simple English and we had no trouble or hassle with any of them.The hotel claims to be 4 star but I would generally rate this as a 3 star hotel. There was nothing extra or spectacular about it. Overall we had a hassle free stay at the Alimara. We were always out and only used the hotel at the end of the night and for that purpose it served us well. I would easily stay there again ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1123,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1117},{"endOffset":1130,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1127}]}
