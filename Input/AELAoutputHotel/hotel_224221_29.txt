{"text":"If size is an issue, do NOT stay at 'The Library'... We had booked the Library Hotel for 5 nights in October to celebrate a 30th birthday, having read so much about how great the overall experience of staying in this boutique hotel was. We booked it at the sum of $575 plus tax a night for a Deluxe Queen. Upon arrival, we were shown up to the room (Architecture, by the way) and were completely floored by the size of it. It was EXTREMELY small. I had heard that most hotel rooms in Manhattan are smallish and not to expect much sizewise, but quite honestly, this shocked us for that price. I was SOO disappointed as we had booked this three months previous to our arrival and had really looked forward to staying here! The rooms were decorated adequately, various architecture books on a side table and a nice bathroom, and the hotel had kindly provided a bottle of champagne on arrival but under no circumstance would I pay that money for this type of room anywhere else on earth! The breakfast provided is a very generous continental spread, served in a 'library' atmosphere, which was really good and the bar on the rooftop is lovely, but after the first night, we started our search for an alternative hotel. I failed to believe that for that price\/size, you couldn't do better in Manhattan. We found one at twice the size and almost half the price in Bryant Park, and were delighted with it!The 'Library' manager was extremely helpful and accommodating upon our checking out. I don't imagine they have guests doing this very often, but quite honestly, for 5 nights in this city, if you're going to go all out and spend that sort of money on a room, you want to get some bang for your buck!
