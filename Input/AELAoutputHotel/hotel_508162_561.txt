{"text":"Preferred Club rooms not worth it. We stayed there End of Jan 2008. Check in. Not enough staff. We arrived with 2 other couples but it took over 20 minutes to get helped. We had originally booked standard rooms but decided to change to Preferred about 2 weeks before we traveled. Called and emailed ahead to do this but... Ask for Vanessa when you get there was the answer. Rooms. Nice furnishing but... The ceiling had moisture drops and the paint was peeling as a result off the AC blowing on it. Poor paint prep and work. Bathroom fan did not work. Because the rooms all have entries from a central hallway, there is a lot of noise that is transmitted into the room from ANYTHING that happens in the hallway. Be prepared for a constant 8 AM wakeup. On the last day there was a heavy rain in the early morning resulting in water all over the floor of the room. (1st floor). The bathtub may be a problem for some folks. The bottom of the tub is about 6 inches above the floor. Took a little getting used to. But without any kind of grab rail and tile floors, I suspect more than one person has slipped.Food. Needs help. Generally all of the restaurants served a variation of the same main ingredient. Although the tepanyaki restaurant was a nice surprise, expect to wait for that. The french restaurant was elegant but again the food was similar. Bring your own knife if you are going to eat meat. The knives there are butter knives that have been dulled. The buffett should have had more varieties of local flavor. If you like American you are fine. The Italian restaurant was a joke. I tried to get away from the same ingredient and tried to pizza with Bolognese. The sauce was actually chili. Never had bolognese with beans in it.Service. Slow to non-existent. At the pool or the beach expect to get your own. Inspite of an initial large tip at the start of the a couple of days, the return visit took forever. restaurant service was excellent in the French and Oriental ones but haphazard in the others. I suspect that most of the staff was new as most seemed poorly trained.Pool and Beach. The pool area is a little crowded. Not sure why. The beach was great and did not have problems with cut feet or.... Although I did not see any indications of raking or maintenance. The palapas at the beach need to be repaired. Many were only a couple of feet off of the sand. Otherwise it was very nice and relaxing.Entertainment. Very good dancing but very repetitive. I say boring.Other issues.All inlcusive did not include unlimited liquors or wine in the room, unless you called for a drink from room service. To get internet service you have to go to certain spots in the lobby. If you are club level that is free. Whoo. Very very slow. Not business user friendly.
