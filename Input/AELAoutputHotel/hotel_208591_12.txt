{"text":"Nice for the price This is a decent hotel at the top of the Rambla. It wasn't cheap, but seemed to be the cheapest decent hotel around.As a single traveler, I was scouring the internet for affordable rooms, digging mostly the the hostel options. I found this one for close to the price as many of the hostels and with that top rating for single travelers, I jumped on it.The room looked nice, but very small. This was fine for me as all I was really doing was using the room for sleep and rest. The bathroom looked like it had been recently renovated and was nice enough, aside from the dead roach in the corner. My room had the balcony facing the Rambla which was very nice. Loud mind you, so if you need quiet, don't stay there, but it was fine for me. The breakfast wasn't great, but it was convenient. A week of staggering around town constantly searching out restaurants, cafes, and such was challenging so having some food and coffee right there to get me going was nice. There was one computer in the lobby with internet service. I was able to check email a couple of times during my stay there. The only real complaint was one night having returned from being out until about 5:00 in the morning, the man at the desk was giving me a hard time after letting me in the front door. Mind you, there was somebody harassing me at the time so I was anxious to get in, but once in, the man demanded that I leave my key with him every time I left my room. Basically, I felt that I was being treated as a child when in fact, I was pushing 30 years old. The service aside from that was ok. Initial check in was quick and uninformative. I didn't ask questions so maybe I could have learned more, but there was certainly no assistance offered other than my room key. All in all, it was a fine hotel. Not a very social setting, but a decent nights sleep, though the single bed was a bit uncomfortable for my tall body, but the shower water was hot and the location was nice. I probably wouldn't stay on the Rambla again, but it was right in the middle of the city and I was able to walk everywhere over the course of the week from the beach, to Montejuic, to Park Guell, and everywhere in between. But then again, I like to walk.
