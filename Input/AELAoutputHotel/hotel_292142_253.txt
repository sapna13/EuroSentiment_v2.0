{"text":"more gushing about the Affinia!! This is getting repetitive..............but I can only confirm all the other reviews. We have just returned from a four day trip and I would be hard pushed to find anything negative about the Affinia.Front desk\/staff:The young ladies on reception are faultless. We requested on arrival a nice high room with a view and got the 33rd floor!The doormen were great. The ladies that cleaned our rooms we're also very friendly, efficient and eager to assist.Hotel:The Hotel itself is very comfortable, extremely spacious and very clean and welcoming. The rooms\/suites are very much home from home, which after a long day pounding the pavements in search of that ultimate bargain are a welcome relief. The only slight criticism I could make is that the mini bar and movies on command were a little pricey and we missed the first ten minutes due to a technical hitch. (told you I would be hard pushed!!) but that really is nitpicking!Location:I don't think we could have been better located. We were in very comfortable walking distance from most of the attractions and subway. We were close enough to the action without it being 'touristy'. If ever I find myself heading to New York again (which is quite likely seeing as though I feel I have only scratched the surface) I shall certainly be checking in here!!Top Tip* You must try 'Cucinas' restaurant in Macys, The pasta is cooked to order and is delicious and very reasonably priced. (huge portions too!!)
