{"text":"Good choice in Berlin We booked this hotel through laterooms.com. Not the cheapest in Berlin, but we wanted to be in a good location and in a hotel of a decent standard, and we were very pleased with this choice.The Mitte district is very central to all attractions, and the hotel has lots of plus points in its location. A variety of bars, cafes and restaurants are in the immediate neighbourhood. The hotel has excellent transport links with tram, S bahn and U Bahn- all almost on the doorstep, so it's quick and easy to get around. The day passes for the transport system are really good value, especially as a family-15 euros for unlimited travel for a day for 4 of us.Try the Oranien cafe for a fab breakfast. (Turn right out of the hotel, walk down to where you see the S bahn and it is on the opposite corner). Beautiful setting, large round tables, very light and spacious, newspapers, mags available for relaxing with. We were there on a Sunday just after 10am, but it filled up very quickly after that time.We didn't try the hotel for breakfast as this cafe had more choice and was better value. Also try one of the small cafes across from the hotel (to the left as you look from the hotel)- very good, but the service is slow, so not if you're in a rush! The cafe next door is also good for a coffee and cake.Hackesher Mkt is worth a visit. Only a couple of stops on the tram. Walk round the corner from the hotel to get the tram on the way, but on the way back the tram stops just opposite the hotel. Good shops, cafes, restaurants and entertainment. We ate at a Spanish tapas bar and it was a good evening.Also useful for a supermarket if you want to buy some bottled water, snacks etc.Another dinner recommendation is the Cuban restaurant. Turn right out of the hotel, cross the road and it's just down there. Good range, healthy portions and good value. Don't eat at the Italian on the corner next to the hotel -very average.Overall, we found eating out in Berlin to be really good value when compared to other European cities, and even to places in the UK. Plus, the food and service is MUCH better than the UK!Some reports say that the hotel is noisy. It was fine when we were there, but perhaps at different times of year..?Reception staff were friendly and efficient.Re the rooms- very clean, and modern. We really liked them. If you read other reviews you will know that the shower and sink are open to the bedroom apart from a thin curtain, however, it really isn't a problem as the mirror pulls over screening most of the area. Also, it can be an advantage as the mirror is double sided, so if 2 people are trying to get ready at once, you can have one on each side! The toilet is separate. We liked the security aspect of the hotel- you have to put your room key into the lift, and it only stops at that floor, so no one else can access it. Didn't like the lounge\/ bar in the hotel - cold (but it was February), smells of smoke and overpriced compared to every bar within 30 seconds walk. Cocktails and beer abound on every bar menu and lots of happy hour offers.Worth visiting -Alexander Platz tower, Tiergarten,outdoor art gallery (graffitti art on the wall), Berlin Zoo, - lots of other attractions depending on your own taste.We would stay here again, as we feel it is the best location, and probably one of the best hotels in the Mitte.
