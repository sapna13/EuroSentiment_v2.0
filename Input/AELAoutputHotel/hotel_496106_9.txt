{"text":"One of the best hotel experiences EVER...truly I'm not sure where to start...The Drake Hotel has to be one of the most unique, wonderful, special hotels in all the world...and I've travelled the globe quite a bit. From the moment you walk in you are in design heaven. The design eye and sensibility behind The Drake is evident in every single detail. The lobby, the rooms, the cocktail lounge, the underground bar, the cafe--every single space is a visual delight, the kind that has you oohing and ahhing outloud. And while yes, the look of the hotel is ultra cool--and the vibe backs that up-- the people at The Drake could not be nicer or warmer or more genuine. Go to a spot like this in London or New York and you'd typically find the staff a bit pretentious; this is so not the case here. I think that pairing is what makes this place so fabulous and desirable:uber cool and of-the-moment in its look and hub of activity but wonderful, real, kind, helpful people bringing it all to life. I will definitely return to The Drake; there is nothing like it in the world.You should put it at the top of your list for experiences in this lifetime. Some of the unbelievably amazing people you should look out for and get to know: Jonathan, Zoe and Ana at the front desk; Mia the curator who will show you the hotel's fantastic art; and Anthony in the cafe. signed, Amy from Chicago ","annotations":[{"endOffset":463,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":456}]}
