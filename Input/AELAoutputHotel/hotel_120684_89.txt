{"text":"Great hotel just OK vacation. This hotel is great. Loved the view (partial beach from balcony). The service was top drawer. The location seemed to be heart of Waikkiki. We were able to walk to aquarium and tourist trap huge international market just across street. Many places to dine and we loved Dukes downstairs. We were greeted by our tour Blue Hawaii and conned into free first morn breakfast. They did a great picture of us but breakfast lousy and they are over priced on tours they sell. We did book city bus tour and was OK, but book through people handing out fliers and cheaper. We went to Pearl Harbor to see Arizona in afternoon Tuesday and waited in no lines It is 1:20 by bus or $24.00 by shuttle Don't Miss It. I am from Florida and was shocked at the constant winds and lack of warmth air\/water in May. I had to skip snorkle as water too cold for me!! Such a disappointment. I do understand man from Nashville. Can't even have a frozen drink on beach. If you smoke skip this place. My husband drove me insane as Hawaii is no smoking anywhere. You must be like 50 feet (outside) from any public building!! If you like japan inspired foods it is cool as quick stores carry all kinds of interesting items. Glad I went but it is very expensive. Jack in box cheap relief on next steet past international market which has food court we found last day.High end retail galore but not in my league. (Gucci etc..) ","annotations":[]}
