{"text":"Great expectations, awesome time! We stayed for ten nights at the Excellence Punta Cana for our honeymoon and enjoyed every second there!The ride to the hotel is long, but fun since you see lots of interesting things (tourists on buggies, four people on a tiny motorbike...). When we arrived we didn't get the towels or champagne, but got checked in within 10 minutes. Upon arrival we were already amazed by the beauty of the hotel and its gardens. It took quite long to receive the luggage, but after unpacking we got ready for dinner and got into a romantic mode right away. This hotel is sooooo romantic, dimmed lights, couples seats at the beach to watch the sunset, queen size beds on the beach and the pool...! We were blown away!ROOM:Great, really big with an open bathroom incl. Jacuzzi tub next to the bed (seperate shower\/toilet room though). Big four poster king bed, stocked up mini bar (beer, soft drinks). Small safe to keep money and passports etc., robes, slippers and a huge amount of bathroom goodies (even a razor). Big TV and DVD player. We got the Junior suite Garden View which is their cheapest room and it was soooo great! I can recommend it!FOOD: We loved the food! Breakfast was sooo delicious, especially the Smoothies. There is everything you would ever want for breakfast, even Bloody Mary ingredients and Champagne. Never had a better breakfast buffet!There were basically two options for lunch: The Grill which we liked (try the Grouper sandwich YUM) or the Buffet which had Sushi, which was really good and Pasta, Pizza and Salads, Soups and so on. There were also BBQs at the beach which we never went to...Otherwise snacks were served at the pool and beach (sandwiches, pizza, nachos, burgers....)At night you could choose from 7 restaurants. We tried five, since we don't eat meat or seafood (Lobster House and The Grill were out). Spice is great! I would not recommend the Sashimi since they don't know how to cut the fish right...but everything else was great! Try the fish soup and the chili fish dish...!Barcelona was amazing too. They have a to die for fish Carpaccio and the fish in salt crust is delicious too! It is the most romantic place and they have players going around and playing for you! Chez Isabelle is definitly one of the best places and as good as any higher priced restaurant in the States! I recommend the fish tartar and the Portobello Mushroom appetizer and the Sea Bass as main course! Have the cheese platter before dessert, just because it feels so sophisticated and tastes great!Toscana is great too, they have Italian dishes which were really enjoyable. The Gnocci are really, really good!!! Agave was the only place we didn't like to much and I got sick afterwards, In general we don't like Mexican food to begin with, so we should have stayed clear, but if you like Mexican food it should be fine.All bars are amazing and all drinks were great! Loved the Coco Loco and all Martinis they made. Waiting 90 minutes for Chez Isabelle was so much fun at the Martini bar! I could go on and on about this place...I would just repeat what everybody else wrote! It is an adult only place, so you will see women without tops and they have a free porn channel (nobody ever mentioned that...).My advise to future Excellence guests: 1. Don't get Excellence Club, it is not worth the higher amount of money SERIOUSLY!2. Try different kinds of dishes than you would normally eat , go with the fish dish instead of the steak! They know how to prepare good fish and you are on vacation!3. Drink- a lot- it's fun to try different cocktails!!!4. Don't forget medication and sunscreen, the pharmacy is a rip off!5. Don't mess with the parrots they bite and love to destroy sunglasses, necklaces, bracelets....(one woman got her brand new Chanel sunglasses clipped OUCH)6. Play!!!7. HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
