{"text":"A good altenative if the price is right We needed to go to NYC for what we now realize is major tourist season. We tried all means possible to get a nice hotel for under $500-600\/night for a weekend in between Thanksgiving and Xmas to no avail.We decided to blow our entire hotel point account on 2 nights at a different hotel which was not ideal but it got us there. I continued to search however, for some break though or last minute deal. Hotwire was listing a 4 star hotel in Soho for $249. Bingo! I examined the description (which mentioned a pool) and searched to find that the only 4* hotel in Soho with a pool was the uber-hip Gansevoort. I jumped at the chance and booked it, only find, out after committing, that the reservation was for the Millennium Hilton.We were quite disappointed (I'd even say a bit mad) since although this hotel is South of Houston....it is no way Soho.We have had many opportunities to stay here in the past but declined. But....we sucked it up and checked in and wrote it off to it's only a place to sleep and shower.I have to say that we were pleasantly surprised. The proximity to the subway and path trains made it an incredibly convenient location. Since we are Gold members, we were upgraded to a room with a fantastic view of all downtown and the river. Sunset was spectacular. It was fascinating to watch the activity going on in the rebuilding of the WTC across the street. We checked in to a decent sized, modern and clean room with nothing really to complain about. The staff was helpful and friendly.While we did just sleep and shower here on our busy weekend, I would consider staying here again if the price was prohibitive at some of our more favorite locations.
