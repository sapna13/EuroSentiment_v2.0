{"text":"Sad to say... We've stayed at The Muse numerous times over the past four years, and I'm sad to say that our last visit was disappointing.The hotel is lovely, and the rooms are comfy- but there's something missing since Kimpton took over.We checked in on Friday, and had nightly turndown service until Wednesday. Then this lovely touch was discontinued with no notification on the part of the hotel staff.On previous trips the turndown service included pillow treats, which my husband looked forward to. We received a 'treat' on the first night of our stay because of my Kimpton membership. After that it was just turndown. We're afraid that the evening housekeeper had been terminated because Kimpton didn't want to keep up the turndown tradition. When we asked about the service, the staffer at the desk spoke to us like we were morons.In the bathroom was a 'convenience' menu of items that could be picked up at the front desk if you'd left yours at home. I sent my husband down to the desk for an item, and they didn't have any- and hadn't for a few days.Suffice it to say, that with the rates going up considerably and the congeniality and courtesy of certain staff members going down- we're looking around for another hotel to call 'home' on our trips.Kimpton will be doing a renovation of The Muse, which will include removal of the lovely ladies on the ceiling of the lobby.Before our July trip, we would have given this hotel not only an 'Excellent but would have raised it to 'Outstanding. Now it's above average, for the comfort of the rooms. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1538,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":1531}]}
