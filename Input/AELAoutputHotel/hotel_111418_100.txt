{"text":"Boston Park Plaza - Avoid at All Costs What a terrible experience. Booked through Priceline and got a great rate, but hotel placed me on the same floor with a college Model UN convention. Due to the hotel's long hallways and high ceilings, all noise generated by the Model UN-ers drifted right into my room from midnight to 5 am. Needless to say, no sleep that night. Two calls to hotel security (after trying to get the kids to quiet down on my own) failed to solve the problem.After a sleepless night, I had to deliver a seminar to a group of about 25 in the hotel's conference center. At least one other conference participant was also kept awake all night by the college kids. The hotel put my conference in a small, poorly configured room. Worse, the heating\/cooling system did not work properly, and the temperature in the room was 81 degrees when we started the seminar. Hotel staff failed to correct the problem, making us resort to opening the windows, allowing street noise and strong winds to interrupt the seminar.Just when things couldn't get any worse, the hotel informed us that they would be conducting a fire drill that morning, meaning that fire alarms further interrupted the seminar.The staff's response to the hallway noise, and the staff's failure to rectify the heating problem in the conference room, made for a miserable experience at this hotel. This is clearly one of those old, grand hotels who's time has passed. With so many better hotel options in Boston, travelers are advised to avoid the Boston Park Plaza at all costs.
