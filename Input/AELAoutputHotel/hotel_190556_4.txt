{"text":"Elegant little hotel The Canal House Hotel is an elegant, beautifully furnished, small hotel in an ideal part of central Amsterdam. Within easy walking distance for public transport and many tourist attractions, yet in a quiet canalside street. We were nicely welcomed and offered a choice of two rooms. Our room was clean and comfortable and overlooked the garden which must be delightful in the summer months. This hotel is certainly different from the usual large hotel chains with boxes pretending to be rooms!Criticisms? Yes, it was expensive for a three night stay. Especially as one of our nights was a Sunday when there were not many guests and it was the Winter season. No discounts were offered. Breakfast on the Saturday morning was reasonably fine when the hotel was busy and there were an adequate number of staff. Bowls of fruit straight out of a tin though? Fresh fruit doesn't cost so much more! The following two mornings went downhill for service and food running out. At our last breakfast I was continually visiting the kitchen to ask for things and almost donned an apron to get things moving! Canal House Hotel, if you are employing foreign workers give them more training in understanding what guests are asking for.Apart from that, a lovely experience to stay here and this hotel is recommended to anyone who wants something elegant, surprises around every corner in its decor and in the heart of Amsterdam.One other must do is to have dinner at the restaurant 'Lieve'. Just a short walk away. An amazing dining experience. Not to be missed! We loved every minute! ","annotations":[]}
