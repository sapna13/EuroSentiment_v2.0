{"text":"Fantastic Dai Ichi Wow! What service and attitude - the Best! My wife and I stayed here Oct 10-13 on our first leg of 4 stops in Asia. This hotel has spoiled us for all other hotels! The service was beyond exceptional. The staff makes you believe that they enjoy helping and serving you here. No tips expected and what a wonderful attitude. May I help you? really means that. Rooms were immaculate and the location could not have been better. We were tired the first day and ended up taking advantage of their 30% off meal in their smorgassboard type restaurant. (Yes, it cost $34 each, but we paid $50 another night for one pizza and 2 beers!) On the menu that night were Filet Mignon and King Crab Legs (along with other entres) with a myriad of other fabulous side dishes. It sits less than 5 min walk (with roller luggage) from the Shimbashi Terminal and less than 5 minutes walk from the start of the Ginza District - take lots of money!We bought the First Class Japan Rail (JR) pass for 7 days ($333 each) because we were taking the fast train (called Shinkansen) to Kyoto and the 7 day pass cost less than a round trip cost Tokyo - Kyoto and return. The biggest benefit was that the JR express from Narita Airport to Tokyo station and back were free and all JR (most subways and above ground rail) lines were free also. Saved us a ton of time and bother having to carry around small change for tickets. One word of caution, show the rail pass to the person at the window rather than trying to go thru the turnstiles when you enter and leave the train stations. If you get lost --and you will,-- ask any policeman or ticket window person for directions. Everyone is lost sometime- even the locals! This Hotel is among the best of the best!!
