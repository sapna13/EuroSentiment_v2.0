{"text":"Hip? The San Juan Water Club made the Conde Nast Travelers list of best hotel for 2000. Perhaps they need to visit again. The best part of this hotel is the staff, their genuine friendliness and helpfullness. Because it is a boutique hotel, the staff gets to know you quickly. Also the hotel is right on the beach. There are negatives however.This hotel boasts of it cool factor. There is a rooftop bar with leather longues that are in need of replacement, along with the salt air weathered furniture. The elevators have beautiful waterfalls inside,but inadequate ventilation of the heat-so they are muggy. There is practically no in room storage space-pack light!  If you are in a partying mood on Friday or Saturday night, the rooftop, known asWET is the place for you. A young hip local crowd dances to 2am on Fridays and 5 am on Saturdays. If sleep is your plan, this is not the weekend place for you. On the weekdays, the hotel is a lot quieter. Ironically, the majority of the people that can afford these accomodations are the baby boomer set- though there are some 30-40ish people. A word about the restaurant-Tangerine. Avoid it! We should have known better, when at 8:15 pm the place was empty.At this highly rated dining spot, we had one of the worst meals we have had anywhere Still, I would come back. I hate large impersonal hotels, I liked the location and closeness to the airport-5 minutes. No, you don't hear the planes as much as you might think. And I liked being on the beach. A very convienient car rental, is right behind the hotel. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":28,"mention":"Water Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Water_Club"],"startOffset":18}]}
