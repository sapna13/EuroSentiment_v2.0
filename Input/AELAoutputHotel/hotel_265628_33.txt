{"text":"This resort is FAR AWAY from the airport - only good for longterm stays LOCATION - We booked Sirenis for part of our honeymoon after reading positive reviews in Lonely Planet. What we failed to realize is how FAR this resort is!!! If you are going with your family for a week and are not planning to leave the resort, then this place will be great for you (and was great for families staying there - lots of activities every hour). But for my husband  I, we were planning to stay there for 4 nights, then tour around the rest of the Dominican Republic. Because we were so far from any city (it was a 1.5 -2 hour ride from the airport), we had to hire drivers from the resort to take us to Santo Domingo, our next stop, for $200 USD. (just to put things in perspective, if we were closer to Punta Cana or even Bavaro, we could've taken a bus for $10 USD). Because you are in the middle of nowhere, you have little choice for things such as internet ($7 for 30 minutes!!!) or groceries. FOOD - The buffet is pretty terrible, with all types of cuisines that would please kids (think fried foods, pasta, pizzas). There are around 8 small restaurants on the resort but they are impossible to get a reservation for! You can reserve 2 dinners per week, but good luck trying to actually get a reservation at one of them, and in that case, you eat the buffet, again. DO NOT PAY FOR THE LOBSTER DINNER! My husband and I couldn't get a dinner reservation and couldn't stomach another night of buffet, so we paid $30 each for their lobster party which happens every Wed. night. Terrible lobsters. They had the consistency of mashed potatoes. Avoid paying for any extra food at this resort. HONEYMOON - On our last night there, we mentioned that it was our honeymoon - and this really changed our trip! They wanted to see our marriage certificate, which we didn't have, but be sure to bring it if you're on your honeymoon. They brought us fruit  champagne to our room, breakfast in bed  squeezed us into the Italian restaurant for dinner. This really changed my perception of the resort!CONCLUSION - If I had children  wanted a relaxing break, I would go here for a week long stay. However, not that you will NOT get any Dominican perspective...it's really like a huge American resort transported into the Carribean. My husband  I actually had more fun going around the country  staying in small places and eating at local restaurants.
