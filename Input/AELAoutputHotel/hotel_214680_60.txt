{"text":"ABSOLUTELY A+++Hidden Jewel Hotel in Waikiki Hawaii This hotel is absolutely fantastic. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Roberta...without her the image of this hotel would not of projected a true hawaiian \/ aloha feeling. She made us all feel right at home. Her upbeat attitude, smiling face and eagerness made our day. Our family booked four rooms and stayed twicein the month of August for a total of 9 days. The hotel is right across the best boogie boarding beach inWaikiki. The locals call it the WALL. We had some diehardsurfers and the ladies could watch them from our hotel andfrom the pool room. We had rooms from oceanfront, poolsideand oceanview. The poolside lanai rooms are great because it opens up to thepool area. It is not noisy at night, because the pool closes at around 6 pm or sunset. The oceanview rooms are great because you have a view of diamond head and the ocean.The oceanfront rooms are okay b ut it is set back and not asnice as the oceanview rooms especially if you request therooms nearest to the ocean.The japanese restaurant is great! There is also a nightclubupstairs for the youngset. Also, Starbucks and the ABC stores are in the hotel lobby area. We have stayed at many hotels in Waikiki after visiting this hotel we will always make our reservations here now. You will be absolutely happy choosing this hotel. The room pricesare very economical and you will not find a hotel like thisin Waikiki for these prices. Please look up their website and you will see the hotel is practically on the beach. You can stay in Hawaii longer with these hotel prices and have lots of fun. Good Luck ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1148,"mention":"ABC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ais_kacang"],"startOffset":1145},{"endOffset":1148,"mention":"ABC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ais_kacang"],"startOffset":1145}]}
