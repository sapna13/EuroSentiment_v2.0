{"text":"Not so great The actual structure of this place was fine. The rooms were clean but the bathroom had little water pressure. Our bed was broken but was fixed the next day.  If you want anything at this resort don't ask because the staff will not accommodate you. I'm a vegetarian and asked for something to be made without meat and was told it was not possible. I asked for cheese between two pieces of bread and was told they were not sure if they could do it. I later found out they had grilled cheese on the children's menu, so they could make it. There is supposed to be a person on the beach who provided towels. I never saw anyone doing this. We brought our room towels to the beach. This is not so bad, but when they advertise and even tell you at check in that they do this, then they should. I picked this resort since it had two restaurants and we wouldn't have to leave the resort (we didn't rent a car). However, when we went to lunch at the resort the day after our arrival, we found out that the restaurant was closed for a wedding and the other restaurant on site was already booked. No one told us that the restaurant would be closed due to weddings and no one advised us to make a reservation at the only open restaurant. We had to take a taxi to another restaurant in town just to eat. There is no room service or way to eat anything at the resort if there is a wedding, except for the vending machines.The only activity to do was to go to the beach. They do provide the chairs as shown in the website, but they don't have enough for everyone. Also some of the chairs have missing cushions, so you would have to sit on the wood chair alone. I did not see or hear about any rental equipment for the ocean such as kayaks or snorkel gear. I did not see a place to get massages nor was there any word on how to book one. I was afraid to ask since everything else I asked for they could not make happen. The best thing we did while staying at the resort was to take a taxi 2 hours away to another town where we spent half the day snorkeling. We also made sure to eat dinner on the way back. The resort actually recommended this snorkel place and had a brochure. But they told us to make all of our own bookings including transportation. I found out that this place is under new management. That may be why others on this site liked it so much in the past. I would not recommend going here unless you simply want to stay near the beach and don't plan to have any meals there. Or maybe it would be better if there were no weddings at the same time as your stay. So you may want to ask before you book if you will be sharing the resort with a wedding party.
