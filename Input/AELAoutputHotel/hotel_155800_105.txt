{"text":"No Problems for us...We liked this hotel My wife and I just returned from our Honeymoon. We went to St. Thomas and Purto Rico. We stayed at the El San Juan for 5 nights in late January\/early February. We were very surprised to see the other reviews about poor service and bed bugs. We did not encounter any of this. We enjoyed our stay. I'm no travel expert, just an ordinary person who travels a couple times a year. Honestly, this hotel was very nice with above average service.There are 3 very nice looking bar areas when you walk in. A casino is immediately to the right. Everything was very well landscaped and kept up nicely. We stayed in the Garden Villas on the 100 level. NO PROBLEMS WITH BED BUGS!. Reports about thin walls are true. I have to admit that. However, it was not that bad for us. The pool area does get crowded and the hotel definitely picks up on the weekends. However, the pool area is not so crowded that its unbearable. There are 2 separate pool areas and 3 separate hot tub areas. The beach and Atlantic Ocean are only a few steps from the far pool area. We encountered no problems with getting 2 pool chairs and were alone in the hot tubs most of the time. The bartenders at the pool bar were very helpful and courtious. The pool is open 24 hours! You just have to bring your own towel after 5PM. The only thing they are strict on is attire in the lobby after 7PM. Slacks and shoes are required. No tanks, swimming trunks, shorts or flip flops after 7PM. I had to change into pants one night. There is even a little shopping galleria inside the hotel.Good luck getting a table at the Casino on Friday or Saturday night. Or getting into the night club Bravia. The lobby and casino are crowded on Friday  Saturday nights. Get to the craps table early! Performers come in and sing and play music and folks can dance and hang out at the bars after 7PM. Much different during weeknights. More low key atmosphere during the week nights.The service at this hotel was great! Our flight got us in at 1PM, and the concierge\/reception was able to get us checked in early. Our returning flight did not leave until 7PM and they also let us check out late.(3PM) The bell man were very helpful and valet attendants were excellent. One did not speak english very well, but was able to run a co-worker down in a matter of seconds to help us out. The pool manager even got towels for us one day. We didn't have to leave our pool chairs. Be prepared to pay resort prices for the drinks though. We were new to the Island and everybody was very helpful with reccomendations for restaurants  sights to see! Old San Juan is a must!Overall, this was a very good hotel. Not 100% blown away by excellence, no. The room decor was not entirely modern. Couple of stains on the carpet and our safe did not work properly most nights. The TV's are not high tech modern flat screens, just your basic 19 inch Magnavox with basic cable and a VCR. No DVD. However, nothing is perfect. I'm not on vacation to watch TV or be blown away by fancy furniture\/decor. No Bed Bugs in our room! Nobody slipped something into our drinks. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Very nice scenery. Great restaurants. Very helpful staff. We splurged one night and went to The Palm. Highly reccomended! Also, on the 10th floor is a neat cowboy\/western theme type restaurant called Ranchers. Great food and atmosphere with a great view of the ocean. We would return to the El San Juan ","annotations":[{"endOffset":501,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":497},{"endOffset":1679,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1675},{"endOffset":3164,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3160}]}
