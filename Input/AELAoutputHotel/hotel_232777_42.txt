{"text":"a little gem of a hotel As this was my second visit to the city i knew exactly where i wanted to stay.This hotel is a 3 min walk from Plaza Catalunya + the ramblas. This is where you can get a bus or a train to almost anywhere in the city.I booked this hotel for its location and as there was so many good reviews on here.The hotel was very easy to find and when we arrived to check in we were offered a glass of champagne which we accepted of course!! Our room was in Gravina 2 which i think is a new addition to the original building. On first look after opening the door i was slightly dissapointed with the size of the room. The double bed took up most of the floor space, a fitted wardrope and a writing desk were also fitted in. The bathroom was big and modern. The room was spotless and at the end of the day the small room didnt bother us one bit as we were not planning to spend much time in it (which we didnt). You dont go to a beautiful city like Barcelona to spend all your time in a hotel room.The breakfast in the morning was excellent. A nice bright breakfast room serving everything you could imagine, fruit, sausage, beans, eggs, cheese.........i could go on and on.Over all this is a fantastic hotel. For me its the loaction that makes it so special! If you want luxury and fancy fixtures and fittings then book 5* and pay √ä√£¬¢200 a night for the room, but you would be off your head to ignore this wee hotel ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1058,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1054}]}
