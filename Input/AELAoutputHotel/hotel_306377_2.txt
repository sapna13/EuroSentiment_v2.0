{"text":"Good location for daytime sightseeing LocationI stayed in the Shiba Park Hotel for one week of sightseeing. 3 subway lines and the Yamanote line can be reached in less than 10 minutes, so it's a great basis for daytime sightseeing. Tokyo World Trade Center (with it's gorgeous view over Tokyo Bay by night from the observation platform - don't miss it - and a Japanese Post office with international ATM) and Tokyo Tower can also be reached on foot. Ginza is just two subway stations away.BookingInitially I found the hotel on some hotel metasearch site, but the rates on the hotel's own (english language) website were about 10% better than the best alternative.RoomVery dated, probably should have been renovated 15 to 20 years ago (e.g. spots on the carpet, old furniture). However, cleaning personal is quite efficent. TV old, but three english speaking stations (CNNjapan, BBC World, CNBC). Empty minibar (which for me was a good thing, because the next convenience store is right next to the hotel and there are vending machines on each floor). Windows old, but hotel is located on a rather quite street without much car traffic.PersonalFriendly, efficent, english-speaking.SurroundingsMany small convenience stores, dozens of small restaurants, 24h-McDonald's, Starbucks, all in less than 5 min on foot. The next bigger food store with a good selection I found is one subway station away (1st floor of Shimbashi railway station). However not very much flashy nightlife (I didn't miss it, but that's just me).Who shouldn't book this hotel?If you want a modern and good looking room\/hotel.If you want much nightlife, clubbing,..Who should consider booking this hotel?If you don't want to spend very much money on a good staging point for daytime exploration of Tokyo. For my needs the hotel was a very good choice. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":78,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":68}]}
