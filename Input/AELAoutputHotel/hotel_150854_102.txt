{"text":"A good place to loose weight Ok, I am in my early 40's and have traveled extensively for business and pleasure. I chose the RIU Palace Macao because I was taking some top performing sales people away for a reward trip and had a very limited budget and the RIU fit it. I would rate my room as fine but nothing special. The pool was fine but nothing special. The beach was very nice, but it was crowded. The service was good and very friendly. The drinks were good (but not the wine) and included, thank god because the food was horrible. I admit I am an adventurous foodie but this was just below what should be standard. Greasy was the description for anything that was cooked but not in a stew. I would say that it was below Denny's grade. In fact, I would have been thrilled to go to a Denny's as an alternative. They have a number of restaurants for dinner. All of them are empty because they are a joke. The japanese resturant was comical. They served sushi, which was rice with a shaved sliver of fish on it with a thick soy sauce. Then, some version of Sukiyaki, which I believe was the from the beef stew from the buffet that they washed off and served with rice. The steak house offers a 6 ounce rib eye, which was fried, not grilled. I could go on. I think they have the resturants so they can market that they have them but everyone ends up at the buffet out of despiration. I should add that I saw a number of people enjoying the buffet. I can only imagine these are the people that go to Denny's for dinner, not the ones that end up at Denny's at 2 am to absorb the alcohol. Also, the front desk quoted us 150 dollars and a 35 minute ride to play teeth of the dog golf course at Casa de Campo. Well we did it and it ended up being a 3 hour ride and 300 dollars. Great course but it was tainted by the false promises. There is a course right next door to the Palace Macao, Punta Blanca, which was a very good course, and was really 150 dollars and it included a limited lunch, though not on the ocean like the Teeth of the Dog.All in all if your budget is limited and you can't afford much and food is not an important part of your vacation the Palace Macau is not a bad choice. The one good thing about the safari accross the island to play golf was I got to see outside the well guarded compound that is the resort. The island has a lot of potential but the poverty was wide spread and I must admit makes me ashamed of writing about how poor the food at the resort is as it would most likely be the meal of their lives. Yet, you do deserve to know what to expect before you go as spoiled and pompus I know I sound.
