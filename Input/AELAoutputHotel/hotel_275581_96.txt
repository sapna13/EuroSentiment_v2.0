{"text":"Absolutely Fantastic! We stayed at the hotel Friday to Sunday in Room 1235 (suite on the 12th floor) as a bit of treat to our usual Travelodge or Travel Inn and were not disappointed!Check in at 11am was fast effecient and very friendly - our room wasn't quite ready so we were offered complimentary drinks in the Millbank Lounge (seeing as the delay was only 15 minutes the sitdown and complimentary drink well made up for this).Our room was fantastic with views over the river and down to Vauxhall Bridge. Two iMac's (one in the lounge and one in the bedroom) meant is was really easy to check out things to do in London.Very good quality toiletries in the bathroom along with large soft towels and robes. Air conditioning worked well and the room was spotless.Complimentary Evening Standard Newspaper on Friday and a paper of our choice on Saturday and Sunday.Can't understand previous comments about distance from Tube Stations - it is literally only 5 minutes steady walk on the flat from Pimlico Station and 10 minutes from Westminster both of which aren't unpleasant walks!Our package didn't include breakfast which didn't bother us as large hotels are usually a bit of a faff in the mornings, so we had a really good breakfast for √ä√£¬¢9.00 total at Victoria Station's Weatherspoon's Pub (bacon, sausage, egg, beans, hash brown, tomato, toast, coffee).Basically we can't find anything to complain about and will definately be going back when they have deals on. Interesting I got our room √ä√£¬¢80 cheaper by booking with the Hotel direct on their website than the price quoted on LondonTown.com.
