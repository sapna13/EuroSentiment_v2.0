{"text":"Great Great Bahia ! My husband and i flew from Montreal through Air Canada from Oct. 28 till Nov. 4th to Bahia Principe Punta Cana.For the first 3 days we hit Hurricane Noel, it rained non-stop for 3 full days. And then.... spectacular sun and we got to explore the resort. It is huge and extremely clean. Although we did not get our room before 4pm (we arrived at the resort around 11 am) the room was perfect and clean. The resort itself is amazing, the pools are always clean. The staff did a great job at cleaning the beach after the storm and it was awesome. One down side, the animation team ! They bug you all day long with their activity program and they want you to participate but a simple no will do. I know I know, they are only doing their job. The night entertainment was really good. Every night a different show. The food was good, the buffet was a bit repetitive after one week, but we had the chance to eat at the japanese restaurant, the garden grill (excellent steak!) and the fish restaurant! all of the them serve excellent food. The village next door to the hotel is a plus, you can buy souvernirs for everyone. We left our maid Ramona tips everyday on the pillow and we got great great service from her. The reception staff got a little slow at times, but they are all friendly.Overall, the experience was good, eventhough we missed 3 days of sun, but i would recommend it to families and couples. Great Great Bahia! ","annotations":[]}
