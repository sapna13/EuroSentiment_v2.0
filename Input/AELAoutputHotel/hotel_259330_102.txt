{"text":"Amazing Resort Just returned a few days ago and this place was amazing. Just my sister and I went and had an awesome time. ROOMS: We stayed in the Club section of the resort which the rooms are older. Really clean but bathroom fixtures and stuff were older. NO BUGS!! Except when they would put fresh flowers on our bathroom sink, there were little insects in them. We would throw them out right away. We were to get two double beds but ended up getting one king size because the resort was over booked for the Dominican Labour Day Weekend. That was fine for us. Flat screen tv, which we never used was in our room. Hairdryer, coffee maker, AC, iron  board were all in the room. Be careful using the phone, you have to pay each time you use the phone. They charge you when you check out. The Grand Paradise section (not the club) is newly renovated and the rooms are much nicer but you have to take a 10 minute trolly to get to the beach and restaurants. Trolly is fun but waiting around for it is a nuissance. If I go back I'd stay in the older section just to be that close to the beach.RESTAURANTS: Two buffets to choose from one in the Club section and the other in the Grand Paradise section. Both were excellent. Breads, assorted deli meats, deserts, pasta, meats, etc. Very good. Breakfast was the best at the buffet - bacon, bread, yogert, cereal, crossants, muffins, etc. There's also La Cana Grill which is open during the day they have hamburgers, hotdogs, deli meats, fruit, pizza, fries, chichen, etc. Also there's a la carte restaurants to choose from which you have to book in advance. We only tried the Itilian, which was really good.BEACH: Awesome!! Clean, lots of beach loungers. Water is warm. If you have kids be warned lots of topless women. Also around the pools even though there's a sign that says No nudity. Beach was my favorite part of the trip, truly amazing.POOLS: 4 or 5 pools to choose from. Swim up bar on the Grand Paradise section. We mainly stayed around the pools in the Club section. Clean.EXCURSIONS: Definitely recommend the Soana Island Catamaran Tour. It's a full day trip from 7am to 7pm. Try and get a seat up front in the bus so you can see the view. Beautiful place. Took about 2 hours to get to the fishing village where we take the catamaran to the island. It's on the Caribbean Sea which the water is even nicer. Really calm, no waves. Catamaran ride was about 2 hours to get to the island. We stayed on the island for about 3 hours, then took a speed boat back which was so much fun. I recommend packing a light snack for the morning ride. Around 12-1pm they have a big lunch set up on the island, which was good.SHOPPING: Just outside the resort there's a place called Punta Blanca it's a marketplace only 5 minute walk outside the resort gates. You have to barter for items. I suck but my sister got us some really good deals. Always start at 10% of what they are asking, they tell you crazy prices. We walked outside by ourselves it was completely safe. No bad experiences at this resort. Also towards the end of our stay some locals came inside the resort and set up tables to sell items. There's also people going up and down the beach.ACTIVITIES: We weren't much for the nightlife, we got every morning between 5-6am to hit the beach and pool so by 10-11pm we were done. We tried to get as much daylight that we could. Most of the activities were either done in spanish or french and we only understood english.PHOTOSHOP: There's a photoshop on resort and they have photographers going around asking if they can take your picture. You don't have to buy it if you don't like it. We loved the pictures and ended up booking a session. Very professional looking photos and we had a blast doing it. We booked with photographer - Pablo, and he is very talented. Definitely recommend this.LANGUAGE: We only speak english. Most at the resort are french canadians. We found it a little frustrating at times getting directions and asking for things but we got use to it. Most of the staff only speak a small bit of english. Most tourists at the resort were french.I would definitely recommend this resort and I'm thinking about going back. Punta Cana Bavaro beach is awesome!!
