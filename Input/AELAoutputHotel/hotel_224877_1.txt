{"text":"My absolute favorite hotel in Miami My absolute favorite hotel in Miami I frequently visit Miami and had the chance to stay in several hotels. Having spent 30 nights there over the course of the past 3 years, the Mandarin is my favorite. The main drawback as most people familiar with Miami know is that the hotel does not have a real beach. Also, the pool is a little small. Other than those two things, the hotel is excellent. The staff are very good. Very helpful and friendly. While the staff at Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ Sambal are quite good, they can try to be a little more proactive. For example, at breakfast they see me carrying several plates from the buffet back to my table for my kids and they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ volunteer to help me, however, when I ask them they do it very eagerly. At breakfast (especially during holidays) it gets crowded and the service can be slow and a little frustrating. The room service menu is VERY limited after 11pm. They are in the process of upgrading the AV equipment and during my most recent stay the equipment in the connecting room for my kids was upgraded but not in the suite. The SPA is AMAZING one of the best in the world. The ambiance is very relaxed. One of the things I look for in a spa is a separate locker\/shower from the gym and the pool and at the Mandarin spa the facilities are top notch. They have a large number of treatment room and therapists on hand so getting an appointment is not a challenge. Even though it does not have a real beach its is on a small key\/island and is very well integrated with the surroundings. There is a very pleasant walkway circling the island and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a good 30 min walk. There is a small park with kids playground that the island residents use and my kids love going there. The concierge were very helpful in making my arrangements but they really put a big surcharge on transport and car hire. The hotel has an amazing lobby with breathtaking views of the ocean and the Miami skyline. During prior stays it was very lively with good food and beverage service and live entertainment (afternoon\/evening), however, during my most recent stay I hardly noticed any live entertainment or food service. I found out coincidently that the hotel has an arrangement with a nice beach club on Miami beach (South Beach) which hotel guests can use, however, I wish they made this more obvious. Overall, its an excellent hotel, with some room for improvement.
