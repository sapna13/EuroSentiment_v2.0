{"text":"Presidents week @ Caribe Hilton We stayed at the Caribe for our school break this year. We traveled with 3 families with kids 10-16. 10 of us all together.We have traveled every Feb break for the last 10 years. That being said my review of the Caribe Hilton is great. The biggest problem we encountered was the wind and that had nothing to do with the hotel.Our check in was quick and painless, the only glitch was that we were all not on the same floor. We did not get crazy but asked if they could move the one family and it was done the next morning. Our reservations were for the executive level. It was worth the extra money for breakfast in the morning it had something for everyone, snacks and sodas(including water) during the day and cocktail hour at night(although they now offer a cash bar where in the past it was free). We even made it a point to be back to the hotel so we could get a cookie before bed!T hey just installed a new system to get to the executive room floors(8-10) you need to slide your room key in order to push your floor button and it did not always happen on the first try and we took a few rides up and down till we heard the BEEP and knew we were going to our floor.Our rooms were fine and I thought the bed was comfy. Like I said we have been going away for the last ten years and we have slept in some really bad beds.The pool area was clean and although this was a peak break time and the hotel seemed to be busy we never seemed to have a problem getting a bunch of chairs together. It is not like we had to get out there at 6AM. We had breakfast and got out there around 9:30 The water was a bit cool for me but the kids all got in and played around.The beach area was fine. If you are looking for waves dont look here. The beach is great for little ones. Again we never had a problem getting chairs there either. Maybe we would have to walk down the beach. But we could always get a seat.They have a list of activities down by the beach they seem to have lots of things planed for the little ones. I did see a yoga class one day and a bunch of people playing bingo another.They have a volleyball net but it is in the grass( a big disappointment for our group) but like I said it was also very windy so it would not have been fun to play anyway. We never had a problem getting a towel. Sometimes they took your room number and sometimes they did not. I am not sure how they decided what system they were using. They had basketballs that you could sign out.  This trip has been planned since last june. In Jan I saw on the TA forum about a food a beverage credit through go to PR.com I called my travel agent. Our trip fit all of the criteria including the hotel. So we were given a 250.00 FB credit to each of our rooms. That took the sting out of eating at the pool bar for lunch. We just sent the kids each day over to order lunch. We ate 3 lunches and one dinner(at the restaurant near the pool) plus a few cocktails and we each only went over the 250 by 40 dollars. Not bad. One day the dads went to subway and brought it back for us. It also helped that we brought down waters with us from the executive lounge.We took the bus(.50cents) each way exact change per person to old San juan on two evenings and had dinner and a walk about. We did take cabs back. They were ten dollars each cab. I have to mention that the buses do not run like in Cancun you will have to wait up to 20 min. It was deffinaly worth it because we could move all 10 of us for 5.00 compared to the 20 or 30 dollars for the cabs each way We walked into Condado for dinner but we took a cab back.We rented a van from target(not related to the stores) and took a tour of El Yunke and then spent the day at Luguillo beach. The beach was beautiful and you can rent chairs and umbrella right there(5.00 and 10.00 respectively). We booked a snorkle adventure through the tour desk for one day.I would deffintaly reccomend this hotel to a friend and we look foward to visiting Puerto Rico again in the future.
