{"text":"Home away from home... I would like to start by stating that I have been to Paris many times, and found this little treasure of a hotel through America's favorite travel guide, Rick Steve's in his Paris 2007 guidebook. I called to make reservations, and the person on the other end was very fluent in English and very happy to take our reservation. It was the next day that we received an email from Relais-Bosquet thanking us for considering them, and to please let them know if we needed any help with dinner or tours. We accepted their help for dinner, and we were never disappointed. On the contrary, we were blown away. I have to say that as an American, name dropping goes a long way. When we showed up for dinner, and dropped Frederiques name from the hotel, they rolled out the carpet for us. I have to say that has never happened to me ever in Paris. The rooms are bright, spacious and have wonderful windows that open out. We had a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower. There were two PC's in the lobby that had free high speed internet access. We were close to the metro and centrally located. There hotel is located in the quaint Rue Cler district. Just around the corner you are surrounded by bakeries, a fromagerie, a wine store, a market, a fruit market, and a chocolate shop. What more can you ask for? This hotel added to the whole Paris experience, because you could come home at night and ask all of the embarrassing questions without fear. We bought a phone card that had instructions only in French. The wonderful front desk person was so kind as to go through the whole auto-prompting and walked me through it. We will definitely go back to Paris, and the Relais-Bosquet will definitely be a part of our experience. Make sure you ask for Frederique...!!!
