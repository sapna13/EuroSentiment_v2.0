{"text":"Good value for money Stayed in the hotel for 2 nights in mid-April and I have to say, it was very good value for money, if looking at it as a 2-3 star property.The fact that the rooms are somewhat outdated and on the smaller side, our twin room was clean, adequate and quite quiet (5th floor on the back of the house). We had some minor problems with aircon, but it got solved after we called down to the reception.Breakfast is German standard and anything you might ask for in a hotel of this kind. The prices for the minibar were cheap.Staff at the reception were many, very friendly and helpful and they all spoke perfect English. They gave advise on where to go and what to do. Always with a smile on their face.There are also 2 computers in the lobby, however, one of them was not working. Did not bother us though as we were there to see the city, not to search the web.We were able to leave our luggage at the reception after check out and the location near the main train station and the buses to the airport couldn't be better.For a weekend with friends in Frankfurt this hotel is good, however, I wouldn't book a romantic weekend here. The area can be a bit noisy due to heavy traffic.Tips: Ask for a room high up, on the back of the house, it seemed less noisy there. Don't miss the Persian restaurant Hafez next door - amazing food!
