{"text":"Modern sexy hotel This hotel is amazing, from the moment you walk into the dark and elegant reception you are made to feel very special. The rooms are dark and sexy using dark woods and orange, most rooms seem to have a round feature wall inside them which appears to be the bathroom of the room next door, very different and very cool. The room has all the gadgets a boy could wish for, wall mounted 32lcd with free filmson demand and internet, a complex lighting arrangment that allows you to turn off and dim all the lights in the room with a chrome panel on the bedside tables. The shower in the bathroom is a huge walk in affiar with the shower head being about 30cm in diameter dropping out of the celing. What is also strange is the building seems square on the outside but the area around the rooms make you feel like you are in a vertical tunnel, but not in a bad way in a very cool way. We never tried the restuarant so cant really comment on that, it was the menu that put us off with pigs trotters and BrainSalad!The main parts of Barcelona are all in an easy walk of around 10 mins the port is about 20mins. The only problems we had during our stay where to do with the new swanky TV system , we had to change rooms after first checking, in as the tv would not turn on and then in our other room we had a few problems accessing some of the films. But im sure these where just the intail teething problems and have probably been sorted out already. ","annotations":[]}
