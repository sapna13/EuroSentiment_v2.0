{"text":"Great location, great price I spent three nights at the Charlesmark and agree with many of the previous reviewers: the location and price can't be beat.The main purpose of my trip to Boston was shopping, and the location of the Charlesmark in the Back Bay neighborhood, just a block off Newbury and close to Copley Place, was ideal. Additionally, the T stop just down the street made getting around the rest of the city very easy. The price was also at least $100 cheaper than anything else I was able to find in the neighborhood.Other reviewers have raved about the friendly and attentive staff, but unfortunately this was not my experience. I arrived a couple hours before the check-in time, and my room was not yet ready, which I was expecting. I think the guy manning the desk was the same another review described as indifferent, and I agree; he wasn't exactly rude, but he also wasn't very helpful. Anyway, when I came back later close to the official check-in time, my room was ready, and my bags had already been brought up. By then, someone new was at the desk to actually check me in, and she was much more pleasant but still did not give me any information about the room, hotel, etc. For example, had I not read here that breakfast was provided in the lobby, I never would have known, as she didn't tell me and nothing in the Guest Information in the room mentioned it (and it was served in the upper lobby, tucked away from the elevator and flow of traffic). I overheard another guest checking in later during my stay, and she got a full spiel about breakfast, internet, etc. Also, during my four-day stay, I could hardly get anyone at the desk to look up, much less say hello, during my various comings and goings.I had a room on the sixth floor, and the view out the big windows was actually quite nice. The room was quite small by American standards but perfect for my needs (and not unexpected after reading previous reviews here). The DirectTV and radio were nice, as was the complimentary water. Overall, though, the room I had could use some TLC. The carpet in the bedroom was loose along one wall, especially outside the bathroom door, and caused me to catch my toe a time or two. A light bulb was out in the bathroom (and was not replaced during my stay), and a dial on the wall that I assume was volume control for the sound system didn't work. The room had a cordless phone, but the battery in the handset needed replacement, meaning all calls had to be quick to avoid being cut off when the battery died. The hotel also had free wireless internet access, but the signal was so weak in my room that it was essentially useless. And oddly, the room had a folding chair (not sure why) in the closet\/cupboard but no suitcase stand, which would have been much more convenient than the floor.Other small things would really make a big difference: replace the thin blanket and bedspread with a nice duvet. Get rid of the VCR (who needs it when there's DirectTV?), and replace the old TV with an LCD on a swing arm to make the awkwardly high position more easy to adjust and view. Add a programmable thermostat so that the fan isn't constantly running. Keep a better eye on the breakfast room so that things are well stocked and the tables aren't dirty and full of trash.Overall, the hotel was good but not great. It really is so close to being fantastic that the small things (and unfortunately there were many that really added up) took away from what could have been a perfect experience. I would definitely consider returning, though, mostly because of the unbeatable location and price.
