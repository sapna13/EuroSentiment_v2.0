{"text":"Nice Hotel Stayed at the the Langham this past March. Had booked a club room, got upgraded to a club suite upon arrival. Very nice, wonderful view, a bottle of champaigne and chocolates were waiting as we were celebrating a special ocassion, on the floor check-in\/out, great plasma TVs (3) in the suite, free drinks 6-8 PM I believe, free breakfast, great omelettes, just nice. The location is fascinating to say the least, in old Hong Kong. Very colorful, have to see the street market by the hotel, most everything is alive, quite an experience. As for the location, we thought it was a little far from the main attractions, since most of the action, night life, etc. is in the harbor section. However, we crisscrossed the city one day in taxis for just about $20US. Which brings me to a great experience we had with a taxi driver. We hailed it to go from the jade market to a buddist temple (we had all the destinations written in chinese by hotel staff since taxi drivers speak very little English). When pointing to the driver where we wanted to go, he saw the name and location of the hotel we were staying at thinking we wanted to go there. Ended-up leaving my eye glasses in the car, case and all. I thought for sure I'll never see them again. Wouldn't you know, the driver remembered us (we were the only westerners in that particular temple) and the hotel we were staying, and returned them when his shift was over in late afternoon. Unbelievable. Security at the hotel is pretty tight, my wife smokes, only allowed outside the hotel, and whenever she went for a cigarrette in front of the hotel she'd be assigned a door man to watch over her, and the same for other guests who went outside for a smoke. It makes you wonder about the general safety of the area. However we walked around, day time, without incident. All-in-all, had a great time in Hong Kong and at the Lamgham.
