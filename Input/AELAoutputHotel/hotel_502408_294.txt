{"text":"Mixed but overall good value I stayed at the Affinia 50 the first week in January. The room was booked through Hotels.com and had rates ranging between $140 and $190 during my stay. I spent one weekend night at a sister property - The Benjamin - which may be why I was a bit disappointed in my experience at Affinia 50. Don't get me wrong, overall it's a very nice hotel and a good value for the money. The location can't be beat at 50th and Third- close to the subway, walkable to shopping and museums and the midtown business area. I arrived around 1pm (2 hours before the 3pm check-in). The hotel was obviously busy, but I asked if I could check in early and the person at the reception told me to go up to their 2nd floor lounge (nice place to to hang out, have breakfast or a cocktail) to wait and they would get me when a room was ready. I was there over an hour (much longer than I would have expected when I was there waiting...). If one of the managers hadn't come by and noticed I was still there, I'm not sure how long I would have been kept waiting. When I finally got into my room I was pleasantly surprised by the large (by NYC standards) room with its modern updates. The room faced out to the corner of 50th and 3rd but was surprisingly quiet. With the exception of the initial front desk experience, service at the hotel is friendly, quick and professional. I appreciated the in-room safe and the small refrigerator.Overall I would recommend the hotel as a very good value for the money and a nice change from large chain hotels.
