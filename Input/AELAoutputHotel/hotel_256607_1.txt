{"text":"Great location, tiny room Stayed two nights on a business trip, selected for convenience to the venue. My experience wasn't as bad as some of the caustic reviews I saw before writing this. A reasonable place to stay in an interesting part of the city, but I'd avoid the breakfast if my experience is typical.Check in (10pm) was satisfactory, as was check out, although it was a pity I couldn't get anything in the bar or restaurant - even a coffee - when I arrived.Room was very small by Australian standards, I have seen similarly small rooms in Sydney, comparable to rooms I've stayed in in New York and Europe, but I've also seen plenty bigger rooms also. Anyway it was clean and the fittings were of good standard and condition. Had a reasonable sized bathroom. The fire escape plan of the hotel indicated that there were larger rooms in the corners of the floor I stayed in, but they weren't much larger.Hotel is located in a busy area with a lot of traffic (cnr Pier and Harbour Streets) but I didn't have any problems with noise. The room had a smallish window and ordinary view of Entertainment Centre (large indoor concert venue) over the road. On the other side would be better views over Darling Harbour.Location is good for tourists, right beside the Darling Harbour precinct adjacent to the Chinese Garden, Chinatown on the other side, Monorail station diagonally opposite and tram stop only about 200m away. This is a more convenient location to the south side of the city than other hotels in Pyrmont, although you get better views from the latter (and pay for the privelege)Breakfast was a disappointment. A queue at check in, which felt more like an airport experience than a restaurant one when the check in person seemed more interested in the computer than the diners. It was uncrowded - I'm not surprised - and I got a window with a nice view over the Chinese Garden across the road. Breakfast Buffet was a limited selection of predictable but lukewarm dishes, and it came at an excessive price. Needless to say I only ate breakfast once as you can get better and cheaper from any number of places nearby.
