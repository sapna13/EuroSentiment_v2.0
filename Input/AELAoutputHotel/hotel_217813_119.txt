{"text":"Good Location,nice,clean hotel Just returned from our 2nd trip in as many years to wonderful,diverse San Francisco. Can not wait to plan another trip to my favorite city in the country! Stayed at Holiday Inn Express Fisherman's Wharf.We like staying in the wharf area so chose this hotel . The hotel is located close to anything you need. Stores, shops,food, the wharf, Ghiradelli, the Cannery. great area. The hotel was very clean. plenty of room to move around in our room, and very helpful friendly staff. We had requested a refridge in the room (daughter's dietary needs). When we got checked in and arrived in the room there wasn't a fridge. Called the front desk and within minutes one was delivered to the room. Have only positive comments concerning the staff and front desk.Back to the room, the beds were comfortable, everything looked fairly new and nice bath products left every day.The maid service was good. Funny thing not once~never ,saw a maid, maids cart or any sign of them our entire stay. Rooms had always been cleaned by the time we returned from our days excursions.The only negative I can think of is there was absolutlely no view from our room. It was an inner quiet room as we requested, but our only view wasa wall of other rooms. Maybe if we stayed on the highest floor (4 I think) may have had a view. The street side rooms may have a view, but they are very noisy with traffic. Wasn't a huge deal as we use the room only for cleaning up and sleeping. Just compared to a different hotel we stayed previous vacation. Watched Alcatraz, the water every morning with my coffee..So, probably unfair to compare. The free cont. breakfast was adequate.If you want fresh, cooked to order breakfast, there are several places within steps of the hotel.I feel if it's free nobody has a right to complain.All in all I feel for the price this was the best deal we could have found. Have no complaints about the hotel itself or the staff. We had a great time.
