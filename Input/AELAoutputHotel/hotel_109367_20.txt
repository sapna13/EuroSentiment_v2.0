{"text":"Just what we needed We stayed one night in Dallas and found that the Marriott Suites was a great choice! It is located right off the freeway and is convenient to downtown Dallas. We went to the Faith Hill and Tim McGraw concert in the American Airlines Arena and the hotel was only a 5 minute drive...very convenient!! The hotel lobby was decorated very modern and colorful! There is a restaurant and bar located in the hotel...we didn't eat there because we were in a hurry to get to the concert, but it smelled really good! The front desk employees were very friendly, easy check-in and check-out. The hotel room was very spacious! The bedroom was separated by french doors from the living room. The room had a mini fridge, coffee maker, and bar sink (but no mini bar supplies...just bottles of water). We did not spend much time at the hotel, but we slept very well and woke up to a paper outside our door! The bed was very comfortable and it was a quite room (we faced the backside of the building and had a night view of Dallas lights, the front faces the freeway)! It was clean as well!! There is no fee to park your vehicle, but there are signs posted everywhere to lock your car and hide your valuables. It did not seem like it was located in a shady area, but I guess it was just a reminder to take precaution. We would stay at this hotel in the future!
