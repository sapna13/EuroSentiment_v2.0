{"text":"Good Enough Discounted. Next review (see Carimar, Holland House, Grand Case)Well, Ritz-Carlton ummm it has a beautiful lobby with a lot of good property amenities best of all it has a GYM AND SPA and thank goodness we didn't have to pay extra for the gym but at $400\/night I guess a gym pass is expected. The beach was okay but everyone seems to enjoy the pool a great deal. This hotel is fabulous at a discounted price it is worth exactly half the price I would only go back at $200\/night and if they assured me that my do not disturbed sign would be respected. I DISLIKED EL CONQUISTADOR and Ritz might be the best accommodations in San Juan and there lies the trap. The atmosphere did scream vacation with (Coqu√à√¨√ú - little frog) singing to you at the front of the hotel (I believe it is a recording) but nice. A few restaurants, concierge, high tea, and the spa helps to make your stay enjoyable. The room was spacious but best of all THE BATHROOM WAS LOVELY. I like certain basic amenities and usually won't stay at a hotel if they don't have them and the Ritz did:1. Pull out wall mirror in bathroom2. Big spacious marble counter tops for all my jewelry, perfumes, jels, lotions and potions (smile) makeup etc.....3. Shelf space in the shower and a shower line to hang towels and undies to dry.4. Spacious bathroom with beautiful tiles.5. Toilet separate (with a phone)7. BATHROOM SCALE8. Toiletries (I bring my own but Ritz was one of the two I actually would recommend for use). (Hilton's Resource spa)One BIG PEEV:Cleaning crew kept coming into my room even though I had a do not disturb sign. I usually have my things laid out just right and I don't like folks messing with that but some how my sign would disappear and in they would come, luckily I was in the room every time and sent them packing (smile). Spoke with security 5 different times (head of security even came to my room) and they would assure me but house keeping would still come in. They tried to say there might be some kids playfully removing the sign but I never saw or heard any children.They never offered any gift of apology for all the times it happened. I am glad I was there each time (at least that I was aware of) and none of my jewelry came up missing.
