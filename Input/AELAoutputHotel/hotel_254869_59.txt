{"text":"Enjoyable stay at the Amrey We have just returned from 4 nights stay in the Amrey Diagonal. The hotel certainly lived up to our expectations. We found the reviews of other positive contributors to be accurate. The hotel is modern and minimalistic. If you want chandeliers, armchairs, sofas and libraries, then the amrey is not for you. We enjoyed coming back each evening to a very clean and comfortable room. Our bed linen was changed twice in the 4 nights and we had clean towels provided daily. Our room was on the 10th floor and although overlooking the Avinguda Diagonal, noise was not a problem and we always had an excellent nights sleep. The breakfast was a great foundation for a long days sightseeing!We purchased a two day Bus Turistic pass (23 Euros each). This was an absolute life saver to aching, tired feet! It is a great way to see the city and I would recommend it.We used the train and metro from Barcelona airport to get to the hotel however we would not use this method again as we found it difficult hauling luggage up and down stairs in the metro and also negoiating the train changes.We used the air coach on the return journey to the airport and found it much easier. The following information may be helpful to you if you wish to choose this form of transport:You will find the air coach waiting just outside the airport terminal (cost is 3 euros 90). This will take you directly into the city centre to PL Catalunya. From the city centre you walk up the Passeig de Gracia, crossing two roads. When you see the single fountain you will know you are almost there. Look out for a huge Zara shop on your right on the corner. Walk down the Gran via de les Cortes Catalanes (a short distance). You will have to cross the road to get to the bus stop (the bus will approach you from your left). It is a NO. 7 bus. Your journey will take approx 15\/20 mins. A good landmark to look out for as you approach the hotel is the Torre Agbar (a skyscraper circular glass building) on your right hand side. Don't get off the bus at the stop just past this, but wait until the next one which is just 10 yards from the Amrey. The bus fare is 1 euro 25 each.We purchased a T10 ticket at the airport. This is the most economical way to use the buses. These tickets can also be purchased at metro stations.We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Barcelona and would recommend the Amrey Diagonal to anyone. We felt the location of the hotel to be excellent in that you could enjoy a nice walk down Rambla Pou to the Bogatell Beach (for us it was a nice 30 minute stroll) and you were also beside the bus stop to hop on the bus to see the city sites.I hope my ramblings will be of some help to someone!!
