{"text":"Fantastic My wife and I stayed at Amankila for two blissful weeks during our honeymoon earlier this month. It was quite easily the most relaxing, professional and charming hotel I have ever experienced in any part of the world. The location is beautiful, and the architecture of the hotel itself is superb. With spaced out accommodation, four swimming pools to choose from (not including those rooms with private pools), you never feel that you are on top of the other guests. The staff are always ready, willing and able to assist at any time, and as has been noted in these other reviews their ability to make the stay more pleasurable is second to none. I have travelled on Bali before, and the island is becoming ever more crowded with tourists and locals catering for the tourist trade. But Amankila is still a reminder of the quiet, laid back island I remember from 15 years ago, with all the local charm of the staff to match my memories of old Bali. With objectivity in mind, I have tried to find some negative points to my stay that I can address. Yes, the private beach is black sand, but I think it is actually very beautiful and there was never more than three other guests on this long, clean strip. There are some ships moored in the horizon, but it is the Lombok Strait...of course they will be there. Other than that, there is nothing I can think to discuss.I can say with absolutely no hesitation that I will be returning to this hotel in the near future and recommend it to the highest degree.
