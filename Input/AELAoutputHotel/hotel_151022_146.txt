{"text":"loved it! My family and I (ages 13, 20, 40, 38 ) stayed at Natura EcoResort  Spa, and I must say, after reading these reviews i was a little nervous! Surprisingly, it was WONDERFUL! I would highly reccommend it! It was absolutely beautiful! When we arrived, check out was smooth, the rooms clean and enjoyable, and the staff very nice and inviting. During our 7 day stay, I don't think we walked past a staff member once without them saying hola or buenas dias. We were really worried about the food since so many of the reviews were really bad. We actually preferred the buffet, which was very attractive and we could all choose something we liked (there were 2 buffets, the one near the beach was not as nice as the one near the lobby). There was quite a selection of food, my faves were fruit, the breads and dessert! ...and the drinks were not watered down! The three ala carte restaurants were good too but we preffered the buffet... since our options were limited. The beach was spectacular... a tiny bit of seaweed but that did not stop us from snorkeling! (This depends on the time of year, and it cleared in a few days). The nightly entertainment was funny ( celebrity impressions\/ performances\/ couples trivia and dancing). The animacion crew was always recruiting everyone to join games, bingo, ping pong and other contests... you will love the CHOCOLATE dance! I do not have anything bad to say other than we did have to get up early and reserve the beach chairs\/ cabanas at 6 am. I would def. reccommend this resort, we had a blast!* we were surprised at the prices! for such a poor country they were sure high! (haggle, haggle, haggle! at the shops not the lobby store )*a little spanish goes a long way* tipping is greatly appreciated (even though it may be all inclusive, these people earn about $150 US dollars\/ month)* if you are there thru apple vacations, attend the 1st meeting, you find much useful info, our apple advisor, Shakira was very helpful.*feed the fish and the flamingos after breakfast :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":807,"mention":"breads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":801},{"endOffset":1365,"mention":"CHOCOLATE","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1356}]}
