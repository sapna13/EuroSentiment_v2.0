{"text":"Conveniently located. I feel a bit mean only giving it a 2 rating but i was quite disappointed. We had a room on the side of the building, across the street from some houses. A typical set up for a city hotel I am sure.The room was...small. It was pretty well impossible not to trip over your bag on the way to the miniscule bathroom. You wouldn't want to be clostrophobic!The bed was fairly comfortable but the pillows were ROCK hard.Bring your own shampoo, etc. as there are NO bathroom complimentaries. Only one towel per person and no floor matt. There is a tea\/coffee service but no raw sugar. Later that night as the cold settled in I went downstairs to ask for another blanket. The staff were amused at my request . The look they gave each other seemed to say we're not one of those kinds of hotels. I was instead instructed to use the air conditioning which was ridiculous as I wouldn't like to sleep with it on all night. We piled our winter coats on the bed for warmth instead.The 'sleeping' part of the hotel is attached to the original Sullivans Hotel (pub section). We went there for dinner and were VERY HAPPY! The service was absolutely fantastic, the food was fresh and tasty AND reasonably priced (we had the bean nachos and the salt and pepper squid which came with a yummy salad). One thing that MUST be said about the Sullivans hotel is that it is in an EXCELLENT location. You can't beat it for the price (though not cheap, fairly cheap for Sydney). The rooms are clean and it is great not to have to share a bathroom.Go to the Sullivans hotel for dinner and a beer and a city-sleep ;) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":429,"mention":"ROCK","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rock_candy"],"startOffset":425},{"endOffset":1237,"mention":"nachos","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nachos"],"startOffset":1231},{"endOffset":1297,"mention":"salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":1292}]}
