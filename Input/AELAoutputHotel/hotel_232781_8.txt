{"text":"Very nice for a 3 star Just returned from a very pleasant 4 night stay at the Europark. I was travelling solo, but opted to pay extra for a double room, rather than a single. I requested a room with balcony at the front which is exactly what I got. Check in was friendly and quick. The hotel was recently refurbished and is wearing very well. The rooms are very trendy and functional. The airconditioning is powerful, and my bathroom was great, all in the black  white theme. No bathtub, but large shower with sliding doors. The room had wooden flooring and was kept immaculately clean by the maids.The pool is, as other people have pointed out, only waist deep. No swimming, but still great to cool off. At the moment there are building works next door, it looks like this will be another part of the hotel. Two out of four days there was drilling  hammering, so bring your Ipod to block this out while lounging by the pool. The noise didn't start early though, so didn't wake me up. The hotel is situated on a busy road, so if you want a quiet room, you might want to ask for a room away from the front.I didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on that. Loads of nice places to eat near the hotel though. The best thing, apart from the styling of the hotel, is it' location. In the Eixample, away from the overly touristy Ramblas. Great arcitecture around every corner. I really enjoyed walking around the Gracia area, lovely restaurants  shops, much more of a local atmosphere.There is a PC with printer in the reception area, good for checking emails, checking in for your flight.The only let down was that they wouldn't let me use the shower at the back of reception. Even though an earlier review stated that they were offered this option. in fact, this remark is what made me decide to book this hotel. A bit petty not to let guest, who have checked out in the morning but don't have a flight until in the evening, use this to freshen up.All in all, a good experience, and great value for money.
