{"text":"Fabulous for families We just returned from a 10-day stay at this hotel and have concluded that we've found our new home-away-from-home. We have been to Oahu about a dozen times pre-children, and now three times with children, and have to say that this property is just about perfect if you're traveling with little ones (our kids are three and six months).The pros: The two-bedroom suite layout is fantastic. The master bedroom was easily big enough for me, my husband, our baby in a Pack N Play, and our son on an inflatable toddler bed. Our au pair and her boyfriend were in the other room, and we actually never felt crowded or that we lacked privacy. There's a full kitchen, including rice cooker, coffeemaker, microwave, full-sized refrigerator and freezer, large oven, garbage disposal, dishwasher, and probably a lot of other things we didn't notice. We ate breakfast, snacks, and about half our dinners in our suite -- it was great! And they just opened a new Safeway in Kapahulu, about a 5-minute drive away, so stocking up was a piece of cake. Lots of space in the living and dining areas! Great for active kids and for letting adults sprawl out. The provided DVD player was a godsend for itchy kids (we brought our own DVDs with us). Location, location, location! Everything is just a short stroll away. The best beach for little kids in Waikiki (Kuhio Beach Park) is literally across the street and features two sheltered lagoons perfect for beginning swimmers. There's a beach, some grassy areas with shade, and a freshwater shower right at the beach for rinsing. Other kid-friendly destinations: the zoo, three short blocks away; the aquarium, which is a little further, but still an easy walk; Kapiolani Park, three blocks away with huge expanses of grassy space for kids to play (and great photo opportunities). For rainy days, the children's Discovery Museum, in Ala Moana park on the other end of Waikiki, is a 15-minute drive.Foodwise, it's a treasure trove in kid-friendly dining. There's a McDonalds adjacent to the hotel, ABC stores on every corner (for snacks, drinks and premade sandwiches), and our favorite hang-out restaurant, Duke's, is a block and a half away. Cheeseburger in Paradise is across the street and Keoni's, a Thai restaurant that has a great traditional (American) breakfast, is a quick walk even with a straggling preschooler. Oh, and one more parental bonus: the hotel has room service! It's pricey, but it beats dragging fussy kids out to dinner.Finally, the International Marketplace is about two blocks away and a great browsing treat for the whole family. The staff! They were exceptional. We couldn't believe how nice, friendly, and helpful everyone was. The guys at the bell desk\/valet stand were just amazing, always ready with a smile, a destination recommendation (we discovered a fabulous locals-only spot for poke thanks to them!), and a quick game of catch with our preschooler. They were responsive to our requests (e.g., more beach towels) and did a great job checking us in and out. TONS of storage! Multiple closets with shelves throughout let us give the kids their own dedicated spaces. Easier for corraling toys! Free DSL. Yippee! Our au pair spent hours IMing her friends and family when she wasn't watching the kids.The cons: Avoid the hotel-provided crib: it's made of metal with a foam mattress, not the firm type of mattress recommended by the AAP. We ended up renting a Pack N Play and some other items from Baby's Away Oahu (babysawayoahu@gmail.com), a company that supplies kid stuff to traveling families. Worth every penny! The hotel pool doesn't really have a shallow end; the minimum height is 3 feet. But it is heated, which is great! Slightly outdated decor, and a couch whose seat cushions kept sliding off. Believe it or not, the twice-daily maid service could get annoying. A few times we forgot to put in the do-not-disturb card, and we had to explain to the housekeepers that they couldn't clean because children were sleeping. But that's obviously a minor problem and the benefits outweigh the negatives! Expensive. But then again, cheaper than booking two separate hotel rooms, for the most part -- and you can't beat the convenience of a suite, plus the many amenities.I could go on about all the great things about this place, but the bottom line is, we loved it and will absolutely be back!
