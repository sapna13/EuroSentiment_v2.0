{"text":"Brilliant Hotel I stayed 3 nights in the Park Hotel from 11th-14th April 2008. The hotel is beautiful and in such a great area of Tokyo. I was blown away by the beauty of Tokyo and the friendliness of the locals. It truely is a city I want to go back again soon as it has so much to offer. More about the hotel.ROOMS:The rooms are small but very functional. The bed was very comfortable and my view of the city through the small window was lovely. The plasma tv, space age toilet give the hotel a very new and clean look.STAFF:Staff are friendly but not the friendliest i've met along my travels. Considering that I found Tokyo people to be the nicest I have ever run into this is only a small let down for the hotel.FACILITIES:The facilities are second to none in the hotel. The free internet room beside reception to the surrounding area where restaurants, shops etc very accessible.It takes a while to get used to the 'madness' of Tokyo but just embrace it. The hotel is situated in the Shiodome area which is the 'Docklands' area of most cities where new high rise skyscappers sit in a very clean, safe area near the bay. I loved it and felt totally safe and believe me that includes being lost at 7am in the morning after too many beers. The locals go out of their way to help. I got lost so many times and acts of kindness will never be forgotten.I thing to remember if you are an international traveller. My visa card would only let me withdraw cash at Citibank ATM machines. It was a bit fustrating as there are only about 10 in the city. The 7-11 store ATM's did not work for me. So please have some cash with you before you go and then use the Citibank ATM's if all others fail.Overall Tokyo has a big heart and the nightlife and food and people all add up to an experience i wasn't expecting. wow!!!!
