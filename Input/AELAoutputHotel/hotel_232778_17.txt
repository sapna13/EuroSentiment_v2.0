{"text":"Remember !! 2 Euro Coins for Luggage Storage Each Time Y ou Open It This was Great. I mean Great!!!!! Hotel right on the Las Ramblas. Our Room was in the front. had a small Romeo and Juliet balcony . Doors swung open and you could step out see everything all day and all night long. It was soooo cool. It was not noisy. Just the sound s of people outside cleaning, laughter and light city sounds. Kind of quiet actually.The hotel like the area has character and was not built in 2008, but probably in the 1940's or earlier. Therefore, It was not new and it was not large. It is nestled among the buildings and businesses that are common to most older areas around the world. There is something for everybody. ---and everybody was there. If you arrive early you can store your luggage in locked cabinets. However, if you have to return to open them you have to pay all over again. 2 Euros each time. So bring a lot of 2 euro coins just in case the desk runs out.The people at the desk, restaurant and cleaning staff are very kind . Speak slowly. they did not always understand what was said spoken quickly.The hotel is safe and clean. Hotel Arc La Rambla has character and offers the basic things that new large hotels have only on a small scale. It's okay for kids to stay. It's just not enough space for them to run wild. Everything is accessible from the hotel. tours can be booked etc. Mcdonalds , Burger King and high end eating and high end shopping(Plaza Catalonia) very close by.This is a diamond in the rough if there ever was one. I thought it was going to be bad or something. It was fabulous for the price and the experience as as tourist of old downtown Barcelona. I am going back there on my next trip to Barcelona.
