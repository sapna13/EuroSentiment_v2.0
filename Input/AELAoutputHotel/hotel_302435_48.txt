{"text":"As everyone says - it's great! My family and I stayed at the Imperial Hotel for two nights. We stayed at the Snoopy Heartful Stay Suite, which was a suite based on Snoopy, the World Famous Beagle who appears in the Peanuts comics. Once you went inside, there was a very cute Snoopy interior mat. There was a sofa, and two armchairs beside it. On one armchair, was the biggest Snoopy stuffed animal I had ever seen! It was so big it would suffocate a baby if he slept with it. On the table were two tote bags with gifts inside. It was a tiny cheese plate and a mug cup! There were also two coupons for Snoopy pancakes at the Eureka Restaurant - 10% off! We never got to using them because we were so busy in Tokyo - shopping, and all that stuff. The beds were very comfortable and I got a very much needed sleep. The blankets had Snoopy, Charlie Brown, and Woodstock carefully embroidered. On each of our two beds was a Snoopy and Charlie Brown cushion. In the bathroom, there was a Snoopy hairdryer! And beautiful Snoopy bathrobes and towels. Now, besides the Snoopy suite which excited us so much, the dining here is wonderful. The buffet (or viking) is wonderful. Be sure to try their ham there, if possible. It's wonderful! If you get the half grapefruit, it's carefully cut so that it is easy to spoon out each piece. The value is well worth it. It's kind of pricey, but you get what you pay for. The service here is extreme!!!!! Everyone treats you like royalty, and like you are some celebrity. Overall, it was an awesome stay, my family loved it, and I highly recommend it!!!!
