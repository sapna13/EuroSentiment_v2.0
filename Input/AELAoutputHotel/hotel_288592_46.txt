{"text":"Great in many things, but still having problems My wife and I stayed here for two nights for a business meeting being held at this hotel. Other reviewers have given details I won't repeat here. Definately a luxury hotel with beautiful rooms and attentive service. Every employee we encountered gave us a smile and a greeting. BUT, there were a couple of areas that still need work. First, the list of hotel ammenities we saw in the on-line descriptions said free wireless internet. Not true. In the room internet (either wireless or Ethernet) cost $14.95\/24hours. There was a provision to enter a username and password if the business entity that was holding their meeting there provided one. We tried the code that our business was given. We always got a message that the account was not activated when we tried it. In spite of reporting this problem, it never got fixed in the 2 days we stayed there - had to pay the $14.95 anyway. Was also told that Wifi internet was free in the meeting rooms on the 3rd floor. We never were able to connect there - always got a message that the service was blocked. Finally the organizer of the business meeting told us that they had lots of problems with that side of the hotel operations. The rooms were not set-up as requested and the materials that were shipped in advance to the hotel were not in the meeting room at the start of the meeting, but there were 5 hotel employees there to greet them! Bottom line - a great place to stay if you can afford it AND realize that you have to specifically ask for everything you want them to do for you. ","annotations":[]}
