{"text":"Loved it!! I'm writing this review late, as I stayed there in April for a wedding!! I felt compelled to write a review because of all the negative ones, which I personally don't understand! I loved absolutely everything about it!!Flight was long and tiring but worth every minute of it!!! Finding our bus was easy, and the workers took our luggage for us. They do expect a tip though, so just be aware!!! On our bus the guys were very friendly and checked us in and explained about the resort quite thoroughly!! The resort is huge, but that is what I loved about it!! We arrived at night so basically we went to bed as soon as we arrived at our villa.We stayed at the Royal Golden and I loved it!! Our room was spacious, and very well cleaned!! The maid was very friendly and always stocked our fridge with extra beer, pop, and water. The room doesn't come with an iron, but I found room service to quite efficient and got one right away. Well air conditioned.People complained how big the resort is but I thought it was great! I enjoyed walking through the grounds and taking in the beauty of the grounds. They were very well kept, clean, and absolutley beautiful. Plenty of shade everywhere. There is a tram that can take you around the resort if you don't feel like walking so I fail to see the big issue. I personally didn't notice the exhaust fumes, but if there was any it was very little. Nothing to complain about.The beach was my favorite part. It was gorgeous, with white sand and blue water. They kept the beach spotless, and there was always plenty of places available to lay down. The Pool were very nice to, though not as refreshing as the ocean. Kept very clean, and we really enjoyed the swim up bar. Bartenders were very nice, and made delicious drinks.I reccomend going snorkeling during your stay. We went and enjoyed every minute of it. We got to swim with nurse sharks and sting rays, and then got served drinks on the boat. The staff were incredible!! Lot's of laughter and dancing with this crew. Food at the resort was mainly good. The main buffet was huge and always rather good. We ate at 4 a la carte's and we enjoyed most of them. The brazilian I didn't like at all. The meat was tough and tasted really smoky and service was a bit slower. The BBQ was not bad, meat still a little tough. I loved the Mexican, the staff were amazing and food was excellent. I also really enjoyed the french Paris, very good service and food. The snack bar by the pool was mediocre at best. Pasta always hard, and didn't care for burgers or hot dogs. Stuck to the fruit. There is also a burger place open at night if you out parting, which is pretty good.Night life was very good. We went to the theater 3 times and all three shows were excellent. I especially enjoyed the Micheal Jackson show. There is also a kareoke bar, and a band that plays every night there. There is a casino, drinks aren't free, and a disco club which I really liked going to. Shopping was very good here also. There is a market square located in the resort where I did most of my bardering. There is one further up the beach but I never got the chance to go see it. We also went into town to a canadian owned store to buy souvineres, but it was a bit pricey. Quite interesting to see though.The wedding itself was breathtaking!! Again the staff were awesome,and the reception was very nice.Overall I thought the resort was excellent, and would definitely reccomend it to anybody.
