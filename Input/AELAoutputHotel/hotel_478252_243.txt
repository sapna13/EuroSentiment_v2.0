{"text":"Screwed up from the beginning Feb 8,2008 I will start off by saying,I was not going to be one who was going to find things to cry about, as i was going to have a good time. we were booked to go in Bavaro .But ended up in Punta Cana side. Well to start things off, this is my story.We were a group of eight.We had asked to be all together,Then we asked that 2 couples have a king bed.And 2 other rooms to have 2 beds in each room .We asked not to be on the ground floor,We asked to be near the beach.we did not get what we wanted.First off when we arrived ,the room that was supposed to have 2 beds in each,only had king size beds.We went to complain, and were told to use it for the night and tomorrow they will change it.Well tomorrow came in the morning, and we were told to come back later.We tried to go for breakfast and we were told we did not have the proper bracelet. But our friends were in there eating, which we did not know. Finally back to try and find our rep for signature travel, and at 12:30 she went to try and straighten it out.She did move us,But not with our friends.And Finally at 1:30pm we were on our way to our new room.I guess the frustration got to me, when we were leaving the desk that I was not paying attention and fell into this gully on the side of the sidewalk and the street.I went down so hard that my arm had a blood clot the size of a tennis ball, This is no lie, my foot was swollen on one side and my knee on the other leg was swollen.So off to the Doctors they took me.I was there 1\/2 hour before they looked at me an suggested i go to there hospital about for some anti inflamatory needle.No Ice was giving and they seemed that they did not want to look after me at the clinic on there grounds.May I say that when i was there, there was an lady of 75 years of age who had stitches over her eye and black eye and a cracked rib, She was there for her grandaughters wedding,and fell into one of the gullys also . I decided to go back to our room which we had not moved out of yet and ice it and take anti inflamatory pills.By the time we did get moved it was 3:30. And we were still not with our friends. They were a another building farther away,We also got moved to the end of the resort,Where construction was going on.We were not told this. .The construction started at 7 am and went till 6pm daily.Except Saturday,The day we were leaving.Every 10 minutes a truck would come with sand and every 10 minutes a truck would go out empty .We did have a guard near our building As the construction site was only a few feet away. By the next day, my arm was black and blue from the rist to the elbow,My foot was swollen, and so was the knee.I had to get help getting around from my friends and setting things up for me to manage.I had tried numerous times to get ahold of the signature rep,but she was always somewhere and not in her office.Finally I gave up .My friends had noticed that these drain gullys are very dangerous.Other that this mishap,and not getting what we wanted.The resort itself,is the most beautiful place i,ve been to.It is so clean and friendly .Food was quite good, and if you did not like something there was always something else you can always eat.We had seafood one night, some friends did not like it but it was not a problem, and asked for a steak instead.Japenese food was mouth watering.We did not like the BBQ restaurant.It was just blaah. Upon returning back home , of course we were told that we should of complained louder and stuck to our guns,as to what we were promised.As for the arm it has finally come down to the size of a grape and it is seven weeks later.And Yes I did write to the signature vacation, and have yet to have received a letter showing any wrong doing on there part.I believe this accident would not have happened had we got what we were expecting, as I would not have been in that area.All in all I would say that this, Yes is a 5 star resort. and I would go back in a heartbeat.
