{"text":"I am only telling you what I wish I had known... My boyfriend and I just returned from Excellence Punta Cana. We vacationed there from December 7th to December 16th. There were some quirkiness about the place that made the resort less than perfect but I definitely think it was worth the money. 1. EVERYONE IS OLD. If you are younger than 45, you won't have many people your age to socialize with! My boyfriend is in his forties and was overwhelmed by the number of old people slowly strolling around the resort. We really need to young this place up! 2. The BEDS are HARD. This is the hardest bed I've ever slept on in my LIFE. 3. IT RAINS EVERYDAY. Most times it only rains for 10 minutes or so, but if you love to sun-bathe, you will notice that rain comes out of nowhere. It doesn't get cold, yet I was afraid to fall asleep by the pool or on the beach. Out of 9 days it rained 8. Out of those eight days, it rained all day on one day. I love the rain and find it romantic but when your room hasn't been cleaned yet and you are participating in elementary school rainy day activities, it can be annoying. I was glad it only rained hard one day. 4. Lunch is terrible. The pizza is tolerable. DON'T MISS Toscana for breakfast or you are screwed until 6pm when dinner starts. Room service is not good either. I only liked the Penne and after a while I hated that too. Also, Room Service are the ONLY RUDE PEOPLE on the entire staff, ignore them. Everyone else has the best customer service I have ever experienced.  5. Make friends with Matias at the front desk ext 6032. He is the only person you need to know in Customer Service.  6. Make friends with the party girls and guys at Allegro, the disco. If you are under 45, or feel under 45, go there for fun. If you are jealous-hearted, this is NOT the place for you. The girls and guys are very attractive and very sweet...and they are all flirts by nature. Have fun with them...  7. Housecleaning gets a little lazy, if you are tipping them, call them on it. Don't let them overlook things, they move very fast. Due to the amount of Rain, ants will come. I'd suggest making sure the housecleaning staff sprays for ants.  8. Read tripadvisor's WHAT TO PACK forum. It will make your stay better. Tea tree oil saved my bf who ALWAYS gets bitten by mosquitos. He was only bitten the day he didn't use OFF or bathe with Tea tree oil. A couple of drops of the oil in the bath tub and a thick lotion like Bath and Body Works Body Butter does wonders. Also, bring a few collar shirts and long pants for your man if he is a casual dresser. You don't want him wearing the same thing every night you go out to eat. Also, if you go dancing later, you don't want him dirtying up all of the clothes he needs to wear for the dress code at the restaurants. Also, pack lots of sun dresses and coverups. Bring Sandals that are comfortable to dance in but also dress up your outfit when you go dancing.  9. Learn to say a few things in Spanish. The staff appreciates it and it will get you special favors. A smile doesn't hurt either. 10. Things break in the room, and the cable goes out often. Big deal. For the things that break, like the A\/C and the Jacuzzi Tub, there is 24 hour maintenance and they will fix it before you've finished your drink in the lobby.Everything else not mentioned was wonderful, from the staff to the drinks, Spa, Workout room, grounds. I read EVERY review on excellence before I left. LISTEN TO THEM!!! All of those people are telling the truth. Figure out which things are flukes and which things are consistent among all of the travelers. Don't sweat the small stuff, you are in a third world country!
