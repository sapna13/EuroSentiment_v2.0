{"text":"Great location, excellent service Silken Concordia perhaps isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a luxury accommodation, but definitely worth the three stars and absolutely great value for money. We stayed there for one week in July 2007 (24.-31.7.) with my better half and I have to say that we both loved it. Because there seems to have been some nags about the air conditioning I start by mentioning that it worked like a charm in our room. If anything, it felt almost too effective at times. And the temperature outside was in the 30-degrees-centigrade region the whole week.The service was delightful. We arrived there at 11am and they gave us our room straight away (we hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ requested an early check-in in advance). During the week the staff was very helpful with all our requests and questions. They also communicated quite fluently in English, so there was no language barrier either.Location was also near perfect (for us anyway): Walking distance from Plaza Catalunya, Rambla, Old town, Montju√ã√\u2022√ác, Font Magica, Port Vell etc. And a subway station right across the road to get you to those attractions further away. The neighborhood isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ exactly something you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° call picturesque. I liked staying there though, because wandering in the streets nearby revealed a little bit of the unpolished, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢rue√à√\u2020\u2022?Barcelona that you won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ find in the tourist-heavy areas. Although a tad rough round the edges, it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ by any means an intimidating area to walk around even in the dark. And the hotel itself was newish, well-groomed and clean. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have the breakfast included in our room (luckily, I may add) but gave it one shot. It was in my opinion quite unimaginative and not worth the 12√à√\u2020√ü?person\/day. Ok, it got you full, but for that amount of money you will find much better eateries round the town.This review got a bit long and may sound like an advertisement, but we really didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ find anything negative worth mentioning about the hotel. I would recommend it to anyone! ","annotations":[]}
