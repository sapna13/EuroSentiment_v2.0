{"text":"Great, but not the same This was my second stay at this propert y and although the structure is beautiful and magnificent in its own right. the service the second time around left much to be desired especially after how well me and my fiancee were treated during our initial stay back in february. The difference was clear from the moment we arrived. Our first time there, there was a bell hop ready to help us with our luggage to the front desk and then get us to our rooms in comfort. This time around we were left to fend for ourselves.The evening turn down service is nice but we had a dandy of a time trying to find where the cleaning lady left the pillows (they were hidden behind the curtains). My next complaint was with the concierge, who you would think would be somewhat knowlegeable with the local area but when asked for a good place for an informal brunch type breakfast he was at a loss. They push their restaurant on you and the food is above average but the prices are astronomical and the portions are miniscule. Luckily I found a great place called Murals on 54 that serves a fantastic continental breakfast buffet for around 20 dollars and its just a short walk away at 65 west 54th street. Another peeve was that although there are all these options when you book as to what floor you are on and the bed selection they told us when we got there that they did not guarantee the bed selection (and yes i went directly though the hotel.) So be wary that if you only book one room and plan on having two queens beds between you and your travel mate, guess what you may be spending some time closer than you think. The rooms however are consistenly some of the cleanest around and yes I would gladly stay ath the Palace again, and hope the visit resembles my frist more than my second.
