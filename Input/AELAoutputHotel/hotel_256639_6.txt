{"text":"Loved Our Stay! We recently stayed at the Sir Stamford for three nights and took the Quay lounge package.Our whole experience was absolutely fantastic and I would not hesitate in returning.We booked a package which included a room on the quay floor with access to the quay lounge and the extras that come with it and we were not disappointed.The hotel is of yesteryear in style but not dated and not worn. The carpets in the rooms are fresh and the decor clean. The feel of the hotel is intimate and welcoming- you don't feel like just another numberThe hotel is right across from the gardens, a minute or so to the Opera House and coming out of the hotel turn right, gown down the hill and you're in Circular Quay ready to catch a ferry.Valet parking was a breeze and the helpful staff showed us the facilities of our room upon check in. The room was large with an enormous bathroom- the shower with it;'s own light (only down point of the whole room was a tiny shelf in the shower) double sinks, seperate toilet (ability to shut its door) and bath,Balcony overlooking the back or Circular Quay- double doors- Bliss!The bed was comfortable and we had a pillow menu to choose from.We took advantage of the free pre dinner drinks and canapes in the quay lounge and enjoyed both. Staff members were in attendance but kept their distance enough so we were comfortable.Breakfast was served in the Quay lounge- tables set with white linen, china and cutlery. An attending staff member (who was just lovely) bought out breakfast plates for us featuring fresh juices, fruit salad and cheese or quiche or other delights. We were able to self serve coffee, tea, juice, toast and pastries from the side buffets of the lounge. Then were able to order cooked breakfast (or cereals) from the menu.The best part about this was meals arrived piping hot- as opposed to normal hotel buffets. We dined in the bar one night which has lovely old world charm. The wedges with sweet chilli sauce, guacamole and sour cream were delicious are were the fries and aioli. The cocktails were delicious too.The concierge got us a booking at an acclaimed (though disappointing) restaurant at last minute. The staff were all generally welcoming and kind- each greeting us as we entered and left the hotel.Getting a taxi, or our car from valet never took too long.Our room keys stopped working in the lift twice but the issue was quickly attended to by staff. Our only slightly disappointing experience was breakfast on our last day- a Saturday. We had a different staff member attending who was constantly sniffing throughout our breakfast and who was quite noisy getting cutlery and plates out for other guests (or was she putting them away? not sure) It just hindered the relaxing breakfast experience slightly with clanging and sniffing!I would not hesitate in recommending the hotel- and would definitely take advantage of the quay lounge facilities again.
