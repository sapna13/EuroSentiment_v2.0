{"text":"It was okay We stayed for 6 nights on an award stay in early October. Something was just missing. I stayed at the Conrad Dublin in the recent past and it beat this hotel by a MILLION times. Anyway, the staff seemed generally nice but very mediocre and not necessarily competent. We were upgraded to one of the executive floors as a Diamond Hilton member. You don't get a better room for that...you just get access to the lounge. The lounge was a good deal b\/c there was a pretty good supply of alcohol but the food (breakfast and evening tapas got old quick -- and if that previous poster is correct that they seriously cut back on these in the past two weeks, this is a total bust). The hotel room was nice but small. I liked the hardwood floors and the modern look. Some of the minuses: Front desk refused to break change for two 50EU bills we had (only asked for 20's and 10's) b\/c there were two NBA teams coming in later that night!!! Wow, thanks a bunch for your customer service. Whatever. I also didn't like coming in at night and not seeing ANYONE working in the lobby (they were somewhere in the back) and they also turn off almost all of the lights!!! Heck, doesn't Motel 6 leave the light on? So much for security. Of course they left the lights on the night the NBA teams showed up. Hmpf. There was no free internet access, which I would think they would at least provide for Hilton Honors members (Conrad Dublin does it for EVERYONE!). Luckily, I planned most of the trip beforehand, so I didnt need to find info. on the net. Anyway, the hotel was okay but something was just missing. I wouldn't spend the $ they ask for, and I'd even reconsider spending the Hilton points I used for this hotel. It really is a 3 1\/2 star hotel.
