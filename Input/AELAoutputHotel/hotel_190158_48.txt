{"text":"Great location but a few problems Recently stayed for 5 nights with 2 friends for my husband's 60th. We had stayed before a few years ago so knew the location was great, walking distance to most things we wanted to see and taxis nearby when legs gave out. However it was important to us that we had a king size bed and that Casa Patas (a flamenco house) had been booked for a meal and the show at midnight as a birthday celebration.This was all confirmed by email, so we felt quite relaxed about everything. However, the bed was definitely not a king but standard size. The usually silent older gentleman on reception explained that it was a Spanish King size, yeah right! Strange that the king size bed we had in Barcelona was huge! Just something to be aware of , we ended up changing to a twin room so that we would both get some sleep. Also the booking had not been made but we went there the next day and the nicest waiter organised it all for us, even reserving us a table right by the stage. So it was fine in the end. In fact it was an excellent night aided by several bottles of cava. To be fair, the hotel had also been in touch to book for us but we wanted to be sure.Staff a mixture of very friendly and super-surly. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to make lifelong friendships but it is nice just to be acknowledged when you pass through reception. Best staff were at breakfast which was good with very nice tortilla and good selection. Rooms fine, clean and not too small for a central hotel.Overall would recommend and stay there again as it is just so well positioned and good value. We booked through Venere so nothing to pay until we left.
