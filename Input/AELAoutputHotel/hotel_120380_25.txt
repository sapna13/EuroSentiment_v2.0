{"text":"great location, comfortable, and clean I stayed at the Crest Hotel Suites while attending a conference at the Miami Beach Convention Centre. The location could not be beat. The hotel is a block and a half to the convention centre, same distance to the beach, and a half a block to Lincoln road (great for restaurants and shopping). The location was surprisingly quiet for being so close to a busy street. Just in case of noise, we kept the room fan on at night, which kept the temperature comfortable and muffeled any outside noise there may have been. We heard some hallway noise, but nothing from the rooms beside us (also filled with conference attendees).The hotel itself was very clean (room was cleaned very well everyday, while we were out). The staff were very friendly and accomodating. They called us cabs and gave directions when we needed them. We had a little trouble with the temperature of our shower and they fixed it the same day we told them about it. I stayed in a double studio suite with one of my collegues. It was a perfect set up for us, with full kitchenette, including fridge, stove, microwave, dishes, and coffee maker (bring your own coffee). There was a livingroom area divided from a sleeping area, and a typical hotel bathroom. Another collegue had a regular room, that was very small, with a tiny bathroom. Again, she was happy there on her own, but would have found it cramped if she had shared the room. The rooms have recently been updated and beds were very comfortable. There are blankets in the wardrobe. There was free internet access in the Lobby. We were very happy to have stayed at the Crest Hotel Suites and would highly recommend it to people wanting to be close to the convention centre or Licoln Road.
