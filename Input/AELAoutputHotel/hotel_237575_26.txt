{"text":"Nothing Bad 10 of us arrived in Amsterdam for two 50th's. Hotel was booked on-line using previous references on Trip Advisor. Hotel was 5 minutes from Centraal Station and was ready for us when we arrived. Work over the canal is only weekdays and starts at 8.00am with pile driving which can be noisy.Very near to Red Light District (5 mins), Dam Square (10-15 mins) and Van Gogh\/Anne Frank musuems (20 mins). Had a meal in the hotel restaurant one night and the steaks, pork fillet and rack of lamb was excellent. Monk fish and garlic gamba prawns were nothing special but the waiter Petr was excellent.Did not meet any rude receptionists - all we spoke to were excellent and COR was very helpful. Found lift to be OK but agree stairs were very steep - but that is all over Amsterdam.Stayed in rooms 219,220,221, 108 etc. and found them all to be of generous size. Did not find out about the annex.Bar was OK and stayed open to 3.00 am - no trouble on closing early as in earlier reports. Not the cheapest though but not the most expensive either. Found the evening bartender (Volker) a bit abrupt at times and did not like opening another bottle of wine and was found dodgy on measures. Daytime lady bartender( poss Judi) was excellent.Due to central location near bars and Red Light district can be noisy with groups singing as they are walking past up unyil 5 O'Clock in the morning.Lots of sports bars nearby so don't worry about missing any sports events on Sky.Watch out for the bikes! - you sometimes find yourself walking down a bike lane without realising it.Visit the Sea Palace floating Chinese restaurant in the harbour - not cheap but well worth a special experience.If you want to travel on the canal's buy a 24 hour canal pass to all four routes which lasts until midday next day.
