{"text":"Not too bad, maybe bring an air freshener There are a few issues with this hotel, but overall we were satisfied and had a good stay. We stayed here for 4 nights in August and it suited our needs just fine.Beds: comfortable, we slept well. Bedding seemed a bit old.Room: very spacious- we had 2 queen beds and a desk with a chair. It was good to have the extra room as we had a dog and baby with us. It was quiet- we didn't hear any noise from inside or outside the hotel.Cleanliness: needs some improvement here. There were some hairs on the bathroom floor, and they weren't mine.Air conditioning: worked okay, there were 2 speeds. The windows don't open. We didn't have a balcony but that might be something to ask for.Breakfast: pastries, muffins, yogurt, make your own waffles- it was great to have a good breakfast each morning to start the day.Parking: 10 spots above ground, the rest is underground and around the back through an alley. It was tight but we have a truck with a canopy and we managed to get a space everytime. We saw SUV's parked underground, and even a Hummer (taking up 2 spots, grrr). You do need some good parking skills though.Location: Great! We walked everywhere. The area is not the nicest, with parking lots and some construction around, but we were never afraid. If you want to pay more you can stay more in the heart of downtown. There is a Whole Foods nearby. A great place to grab some food if you don't feel like eating out. There is a fridge and microwave in the room that we used quite a bit. Internet: One computer in lobby. We used it to print out some directions and didn't have to wait long to use it.Dog friendly: Dogs were welcome, no extra charge. Our dog seemed to like the room okay. There is a park nearby (Denny Park) where we took her to pee. There were homeless people in the park, but they never bothered us. The hotel is a bit old, so there are some issues. The elevator wasn't that bad, as others have said, it's just a bit noisy. Yes, there was a strange smell in our room. I couldn't quite place it, or find where it was coming from. It kind of bothered me, but was not a huge deal. An air freshener would have taken care of it. The TV remote did not work, but a call to the front desk fixed that. It was a bit hard to open our door with our keycards. We had to swipe them a few times, then had to get it fixed at the front desk.We chose this hotel because we wanted to stay in downtown Seattle but didn't want to pay too much. It still seemed a bit expensive, but considering we got free parking, free breakfast, and our dog stayed free, it was not too bad. If you don't have a dog and don't have to worry about parking, maybe consider a nicer place.
