{"text":"Very nice place, really Caribbean! We've been twice times to Barcelo Bavaro Beach Resort. Every time I am reading people are rude, the staff, and the Europeans are rude... Would it not be nice and honest if you look at yourself and think in what way you are acting and how you behave? Think about that please. Don't you ever drop something on the ground, thinking they will throw it away\/clean it, they get paid for it, reserving chairs at the pool or at the beach because you want to have a nice place in the shade, viewing the sea? Looking not nice, because you've a bad day\/hangover of too much alcohol the night before? And because of that, puking in the pool? We've seen it happen and did feel bad about it.A lot of tourists tell you to tipp the maid, the waiters and so on... But please also think of the people who are gardening for you, in the heat of the sun whole day, 6 days a week. With one or two dollars or a bottle of water, they are very happy wiht it. And also the man on the train(s), they don't get anything except their salary. Most of the time they are forgotten by the tourists. One man was writing about the wet slippery and often hot tiles. So sorry, but I must laugh about that. If you walk around and they don't clean everything, than people complain. The tiles are too hot? Tip: wear open shoes (flipflops) so your feet don't get burned!All in all, we like the resort very much. We hope to return to BBB in april or may 2008. The shows are fine, the whole complex looks like a small village. The food is good, the staff is behaving normal seeing the circumstances.A lot of the staf get very low paid, around $150,- a month, working 6 days a week, or even more, because most of them collect their free days and go off for 4 days a month to see their family. Can you imagine, working more than 12 ours a day every day?? In that heat. I would not think of it! They don't want to be friends with you. That's reality. All they want is their job, get the money, have some fun with their real friends and family (very important to them!) and have some sleep...... Maybe they want the same things as you expect at your work at home? Why must that be a problem?There are also complaints that the staff cannot or are not willing to speak English. When we speak to them, broken Spanish and in English, they told us that the management don't want them to follow English courses, because than they (the management) have to pay them more salary. I heard it in the Dom.Rep. and also at Brasil (their language there is Portugese). So don't blame the staff, but (most of the time) the European! or American management.I must agree with some other people: we are guests in a 3th world country, so you cannot wish having everything the same as it is in your country. If you want to have that luxury and a more than 100% (fake-smile)service, than go on holiday in your own country or stay at home.The smell in the room: when it is humid and hot, put on the a.c. when you get in the room and if you like, at night. Maybe it will go away if you do so.The resort is old (I think now around 15 years). Because of the heat and the sea, everything gets old in a fast way. As I heard from my travelagency and read from other people on other websites, they are renewing the Beach-part. Maybe later the other sections will be renewed? If you choose this accomodation, don't worry, you will get what you've paid for. It is worth the money.
