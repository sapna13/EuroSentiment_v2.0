{"text":"Great Hotel - Great Location - Great Room My wife and i stayed in the Westin for 3 nights at the end of May.Arrived into Newark and took the bus into the Port Authority bus terminal, this was cheap and easy to do and very very close to the Westin, so was a breeze. We arrived early and the room was not ready, but we expected this and the staff immediately offered to take our bags until 3pm when the room would be ready, we came back about 3:30 and the room was available.What a room! Booked a corner room, we were placed on the 39th floor and had amazing views of the Empire State building along one side and up and down the Hudson on the other. Room was clean and fresh and all the fittings were in perfect working order. nice flat screen TV for when we were relaxing. The only tiny problem we had was our fridge locking itself on our last day, but a quick phonecall to reception had a man at our door in under 5 minutes who fixed this promptly. Check in\/out was quick and easy, the business centre offers free use of the internet for checking in for flights, which was very very useful.When asking for advice from the hotel staff they were all friendly and helpful often finding us a map and often pointing out discounts that are available.We never used the hotel restaurant, as we ate out all the time and looking at the prices i am glad we did.The location is fantastic, very close to the action of Times Square and quite central for all the shopping and sight seeing.In conclusion i would highly recommend a corner room at the Westin, we have already promised ourselves we will stay there when we go back next year (hopefully).
