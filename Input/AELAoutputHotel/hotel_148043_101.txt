{"text":"An Absolute Treasure!! This hotel gets 5 stars from me. You can read all the other reviews to get a fuller picture and also look at their website but I would like to extole their virtues in a somewhat different manner.Service, service, service and always with a smile. From arrival to departure we had 5 days and nights of sheer enjoyment.Front desk, always manned, alert and attentive. Directions and recommendations for restaurants, churches, museum's, etc professionally given. Valets and Porters(who all speak English) quick and attentive and on more than one occasion in the elevators they mentioned that we shouldn't miss the free cheese and wine being held each evening from 6-7pm, which was superb by the way.Rooms, spotlessly clean, authentically Spanish in design(as is the whole Hotel). Maid service, prompt, smiling, efficient and turndown service was also included and found this to be more superior than many other top-rated hotels we have stayed at.Room service was answered quickly and delivered quickly and again, always with a smile. What the hotel website doesn't make abundantly clear is that outside each one of the rooms, you have your own table and chairs, where you can drink, eat and smoke(if you wish)whilst enjoying the fabulous views of their 300 year old nispero fruit tree from Spain and all the other plants, whilst refreshing breezes and great music wafts the senses.On the third floor one finds complimentary tea, coffee, iced water and assorted nuts(24 hours) plus an extensive honour bar and a Library that houses free internet services.As mentioned before, you can read all of this in other reviews..what I want to bring to the traveller who has not visited San Juan or indeed the El Convento is a Hotel that clearly strives to stand out from all the rest and actually achieves this difficult task by offering the kind of atmosphere and service, be it in any of their many outstanding Restaurants or from difficult to simple requests, that sometimes get that scorned Caribbean frowned upon look elsewhere in this part of the world. We have all been there, havent we?I have actually seen Management walk around and talk to the guests, asking how their stay is or was and can they do anything more for them? So if one is able to find a hotel that is fanatical about making sure their guests come first, no matter what and always trying to improve(as nothing runs like clockwork), plus have possibly the best position in all of downtown San Juan, followed by stunning hotel scenery and authentic culture, well one just hopes that one can return in the near future. I know I will.Finally, if you are the sort of person who relishes glitz, gambling, noise and hob-nobbing with people, especially around the usual brash pool, go elsewhere. If you require authentic refined elegance and beauty from another era, backed up with truly outstanding service, you have possibly found a hidden secret and from my point of view one of the most exclusive hotels in the Caribbean.
