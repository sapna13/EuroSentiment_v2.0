{"text":"Perfect Location! We stayed here the weekend before Christmas and had a wondeful night stay. We only had a small overnight bag and so enjoyed the 20 min walk from Victoria station to the hotel. We arrived an hour early but our room was ready for us. Very cheerful reception staff.The room was fairly small (we were offered an upgrade for an extra √ä√£¬¢50 but as we were only staying one night it wasn't necessary), but was full of everything you could possibly need for a comfy stay. Hairdryer, bathrobes, iron, ironing board, tea\/coffee making facilities, mini bar, t.v. safe. The bed was extremely comfortable. They must have many compliments on the bed as there is a catalogue from which you can purchase mattresses and pillows! Great bathroom although the water was only on the verge of being warm and not hot. There was a large choice of food and drink on the room service menu but we stayed clear due to the prices - √ä√£¬¢190 for a bottle of Jack Daniels! We had a pre-theatre meal in Brasserie Roux which is the restaurant attached to the hotel. The food and service was excellent, as was the price. Just √ä√£¬¢20 for a three course meal plus two glasses of wine!We also noticed that we had had a turn down service when we returned from the theatre which was a lovely touch. They had even left a note next to our bed letting us know what tomorrows weather was expected to be! Newspapers were left in a bag outside our room in the morning.The hotel is in a perfect location, just a few minutes walk to the theatres and the shops are even closer so no need for using public transport or taxis.We didn't have breakfast in the hotel - √ä√£¬¢21 extra. Instead we went to a lovely cafe just to the right of the hotel called apostrophe, definitely recommend it for coffee and pain au chocolate!We booked through the hotel and payed √ä√£¬¢120 for a classic room. We had this low price as it was paid in advance and non refundable if we cancelled. Will definitely be returning to this hotel again!
