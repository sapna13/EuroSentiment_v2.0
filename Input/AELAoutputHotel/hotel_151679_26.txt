{"text":"Cute Inn My best friend and I stayed at Wind Chimes Inn during an impromptu vacation. We decided on Puerto Rico since we hadn't visited that island yet. (We travel through the caribbean quite a bit). We needed somewhere clean, near to the beach, with good staff and as inexpensive as possible. Wind Chimes was pretty good in all these areas. The room we stayed in was about the size of a standard bedroom, located upstairs w King Size bed and a bathroom. The water pressure wasn't that great, i guess because we were upstairs, and the hot water was intermittent. That wasn't a problem for us because this is a pretty standard situation in the caribbean unless you're in a big hotel. Bathroom was fairly clean, and our towels and linens were changed daily. Cable TV available in the room, and my friend picked up the internet on her laptop. The swimming pool is really just there to wade around and cool off in. Very small, but i liked it. There is a separate tanning area above the pool as well.The staff is awesome, we found ourselves hungry late one night and the chef\/bartender Angel fixed my friend a tasty vegetarian pizza and i had a chicken quesadilla. AWESOME!!!The front desk staff is also really helpful with area information. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The Condado beach is choppy and the sand isn't as nice as you would find in Negril, Jamaica but for Puerto Rico it was ok. Isla Verde beach is much nicer and not as many teeny boppers about. There were good restaurants to choose from. A five minute walk takes you to a Dominican Restaurant called Beso's. The french eatery La Patisserie was also excellent, the Quiche was amazing. Although my friend insists that the lunch meats there gave her a virus. (I recommend eating cooked meats in foreign countries...newho). 10 -15 minute walk takes you to a wide array of other eating areas, including Uno's Pizza, Starbucks, and other selections.We followed the suggestion to take the bus to Old San Juan and that worked out well for us, since we didn't feel like spending the extra money for a cab.Be prepared to be disappointed with the Bacardi tour, personally had I known what i do now, I would have skipped it. Basically you get 2 drink vouchers, then you take a trolley to the 'tour', Which is essentially videos and pictures, and then you get sent over to a drink expert who tells you how to make Mojito's, Cuba Libre and Daiquiri's. Then it;s over to the gift shop. That's it. No tour of the actual facility or taste testing or view of the estate.All in all, i would recommend Wind Chimes for singles, laidback, adventurous, flexible persons.
