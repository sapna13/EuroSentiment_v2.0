{"text":"hated it Our experience was horrible - our reservation was for a triple room and a double room - when we got there we were told our rooms were on the third floor - NO ELEVATOR - NO HELP - we went up approximately 100 steps - by the time we got to the third floor we were out of breath - when we opend the door to our rooms we were completely upset - it was a single room, no air, no working tv, no working phone, no soap, no towels and it smelled terrible - I had to go down 100 steps again since the phone was not working and let them know this was not the rooms we ordered. we were told it was sold out and the next day we would get a better room - that night was horrible - the bed was small enough for one person - and not three people. When we changed the rooms the next day - the only ok think was that it was on the 2nd floor - we did not have to go up over 100 steps again. The rooms were very small and again nothing working. they say this is a 3 star hotel - believe me to give them a 0 star is a compliment - if you like to stay near il Duomo sleeping outdoors is more comfortable than sleeping in that awful place - one more thing its infested of moskitos. When we went a few doors down to a beautiful hotel to find out what pricing were their rooms they told the same as La Gioconda - SHAME SHAME ON YOU OWNER OF LA GIOCONDA - FOR STEELING MONEY FROM TOURISTS - ","annotations":[]}
