{"text":"Little piece of Paradise We stayed at the Alam Kulkul following a recomendation from friends who had stayed there before and we were not disappointed.Beautiful boutique resort hotel, friendly and helpful staff for whom nothing was too much trouble.We stayed here at the beginning of our trip and at the end, taking an Alam Villa for 4 nights at the start of the stay and the Java Villa for 4 nights at the end - the Java villa is simply stunning and well worth the extra $100 a night. A private plunge pool with loungers that got the sun for most of the day, with a very welcome chilled bottle of rose and fruit and cheese platter upon arrival.The main pools are very nice, although there was some major building work to the side of the hotel, a huge complex, which operated throughout the day and night, but didn't really affect us. The Spa was being renovated whilst we were there, but had been relocated elsewhere in the resort and we wouldn't really have known unless we had read it somewhere. The spa however is VERY expensive compared to elsewhere in Bali - a basic 1hr massage was $45 compared to about $5 for the same treatment elsewhere. It was good though.The restaurant served excellent food, and the bar served very good cocktails whilst the sun went down over the beach in the evenings. Papa's restaurant at the front of the hotel is renowned for pizza and pasta, and again the service and food was excellent.I'm sure you could find cheaper hotels from the bigger chains, but this attention to detail, service and design was just perfect for us, and we would not hesitate to recommend it 100%.If you need transportation whilst in Bali, our driver Wijana comes highly recommended - he took us all around the island, was very trustworthy, gentle and knowledgable. He can be booked in advance via his website [--] or [--].
