{"text":"A nice hotel but there is room for improvement 1. Damp - on arrival we were shown to a ground floor room  upon entering; the damp stench took your breath away.! We went back to reception  were immediatley offered a different room which whilst the smell was still there it was much less noticeable  improved with air con. The receptionist dealt with this very well  explained until they have enough 'feedback' the hotel is powerless to get the matter resolved. He actively asked us to write in about it  complete customer satisfaction form. Overall I would say the decor is tired  dated.2. Lovely staff - at all times the balinese staff were very polite  always helpful, we found this throughout our stay in Bali. Also the housekeeping were very good  always very clean.3. Cost of food  wine - the Melia is overcharging for food  drinks especially when you can walk along to other 5* hotels and the same wine or food is cheaper and in a nicer hotel \/ restaurant.3. Spa - we did the 'Balinese Memories' spa package for 2, this was lovely and the spa is very well set out  reasonable prices. 4. Access to the other hotels - from the Melia you can walk along a beach path to 3 other lovely 5* hotels (The Laguna, The Westin  Nusa Dua beach htl). All have lovely bars  restaurants we had lovely meals at each and the Sands Bar at The Laguna was great with live music each night whilst looking out to sea and enjoying your drinks laying on the gazebo's and lovely staff (say hi to Pandhi).5. Conferences - The Melia has many major conferences  this restricts the pool area  during the day this can include noisy team building on the beach. 6. To see the island book a car with a driver, we did this and it worked very well. Cost $60 per day.7. We went in November for 10 days  it was 90% humidity with temperature mid 90 - 100 degrees every day, occasional shower.Overall Bali is a lovely place to visit  we did really relax  enjoy it. Would revisit Bali but a different hotel. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":6,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2}]}
