{"text":"Disappointing We use TA as our bible and were encouraged by the reviews of this hotel. As usual many of the comments are totally bang on, especially.. Excellent Concierge Ask Me service Excellent Location Noisy LiftBut..We booked rm602 (the meeting suite) not 502 as everyone seems to suggest. Its one of their 2 suites (above rm 502 we overlooked their terrace) at front. We got over the complicated light switches but couldn't cope with the poorly maintained bathroom. Our shower didn't leak but only partially worked. The overhead shower head dribbled out ok but no power shower, but the handheld didn't work and the tap had come out of the wall. The sliding doors between the bathroom and bedroom always jammed stuck. This was very irritating.We are family of 3 and booked the suite thinking it would be big enough for our daughters bed. It wasn't really - being just a big room with wonderful glass windows overlooking street. Fine for a couple not for family.When does a room become a suite ? I always thought that a suite was more than one room but obviously not.The concierge was excellent - making bookings giving advice etc. The rest of the staff were good looking but useless. The pretty boy who waited breakfast should stay on the beach. The doormen in the silly hats more concerned with how they look than looking after you.So you don't think this review is wasted I'll give you 2 non-touristy places to eat. Modern tapas at Paco Meralgo (carrer de muntaner) and where they still treat tourists as interesting guests and for lunch (excellent fish) L'Oliv√ã√\u2022√ñ (balmes 47).The food at both these places is very good.
