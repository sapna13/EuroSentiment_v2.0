{"text":"stay elsewhere , not worth it, even at bargain prices Just returned from medical meeting at Barcelo Bavaro Convention Center in Punta Cana. A group of colleagues and I, were placed at Barcelo Bavaro Caribe Hotel. Upon arrival the reservation receptionist administrative part was a near mess, like a college admission event but not for college students. Got to my room after more than an hour, The room was basic, furniture poorly kept, had a problem with a lock and it took me one and a half hour and three calls to the Public Relations Phone, what a fancy name, to get help, with a frankly unpleasant attendant who could not care less, the third call was a nasty one and I got help in five minutes. The wall shower support was placed upside down, the toilett was leaking, I fixed it myself not to wait another hour. One of the two elevators never worked. Do take or buy mosquito repellent inmediately, upon arrival, otherwise they will eat you up. I checked for fumigation and saw a couple of clerks with small hand pumps once, doing house type fumigation, no industrial fumigation like I have seen in other resorts. Do not forget dengue is a reality in the Dominican RepublicPhone calls are very costly, buy calling cards accross the hotel at Plaza Dominicana Shopping Mall and place calls through them, cost is one fifth of hotel calls or less.Food is fair and no change through the entire week. You cannot use the facilities of Bavaro Palace, the more expensive hotel of this group, or have to pay extra for meals. The only good night show at Tropicalissimo required extra charge for the drinks which were not included. The rest of night shows were dull and poor, we did not bother seeing them after the first night experience.The pool and gardens are nice, drinks were watery and fair, ask them to add rhum if you want it otherwise you do not know what they serve you, the beach is beautiful as all beaches of this area are. Activities were practically nonexistent, played volleyball with a group of nice people without anyone in charge. KidsClub does not exist so forget if you think about kids participating in any activity for them.Personnel seemed tired, overworked, sometimes truly unpleasant, with very few exceptions. We had an argument with the waiters at the Steak House restaurant because we requested some tables to be put together for us and moving two or three tables was too much work for them, so we left. The only exceptions to this distant careless attitude were Roberto, an extremely pleasant receptionist and a youg fellow at the Internet facilities. The rest were just careless or frankly ubnoxious.The Convention Center was OK. The toilets were sometimes not clean at all, and the seats were broken and never fixed during the whole week of the Congress. The lecture rooms were adequate.It is my third and last stay at a Barcel√ã¬\u2022? Hotel, having other so much better organized Hotels I see no reason to return to this Hotel Chain where personnel trainig and good feelings, plus real passenger care do not seem to matter.Dr Roberto Balassa MD ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1445,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":1439},{"endOffset":2009,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2005}]}
