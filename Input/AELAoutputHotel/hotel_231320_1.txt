{"text":"Very good experience I booked the Hotel Damrak for a 1 night stay for my wifes birthday in May 2008. I had read several mixed reviews so didn't know exactly what to expect and like everyone, was hoping for a good one.We arrived at the Hotel at 10.30 am to be greeted by a very friendly reception lass that went out of her way to be nice. Cases were left in the luggage room which was cool as we couldn't get into our room until 1pm. We were in room 36 which was excellent and a double room. No view from the window other than the escape exit stairs but it was clean with clean towels and floors and clean walls and the tv worked perfect and had a remote. The bar and restaurant were cool with plenty to choose from. Breakfast is NOT bacon and eggs, lol, which was a litle disapointing, but when in Rome.....eat the continental crap they serve for breakfast.Location is 100% awesome. You are a few yards from Dam Square and the famous red light district and cafes, the sex museum is like 5 buildings away and Centrall Station is close enough to nearly be able jump to. This Hotel is in the middle of everything you would visit Amsterdam for. My wife and I are 35 and had an awsome time. The price for the room was great, √ä√£¬¢80 for us both. Would definitely stay in this Hotel again from our experience. Hope my review helps. Please message me for any further details that I may have forgotton. Cheers, Steve ","annotations":[]}
