{"text":"Classy with a great location My girlfriend and I stayed at the Four Points July 13-15, 2006 because she had points eligible for a free stay and we just payed for the second day. The hotel was very classy from the moment we stepped onto the property. Our flight from san francisco arrived in sydney around 7:30 am and they were able to check us in right away (normal check in time is in the afternoon). A nice long shower after a 15 hour flight was priceless. We had a double queen and our view was city side but we didn't really miss the harbor view because we were only in our rooms for sleeping and showering. The view only showed the parking garage across the street and a glimpse of Sydney Tower. The hotel is steps away from Darling Harbor which has many bars and restaurants. It is also on the west side of the central business district, well within walking distance of the botanical gardens, opera house, The Rocks, Chinatown, and Darling Harbor. The hotel has a restaurant on the ground floor which looked very nice. Prices were just that, pricey. Buffet lunch was over $30 AUD ($25) per person and dinner was $50 plus a la carte per person. With the amount of restaurants around, you had a much better deal walking around and finding a cuisine that fit you and your pocketbook better. During our 2 week trip, we were in Sydney on two different occasions with the first staying here at the Four Points. The second hotel we stayed at was the Metro Hotel on Pitt (300 Pitt Street). With half the price and only 2 blocks away, I thought the Metro was a better hotel pick in my opinion (read my review of that hotel). Overall, the Four Points is a very fine hotel. Very clean, quiet, and classy amenities and staff. You will not be disappointed. But with the higher price tag, I would choose the Metro Hotel on Pitt based on value.
