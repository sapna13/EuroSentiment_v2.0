{"text":"The Watertown: Great rooms, great views! We live nearby, and when we had to (on very short notice) move out of our house for a week during some remodelling work, we found the Watertown online, and booked a week there. I'd known friends who'd stayed there because it was near the University, but we'd never been there and had just driven by on occasion. Our experience was top-notch: we showed up about an hour after we'd made the reservation online (and about 2 hours after our contractor told us that we'd need to vacate our home for 5 days!), and they were very organized, and prepared, given that we'd just made the reservation. Our room was beautiful, and the view of Lake Union and Queen Anne was lovely. We enjoyed the proximity to the U-District, and ended up walking everywhere or taking the bus downtown... it was easiest just to leave the car in the parking garage and hop on a bus to get downtown, or just walk a couple of blocks to dinner, shopping, and grocery stores. Plus we could walk to all the movie theaters. So, we ended up having an unexpected but great stay in the Watertown, and had a fabulous time exploring the area on foot, which we hadn't done for ages. The fixtures, linens, and finishes were all luxurious and elegant, and our room felt very spacious. The staff made our stay even better: they were professional, welcoming, and helped us with bus schedules and movie times. The breakfast was also decent: we didn't expect The Four Seasons, but it was miles above a typical continental breakfast in a hotel chain. Real coffee, fresh juice, and organic yogurt w\/ fresh fruit. Yum!
