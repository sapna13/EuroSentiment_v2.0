{"text":"Excellent value We stayed here for a week and were very impressed by the quality of the hotel, its central but quiet location and the friendliness of the staff.The hotel is brilliantly situated, a few doors away from a well-stocked wine shop, a couple of minutes from the Metro, and five minutes walk from the Musee de Cluny (home of the magical Lady and the Unicorn tapestries). It is close to Notre Dame, Saint-Chapelle, the Jardin des Plantes, and the Luxembourg Gardens, and within walking distance of the Musee d√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©?rsay, Pompidou Centre, Picasso Museum and many other delights. Although the hotel has no bar or restaurant, there are many places to eat and drink nearby. Le Cosi, an excellent Corsican restaurant which has a different set menu for lunch each day, is only five minutes walk away. The Place de la Sorbonne is a great place for a drink and people watching.Our room was on the third floor, with a small balcony and a good view along the Rue des Ecoles. The room was a decent size, very clean and well-equipped. The kitchenette was a bonus, particularly the full size fridge, which was useful for keeping food and wine chilled.We were perfectly happy with the hotel breakfast √à√\u2020\u2022?strong coffee, fruit juice, croissants, brioche and rye-bread √à√\u2020\u2022?although we did hear one American family complaining that it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ substantial enough for their needs. On one morning, we came downstairs to discover that breakfast had finished early due to an interruption to the electricity supply. We must have looked very disappointed, as, a few minutes later, there was a knock on the door and breakfast was delivered to the room. As we had an early flight, we had to leave before breakfast on the Saturday morning, and asked whether we could have a cup of coffee. When we came down to reception, we found a complete breakfast waiting for us, which was greatly appreciated.We very much enjoyed our stay, would certainly use the hotel again and will recommend it to our friends.
