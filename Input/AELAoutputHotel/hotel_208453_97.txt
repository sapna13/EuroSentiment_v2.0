{"text":"Large, Clean, Comfortable Rooms in Prime Location The Hilton is a gem in Times Square! The upscale rooms are huge by New York standards, the white bathrooms sparkle, and the bed, lounge chair, ottoman, and huge modernistic desk and chair are inviting and accommodating. Add the large flat panel TV, tons of drawer and closet space, a mini bar frig, and full length closet mirrors, and The Hilton surpasses most of the 4 star properties in the vicinity, especially for the value. The fitness center seemed smaller than my guest room and only has two treadmills, two bikes and an elliptical machine amidst a weight station with four machines fanning out from the center and a rack of free weights. An old TV and water cooler have seen their day, and the machines need maintenance to keep from squeaking. Luckily, I was the only guest interested in exercising early in the morning, as the facility is quite tight though adequate. The bar and restaurant are a bit small for the property's size, and the food was average fare. The bartender, as well as the front desk staff were very friendly. I was welcomed for an early check-in and was granted a 2pm checkout without any incident. Bags can be checked for free with the bellhop, and umbrellas are available from the concierge or front desk. The maids ranged from curt to exceedingly friendly, and one went way out of her way to get me toothpaste when I inquired. The Hilton's location is great, and you can take the Times Square subway or walk almost anywhere you'd want to go in the city. Lord  Taylor and Macy's are within a comfortable walking distance, as are the theaters and Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center. Bryant Park behind the NY Public Library on Fifth and 40th has a free skaing rink, and rentals are only $10. My stay was extremely comfortable, and the drapes blocked the sunlight in the morning so that I slept well. The bed had a great mattress and pillows, and the bedding and furnishings were upscale, bright and attractive. The large bathroom counter ran the length of the room, and a Cuisinart coffeemaker for two with large ceramic mugs and tea selections provided a nice touch. The bathroom itself was a bit small, but by NY standards, it was above average. The tub was very deep, and the shower head was placed very high, a great touch for tall guests! Water pressure was fantastic as well. Overall, the Hilton far exceeded my expectations. It is a bit difficult to find, as several enterprises share the same address between 7th and 8th Avenues. Look for funky sculptures on the ground where the entrance is tucked into an alcove. You are whisked up to the 21st floor lobby, and rooms start on the 23rd floor. The building is situated a couple blocks from any other buildings to the north and many blocks to the south, so that the views are all phenomenal in comparison with other Manhattan hotels, where you could be looking out at the adjacent building's windows a few feet away, or some mechanical apparatus on a rooftop. I highly recommend this property!
