{"text":"Our wonderful honeymoon at the Taino My husband and I spent 2 fabulous weeks at this resort. It was a delayed honeymoon for us and we were very happy we chose this resort. To give you a bit of background, we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e in our late 20√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂  early 30√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ and this is my 3rd trip to an all inclusive  his 2nd. We flew Skyservice from Toronto. There was a lot of turbulence on the way there, but we arrived safely, got through customs and towards our bus. The first stop was at Riu Naiboa  then we were the 2nd to be dropped off. Check-inWe arrived at the resort at 1pm. Our room wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ready so we grabbed a bite to eat at the buffet  walked around the resort  beach to get a feel for the place. The beach is beautiful, the pool is a decent size, but a rather small swim-up bar. The reception area is large  open. We got our room, just a basic room, nothing special. Yes, it is a little old  tired, but the room was very clean and a good size. We loved having the liquor dispenser and the mini fridge, it came in handy on the few rainy days that we had.FoodThe food was very good. We were happy with the quality of food, comparing it to the food we had in Cuba, it was 10 times better!! A lot of people complain about the lack of variety in the buffet options. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get it, they have different meats (veal, pork, chicken, meatballs, steak√à√\u2020\u2022?, they have different seafood options (I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat the stuff, but my husband enjoyed it), they plenty of different sides from a variety of different potato styles, to pasta, to rice, to nachos, to soups, veggies etc. The √ã√ë√∏ la carte dinners were fantastic  we were happy with them all. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ a picky eater  I managed to eat a lot and neither of us got sick. The PoolsThe Taino has 2 pools, the larger one with the swim-up bar. It was a nice pool, but I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ enjoy it because there were too many rowdy drunk people. I get it, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ an all-inclusive, and that's how the enjoyed their holiday. I preferred to stay at the other pool. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a smaller pool with a children√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ area. My hubby  I just stayed on the other side opposite the children area. This pool didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a swim up bar, but that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ fine, because we brought 32oz Bubba Kegs which kept our drinks cold  they lasted longer than the small plastic cups. I highly suggest Bubba Kegs. Many people had them, and those who didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ wished they had. The BeachThe beach was beautiful!! That√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ all I can say about it! We walked the beach a couple of days. We went left towards the other Riu properties. The beach gets wider as you go across the Riu properties. We also went right, which is towards the beach vendors. Make sure you barter with the vendors. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ accept their first price offer!! And if they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e being stubborn, just say you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l come back tomorrow. They don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like to hear that!!ExcursionsWe only did 1 excursions and it was the Buggy ride. We booked through the people in the lobby, our Sunquest rep wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ there, so we booked through the TUI rep. We were told that we were also going to go on a horse back ride  into a lagoon. But that wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ the case!! We rode dune buggies (which we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mind) through a small town  across a very dirty  muddy road (it had rained the day before). The only part we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like about this was the small children begging us for money. What a sin!! We felt so horrible. We brought candy with us in our luggage for our excursions, but forgot to bring it with us on our excursion!!! The weatherIt was hot  sunny 11 out of the 14 days. There were 3 days where it rained on and off all day. PM me if you have any questions.
