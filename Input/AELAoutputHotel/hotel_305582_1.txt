{"text":"Not as bad as I was expecting I booked this hotel and my trip to Barcelona on a whim in order to escape the dreary North European weather and, having read some of the reviews just a few days before going, went with some apprehension. I booked for three nights mid-week and despite paying a single rate was given a reasonably sized double room. The clinical whiteness of the room was a little overdone (the only relief afforded by the black slim-line TV) but everything was clean and in good working order. The bathroom had a decent 'monsoon' shower and separate hand held nozzle for all those hard to reach places. A free facility on offer was an i-pod docking station, which was much welcome as music CDs on the TV came at rather a hefty charge. The room service was done properly, although, oddly, one of the door hangers actually said Do Disturb. This being a gay-orientated establishment I wasn't terribly sure whether this was a typographical error or not! With regard to the Spa complex - I had this to myself. The gym is a little small and would only contain 3 people comfortably but are you really on holiday to have a work out? The sauna and steam are both fine and the jacuzzi delighful (though it would have been better shared with someone tactile but that's life). This being December I can only confirm that the plunge pool is at least more than ankle deep. I also booked a massage through the hotel and this was provided by a very professional Venezualan who was both handsome and friendly (so it can happen). I had a full hour for EUR70 but there were no extras - so you may find better value and possibly extras at one of the saunas where the going rate is in the region of EUR40\/hr. I unfortunately was unable to research this matter as some kindly gentleman availed himself of my wallet and all its contents on the metro. This was from the inside zipped (albeit exposed) pocket of my overcoat. If you're going to BCN take and use a money belt. Don't be poorer but wiser after the event like me (sob!). The downside to the hotel, if there has to be one, is that my 5th floor room overlooked the front of the hotel. This may have had a nice view from the miniscule balcony (which vertigo prevented me from venturing onto) but it also meant lots of traffic noise. This being Spain, where every road is a race track, the noise did not abate at any time - day or night. Clearly the seal on the double glazed doors of this particular room needs replacing. If this is likely to concern you you may be best asking for a room at the back. On the upside the hotel is located fairly centrally to all the main sites and is also within walking distance of most of the gay establishments. I didn't sample the breakfast as a coffee and a croissant suffice for me but the lunchtime menu looked terrific value (i was usually having my croissant at about this time, however). Finally the A1 (Blue) Airport bus costs EUR4.05 for a single trip. Note that the only central boarding point is located outside El Corte Ingles in the Placa de Catalunya and the journey from there to the Airport took 40 minutes not the 20 minutes that I was advised by the hotel. Bear in mind that this may take longer in high season\/at weekends especially if you live your life like the White Rabbit..........
