{"text":"Beautiful resort, shame about the food My husband and I stayed for one week July 2006 and were overall very pleased with the resort.The rooms could do with a little updating but were clean and comfortable.The resort was very picturesque and the staff helpful and polite.The pools were very clean and the pool bars great.It was a bit fustrating having to queue up to reserve your place at the restaurants and the food here we found quite bland. The food at the buffet, foor which you do not have to book was much tastier and had a good variety, different each day.However my main problem started half way through the week when my digestive system felt rather uneasy and from then on I was not actually really ill, until the day of our return journey, but I could not eat or drink much at all and felt quite queazy alot of the time. Since we had paid for all inclusive this was really disappointing. Whether this was caused by the food at the resort I cannot be sure as we also ate out on two of the organized days out.These were great and well worth the money. The best was swimming with Sharks! An experience not to be missed. You go out on a boat to an enclosure holding veggie sharks (LOL) and rays and you scuba dive into and in the enclosure. I am not a very good swimmer and have never scuba dived but managed. Also you have drinks and dancing on the boat and swim in the shallow clear waters. All very enjoyable.We also went on the truck safari and visited the locals and the surrounding areas. Very interesting and worth the visit.Therefore I would recommend the resort for those with a strong stomach, as my husbands, who was absolutley fine, it was an unforgetable week away..
