{"text":"Chinese design and Catalan hospitality We stayed at the Pulitzer for the special occasion of my wife's birthday for 3 nights at the end of March. As far as our adult son was accompanying us, we booked a double and a single room, which were arranged from the hotel right next to each other. We love boutique hotels with minimalistic design much better than faceless hotels of big chains, where a hotel room in NYC looks exactly the same like in any other place of the world. The interiour of the hotel is inspired by Chinese themes, and it uses the colors black and white (with a red dot in the bar, which is the central point of the hotel). From all the positive comments, given on this website, we would like to underline the ones, referring to the personnel, running the hotel. The staff is well selected, everybody is absolutely confident about his job, everything is smooth running, which is the result of real team work and a manager, who is open for comments and suggestions. All employees with customer contact (front desk, restaurant, bar) speak excellent English, and you will receive a smile, which goes right into your heart. This smile is very special, because it is natural. It shows, that everybody in the hotel loves his job every day, and that you as a customer are really welcome.We have stayed at other design hotels before, and we observed more than one time that cool hotel design triggers a cool attitude of the personnel, which can be interpreted as arrogant - this was absolutely not the case in the Pulitzer!Reading some complaints about street noise, clapping doors and rain drops falling onto the terrace roof we would like to admit, that yes, Barcelona is a big city, and the hotel is centrally located, but in a side street. Those, who are extremely noise sensitive, can make use a beautifully designed suite on the 6th floor, where complete privacy is guaranteed, the door of the suite will be the only door clapping, and possible rain drops will fall on the private terrace of the suite. However, we liked our rooms on the third floor, and we will definitely return to the Pulitzer.Big compliments to the entire hotel team. Keep on going this way, and you will be rewarded by guests, that take best memories home to their countries and that return to your hotel again and again!
