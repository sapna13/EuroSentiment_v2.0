{"text":"Duc de la Victoria Lived up to Expectations My husband and I stayed at this hotel for two nights prior to embarking on a transatlantic cruise. We were very pleased with our stay.I had booked the hotel on the NH website and had requested early check-in if possible. Sure enough, after walking for five minutes from the Aerobus (as easy as others have indicated!) we were able to check in at 10:30 in the morning -- unexpected and wonderful after a night with very little sleep on two flights!I had requested a room with a balcony on the fourth or fifth floor and was given a nice room (425). The room was a decent enough size, but a little crowded with our luggage -- I ended up moving the tea\/coffee tray to make more room. Nice robes and slippers were provided and the bathroom was excellent. It had terrific toiletries and all sorts of extras like a toothbrushing kit and a plastic razor with shaving cream. As indicated elsewhere, the bed was very large and comfortable and assorted pillows were provided. Nice touches: I was able to use the computer in the lobby (if you ask they will provide you with a business coupon good for 15 minutes of free internet). They provide many daily papers in the lobby including the International Herald Tribune. Service was excellent. I had a problem during our stay involving a restaurant reservation and needed one of the front desk staff to call the restaurant for me while I was out and about in Barcelona. Andres was wonderful. He not only called the restaurant, but he also called me back twice to make sure I knew everything had been taken care of!Our room was clean and well serviced by staff. When I asked for extra towels, they were quickly brought to the room.Also, I had occasion to correspond with the hotel before and after our stay. Cristina responded promptly and politely to requests in both instances.Although not inexpensive, the location is what makes this hotel wonderful. You can walk to the Placa Catalunya to board the Hop On Hop Off Bus easily and a short walk in the other direction brings you to the Cathedral and the many shops and restaurants of the Barri Gotico and the Born.BTW many posters extoll the virtues of the Bagel Shop, but alas, it isn't open on Sunday. A short stroll brings you to the Rambla, which is filled with cafes and other places where you can grab a bite quickly and easily. Every other day of the week you can also walk a couple of blocks to the Boqueria, which is a treat. We walked to the hotel from the Aerobus, but we used a cab to take us to the cruiseport. This was called by the front desk -- very quick and easy and the driver came up to the front door. I would definitely recommend this hotel and plan to stay here in the future.
