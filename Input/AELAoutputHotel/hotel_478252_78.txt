{"text":"Fabulous hotel I have just return back from staying 2 weeks at the Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana and when I say I have just came back I mean I have only been home a few hours, but I just had to leave a comment about this hotel as before I went on my hols I had looked on trip advisor at this hotel and like you are thinking, I was worried about this hotel because of the mixed reviews. All I can say is what do these people want????? Buckingham Palace to stay at? Unbelievable hotel, we were staying in the Amber part, where the rooms have four posterbeds, wide screen tv's and the pool area is adults only, however I must stress that gentlemen if you want to eat in the buffet area in Amber as well as the other restaurants then you need to bring trousers and if you have tattoo's they need to be covered, this was the only problem we had as my partner did not bring long trousers and has tattoos on his arms, but we would walk to Punta Cana buffet and it was lovely, freshly cooked pasta to your taste and standard in front of you and every night a different theme on the food. I do not have anything bad to say about this hotel, if you are gonna moan about the weather, get a life why are you going to the Caribbean??? if you are going to moan its not a five star and you live in USA or UK then remember you are not staying in a UK or USA standard hotel, Dominican Republic is a third world country!!! If you have booked to go here then trust me, you will have an amazing time, wish I was these still ; ( ","annotations":[{"endOffset":990,"mention":"pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":985}]}
