{"text":"maybe my individual tale of woes? I stayed there in April on points and am a platinum starwood member. All the reviews have been so great but I do want to tell my tale of woe as a word of caution. I felt very sorry for the staff as they dealt with one disaster after another and seemed quite embarrased..1) Disaster 1: The first room was a suite and when we arrived there was a problem with the electronic lock-- no key but the hotel master key could open it. It was supposed to be fixed the following day but was not. I finally had to really push to get a hotel manager to see the lock who then apologized and quickly moved me to nice room with a balcony view2) Disaster 2: It started raining and water started pouring out of the ceiling light fixtures onto the flat panel tv. in room number 2. We grabbed the TV so it was not damaged and went down to the front desk...who by now were flabbergasted..3) Disaster 3: We went to dinner at the hotel and the service was so bad they comped the meal.. we gave the price of the meal to the waiter since he and the staff were so embarrased at the hotel4) Disaster 4: Not really a disaster, but by now we had been upgraded to our third room which had a massive jacuzzi and two bathrooms. After all this I decided to take a jacuzzi to relax--which I never do-- and you guessed it, the switch didn't work and in fact came out of the socket in the tub.The renovation of the hotel has taken far longer than expected and I hope by now all this has been fixed. I really liked the folks working there and hope that under Westin management all the issues have been fixed.
