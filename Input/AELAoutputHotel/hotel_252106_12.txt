{"text":"Top Notch If you are staying in Berlin, stay here!!Helpful friendly staff, great location, great breakfast with lots of choice, free coffee machine and even a complimentary chocolate cake for my birthday. I have stayed in many hotels around the world and with the exception of the Bellagio in Vegas and the Ritz Carlton in Dubai I don't think I have stayed in any better.Some hopefully helpful tips for Berlin - - The hotel is about 45 min train journey from Schoenfeld Airport on the S Bahn line 9 to Zoogarten. You will need the ticket that covers zones ABC.  - Get to know the S Bahn and U Bahn lines as Berlin sprawls so its good to save the shoe leather. Fortunately the hotel is next to a U Bahn line and only 8 min walk from a major U and S Bahn station (Zoogarten). - The Reichstag always has long queues so go early or as we did go late (last entrance is 10pm, we went at 9pm) and in the evening the views and the Copula looks fantastic - For other things to do we found the Holocaust museum very moving, The Brandenburg Gate looks great lit up at night, the Checkpoint Charlie Museum is really interesting and there is lots of shopping to be had if that is your thing. Potsdamer Platz is great and we found loads to do there and the Sony Centre is great and energetic at night especially at the weekend. The Zoo is huge and really well laid out and quite relaxing. Generally there is lots to do in Berlin and as a city it surprised me at how enjoyable and laid back it is. - If food is your thing there is so much to be had including restaurant 44 at the hotel. We were spoilt for choice for food in Berlin, so much variety.  - Finally the Berlin Welcome Card is worth a look as it gives you free travel and discounts (normally 25%) at most of the major sites, tours and at some restaurants. We used it and it was worth the 24 euros for the 3 days per person. But most importantly - Swissotel, definately one to stay at again.
