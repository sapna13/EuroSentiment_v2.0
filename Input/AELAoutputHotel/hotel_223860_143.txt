{"text":"Muggy rooms in the summertime My husband had a lengthy conference at the JW Marriot Desert Ridge the end of July. While the lobby and grounds were beautiful, the hotel has major problems with its air conditioning. We were assigned a beautiful suite overlooking the pool, and we could not get the room temperature below 83 degrees. The hotel's engineering department admitted that the rooms at the end of the halls are also at the end of their cooling loop and do not get adequate cooling. In addition, our lovely bathroom that was big enough to have a dance floor in it, had no vents or air conditioning supply. It was unbearable. We literally kept the door open with fans blowing the slightly cooler air from the hallway (which was still very warm) into the room. The hotel moved us to another room in the area....but same problem. We finally gave up our suite and moved to a standard room closer to the lobby and the air conditioning was at best, adequate (we kept our fan!). MANY of the conference rooms were too hot, and other rooms seemed to be cool then hot, as if the hotel was moving its inadequate cooling capabilities around. The pool areas are nice, and service was ok...beyond the seemingly unfixable air conditioning problem.If you're thinking of booking a conference\/meeting at this property in the summer, my advice is don't do it. If you're just wanting to take the family for a night or two, ask for a centrally located room and it will probably be ok.
