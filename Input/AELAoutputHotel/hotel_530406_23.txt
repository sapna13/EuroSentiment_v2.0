{"text":"Loved Ocean Sand\/Blue .... Best Ever!!!!! I stayed at the Ocean Sand from the 14th to the 28th of September 2008. Flights were with Thomsonfly, on time, loads of legroom etc the best way to travel longhaul. Punta Cana airport is really nice. Be warned though you do get you photo taken after you get off the flight so freshen up!!!The weather was fantastic, we did have 3 days of rain due to a tropical depression however it didn't spoil our holiday other than that the weather was FANTASTIC!! I stayed at the hotel during the Presidente Rave. This was a one off event in the hotel ran by Presidente (the local beer) hosted in the pool and beach areas. This only added to our holiday, it was fantastic!We were in Villa 10, overlooking the pool. These rooms are really lovely. Huge beds, beautiful bathroom, balcony. Cleaned every day. We tipped the maid a few dollars every day however this is not necessary. The minibar is restocked daily with water, pepsi, 7up. Previous reviews mentioned tiles missing in the pool. You'll be pleased to hear they have all be replaced!! They did this while we were there! Pool areas are great, always clean. The beach and sea are really beautiful.Food in the hotel is great. We only went once to the a la carte restaurants. They were good but we were happy with the buffet. Loads of choice and food is made fresh. Entertainment is great, they have live shows, music every night with the occassional karaoke. All the entertainment team are really friendly and great fun.We loved the lobby bar, disco and sportsbar. All the staff are fantastic, you can't get better service anywhere else. We will definitley be returning next year. We met some fantastic people there. Don't listen to the negative reviews, go and make up your own mind.. (p.s you'll love it!!!!!!!)
