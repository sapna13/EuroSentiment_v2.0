{"text":"So much (wasted) potential What a beautiful place, but they really need to tweak a few things if I were to reccomend it to anyone.I was there on a business conference for the week. My girlfriend joined me on Friday night and we stayed until Monday morning.During the week, I was very busy and didnt really notice anything one way or another, other then the sheer beauty of the resort.We checked in late Saturday night and I was floored. The lobby smelled and looked amazing. I almost couldnt contain my excitement that THIS is how I was spending a week at work. Turns out they really need to address a few things.YOU FEEL LIKE A HOSTAGE:RENT A CAR! They charge you rediculous amounts of money to take a cab anywhere off the resort. I was tempted to walk to the nearest grocery, but the driveway is like 4 miles long. I would have felt a little better about the whole thing if I had control over where I could go. Plus, they charge by the person to go anywhere ($80 each way per person to old san juan), which sucks. I actually spent $120 for a 10 min trip to the rainforest (which was cool), but again overpriced.THE FOOD IS MEH:There is not a whole lot to choose from and it is very overpriced. I do not mind spending $30-$50 on an entre, but the food was only so\/so. The pool bar is your best bet for the price, but it is only so\/so. I have been to Puerto Rico a couple of times and the food is one of the true highlights the island has to offer. I was really dissipointed I did not get to show my girlfriend how good Puerto Rican food really is. Again, if it wasnt so crazy expensive to get a cab out of there, I could have taken her to many better places to eat. I actually played a few hands of blackjack for the free sandwich (hot ham and cheese) which unfortunately was just as good as anything else I had.My girlfriend did get the seabass one night and liked it.KIDS ARE EVERYWHERE:Be prepared...INCONSISTENT SERVICE:Sometimes it was good, sometimes not. We once ordered our food and never saw are waiter ever again. We got our food from the sushi chef and our check from the manager...no lie. Expect to wait a good 15 min for your check wherever you go.The maid service was strange. At times they were overbearing and could not comprehend that I left a DND sign on my door all day. I was working and by myself, I really didnt need any pillow fluffing. But a 2 maids and a large man visited my room in the span of two hours to see if i wanted service. By the time the weekend hit, I came back to my room at 4pm and nothing was done. Very strange indeed.THERE IS NO BEACH:Just know that and accept it.Overall, I did not have a bad time. I spent one full day at the pool and it was lovely. The pool is spectacular. Its big and the has tile lounges that sit half in the pool. My pina colada was delicious and my sunburn was worth it. The senery is to be marveled at, I was really blown away by the beauty of the place.Unfortunately, I felt they were getting me comming and going. I dont mind spending money for good food and good times, buit you know that feeling when you feel as if your being ripped off a little and there is no doubt I felt that way. (You know its bad when you are pocketing food from the breakfast buffett for lunch! lol) If the resort was all-inclusive (i have seen here that it used to be) it would be really nice, but Puerto Rico has too much to offer to be held hostage on a resort with mediocre food.Please Grand Melia, You are so close...fix the problems please.PA ","annotations":[{"endOffset":802,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":798},{"endOffset":802,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":798},{"endOffset":1731,"mention":"sandwich","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":1723}]}
