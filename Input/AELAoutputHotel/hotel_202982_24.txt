{"text":"an excellent choice Booked well in advance and got a good rate for 4 nights in a deluxe room.Room was very spacious and comfortable on the 3rd floor with pleasant decor, good bedding and plush marble bathroom, complete with huge towels and robes.Location was also excellent within an easy walk to the central rail station, but tucked away in a very quiet street. A spacious outdoor courtyard was a delightful place to take your paninis for lunch. We used it in the cool of one evening to enjoy a drink and a chat with fellow guests we had met during our stay.The main touristy area around the Duomo and Uffizi were about a 15 minute walk away, but it was always an interesting stroll and you could stop to visit the markets on the way, or, as my wife did - stop at every bag store to inspect the merchandise.We had no trouble finding good, reasonably priced sidewalk restaurants without wandering too far.Some previous reviews have made comment staff service could be better. We did not find this at all. Our interactions were always polite, friendly and welcoming.We had breakfast in the dining room each morning with very adequate fare and excellent service from the wait staff.For us Florence was the final hotel stay in our 6 week self guided tour of Europe with the last 7 days in an apartment in Rome. Florence was one of our favourite places on our trip and the Albani one of the best hotels. We will be back. ","annotations":[]}
