{"text":"Fantastic! We stayed at this hotel August 6-11th. I have got to say that if you cannot afford to stay at George V (where I always get my hair done when in Paris) then this is THE hotel to stay at. We arrived a few hours early and we were checked in immediately as the room was already prepared. The front desk staff is the friendliest and nicest and always ready to help with anything. Karen, Emily, and Sonya (and Gabriel the late night desk clerk) were the greatest! They arranged to have someone pick us up at the airport, made restaurant reservations for us, and gave us info and help for just about anything we needed. They spoke perfect English and I learned so much about how to get around in Paris from them. And you can order Louvre tickets and the Paris hop on\/hop off bus tickets right there at the front desk and save a lot of time! Also, the location is great - only a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. My son even did laundry at the lav-o-matic around the corner - the washers cost but the dryers are free. The neighborhood has little markets, restaurants, etc. - VERY convenient. The hotel room was a decent size for a boutique hotel - In other words, we could unpack our suitcases and leave them sit out, not all scrunched up as in other boutique hotels. And the bathroom was just like being in an American hotel - very nice and roomy with lots of amenities, even shoe shine sponges. The air conditioning and everything worked great. The lobby is so nice and cozy and they have books and games sitting out and a little bar - it is just like being in your own den back home. My family will always stay at this hotel now that we have discovered it. It is the best.
