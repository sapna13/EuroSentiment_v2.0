{"text":"Four Seasons -- Very Nice But Could Be Better My wife and I spent Thanksgiving week at the Four Seasons in Downtown Miami. The downtown area is a bit of a ghost town at night. A few towers sit dark  empty. Others remain under construction. However there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ some life sprouting-up in the area. New restaurants  bars, along with a great basketball arena  a beautiful opera house are bringing some much-needed energy to a long-neglected part of town.The Four Seasons is certainly doing its part to build on that momentum. Located in the tallest building in Miami, the hotel is sleek  modern. The lobby is visually stunning with its high ceilings  stylish decor. It even smelled nice √à√\u2020\u2022?like an English garden after a spring rain. Sports Club LA is located here too  guests have access to the gym which is a huge plus. Our room was very comfortable with impressive skyline views. The swimming pool is located on the 7th floor. The setting is perfect. A large outdoor pool along w\/a Jacuzzi  a wading pool w\/palm trees. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ an oasis among the high rises! However we concluded that the service at the Four Seasons didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ quite match-up to its beautiful setting. We base this assessment also on previous stays at other FS hotels. We hope FS Miami will take the following points as constructive criticism! Overall, our stay at the Four Seasons was very good but not excellent. For one thing, the pool could use a facelift. Parts of the pool has paint chipping  I detected several noticeable cracks along the perimeter of the pool. The patch-up job done on some of the cracks looked very sloppy. The maid service was unsatisfactory. For example, the maids were chintzy with the shampoo  conditioner. We had to call  ask for extra bottles a couple of times. Then things started to mysteriously disappear from our room. First it was the waste paper basket in our bathroom. Then it was the Do Not Disturb sign (which was last seen INSIDE our room). We laughed it off at first. I mean, we never experienced hotel staff allegedly stealing hotel items! But it became irritating because none of the items mentioned were returned or replaced. Finally, in other Four Seasons establishments, we always found little treats on our pillow; a strategically-placed bookmark on the book sitting on the bedside table or toiletries arranged symmetrically by the sink. These Four Seasons touches were conspicuously missing. My wife  I started to think that maybe we were placed in a section of the hotel which was relegated for less-desirable travelers. We started calling our floor the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?\u2022rbitz Floor.√à√\u2020\u2022?In conclusion, we believe a few minor improvements would bring the Miami branch up-to-par with the excellence that the Four Seasons is known for. We'll continue to stay at the Four Seasons domestically  internationally.
