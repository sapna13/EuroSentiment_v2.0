{"text":"Loved the Silken Ramblas We stayed at the Hotel Silken Ramblas in Barcelona for 7 nights in one of the Silken Rooms. I found this hotel through a search again and I was impressed with the hotel's website. The hotel was very modern, chic, and contemporary. Check in at the hotel was very easy. The front desk staff were very helpful and after spending 7 nights at the hotel, you got to know most of the front desk staff after walking by them several times a day. We had a King size bed in our room. This was a real king size bed by North American standards and not two twin\/double beds stuck together like they do in many European hotels. The bed was extremely comfortable with nice clean sheets, deep rich colours and lots of pillows. The room was very spacious and extremely clean. We had desk, sofa with pull out bed, recliner and cocktail table in our room. The coolest part of the room was the built-in music system. At the flick of a switch you could listen to some house\/jazz music throughout the room, including the bathroom and shower!! Pretty cool. The bathroom was huge...marble countertops and flooring. There's also a bidet in the bathroom which I thought was funny. Again, a fairly common thing to have in Europe. The only thing that was a bit of a drag is that there was no shower door\/curtain in the bathroom. The shower\/tub has half a wall covering it and then the rest of the space is all open concept. Sometimes water would splash onto the floor of the bathroom while you showered...but these types of showers seem to be quite common in Europe. The hotel had a small business centre with a computer for internet access. There was also a small lounge\/bar area just after the main lobby which was pretty hip and stylish. The waterfall feature was a nice touch as well. We never did eat the hotel. There are tons of cafes\/restaurants all around the hotel and Ramblas. Across the street from the hotel is a small restaurant serving typical Catalunyan dishes and tapas. There's a small grocery store around the corner as well as a Starbucks. The boquiera marketplace is 2 min from the hotel where you can all sorts of different foods.Looking forward to my return trip to Barcelona...and I will defintely stay at the Silken Ramblas again!!!
