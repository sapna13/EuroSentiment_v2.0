{"text":"Little Shabby, Little Chic I just returned from a three night stay at the Miami Beach Resort  Spa for a professional conference. The hotel employee who took my reservation honored the specially negotiated group rate a couple of weeks before my arrival, although the group rate deadline had expired. I was pleased at the nice gesture, until I visited the hotel's web site and learned that I could have done slightly better on the rate by booking online instead! It certainly pays to do a bit of web surfing before calling the hotel directly for reservations. When I arrived at 1:30 in the morning, the desk clerk changed my room to a corner room with a great view (nice!). The room had recently been painted, and there were new linens to give the room a lift. The room was generally clean, but there were major water\/mildew spots underneath the sink.It is clear that hotel management is trying to keep things presentable without investing too much money. The carpeting is old and dated with wild floral patterns on each guest floor and in the conference rooms. The knobs on the closet doors in the guest rooms look like they date to the 1950s. There are major cables and wires visible underneath the guest desks. This hotel, I am sure, was once a major showplace, as evidenced by the marble in the lobby and elegant crystal chandeliers. It has seen better days, though, and needs major updating.On a positive note, the staff is very friendly. The desk staff is wonderful, and the waiters at the Hibiscus Court (wonderful breakfast spot) are a delight. Also, as someone who enjoys her newspapers, I greatly enjoyed getting a complimentary copy of the Miami Herald AND the New York Times delivered outside my door early every morning.
