{"text":"Perfect Vistor Hotel in Barcelona, Spain Spent a week in Barcelona, Spain at the H10 Universitat Hotel, beginning March 14, 2007. Two rooms for four men from Philadelphia, PA, USA. Although, not particularly relevant for this trip, all four of us are gay. It was my partner and I - not too mature, yet; and two other quite mature friends. Booked with hotel direct and got best price anywhere at 135 Euro with the breakfast. Email communication with the hotel may have gotten us the best rooms in the hotel. Note: TripAdvisor User for many years and very remiss about doing reviews. Must state that I do not think I have ever gone wrong using thier advice. We have traveled quite a bit; over 30 trips to Europe alone in the last 15 years. You need assess your own values and requirements. Also, to better reflect on my comments some particulars: Marriott Platinum and somewhat Americanized - not necessarily have to live with the natives or community. Stay at Marriotts when price and location are correct. Will spend a bit more, if Marriott location is right like Vienna Marriott and Renaissance Chancery Court London (very or too expensive at times); Marriott Milan, Italy is a good hotel, but not at the center of town, so we stayed at TripAdvisor recommended hotel on the next vist. Location, with price in mind, and the acceptable standards for an Americanized traveler are the foremost attributes. As for location, being in the heart of everything, dispite noise and crowds. When we stayed in Venice at the TripAdvisor Recommended Best Western Monte Carlo Hotel, the key deciding factor was a review that stated, if you are person that would not like staying in Times Square NYC, like I am, you do not want to stay here. That clinched my decision, and that is where we stayed and it was just great.H10-Universitat was the most perfect location of almost any hotel in Barcelona. It is a block from the Ramblas and Catalunya Square: Aeroport Bus Stop (3.90 Euro) the way to go, the two day on and off Tour Bus ( a must at 23 Euro), restaurants, huge Corte de Englais Department Store, and everything at your beckon call, including two Metro stops within a block. It also sits right on the corner of the renowned Gayborhood of Barcelona. Walking distance to most clubs and restaurants. This hotel location is probably better choice and less costly than the Axel, which appears very attractive, for gays who want to actually tour and visit. Good meals for the entire visit at moderate prices, but best two meals were in gay oriented, but open to all, restaurants. In Spain five or six times and best eating ever in Spain. Our hotel rooms adjoined in front and on main street of hotel 611 and 612 (seventh floor). With balcony doors open; it was noisy, but no problem for us, otherwise. It appears there are approximately 12 rooms on each floor. The eight front and rear rooms appear to be the largest , with the four center section rooms being small. The large rooms are a wonderful size for Europe at these prices. Beds were very firm. I prefer this, but maybe just a bit too hard for me. Bathrooms were superb. We always take our own washcloth to Europe, but second day hotel left them. Toletries were partcularly nice. Can't imagine what anyone's complaint would be about the glass opaque bathroom doors. Our companions had that in their adjoining room and it afforded all the privacy and are particularly attractive. Breakfast lavishly supplied, but in the European manner and tastes. We gave a 20 Euro gratuity for the breakfast staff at the end of our stay. A wonderful time in a beautiful city that turned out to be more interesting than ever suspected. I do not think, unless costs become a factor, that we would stay at or recommend any other hotel in Barcelona. We owe most of great choices, including this one to Trip Advisor and I hope this helps you.
