{"text":"A very good hotel in excellent surroundings I spent at the Owl Hotel 10 nights in August. My friend and I shared a twin room on the second floor. The room was spacious and comfortable, it had a big window overlooking a pretty garden, some trees and a nice building. Everything was clean and worked properly. We had a tv set, a desk, a chair and an armchair, a wardrobe. In the bathroom there were both bathtub and shower, towels were changed every day (if we wanted so), a hairdryer was provided. Of course our room was cleaned every morning.The breakfast room was big and looked out onto the same pretty garden we could see from our window. For breakfast we had a wide choice of hot and cold drinks, different types of bread, jam, spread, cheese, ham, cereals, etc. In short, not a cooked brakfast (except for hardboiled eggs) but a really substantial one. The staff were kind and helpful. The people at the reception were always ready to help everybody with advice on places to go, where to rent bycicles, the weather, etc.In the hotel there was also a small room with a pc provided with free internet connection, a bar and a nice common room with a tv.The location was just great. That part of the town is very close to the city centre and the canal belt, but it's quiet and beautiful. Trams 1, 2 and 5 stop near the hotel (all three of them go to the Central Station). You could easily reach Leidseplein on foot (5-10 minutes). In the surroundings there were all kinds of restaurants and shops, at least two supermarkets and two places where you could rent bikes. Moreover, the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum and Vondelpark were nearby. I have only one minor complaint: in my humble opinion the directions provided on the hotel website aren't very clear. In fact, before reaching the hotel we got lost several times. As for the price of the room, it wasn't certainly cheap, but I think it was quite fair, considered what we got, a good room in a lovely hotel in a convenient district of Amsterdam.
