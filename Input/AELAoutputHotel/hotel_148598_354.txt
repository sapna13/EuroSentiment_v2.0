{"text":"Don't hesitate for a nice vacation here Just returned from 4 days at the Westin Rio Mar. Family of 4, girls 10 and 12. It was a wonderful stay. I would like to second the sentiment of an earlier poster from NJ about some people having to complain about everything. There is very little to complain about regarding the things that this resort can control. The weather is obviously one (Fortunately, it was beautiful. Yes, the rain showers come and go but that is what the Caribbean is, especially in the summer. This eastern end of the island is definitely cooler than San Juan or Dorado). The preponderance of locals is another (A hotel is a fixed asset. They have 600 rooms to fill. Since it is the slow season for American tourists to visit, they do run deals for the locals and they do come, especially on the weekends. Gee, imagine that, Puerto Ricans like to go on vacation too and have enough money to do so√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√ßood for them. When tourists come to NYC, do they complain about all the local New Yorkers? Maybe, but that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the way it is. In the summer, I believe Americans will be in the minority at this resort. So what. If you want everyone to be like you, go to the socioeconomic targeted Disneyworld resort hotel of your choice. There were a few instances of loud and uncontrolled behavior by the local kids. This was, however, no worse than that exhibited by some spoiled American brats, a scene which unfortunately has become commonplace at many high end resorts.)Rooms √à√\u2020\u2022?Nice, large, clean, well-furnished in crisp Caribbean style. Heavenly beds were very comfortable. Nice size balconies, received a direct oceanfront upgrade by just asking upon check-in. No bed bugs. I agree with others that the bites, especially on kids, are a function of the tiny flies on the beach. They seemed to be present only at dusk. We did not go on the beach at night. Use bug repellent or just go from pool to ocean and back without lounging there. As you may read, bed bugs are becoming more of a problem worldwide, even at the Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons. Learn how to check before you settle in and unpack.Grounds √à√\u2020\u2022?Very nice, well-kept. Pools are clean and large. The √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√∫uiet√à√\u2020\u2022?pool has somewhat tired loungers with mats but for heaven√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ sake, put a towel over them. The larger √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Öctivity√à√\u2020\u2022?pool has new loungers that are much nicer than the typical white strapped vinyl variety. Pool service, beach bar, live music, activities such as aquatic aerobics, bingo, free hair braiding for the kids. And the Westin Kids Club, always a good thing. The beach is beautiful, soft sand, mild waves, warm water, clean, lifeguard on duty every day. Not many resorts bother with lifeguards anymore, even Hawaii. So the sand is tan and not white√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√®s there a problem with that?Restaurants √à√\u2020\u2022?What you would expect at a large resort. Basically average, occasionally great and sometimes disappointing. Always expensive compared to eating out off campus. But overall it was fine.Service √à√\u2020\u2022?Every single employee was helpful, upbeat, friendly, respectful and quick with a smile. Very rare anywhere today.Go, have a good time. Try to get a deal like the Escape package (we paid $209 with breakfast included for 2, all taxes, fees, tips included). If you overpay, then I guess you will always find something to complain about.
