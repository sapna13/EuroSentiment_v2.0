{"text":"A Bit of Heaven my wife and i had the pleasure to spent 7 wonderful days at the occidental grand in Puta Cana.before we left i had read alot of reviews about how it was.there were good and bad.Seeing the resort first hand is your best review.ALL IN ALL WONDERFUL!! HERE;S MY REVIEW,,,,, HERE'S 1 GOOD TIP, WEAR A RED SOX SHIRT,THEY LOVE THE SOX'S WE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL AT AROUND 3;30P.M.THEY CAN BE ALITTLE SLOW AT CHECK -IN TIME.,took us about 45min,but not a real big deal for me.Our room was in buliding 10,3rd floor overlooked the pool,lobby,pool bar,resturants were right there,buffet,and the stage where all the shows were ,to me great location!!!! our room was nice and very clean,bed was fine. we had a small fridge with soda water and beer.maid service was excellent( left her 2dollars and some in-expensive make-up every morning, and whatever we asked for we got. you have to remember these folks don't make much for all they do,and they have very long days.They work from sun-up to sun down.The whole resort is very clean, you don't see any litter around.The pools are great,the pool bar even better,with a wonderfulbar tender Alfraido,he new me by my first name after one visit with him.another good bartender is Wilson, in the lobby,2 great guys to look for when your there.the buffet i thought was very good,breakfast,lunch or dinnersome of the other resturants like the steak house ,not great.the mexican not bad,the Italian pretty good.The beach was very nice,and don't foget the beach bar. Also the have shows every night,don't miss the Michael Jackson show,you would swear its him,and sounds like him, and the dancers ,wonderful!!!!!there are alot of tour you can go on to.we went on the jeep saffari,very interesting if you want to see how the real people live,3rd world country,if you do go on it bring plenty of candy,because you will see hundreds of kids,its a good tour but check it out before you decide.The only negatives,,,,time share people in or near the lobby,can be a pain after awhile.but all in all can't wait to get back there , but for longer then 7 days,10maybe.again it was wonderful to be there.
