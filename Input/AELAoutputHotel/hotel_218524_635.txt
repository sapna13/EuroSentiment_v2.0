{"text":"Amazing! My wife and I found this to be absaloutely amazing. We were supposed to be at the new EdenH Real resort but they overbooked and we were compensated with the Excellence. This was a blessing. The food was all excellent. We found all the restaurants to be wonderful. We ate at almost all of them. We found Spice (Asian) to be the least of the restaurants, but everything else was awesome. Yes, as some have complained, the waiting tended to be long, but there was always a restaurant with a shorter wait, and it doesn't hurt to grab a few drinks while you wait for your seat. You have to remember that the alternative at other resorts is to get 2 or 3 nice meals all week and be stuck with the buffet for the remainder. The staff were awesome. We had no complaints whatsoever. At the restaurants they were excellent. Never waited long for service. I don't think that my wine or water glass were ever empty, they were constantly refilling.Room service staff were also great. We had tea and coffee sent to our room most mornings and even had breakfast sent one morning at 0630.Cleaning staff were great as well. Someone complained that they didn't get the extras but we left a dollar on the pillow and that got us plenty of extras. We had towel animals one day, flowers on our sink and counter, extra towels, extra water, coffee .... plenty of extras. One day we didn't get our room cleaned until later, but you have to understand the amount of rooms vs. cleaning staff is a big difference and they do a good job when they get there. Not every room can be cleaned before 10am. The grounds and facilities were wonderful. The beach was nice, with all the chairs and beds, hammocks, etc. The location is a tad disappointing due to the water. It is windy and rough, as others have mentioned. The waves can be very fun to play in, but you don't get the calm blue waters that we really wanted. There are lifeguards there constantly now and are vigilant in making sure people do not go out too far. Overall there is no way to complain about our experience. It was relaxing and enjoyable and I really feel people need to understand that this is not North America and there isn't perfect water and power ... sometimes we have power outages here in Ontario ... deal with it. You don't need electricity to sit on the beach and get a tan ...
