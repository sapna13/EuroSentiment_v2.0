{"text":"Best service in Asia My wife and I went on our honeymoon to Bali and stayed both at the Bali Hyatt and the Bali Ritz-Carlton. The Hyatt was fantastic, the Ritz-Carlton terrible. Upon arrival at the Bali Hyatt you are greeted by genuinely friendly staff. They come across as 'real people' rather than people who have just been trained to cater to you - and this means you get the friendliest, most efficient service I've experienced almost anywhere throughout your stay. The hotel itself is set in a huge garden that contains a great variety of plants (and birds! we were surprised by an owl coming straight at us on the first night :) fortunately it was more scared of us than we were of it). The architecture is 70s concrete - but it is covered by vines and plants which softens it immensely, so you feel much more like you're in a garden than a hotel. Rooms can feel a bit damp if you don't have your air-conditioning on - but there's little reason not to.There are 4 or so restaurants at the hotel, all of which served great food. We're pretty fussy about our food, which doesn't mean we expect haute cuisine at every meal, just insist on getting the basics right. So if you order a steak sandwich at the poolside, it should come pretty quickly and be tender steak, served with a genuine smile, right? Right. At the Bali Hyatt they do this kind of thing naturally. At the Ritz, we found out this kind of stuff was beyond them, and at twice the price. Go figure.We were due to spend 5 days at the Hyatt, then 5 days at the Ritz. After staying at the Ritz for one night we couldn't stand it any longer and went straight back to the Hyatt. We loved it.
