{"text":"Awesome trip!! Don't believe the negative reviews... This was my second time in Punta Cana. The first time was at a 5 star resort. Barcelo Dominican Beach is a 4 star. I would even go as far as saying that Barcelo Dominican Beach is better than the 5 star I went to. The food was better, the staff was friendlier, the ground were cleaner and over-all the look of the resort is superb. I cannot believe the reviews I saw of people bashing the staff and this resort. I have travelled a lot and am very fussy of the service I receive. But this resort surpased my expectations. I did not see any unhappy travellers during the week. Obviously, if you go there with a negative attitude, you will not enjoy everything Barcelo Dominican Beach has to offer. The only thing I found different on this resort, was the beach water. It was not as clear as the other beaches in Punta Cana. We had a windy week, so it might be due to that. There were a lot of fun activities on the beach as well as around the main pool. I would recommend bringing your own face cloths though. The maid only put two a day, but sometimes that is not enough if you're a girl wearing make up! The towels can be as rare as the facecloths too, so hang them to dry on your balcony when you're done. You might have to re-use them. They are trying to conserve water over there, so this is why they do not offer towels galore!The Japanese restaurant is a MUST. You won't be eating anything weird, I promise. It'll just be Tofu soup for appetizer, Sushi and then the HUGE plate of stir-fry the cook makes right at your table. As per buffet, we found the buffet attached to the lobby to be the best one when it comes to variety. If you want to make a reservation to A La Carte, I suggest you go early in your week. They pack up fast, since they do not hold many tables in them. The reservation table is right next to this buffet. The lobby has the best drinks! If you like tropical drinks, you might want to try Banana Mamas, Dirty Monkey, Coco Loco, Pina Colada (of course), Miami Vice, and Cuba Libre (fancy rhum and coke!)....Oh and the beer is also excellent. For wine enthousiasts like myself, you might get disapointed. But wait there is hope. The hotel offers a free shuttle to the Palma Real Mall. This mall is amazing. It also has a nice liquor store with a variety of wine. So you won't be stuck drinking their Italian house wine. Overall, this was a great resort. We were very satisfied with the service, the food, the drinks, and the atmosphere! We would go back for sure. I am still shocked by people who go there and complain about everything. Obviously some people just don't know when to really take a vacation.
