{"text":"Do not believe all of the negative reviews We have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Gran Melia! I can not say enough about the property...beautiful pools, spacious rooms, most comfortable beds I've ever encountered in a hotel, serene and stylish lobbies, nice fitness center and spa. Biggest tip of the year... pay the extra for Royal Service! Butlers to draw a bath (nightly if you wish) in your own jetted tub on your balcony with candles and flower petals, aromatherapy pillows with your choice of scent, free drinks from 6-9 in the royal service lounge, free all day coffee and tea in the lounge, free continental breakfast (you can upgrade to the hot buffet for $7), free palapas at the adults only Royal Service pool (these rent for $50 a day at the main pool). The staff are wonderful; Hector, Sergio, Angel and Leslie you all rock! Thanks also to Yahdira (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) for taking the time to answer many questions before we arrived. A very special thank you to Joshua, Royal Service Manager. I have never encountered someone who truly cares about the service of his guests the way he does. I hope the Gran Melia management realizes what a gem they have in him. About the food...we ate at Nami twice. Dinner the first time was good and the sushi was awesome and very reasonably priced. The Nami roll was outstanding! Veggie wrap, chicken wings and the burgers from the Wet Bar at pool are all good choices! I would skip the dinner buffet. Unfortunately did not get to try the Italian restaurant. If you are looking for a lot of beach activity this is not the place for you. However, if you're looking for a beautiful resort to relax and regroup with Royal Service (they literally make you feel like royalty) then I would highly recommend the Gran Melia. I can't wait to go back.
