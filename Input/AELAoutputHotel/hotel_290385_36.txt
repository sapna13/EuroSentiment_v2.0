{"text":"Very nice Paris hotel - wonderful location My wife and I stayed 5 nights at the Le Walt in January, 2007. We booked our room based on information from multiple sources, including tripadvisor. I would say that the previous reviews of this hotel are spot on and that the photos accurately depict the hotel and its environs.Positives:1. The location is great. The 7e is a quiet residential location with terrific metro access to all of Paris. The Ecole Militaire metro stop is literally 10 yards to the left of the front door, so a visitor can be anywhere in central Paris within 20 minutes. The multi-day fare card is a terrific bargain.2. Numerous bistros and the Rue Cler street market are wonderful for a light morning breakfast or an afternoon coffee. We did not partake of the hotel breakfast, so I cannot comment.3. The staff was friendly and appropriately helpful; a cab for our departure to CDG was arranged the night before and was on time.4. We had a deluxe 4th floor room (estimated 200-250 square feet - good sized for Europe) in the rear of the hotel, overlooking the garden. The room was quiet. We did hear construction noise from an adjacent building on three mornings, but that's beyond the hotel's control. The metro rumble was faint and not terribly bothersome (see previous posts). There was absolutely no noise from adjacent rooms or the hall.5. Our king size bed was very comfortable and was among the best we've had anywhere. The linens were excellent.6. The bathroom size was adequate and updated with towel warmers and nice toiletries. The towels were thick and very comfortable.7. Communication with staff was not difficult - they readily spoke English well. Email communication prior to the visit was timely and helpful.Neutal\/negatives:1. The hotel decor is on the contemporary side, so don't expect a country French or antique-laden experience; if you're looking for that type of environment, search elsewhere.2. If I were a business traveler, the lack of in-room internet access would be a negative.3. Closets are on the small side.4. We didn't do room service (I'm not sure why anyone visiting Paris would want to!); the menu looked a little bare bones.5. If you're looking for night life, book something in the 5e or 6e.Overall, this is a very nice property - not 5 star, but definitely above average. For first time visitors, as were we, this is a really good hotel. On my next trip, we might want to try something different and a little more French, but we'd be happy to stay at Le Walt and recommend it without hesitation.
