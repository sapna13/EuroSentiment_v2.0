{"text":"Anywhere but here First off, this hotel is NOT 24 hours all inclusive. Once the restaurants close and room service ends at 11, there's nothing to eat but mystery meat hot dogs and hamburgers that sit out by the pool until 2 am. There is a huge communication barrier because the resort caters mostly to European tourists. The beach is basically a topless beach, so this isn't really a family resort. The staff for the most part is not really helpful, and are downright rude at times.Food: The buffet was somewhat edible. I'm not that much of a snob and went with 5 guys who basically will eat anything, and we were forced to subsist on french fries and sub-par pasta. The meats were always questionable, and the room service was inedible, sandwiches and stale nachos (stale tortilla chips with cold cheeze whiz). The reservation system was annoying too. If you didn't make your reservations between 7-10 am that day, you were stuck with the buffet. Even if you went to make reservations, by 9 am most restaurants are full.Grounds: The hotel itself is pretty to look at and the beach is incredible, but the service and the food were so lacking that its not really worth it.Drinks: Awful. There was rarely blended ice in the mixed drinks. Stick to beer and rum and cokes.Excursions: DO NOT book excursions with the hotel beds representative (MAYA) located in the front lobby of the hotel. We went on this Laguna de limon tour which costed 100 dollars per person. We were promised a scenic drive up a mountain, a swimming at untouched beaches, cigar rolling and lobsters. Fine, the mountain view was nice, but the beach was far from untouched (the hotel beach wa much nicer). There was styrofoam and cups everywhere. We were forced to spend about an hour or two in gift shops. The tour guide did not give any information on any of the sights, the lobster was cooked at least a day before and was inedible, and they claimed that a group of 5 could only roll 2 cigars. We paid 100 dollars so that each of us could roll a cigar. The worst however was being forced to watch a cockfight. This was not included in the brochure and when we went back to confront the Hotel Beds rep about it, all Maya could say was, but there was no blood. I can understand if it was in the brochure or explained to us before going on the tour. Aside from my personal feelings about animal cruelty, I don't like paying for things or being subjected to things that were not advertised in the brochure. And guess what?! There was blood. There was a bloodied featherless chicken getting its butt kicked (not my idea of an excursion).Additional things that can't be categorized include: the one towel per day rule; the maids coming into your rooms at all times of the day and\/or night, even if the do not disturb sign was up. The room constatly smelled like mildew and the maids would turn all the power off everyday. Sucks when you have an alarm clock that has to be reset every two hours.Please spend your money elsewhere. Go to Mexico, go to Jamaica, go to the Bahamas, or the Virgin islands or Aruba. I will never return to the DR again, ever.
