{"text":"Great Value, but Firstly, the hotel, in my experience, uses simply, the name, Hotel Europa, as opposed to Hotel Residencia Europa. This maybe significant as they are not listed with the usual booking sites.I believe it is privately owned and they apparently want to do their thing without involving fees or discounts to anyone.This however is NOT a drawback as their rates are well below the average.Like most reviewers, we found our six nights spent in a clean, modern hotel, well run and friendly. The bathroom in particular was new. Location is in the very center of Madrid, indeed, in the very center of Spain. Restaurants, shops, Metro, sights, museums are all within easy walking distance.The room came with cable TV and free Internet access via a cable (wireless and a laptop are also free in the lobby). Three things detracted from our comfort: We had a larger room facing the Puerta del Sol and noise was a problem from street musicians despite the soundproof (almost) glass windows. The music ends at 11 PM but be prepared to be serenaded until then. A smaller room facing away from the square would be the only remedy. The mattress on the bed was so hard and unsupportive we both had back pains each morning. Nothing chronic, they went away, but be aware. While there was more than enough space in our room, only straight backed desk chairs were provided. No sofa or easy chair were available at the end of a busy day. Aside from these caveats, it was a fine place to stay, the savings were considerable and we would return.http:\/\/hoteleuropa.es\/index.en.html ","annotations":[{"endOffset":851,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":844}]}
