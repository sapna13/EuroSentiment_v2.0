{"text":"Warning: early departure If you decide to check out early, as we did, management will tell you their policy is to charge your credit card for unused nights, no matter the reason. We had booked a very expensive 2 BR suite for a 4 night stay (reading reviews at tripadvisor) for our family. We found both beds to be uncomfortably hard, however, and unyielding. When we told the staff, they sent up a quilt to put on top of the mattress under the sheet, which did not solve the problem, and then even another mattress, but of similar design. After two nights of poor sleep, we told management that we planned to check out, but the manager charged our credit card anyway for one additional night claiming that the cancellation policy precluded early departure. Now the email we received at confirmation outlined the allowed cancellation period prior to arrival but specified nothing about an early departure penalty. This was an expensive penalty. We were happy with our change to the Westin Excelsior, however, where for about the same rate we had two comfortable rooms with excellent beds. We also had a view of the Arno, and preferred the Westin's quieter neighborhood. The palazzo is across the Arno ('Oltro Arno') right on a bus route with a stop directly in front of the hotel. The palazzo's strong points: a friendly staff , the fun of staying is place which has a history, and the exceptional breakfast t (included). However, there are many reasons why a stay in a hotel may be cut short, even if opinions about beds will vary. In this hotel, you may end up paying for nights you do not stay if for some reason you have to leave early. For this lack of flexibility, I would not return to this hotel. ","annotations":[]}
