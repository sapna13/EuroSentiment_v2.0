{"text":"Room for improvement We stayed at the Grand Oasis from 6th - 12th June 2008, and I can say that it was a mixed experience. We arrived to be greeted with a nice cold fruit punch and a fast check in service. We immediately upgraded to block 7 (room 7220) for US$50 per night, as we had read the reviews on this site before leaving. Not having seen any other rooms I can't comment on them, but we were really happy with the room we received, except for the small sand ants that seemed to congregate around the coffee pot. We reported this to reception and they offered to fumigate our room but couldn't offer us alternative accommodation! We declined as we didn't want to die of toxic poisoning, and lived with the ants. However to be fair we weren't over-run, and avoiding the coffee pot worked a treat. The view was amazing and we overlooked the beach, with a lovely balcony and inside and outside Jacuzzis. The restaurants were hit and miss, the American Grill was the worst, we waited over 20 minutes to be served, and eventually left after being ignored by several waiters. I also asked for wine to be told no wine and then have the tables either side of us (both with Spanish speaking guests) served white. I'm prepared to be generous and say that it was perhaps a language barrier, but I discovered later on that being an English speaker made you a second class citizen as some waiters would serve Spanish speaking guests first, and they had a habit of queue jumping. However the remainder of the staff were really helpful and courteous - I guess it just depended who you got on a particular day. The Italian restaurant in comparison was fantastic, the food, service and wine (yep got some eventually) was wonderful, and I can only praise the D'mario. The resort should look to D'Marios as their benchmark, and the service would improve 10 fold.The only other restaurant we tried was Windows with a buffet style theme. I've read a few reviews that stated the food there was cold, and while I agree that it could have been hotter, it was a buffet and there was always fresh fruit, vegetables and salads on offer. We ate more in there than other restaurants as we always found something we liked and enjoyed the flexibility of not having to book a specific time slot to eat. The pools were clean and the bars were always very very generous with their measures. But you must be aware that there is a tipping culture. We tipped the cleaner $5 per day (more than normal, but I know how messy my boyfriend is), and hoped for a more special service. We received the minimum, no extra cokes or beers and the number of towels we received depended on the day. But the room was always spotless and this to me was more important. Yes there was seaweed on the beach but there were staff cleaning every day, and it really wasn't too bad. Finally the one and only thing that I felt really let the resort down, were the sellers. We were badgered all the time, and although we did buy a few items in the end we felt continuously pressured. One of the shop keepers tried ripping us off by trying to charge us 85 peso to 1 US$, instead of the ex. rate of 33 - 35. We argued, and told him take 35 or leave it and he changed his tune. I suppose that you get people everywhere trying it on, but it did leave a bitter taste in my mouth. To be fair though I don't know how much influence the hotel has over the sellers.To summarise if you speak Spanish or French and don't mind tipping a buck or two for everything then you'll have a great time. Otherwise it might be a bit hit or miss.
