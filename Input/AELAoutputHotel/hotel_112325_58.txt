{"text":"Charming hotel with a friendly, helpful staff The Cartwright was my husband's choice for a surprise 25th wedding anniversary get-away. I'm always the one making travel arrangements so imagine my surprise when he found this gem! From the minute we walked into the lobby I was taken with this charming hotel. Check-in was quick and the staff was friendly and helpful. Since we arrived early in the morning, our room was not ready. We were offered breakfast, maps and pointed in the right direction to begin exploring the city. The Cartwright is located two blocks off Union Square (shopping) and on the Powell cable car line. Nice walk to Chinatown and onto Fisherman's Warf. Easy to connect with buses, streetcars and trolleys to explore the rest of the city. The Cartwright has maintained it's vintage look while upgrading with modern conveniences. The rooms were clean, nicely decorated and quite pleasant. Very comfy bed. In fact, this was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on in a hotel! Lots of fluffy pillows. I almost didn't want to get up in the morning! Bathrooms are small but clean. Water pressure in shower was good. Thick towels and robes were provided. Breakfast is included in the room rate and consists of yogurt, fruit, cereal, breads, waffles, juice and coffee. Roomy breakfast area to relax, eat and read the morning paper. We enjoyed the afternoon 'wine receptions' and had a great time talking to other guests. My favorite things about The Cartwright Hotel were: Friendly, helpful staff, WONDERFUL bed and pillows and I loved opening the windows and hearing the sounds of the city- especially the ding-ding of the trolley. Good value-good location. I'm ready to go back already!
