{"text":"Clean, cozy, centrally located, and extremely friendly staff We booked three rooms at this hotel for four nights, December 17 to 21, and enjoyed our stay immensely. The fact that the elevator and the stairs were undergoing an overhaul was only a minor inconvenience. In fact everything was finished on the day we left. The rooms were spacious, although simply furnished, and the beds were new and comfortable. The bathrooms were spotless. The hotel is well located for travelers arriving at the train station and is about a five minute brisk walk along a very crowded street with narrow sidewalks. Despite the proximity of the heavily traveled street, Via Nazionale, the double glazed windows keep all the sound out. Rooms in the front have a rather uninspiring view of the neon light of a sex shop but rooms in the back look out onto the beautiful Duomo and the Campanile, a ten minute walk away.The area around the hotel is multi-ethnic with several Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, even Kurdish shops and restaurants. There are many small restaurants, both Italian and Oriental, offering reasonable prices in what is a very expensive city. A meal for less than ten euros is not the exception.The neighborhood might look rather gray but is very safe for walking at night.The self-service breakfast is included and is perfectly adequate with unlimited coffee, croissants, bread, jams, and assorted cereals, even Muesly, which is not common in small hotels. There is a small lounge with beverages in a fridge sold at cost. Internet use is available and was free, perhaps because it was the low season. The best part of the hotel is the staff. Everyone speaks English and Paula, the feminine half of the couple owning and running the hotel, has native speaker fluency, having been trained as a tour guide. In fact the two owners, Paula and Jean Paulo, spend most of the day at the hotel attending to the guests. Both are knowledgeable of local culture and can help any tourist choose the best sites to visit. With the owners always eager to talk and help out, even sitting down to an afternoon snack with us, we felt like we were staying with a family and not in a hotel.
