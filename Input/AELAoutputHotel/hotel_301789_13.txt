{"text":"Blissfull stay Our stay at the Westin was uneventful and completely stress free. My spouse  I were arriving in Tokyo on separate flights landing in separate airpots and we were anxious about getting to the hotel in the middle of the night. But there was no need for us to worry, upon arrival at the hotel doors, our luggage was whisked away, check-in was fast and friendly and we are in our room in no time. Our room was on the top floor (21st) and we had panoramic view of Tokyo.The room itself was western-styled and bigger than a standard Japanese hotel room. The bathroom was elegant without being ostentatious. And as expected, everything in the room was clean and in-order.Service was top-class. Our calls to the service express office were promptly answered and the required service we wanted met. The business centre staff went out of their way and lent us their office computer to check emails when all the terminals were being used by other guests. The consierge was also very helpful in providing maps, timetables and other information.The location of the hotel is less hectic than say Shinjuku or Shibuya, but the with the train  subway station less than a 10 minute walk away one can easily travel to other parts of the city. The area around the hotel also has a lot of interesting places to see, the Ebisu Garden Place is across the street, restaurants abound and there are a number of hip places\/shops like the Tokyo store of Maison Martin Margiela.
