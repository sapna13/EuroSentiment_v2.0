{"text":"Great Hotel, Staff and Location Wow - per all reviewers, the location is fantastic with a view of the impressive Pantheon. We were upgraded to a superior room with a view and while I can't comment on comparisons for other Paris hotels, we were very comfortable (2 big pieces of luggage) with a good size bathroom and shower. Even though the Pantheon square sometimes was busy with traffic, the room was insulated well enough where we hardly noticed any noise, so we slept very well. The wireless internet connection in our room came in very handy.We were greeted by a very friendly receptionist (merci beaucoup Farrah - you are wonderful) who spoke good English and helped us with directions around Paris. All the people who worked at the hotel around the clock were friendly and courteous and our room was nicely cleaned and sheets changed every day.We did try their breakfast the first morning and there was a great selection of fruit, cheeses, croissants, jellies, and some cured meats. Coffee was great, though I dont think you will find bad coffee anywhere in Paris!Some observations on the neighbourhood: Plenty of cafes selling great sandwiches to go (handy for a quick lunch), a BNP Paribas with ATMs,  pharmacy all on Rue Soufflot. There are also small supermarkets in the area where we bought fruit  juice for our on-the-go exploration of Paris. We ate a couple of times at the Comptoir restaurant and the food was decent - good portions for the price (watchout, the salads are humungous and will easily feed two). We were dissappointed with the crepes at Crepes A-Go-Go which were way too sweet for our taste for breakfast. Having the Luxembourg RER station located at a convenient walking distance was a plus and that's how we travelled to\/from CDG as well as to\/from Versailles. Of course, don't miss a visit to the Pantheon; the tour to the upper levels of the Pantheon is well worth it. And close by, Rue Mouffetard is also a fun street to explore. There was also a small church on a street north of the Pantheon square that was holding classical music concerts which we discovered by accident - it was a delightful treat. Not to be missed sights like Notre Dame, Saint Chapelle and the Seine are all within comfortable, enjoyable walking distance.Paris is an awesome city to explore and we ran into very friendly, nice Parisians. This was our first trip and definitely wont be the last and yes, we would stay at this hotel again.
