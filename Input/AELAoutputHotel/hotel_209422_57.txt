{"text":"Hilton Prince Kuhio was GREAT!! I stayed at the Hilton Waikiki Prince Kuhio Hotel in March 2008 and plan to stay there again when I return to Hawaii. This hotel is located in the heart of Waikiki and it's easy to walk to all the shops and restaurants in the area. The staff was really friendly, and did everything possible to make me feel at home, especially since I was there for business and not traveling with family. They greeted me by name every time I entered or left the hotel. I had dinner in the lobby bar one night and talked to other repeat guests that make this hotel their home away from home. When I mentioned that I liked the music playing in the lounge area, the asst manager even loaned me the CD to make a copy! The rooms are decorated in a new, contemporary way, and I took pictures for ideas for my own home. The rooms have a large screen tv and very comfortable bedding. The views from the walk-out balconies are fantastic, especially on the higher floors. While the location is one block off the beach, this was not a problem as beach access is great. They have a full continental breakfast available for Hilton Honors members, and there's no cost to join, so it's a good way to save a few bucks on breakfast everyday--especially for families. There were a lot of families staying at the hotel, as well as couples and business people. The room rate was lower here than at the other Hilton or Doubletree hotels and in a better, more central location. Overall, my experience was great and I would definitely recommend staying at the Hilton Prince Kuhio! ","annotations":[]}
