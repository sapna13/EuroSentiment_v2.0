{"text":"Problems solved, great stay! We stayed at the Milestone hotel in London with our two sons, aged 5 and 8, after a previous fantastic stay we had as a couple about a month ago. We booked two connecting rooms, but were faced with some serious problems upon arrival. The rooms were on the fifth floor, that was recently refurbished, but evidently this process was not quite finished. There were no locks on the outer door, the rooms were really extremely small, the DVD-player was not working. TV-channels were mixed up, the airco was out of order, etc. All staff members were extremely helpfull and kind, but the problems remained. That evening we told the Milestone this was not worth their five star rating and their splending reputation and invited them to come up with a solution the next morning. The solution they offered was great: we were given a fantastic spacious two bedroom apartment in the adjacent building, that they normally only rent out on a weekly basis (do they really?) and we had a very pleasant stay for the remainder of our holidays in London.The Milestone is a fantastic hotel. What really sets them out is their service and the attitude of the staff. It is however - by any standard - expensive. Breakfast in the hotel with two adults and two kids can easily cost you near √ä√£¬¢ 100..... We believe that the Milestone is a great hotel if you want to spend a romantic luxury weekend in a (junior) suite in a boutique London hotel and budget is not is not your first choice. We have our doubts about the standard rooms, based on what we experienced. We later learned from staff that the rooms on the fifth floor were hardly used. Also, the hotel was not fully booked during our stay. Yes, they made a terrific response to our complaints, but one question remains: why did they try to give us these rooms in the first place and did not offer us the available apartment right away.....?
