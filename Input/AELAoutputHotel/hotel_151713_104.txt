{"text":"A Great Value Just returned from a family vacation\/birthday celebration in PR. We stayed at the Embassy Suites for 3 nights over the Thanksgiving holiday. Many of the previous posts accurately described our stay. The rooms were VERY CLEAN, the staff was FRIENDLY and HELPFUL (Ian was great). When we requested a room with a view, we were given a suite on the 8th floor overlooking the pool, a body of water (wasn't the ocean?) and could see the mountains in the distance. Very nice. Although I prefer beach front hotels, oceanview rooms and balconies, the Embassy Suites (which doesn't have any of these) still delivered a tropical feel.The location was good; didn't mind being next to the airport. We couldn't hear the planes at all inside the hotel, but could outside at the pool. Urban dwellers won't miss a beat. We rented a car so the location was great, next to the highway and main Isla Verda drag.Foodies will not be impressed with the breakfast buffet or manager's nightly reception. Definitely quantity over quality. The buffet is reminiscent of college cafeteria food. Vegans should skip the buffet all together, unless bring your own rice\/soy milk for cereal. Ask for the basic mixed drinks and you will fare well, ie., rum and coke. Also be strategic, because the lines can be very long -- which cancels out free because your time\/energy is worth something, especially on vacation. Run over to the El San Juan for GREAT mixed\/frozed drinks and atmosphere.Definitely a great group\/family hotel when you have to accomodate various budgets.
