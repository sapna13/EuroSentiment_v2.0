{"text":"Friendliest staff ever. We kicked off our honeymoon at Hotel41 on the 4\/9\/06 for three nights. (reasonable rates through Bookings.org). On arrival they gave us a free upgrade to a larger corner room as it was our honeymoon which was a really nice touch. The room wasn't a bad size by UK standards. Contemporary style decor, Belgian bed linnen, fridge (which you can put your own drinks in or order from room service), TV\/DVD, decent size shower room with walk-in shower. All spotless. We liked the bar on ground floor - very stylish although no American beer,only imported. I had to drink Speckled Hen! Complimentary continental help-yourself breakfast served there every morning - bagels, cheese, jelly, pastries, croissants, tea,coffee, juice - all good.The reception staff, doormen, breakfast lady were really friendly and personal. They really made us feel at home.The location is fantastic - right in the middle of the action - theatres, restaurants, bars all close. If you want recommendations, ask reception. Short walk, (about 20 mins) to Empire State, Central Park, Grand Central station, or use subway at the end of street. The central bus station is one block (5mins) away.Getting there from JFK. Get a cab. Fixed price to anywhere in Manhatten works out at about $50 dollars inc. toll and tip. An official gives you a ticket at the airport listing the exact price fixed by the council. They cannot rip you off, honk their horn or make unnecessary noise! Good price for approx. 45min journey. Returning to airport from hotel. Taxis have to use the meter so get a bus from the central bus station. They leave approx. every half hour. Tickets $15 each. Tell your driver the airline and he'll drop you at your terminal.Rod the Dog.
