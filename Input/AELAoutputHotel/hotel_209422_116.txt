{"text":"Great location When we got there at 8am from our 10hr flight, our room wasn't ready so the Front Desk Manager arranged to have a courtesy room ready for us in 1\/2hr. We went to MAC where I tried the Loco Moco which is a gross dish (burger and rice with gravy?!). Husband loved the Rueben sandwich. They gave us a complimentary upgrade from an Executive Mountain to the Executive Ocean view, which was really lovely. It was our 10yr wedding anniversary and everything went very smoothly. The staff were lovely, particularly a guy and girl on the front desk. We didn't get their names, but they were really helpful. Especially when our airline cancelled our return flight, and they arranged it so we could stay in our room an extra night, despite new guests arriving. Only bad thing was the executive breakfast. It was in a temporary room (maybe that's why), but it was the same food EVERY day - bagels, pastries, cereal and yoghurt. We were there for 9 days and got very sick of bagels. Swimming pool area was VERY windy, which was nice in the middle of a hot day, but a bit too cool in the afternoon. The hotel is a short block to the beach (pick up a bottle of water and tub of pineapple at the ABC store en route). Bus stop is also right near hotel. Short trip to Ala Moana shopping centre, which has an official post office stamp dispenser on the ground floor near some sports store. Wish we'd done the ATV tour of the Ko'olau Mountains. It is beautifully breathtaking. We did 2 tours with the E Noa group - they are great people! Their drivers are so friendly, knowledgeable and the smaller groups keeps things personal. Highly recommended.All in all, a great way to spend 9 days, a nice hotel with great staff, would stay again. Although I do wonder why we didn't get the complimentary water and cupcakes at turndown that someone else mentioned.
