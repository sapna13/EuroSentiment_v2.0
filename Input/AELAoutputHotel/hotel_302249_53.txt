{"text":"Superb Resort, Outstanding Service! Our trip was so pleasurable because of The Ritz. From the moment of our arrival to the check-in, we were made to feel special and welcome. The resort overlooking the spectacular Indian Ocean is situated up the cliff. We were overwhelmed by the size of the resort- private beach, stunning Ocean Beach Pool (saltwater, A pool you MUST at least see!), 4 swimming pools and even a separate children√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ pool with waterslides (My boy enjoyed!). Jimbaran Bay is The Place to watch the sunset. Its even better to do it in Ritz,a lying in posh √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√áeds√à√\u2020\u2022?near the Ocean Beach Pool. As its location is exclusive (right at the end of the road), so there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ no way you can venture out without a transport. The resort provides free shuttle to Kuta Centre near Discovery Shopping Centre, book at least a day in advance as it may be packed. If I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ recall wrongly √à√\u2020\u2022?The van leaves resort @10am, 11.30am, 1.30pm  3pm. Return ends at 3.30 or so. Taxi to Kuta is about Rp40,000 (run by meter). Its easy to get taxi to  fro. Many taxi drivers we spoke to say they wait for hours to get a passenger. One told us he had been plying the streets of Kuta for 3 hours before we flag him down. Being Ritz, expect to pay a price for food  drinks. A plate of Nasi Goreng (Fried Rice) with tax costs Rp153,000. I highly recommend seafood at the northern warang, Jalan Pantai Kedonganan. Restaurants are situated near the beach with fine and clean sand. Its less crowded and looks cleaner than the southern warang near Four Seasons. We tried the Fortuin Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ and thought the food was very good. Lobster at Rp 32,000\/100g, seafood fried rice Rp50,000. We ate 1 lobster 700g, 1 grouper 1kg (enough for 2 adults 1 child) comes with rice, fries, soup, vege with tax Rp 371,000. We realized that the restaurant provide free transport to  fro hotel only when we were there. Call the restaurant @ 0361 709034 or Diska (One of the partner√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ son) @081805583960. They√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be more than happy to fetch. Anyway, we spent most of our time at the hotel enjoying the resort as much as we can!
