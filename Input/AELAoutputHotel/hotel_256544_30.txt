{"text":"Great location, OK hotel, poor food Firstly, its in an awesome location - if you want to be by Circular Quay, Rocks, Opera House, etc this hotel is great for that. but...................the hotel is not up to Four Seasons standard. If you are expecting immpecable service, 5 star attention and the finest food then you'll be dissapointed. I'd say it was 4 star at best, and in some areas (food) its 3 star. The hotel is perfectly comfortable and clean if a little dated but is not as luxurious as a Four Seasons usually is.The outdoor hotel pool and spa are also good, but again dated and the pool service is OK but yet again not up to the Four Seasons brand. The ajoining Spa and treatments are very good, especially by Sydney standards.My one area of criticism is the food. The restaurants have terrible service (especially at Breakfast) and the quality of food is exceptionally poor for a 5 star hotel. Its no coincidence the restaurants are rarely busy. I'm amazed the managment hasn't spotted this and attempted to improve the food and service. I've stayed in most Sydney hotels in my 7 years of business and holiday travel and all in all this is a perfectly good hotel, in a great location, with OK service However, it isn't worthy of the Four Seasons brand and is letting them down. If you do stay here make sure you get good rates and don't be persuaded into paying top prices in return for the usual Four Seasons quality, as you won't find that quality at this Four Seasons.
