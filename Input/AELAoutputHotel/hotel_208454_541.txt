{"text":"Very Nice Facility \/ Great Midtown Location We decided to visit NYC to celebrate my wife's birthday. Wanting to really get to enjoy the city we decided to spend 8 nights, which was to be the longest continuous stay for us at any one hotel. So, of course, I wanted to choose a place with a good reputation and convenient to many of the sites we intended to visit. We were not disappointed!The staff was professional and friendly throughout the duration of our stay. Our room was very clean and tidy upon check-in and remained that way during our entire visit (as did the rest of the hotel facilities). While the restaurant, room service and lounge were all a bit pricey, everything we ordered was top quality and the drinks at the bar were enjoyably long pours.We utilized the expertise of Daniel and other concierge staff for restaurant suggestions, a hard to get reservation and general info\/tips about the local scene. All of the recommendations and advice were right on the money, with one exception (a Thai-fusion restaurant at the Thompson Hotel, which was a bit too trendy for mid-forty-somethings and the food fusion was more like fizzle). The only problem we encountered during our stay was a malfunction with our in-room safe. A simple call to maintenance was all it took and within minutes a supervisor was at our door to assess the situation. Within a few seconds he called a technician via his two-way radio and moments later the problem was fixed. The whole thing didn't even take ten minutes. A nice touch of professionalism was that the supervisor remained right there until the matter was completely resolved to our satisfaction.Get this one: Upon being presented with our final bill at checkout we were stunned to find that the hotel was actually issuing a credit to our account . They applied a lower rate for our room than the rate we had reserved (and paid) in advance. With getting nearly a 15% reduction over an eight night stay, it was as much a welcomed surprise as it was a first! When we return to New York the first place I will check for availability is the Sofitel. It is a very nice place to stay, with a great midtown location and a courteous staff that makes you feel welcomed. What more could you want?
