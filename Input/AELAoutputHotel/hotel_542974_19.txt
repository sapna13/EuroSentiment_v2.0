{"text":"Decent hotel I stayed there for several nights a little while ago for business . . . Positives:- Hotel is relatively clean and new- Hotel staff are courteous and as helpful as they can be (some know english a little better than the others but I give them all points for effort).-Breakfast is fine (never crowded, that's for sure).- Decent location; area may at first seem a little dicey but after spending a little time walking around you'll realize that the area is fine. It's also within walking distance to a number of things to see (such as Las Ramblas, martime museum, etc). - Easy to use, free wi-fi internet (bring your laptop!). The front desk can issue you a username\/password to connect. Negatives:My room was VERY small. Of course it kept me out doing things which ended up being better for me in the end.No room service.Overall, I'd say it was a decent value (especially compared to the very expensive Grand Marina where several of my colleagues stayed -- and they charge an extra $29 E a day just for the internet access). I'd also highly recommend taking one of those Turist buses (with the open tops). They continually run along designated routes in the city and you can get 1 and 2 day passes with unlimited on and off privileges during the 1 or 2 day period. The blue line is the shorter one but still has MANY interesting stops in Barcelona (and from the open air top you see things that you couldn't see in a car, taxi, or even walking). In my opinion Barcelona is a great city to visit (although not great like Paris, but then what is?) ","annotations":[]}
