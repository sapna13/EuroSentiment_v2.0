{"text":"Not bad, not great When we got to our room, there was no power. You need an extra key card to keep the power on in the room, but ours didn't work. We went to the front desk to get another key and it worked fine after that. We tried to break down some money, because we only had $100 bills and wanted smaller bills to tip. They told us to come back the next day. The next day, the same story. The next day, come back later. We couldn't tip anyone for the first 3 days because they couldn't break down our money. Finally, the day when we could tip our maid, she didn't leave us any water or towels. It took several phone calls and a trip to the front desk to finally get it. The other big problem was the vendors. They approach you on the beach, on the resort, on the excursions...They are very aggresive and eventually you just have to ignore them. Other than that, the room was very nice, the food was decent, the resort was very clean and nice, and the beach was beautiful. The staff were ok, not extremely helpful, but not unfriendly either. We went to the seafood restaurant and the food was ok, but the service was unbeatable, very impressive. You do have to take a trolley to the beach if you are staying in the club part, but it is only a 5 minute ride at most, or you can walk it in 10 minutes. We didn't find this to be a huge inconvience as we would spend many hours at the beach anyway. Overall, I would say this resort was somewhat disappointing, but not terrible. Would I go back? Probably not.
