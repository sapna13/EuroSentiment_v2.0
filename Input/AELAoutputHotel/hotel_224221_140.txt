{"text":"Lovely hotel and staff, except for hotel room ventilation\/heating system Our party of three stayed five nights in a Jnr Suite at the Library Hotel in early January. We had made a room floor request when we booked through the hotel's website, but we did not get any of the three we requested. However, check in was smooth and quick. Room Accommodation:The Jnr Suite was adequate, though space was limited. We shifted the coffee table to the side and used the sofabed and also the king size bed. The king size bed was very comfortable, though the sofabed could have had a better mattress. The bathroom was a nice size with plenty of essential items including shoe shine, cottonbuds, and the usual soaps and shampoo etc. We also got two complimentary bottles of water in the bathroom each day. The street noise wasn't too bad from our 6th floor room. Our only negative with our stay was the psycho ventilation\/heating system in our room - the first two nights were freezing and the last three nights were swelteringly hot. No matter how you adjusted the temperature control it did what it liked.Business centre and wi-fi:We brought our own laptop and found the free wi-fi access useful. And the room safe was big enough to securely store our laptop when we went out. We also used the free business cetnre on the 2nd floor which had a printer stocked with fresh paper. Very handy for online check-in and also printing out information for sightseeing etc.Reading Room, breakfast and refreshments:The 2nd floor Reading Room where breakfast and refreshments are served is fantastic. A brightly lit and well-furnished room that looks onto Madison Ave, and also down towards the NY Public Library. We used this room constantly as the Jnr Suite can get a little claustrophobic with three people. The breakfast is wonderfully prepared and presented, with a great selection for a continental breakfast, and the staff go our of their way to accommodate. Throghout the day you can also enjoy complimentary teas, coffees, pastries, biscuits, and fruits (usually apples, bananas and oranges). The wine and cheese is pretty good too - about 5 different kinds of cheeses, two choices of wine, grapes and bread, biscuits. The best thing is that you have a friend or family in NYC meeting you, they are welcome to enjoy the complimentary wine and cheese with you.Location:The location was good. Nice part of midtown away from the noise and hype around Times Square. Also good for transport on subway, cabs and buses. Easy walk to lots of sights as well. We didn't find any particularly good eating places around the Library Hotel, but we found it very convenient to use the Grand Central subway and cabs to go to better eating locations in Soho, Greenwich, Chinatown and the Meatpacking District.Other facilities:If youre a book lover you will find something to read... the selection wasn't as wide as I expected, but there are books scattered throughout the 2nd floor, lobby, in your room and in the Poetry Garden and Writer's Den on the 14th floor. The 14th floor was very cosy during the day and had a more hip feel when the bar was open in the evenings. Both areas were much much smaller than I expected. Complimentary bottled water on the 14th floor is a nice touch.Staff:Staff throughout our stay were polite and helpful. Some were more genuine than others. We really loved the ladies working on the 2nd floor who prepare all the food and refreshments.Stay again?:Would we stay here again... probably, yes.
