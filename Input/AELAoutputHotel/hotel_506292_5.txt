{"text":"Hidden paradise We booked Uma after reading the reviews and were not disappointed! We stayed in a Garden room which was lovely and the welcome massage was also a nice touch. I suggest to book the spa with as much notice as possible. Unfortunately we missed out because they were fully booked! We had a foot massage at nearby spa instead but they weren't very good. They also have DVDs, library and internet connection in the room are all complimentary which was handy on a rainy afternoon.The breakfasts were one of the best we've had in a resort. A la carte is nice change from the standard buffet usually offered at 5* resorts. We didn't consider Uma to be walking distance to town, especially in the heat and on a hilly road (the footpaths are not smooth either). The shuttle was fine for trips into town and we only needed to take a taxi a couple of times. For food, recommend their restaurant Kemiri (family style dining so you can sample more food by sharing plates) - fresh ingredients (Lombok lobster for RP130,000). Ibu Oka for local suckling pig, Cafe Batu Wayan (crispy duck and beef rendang) and every Tues night is chilli crab night and we picked our live crab to be freshly cooked. Naughty Nuri's across the road serves pretty good ribs and always had customers, at anytime of day.I would definitely recommend Uma for a tranquil environment with excellent service on par with other 4-5* resorts. It was great being 10 mins from town, close enough by far enough to escape the people. If we returned to Ubud, we would probably stay here again.
