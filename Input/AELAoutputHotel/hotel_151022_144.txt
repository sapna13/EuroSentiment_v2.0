{"text":"Great Resort - Terrible Service From Sun Wing Arrived at Natura on Mar.31 in the p.m. - 5 of us which included 2 children. Pleasant service, beautiful lay out, clean rooms, all greatly appreciated after a long day of travelling. Like others, we were pleased to see how wrong some of the previous bad reviews were. This was one of the nicest family resorts I've been too..and believe me, I've been to one not so nice...not half as nice as Natura. Would definitely go back. Beach was beautiful, pool was small but was perfect for us with the children - never out of our sight. Entertainment and activities for all...nightly shows were a bit cheesy but fine....can't comment on what happened past the shows as we were in the sack and up early for another beautiful day at the beach (or pool). Food was fine too...plenty to choose from especially for the kids who are normally picky eaters. Now on to the bad...stay away from Sun Wing!!!!! Should've known we'd be getting terrible service right from the start when our flight times were changed 2 times before we even left Hfx. On the way back home on Apr. 7th, we were re-routed due to a snow storm, from Hfx to Moncton..once there, we were left on our own to fend for ourselves...sat in the airport from 8:30 p.m. until 4:00 a.m. the next day, then demanded to be put up in a hotel like the hundreds of other re-routed passengers who were smart enough to go with another airline....Sun Wing had no one contact us, couldn't be reached in any way possible. By 3:00 a.m., we had airport staff track someone down (in Toronto).... were making offers that were ridiculous i.e. find your own way back to Hfx if you didn't want to drive back to Hfx in a snow storm in 4 clunky school buses (which never did arrive at the airport like we were told by the way) ....absolutely absurd..meanwhile, lucky travellers from other co's were flown back to Hfx by 9:00 a.m. the next day. Sun Wing rep. was finally contacted by phone from the hotel the next day - no help at all.....we found him with the help of a fellow passenger and the hotel front desk clerk but by then (after 11:00 a.m.) because we were all exhausted and told there were no other accommodations to be made, we climbed aboard...thank goodness we had great bus drivers ...trust me when I say once again (with support from appx. 70 other people)...stay away from Sun Wing!!!!!! There are plenty more details of the horrible service but not enough space here to write....stay away from Sun Wing!!!!!! It was the worse possible way to end an excellent vacation at Natura...I'll definitely go back to Natura but next time it won't be with Sun Wing.Take your family and enjoy the wildlife roaming the walkways...it'll be a great time!Debbie from NS ","annotations":[{"endOffset":415,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":411},{"endOffset":415,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":411},{"endOffset":415,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":411},{"endOffset":1139,"mention":"snow","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Snow_cream"],"startOffset":1135},{"endOffset":1139,"mention":"snow","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Snow_cream"],"startOffset":1135},{"endOffset":1698,"mention":"snow","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Snow_cream"],"startOffset":1694}]}
