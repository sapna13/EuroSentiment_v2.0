{"text":"SO much fun! I visited this resort as a graduation present in December of last year, and was pleasantly surprised by it! Let me break it down for you:The Grounds: Beautiful gardens. Connecting cobblestone pathways throughout the entire resort. Spa on site (a little expensive, but still good). Geckos running through occassionally. The Room: Basic, but satisfactory. We had a gardenview room, with an excellent view of the sunset at night. The one and only complaint is that the air conditioner leaked.The Beach: Bavaro Beach is the most BEAUTIFUL beach I have ever seen! This resort is right on the beach, at a prime section of it. No matter what time you get there, there is always a lounge chair or spot available to sit or lie down, often under an umbrella. At some sections of the beach, there are waves, and at others the water is completely calm. About a five minute walk to the left of the resort along the beach, there is a really cool flea market, where you can shop and barter away to your hearts content (I picked up a huge $8 bottle of rum, $4 sunglasses, and other trinkets). The Food\/Drinks:The food at LTI is quite good. For breakfast there is a huge buffet with fresh fruit, cereal, eggs, yummy croissants etc. For lunch, there is always a BBQ going with hamburgers, hot dog, chicken, and the special fish of the day. And for dinner, you have the choice of two buffets, or two delicious a-la-carte restaurants (italian and seafood). There are also at least 3 bars that I can recall visiting at the resort. One right on the beach, and one at each buffet site (but I'm sure there was more). Ask for a Bahama Mama with white rum.. they are the best! Activities:To be honest, I mainly lay around on the beach, but the resort, and the nearby vendors offered many acivity options including:-parasailing-spa-internet access-boat rides-snorkeling -scuba diving-yoga-water aerobics-dance lessons-market shopping-jungle excursions-photo shoots (free! it's your choice if you want to purchase any pictures from it.)-and more ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1282,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1272},{"endOffset":1291,"mention":"hot dog","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hot_dog"],"startOffset":1284},{"endOffset":1638,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1633}]}
