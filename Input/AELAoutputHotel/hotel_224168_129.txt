{"text":"A lovely place to stay! The saddest part was that I stayed here only for one night! I would love to return again and stay for a longer period. We were a family and had booked 2 rooms. Being a platinum elite card holder, I was upgraded to an executive suite with a king bed and a connecting room with 2 double beds and had access to the club lounge. Valet parking was good albeit a bit pricey at 29 bucks. Check in was like a breeze and my kids leapt with joy when they drew the blinds of the room and saw the magnificent view of Hollywood hills in front of them. You could literally spend the entire day gazing out at the view. The rooms were spacious and well decorated. For that matter the suite is not a 2 room suite as would be expected but rather its a large room with a seating area. The bathroom was huge and had a large dressing room as well. The lounge was fine but not as well equipped as I expected it - there were no constant soft drinks available as such. At 5 pm the cocktails and hot snacks were placed and in the morning a reasonable breakfast of continental fare with 1-2 hot items were placed. Location is par excellence and lots of shops and restaurants are nearby. Not to forget that you walk into the Chinese Theater and Kodak theater next door. Overall its a lovely property and very well maintained in every aspect.. The staff are great too and I would definitely return to this place again were I to visit LA.
