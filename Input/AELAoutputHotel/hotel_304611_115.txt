{"text":"Decent and good value I thought the hotel was well worth the price. It is in such an excellent location - close to shops, food and transport. I cannot fault the service. Staff were always polite and helpful. The doormen were fantastic - always ready to open a door or hail a taxi or greet you as you return from a full day of sight-seeing. I have to say the lobby was impressive and it was nice to wander through the paintings on display. We had a small problem on arrival as we had requested a room with twin beds but were given a room with two beds made up as a king bed. The housekeeping staff were efficient in re-making the beds as we had requested. Our room was on the 7th floor facing a multistorey carpark and the back of another building however since we didn't spend much time in our room, the lack of view wasn't an issue. The free minibar was appreciated at the end of a hot day and having free access to internet service (even for just 15 minutes) was great. We found the room clean and enjoyed the comforts of modern furnishings and bathroom. I would probably have put the hairdryer in a more convenient location - not tucked into a tight spot in the room. It was great to be able to step out of the hotel and be within metres of shops. It's good to learn the underground routes around the Scotts and Orchard Rds area as it keeps you out of the heat and the tropical rain. These tunnels keep you connected to many of the major shopping centres and food courts in the area. If i go back to Singapore I would definitely go back to Royal Plaza and I recommend it to anyone.
