{"text":"Awaiting Urban Renewal Hotel - YesNeighborhood - NoWhen I walked into the lobby of the Hollywood Renaissance and looked at the curving steel staircase, the modern art, and the expanse of shiny marble, I thought it was a brand new hotel. I was not dissuaded from this view after seeing the guest rooms and meeting facilities. I was very surprised to learn that the hotel was a renovated Holiday Inn. It seemed to me that every surface had been replaced, renewed, or reworked effectively obliterating every trace of its former incarnation.My room was comfortable and attractive with all new furniture, bedding and carpet. It is a nice set up for business travelers with a large repositionable desk and comfortable desk chair. Unfortunately like many upscale hotels they charge for internet access ($9.95 per day). The bathroom was average size but had a nice marble counter and massaging showerhead. Tub, tile and all fixtures appeared to be brand new.The hotel is large - more than 600 rooms - and seems to cater to conventioneers. There are three floors of meeting rooms and most of the folks I saw around the hotel seemed to be wearing name tags. I was surprised not to see more tourists during my stay as the hotel is near the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Grumman's Chinese Theater.The attractiveness and newness of the hotel was in stark contrast to the surrounding area. As you sit in one of the Eames chairs in the sleek lobby and look out the front window, you see a run-down strip mall with a liquor store, tobacco shop and JuJu's Brand Name Fashions for Less as tenants. In fact, with the exception of the Highland\/Hollywood shopping center next door, the area surrounding the hotel is primarily tacky souvenir shops and low rise apartments\/residence hotels dating from the 1940s\/50s.The Highland Hollywood block includes the hotel, the new Kodak Theater (home to the Academy Awards) and the attractive open-air Hollywood Highland retail\/dinning complex. Unfortunately this new construction was not an impetus for any new development nearby and outside this one block, the area is very run-down. To be clear, the area is not blighted - we are not talking about abandoned buildings or broken glass - just tired, old, scruffy buildings. I did encounter homeless people sleeping on Hollywood Blvd, only a few hundred feet from the hotel. Dining options are limited. There is only one restaurant in the hotel - Twist - which is open for all meals. I had breakfast there and it was tasty but fairly expensive at $20 for the buffet or $12 for a simple quesadilla. The restaurants in the Highland\/Hollywood center are primarily chains and fast food with the except of Wolfgang Puck's Vert. For a fine dining meal, you will have to travel a considerable distance.I stayed at the Hollywood Renaissance in mid-July 2007 for three nights in order to attend a business conference at the hotel. I paid $169 which was the negotiated conference rate. I thought the hotel to be a great value at this price. My interaction with the staff was minimal - check in was quick and easy, maid was pleasant, and waiter was cheerful. I was concerned that I was never notified that I had received a FedEx package. If the sender had not contacted me, prompting me to inquire with the concierge, I would have left the hotel without getting the package.
