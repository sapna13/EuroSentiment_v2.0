{"text":"Loved the Dominican HATED the resort Arrived on Sunday 7\/15 the rooms they gave us were incorrect. There were 15 people in our party. They put 4 of us in a room with 2 single beds and wanted to bring in 2 cots that were an average of 5 ft long, If the cots were brought in there would be no room for luggage or anything else. Had to fight with the front desk. Did not find them helpful at all. they finally gave us the rooms we were supposed to have but only after I called my travel agent. This took approx. 4 hours of my vacation time. The rooms had bedbugs everyone was bit to pieces. Our sheets were never changed. Some of us didnt have our rooms cleaned at all and there were never enough towels to shower. No one spoke english even in emergencies and there is NO ATM at any of the resorts. Had to take a taxi in town for 25.00 and they gave me my money in pasos. Any questions I asked the front desk acted indignent and rude. The food was mediocre but you have to eat during certain times or you miss out. Big breakfast but dont expect to be hungry at lunch which is from 1-3 then its to late to eat no place is serving untill 7 that night. Also, dont expect to find any soda for sale, you get a coca cola replaced in your fridge every 2 days. Not enough for 4 people. I would not advise anyone to stay at the Grand Pallidium resorts although I would recommend the Dominican Republic itself. Beautiful country lots to see but none of that is included in the all inclusive. You will be harrassed constantly on the beach by vendors wanting to book trips. OVERALL... AWFUL AWFUL RESORT.
