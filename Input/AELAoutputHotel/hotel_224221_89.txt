{"text":"Great quiet hotel in the middle of NYC My partner and I stayed in New York over new year 07\/08. We chose this hotel because of the reviews on TA and we were not disappointed!The hotel itself is lovely, really comfortable with great staff. Sure, the room wasn't huge... but perfectly adequate for what we needed. For a city hotel it's just what you need: in the centre of Manhattan, close to grand central station, great service, comfy beds... those little extras really make the difference too. We really made the most of the breakfast (which gave us a great start to every day), the cheese and wine evenings and the complementary internet access.I would say that this hotel is best suited to couples or older groups of people wanting to discover NYC, but wanting to come back at the end of the day and relax.We stayed in the double room (one of the smallest) and the only issue we had was the noise from the lifts at night. I had no problem with this, but my partner is a light sleeper. Once we were given ear plugs it was fine. I would say that if you are a light sleeper you should either take ear plugs or consider a slightly more expensive room. Don't miss the bar on the top floor. Great for breakfast, but even better for a cocktail to finish off the evening.I have been to NYC before, and hope to come again. I will not stay in any other hotel - The Library was perfect for us.
