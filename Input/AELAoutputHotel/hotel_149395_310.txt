{"text":"A Beautiful Resort! I read many of the reviews before leaving and wasn't sure how we were going to like the resort because of the mixed reviews. My boyfriend and I were there for 7 days and had a great time. The grounds are beautiful and very well kept. The resort is very large but they have trolly-like cars that you can get on and they will take you anywhere you want to go inside the resort. The pool and the beach were beautiful and very clean. Service was never a problem. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Most, but not all, of the staff can understand and\/or speak some English and they try very hard to accomodate you. Communication was not a significant problem. The rooms were very nice and very clean. Our only complaint about the room were the very small ants in the bathroom. I had read about them in a few reviews. They were not in any other part of the room but we constantly found them in the bathroom which we were not happy about. The food was good-not great, but better than we had expected. We would recommend Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, and the Steakhouse. The nightly shows were entertaining. The casino is very small but still quite fun. We also took advantage of many of the included activities with the package such as paddle boats, snorkeling, horseback riding, archery, batting cage, and the rock climb and we really enjoyed everything. It was a great vacation, very fun and relaxing. We would return again.
