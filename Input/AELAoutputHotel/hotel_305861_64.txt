{"text":"Happily accommodated at the Metropark We had a harbour view room, which was characterless and compact but clean and comfortable. My husband said it was everything he wants in a business hotel, with a good desk, comfortable bed and tea\/coffee making facilities. The bathroom was well maintained and very clean. Our shower (there was no bath) was large and lovely. We had an angled view of the harbour over Victoria Park, which was lit up and choked with crowds for the annual market - we were in HK over Lunar New Year.This hotel has a terrific location - it's a short stroll from trams, buses and the MTR. Times Square and Causeway Bay are lively shopping and entertainment areas, and only a walk away. Electric Road, the local shopping centre, boasts not only hardware (electric goods) shops, but a cluster of organic food shops, as well.The hotel breakfast was OK - we'd just come from Vietnam so we missed the wide array of FRESH fruit and pastries we'd enjoyed there, but the variety and quality at the Metropark was pretty good. The service was excellent - coffee and tea replenished at regular intervals by friendly and attentive staff who were working through the biggest holiday period on their calendar - with a smile. In fact, I thought the hotel generally had a happy feel to it - maybe in part because of the time of year we were there.Eddie the barman was everything a barman should be, and we enjoyed a couple of happy hours with him. Although the restaurant was busy we thought it lacked atmosphere. One evening, at the end of a particularly chilly day, we had dinner at the hotel, but because the restaurant was full, we dined in the bar (same menu). We preferred it.The front desk staff were welcoming and efficient, and the doormen were particularly friendly and obliging. There are a couple of desktops with internet access for guests in the business centre, but you might have to queue.
