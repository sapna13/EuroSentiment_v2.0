{"text":"Mmmn....Very nice but ............is it me ? I love TripAdvisor, I've not been to New York - When I was booking this place was #1 - What could go wrong?Well nothing really...its just a hotel Yes its a good location, yes they speak french - We were probably in the cheap seats ( floor 9) so the room was ...just a room with a bed, which was ok...a bit soft if anything..in short it was all very nice but nothing special - London price hotel room with same size and same remote service - can t complain but cant rave about it either New York is fantastic though so it kind of doesnt matter A few tips if you've not been before...NY that is - Helicopter rides are ok but the view from the skyscrapers are just as impressive - Talking of big buildings - do not underestimate the queue for Empire state building - Huge - 40 mins at least - View is very big and you've go tto go havent you - but wear comfy shoes and go to the Heartleand brewery bar underneath it to chill out afterwards - Bit touristy but nice people and a decent pint- View from the rockefeller center in my opinion was better because you actually see the empire state building so get a a perspective of just how high up you are - fabulous - if you can do one of them at night and one during the day...really good - We went to Carolines comedy store just off Time square - we fell upon a talent contest type thing that was very good - Good night to relax after a day of sight seeing- Broad way show a must - book early or pay concierge prices - guess what we did ??!! however fabulous seats and a great time was had ( hairspray sunday matinee followed by cocktails what better way to spend an afternoon? )- Buy a Zagats guide for restaurants - Obvious if you know, a real life saver if you dont - As a result of it we ended up in the better class of touristy places reasonably close to the Hotel - Virgils BBQ, and Bardolinas for example both very american and enjoyable - Also went to Les Halles ( Anthony Bourdains spot - Fantastic Friday night ) Red flame diner was ok weak coffee big omelettes and friendly\/tip hungry staff, Convenient but nothing special in my opinion - Staten Island ferry is a good thing to do - We did the Gray Line bus tour for 2 days - mixed bag of guides but on the whole a good introduction to manhattan island - Do the Harlem Loop, very interesting .- Wear comfortable shoes, pace yourself on distance but not on the good stuff and please enjoy ...the hotel is just somewhere to sleep ","annotations":[{"endOffset":17,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":13},{"endOffset":17,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":13},{"endOffset":398,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":394},{"endOffset":1005,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1001},{"endOffset":1959,"mention":"Les Halles","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Brasserie_Les_Halles"],"startOffset":1949},{"endOffset":1959,"mention":"Les Halles","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Brasserie_Les_Halles"],"startOffset":1949},{"endOffset":2046,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2040}]}
