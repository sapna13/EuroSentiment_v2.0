{"text":"As good as ever! I have been to Dreams before. I was there last year (February 2007) with my family and the year before that (February 2006) with my family when it was called Sunscape The Beach. I went alone this time, without my family. I am going again this February 2008 with my family. Why did I go alone this time? [1] WestJet had a $139.00 (each way) special from Toronto which I just couldn't pass up and [2] I had read some recent non-flattering reviews on Trip Advisor (and on their own forum) which gave me pause for some concern. Maybe the management had changed and things wouldn't be the same as previous years? It's a pretty big investment taking a family to any (quality) resort anywhere and I just wanted to reassure myself and, if there were problems, give myself enough time to change destinations if things were not the same at Dreams Punta Cana as they had been in previous years. And, boy, am I glad I went! Bottom line? I am much reassured. No, things are not the same ... they are even better! Still as clean as ever, manicured gorunds, rooms great (well above average), people (both management and staff) as courteous and friendly as ever, food even better that last year (and last year was good!) ... BUT they even have more this year. (I'll probably forget something, hope not.) A brand new Preferred Club building! It's really nice. (Vanessa is still the Club Manager and she is the most competent and nicest lady you'll meet anywhere in the DR.) And brand new bali beds on the beach. And brand new (wood) chaise lounges around the pool. And a new hamburger stand by the pool cooking up burgers to order. And many new additions to the Teen Club (what they are now calling the Core Zone) complete with a new climbing wall, baseball cage with pitching machine, and even an electric riding bull! And they've added wireless internet for the rooms ($ - except for Club) but well worth the convenience). A lot of the same staff are still there from last year (and that says a lot about any resort) and that was very reassuring. You must say hello to Chocolate (chock-o-latte) when you go the The Lobby Bar! Great guy. That's it. I've been to two AMR managed resorts (Secrets and Dreams) and they are definitely doing something right. And, needless to say, I have been much reassured about taking my family back there in February.
