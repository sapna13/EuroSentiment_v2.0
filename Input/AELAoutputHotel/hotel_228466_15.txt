{"text":"Great experience! Booked Fira Palace for a short break with my two teenage daughters to escape the rain in England! Got a good deal price wise and was very impressed with the reception we got when we arrived.Our room was huge with 2 double beds and a great bathroom, seperate loo and shower, everything we needed.We had forgotten our adaptor but the reception guys were quick to help and lend us one, vital for the girls and their array of hair straighteners, mobiles etc etc!!The air con was a godsend and worked well, and we were able to keep up with the olympics on the wide screen TV.On the second morning we awoke to the sound of drilling and hammering underneath our room....they were renovating the restaurant!! I asked if we could move rooms and this happened straight away with no problem. A slightly smaller room but still big, and on the 6th floor so away from any noise!We liked the pool and the bar, and the lobby area is really nice to sit and cool down.It is a good 20 minute walk into town which we did couple of times but we also used the bus and the metro which was easy.Mount Juiec is beautiful to explore and you are couple of minutes walk from the magic fountain, which is amazing! We also used taxis a lot as they are very cheap, and it was nice to be able to get away from the chaos that is central Barcelona!!All in all a great find, we didn't use the breakfast faciities and a kettle in the room would have been good, but coffee in the bar was very good!
