{"text":"Love the Argonaut The Argonaut Hotel is one of my favorite places to stay. This was our second time visiting this hotel. Everyone was great. The wine tasting in the beautiful lobby was excellent and so relaxing.This time we bought a package so we had a deluxe room. Last time our view was nonexistent. This time we overlooked the Cannery and part of the Bay. I am not sure I would pay the extra money, but it nice to be able to watch the ships in the morning.Breakfast at the Blue Mermaid was included in our package. It was pretty good, not excellent, but the servers were very nice. I did have Crab chowder there twice in the evening and it was delicious. Once again, the service there was very friendly.I have two boys, and our favorite thing to do is walk across the street to the Maritime Museum and board the boats. The boys loved that they can explore every inch of these old ships. The price is a steal. The cost is five dollars per adult for an entire week. Kids are free. We visited every day of our trip. I think the most beautiful view of San Francisco is off the Balcutha, the sailing ship. You can see the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, the Bay, and the entire city.The Argonaut is very centrally located. We used public transportation including cable cars and the trolley. Ghirardelli Square is close, as is Pier 39 and Fisherman√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Wharf. We also drove to Muir Woods (beautiful) and Sonoma Valley which was a pretty easy trip.I highly recommend the Argonaut. It is such a funky little hotel, but very classy. I look forward to staying at another Kimpton hotel some day.
