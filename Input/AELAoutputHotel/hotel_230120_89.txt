{"text":"Long stay at the Sofitel! My work brought me to Amsterdam for an extended stay and I really enjoyed the Sofitel! During my various stays, I was booked in a couple of different rooms, which gave me a good overview of the hotel. First, the rooms in the 500's are on the front of the building and they are very spacious. I believe I stayed in 502 and it had a lot of room and a big bathroom. Some of the rooms on the back of the building tend to be smaller. I always asked and they would move me once they had room. I would recommend asking for a room with space if you feel cramped. They were really nice about moving rooms.The double and kind beds are really comfortable! I think that when you are away from home, there is nothing more important than a comfortable bed. After staying in other Amsterdam hotels that are in the center of the city, none of those beds even compare to the Sofitel.Location: You cannot beat this location! First, the train station is only a 5-7 minute walk away. I took the train from the airport to the hotel multiple times. It was quicker than a cab ride and the walk was really easy. Second, it is close to Dam Square and backs up to a ton of great shopping. Third, it is close to the Singel canal that was a lot of great places to eat.Complaints -- I think that the room service menu could be updated. I do, however, recommend the pizza and the burger selection. Their wine selection for room service is also pretty good. My second complaint is the fitness center. There is hardly anything down there (only a rowing machine and a bike). That being said, most of the hotels in Amsterdam are lacking on the fitness center.I would not hesitate to stay here again! If you are in Amsterdam for an extended stay, no hotel will be nicer to deal with!
