{"text":"good little Motel for the price I stayed at the Buena Vista for 5 days following a cruise. I called the motel directly and asked for a better rate than was offered on the internet and was given a few dollars off each night. Better than nothing! The room was average, but for the price I paid I did not expect anything more. There was some problem with a breakfast shortage, ie: nothing left one morning, and the offerings were coffee and donuts \/ muffins so we didn't miss much. One morning we found out why the breakfast was going short of food. Some people were taking 4 or 5 donuts instead of considering that there may be someone else who would like a little bite to eat in the morning. The motel is in Cow Hollow, and about 2 blocks away is a great street to walk (uphill) for dinner. Ask the desk clerk and they will give you suggestions where to eat within walking distance. My husband and I walked to Fisherman's Wharf every day, a good walk not overly hilly. Our room was beside the elevator but we did not hear any noise coming into our room. The most bothersome noise was from the street but we just turned on our a.c. to fan only and that drowned out the street noise. There is a nice little sunroom on the top floor but it is very hot if the sun is out, so much that we could not sit there. All in all, if you are looking for a good little hotel in an expensive city, try this one.
