{"text":"Good value and family friendly Our family stayed in a 2 BR unit on the 11th floor during the last week of August. Positives:Spacious and larger than we expected; plenty of room for kids to run around in living roomOutside patio is largeExcellent location across street from a small but family friendly beach with breakwater - perfect for little childrenFree broadband internetFree parking in the buildingPool is well maintained and cleanConcierge staff friendly and helpful; they genuinely look like they enjoy working thereComplimentary beach chairs, mats, towels they loan you when you go to the beachToy pails for the kidsLaundry machine in your unit and they even provide detergentNegatives:Building directly overlooks what without a doubt must the ugliest building in WaikikiNumerous items were broken in our unit that should have been caught by housecleaning before we checked in (broken toilet seat, DVD player not working, internet cable snapped); all these things were pretty quickly fixed when we told them The temperature in both showers fluctuated wildly from cold to hotNo restaurant in the building (the other reviews on this site about the Tiki restaurant are people who are posting erroneously about another similar sounding hotel 2 blocks up the street)Self parking was often quite crowded and took a while to find a spotKitchen has very few cooking or eating utensils are providedPool is small and can get very crowdedNo towels provided at the pool (on the 4th floor), you must bring them from your room or go downstairs to the valet on the 1st floorJacuzzi next to pool is way too hotFunky smell in the room that came and wentOverall its a good value for what you get. We would definitely consider staying here again if we come back to Oahu. ","annotations":[]}
