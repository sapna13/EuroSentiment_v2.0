{"text":"Go Go vacations-terrible experience Go Go Vacations, Bavaro Princess Hotel, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic  Trip Dates: July 02, 2007 thru July 11, 2007This letter was an official complaint sent to GoGo Vacations and Hotel: for deplorable and unacceptable condition of trip accommodations provided by Go Go Vacations, Bavaro Princess Hotel.We paid for first class accommodations in your hotel and received:1) At our arrival room was not ready.2) When we got the room it had only one bed (all accommodations noted 4 people).3) We did not get room serviced until day 3!4) Hotel smelled like sewer (so strong that it caused head aches and nausea). (later learned there was problems with water lines)5) We got poisoned by hotel food on 6 (six!) occasions.6) On July 7, 8, 9 (that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ 3 days!) we did not have hot water !!!7) Shower in our room had not enough pressure to operate, during our stay.8) We requested remote control for TV on two occasions and did not get it at all.9) We requested safe key and did not get it at all.10) The service at main restaurant (next to lobby) was non-existent: we had to ask for water or drinks for at least 3 times (and there is no self service allowed!!!) and on one occasion had to wait for 45 minutes to get water (in 95degree weather!!! with kids at the table), plates where cleaned up very sporadically and it was very obvious that priority was given to Spanish-speaking guests over English-speaking gests all the time!!! On numerous occasions there was not enough forks and teaspoons during lunch hours11) The Auto-train running on premises had no room for guests about 20% of the time and except for one had no room for strollers, making it effective waiting time close to 20-30 minutes.12) On departure from hotel Puerto Tours bus was scheduled to pick us up to the airport at 8:30 AM and after multiple calls finally arrived to the hotel at 9:25AM causing us quite a fear of missing the plane (flight scheduled at 11:25 and route to hotel about 30 minutes), by the time we entered airport our plane was finishing boarding.We requested full refund and after 2 month of arguments we were refunded 2 days' cost, and offered $100 credit by GoGo if booked thru themPlease note there are so many great hotels in Punta Cana, this one should be avoided at any costs (it took us 3 weeks just to recuperate and endless comunications with GoGo to get this resolved, to their satisfaction) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":588,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":584},{"endOffset":588,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":584},{"endOffset":588,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":584},{"endOffset":588,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":584}]}
