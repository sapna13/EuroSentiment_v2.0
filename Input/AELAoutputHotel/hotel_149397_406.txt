{"text":"Platinum Upgrade worth it! We booked our vacation through Air Canada Vacations and got a fabulous 2 for 1 deal with the Platinum upgrade package. If you're flying from Canada, Air Canada is the way to go. They use their regular planes, with lots of leg room. Not like Air Transat or SkyService that try and squeeze in as many people as they can on their planes. It also makes a difference in the service you get in DR if you book with AirCanada. Plus you get to collect the air miles if you have a rewards card!The Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort is located on a beautiful beach, the water is clean (very little bits of seaweed in the water or on the beach). We had the platinum upgrade and I would highly recommend that you get this package as it really made the trip special (as far as I know, it's only offered through Air Canada vacations). Benefits include the best rooms near the beach (ours was second floor, ocean-view), premium liquors, 2 free massages, 2 free snorkelling trips, 1 dive, extra maid service, dinner at Licey's, etc, etc. Well worth it.The rooms are uniquely designed and very comfortable. Be prepared to wait for hot water. There are certain times during the day when none is available, usually between 10 AM to 5 PM. But as long as you shower after 5, you're ok and there's plenty of it. The resort has a protrected mangrove - nice to walk through it -- you'll see some caged birds and reptiles when you do. There are peacocks, swans, ducks all around the property and a welcome sight to see when you go for breakfast. Several times we were met by a male peacock in full plummage. Keep in mind that a mangrove is basically a swamp and the water is stagnant so it does get a little stinky, especially at night. If you don't get the platinum upgrade and just go for a regular room, make sure you don't get a room near the Mangrove for this reason only. Food was as expected. Don't expect gourmet, you won't get it. You eat to live, not live to eat, when you're at all-inclusive resort, so as long as you go in with that attitude, you won't be disappointed. We ate at two of the a la carte restaurants (Licey's and Bella Pasta), again, nothing special (especially if you're used to really good restaurants), but edible. Breakfast we ate at the Hispaniola buffet near the lobby and lunch was at the Gaucho buffet by the beach. There's also a McPrincess Burgers that's open longer hours during the day for burges and hot dogs, if you get hungry between meal-times.My husband and I are both gym enthusiasts so we spent every morning working out. Gym is a little better than what you get at other resorts. Two treadmills, two ellipticals, two bikes, free weights and numerous weight machines. Not too bad, considering. Unfortunately, one of the treadmills broke down after the 4th day and as you can imagine, turnaround for service calls aren't as quick as what we are used to in North America so it still hadn't been fixed when you left 3 days later.This is our second time to Punta Cana and I have to say I much preferred it to our first trip (we stayed at the Catalonia Bavaro that time - hated it!). We will definitely go back to Punta Cana but probably would go in February instead of January so the weather is a little warmer then.
