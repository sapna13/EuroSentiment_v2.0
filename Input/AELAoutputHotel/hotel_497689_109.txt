{"text":"Could try a bit harder!!!! We stayed here for two nights a couple of weeks ago. It was our second visit [so we must have been relatively impressed first time around] and our third at a Firmdale [because we had previously stayed at The Covent Garden Hotel, which did we like but, stylistically, much prefer The Soho].I booked the room over the phone and gave my credit card details to cover the cost of two nights [about √ä√£¬¢1k] because my partner was travelling ahead of me and I didn't want him to have to be bothered with having to use his card to have to pay [he would usually know that by having to use his card he would end up paying for the treat, which wasn't the point].It turned out that when he arrived he was required to present his credit card [not for identification purposes, which would have been fine] but for it to be swiped and debited. He didn't complain because [knowing me like he does he just thought oh here we go again]. I arrived 2 or 3 hours later to be told that he had had to use his card. So, being determined that just this once I would pay, and assuming that my card had not already been debited, despite my instructions, I presented my card.As events eventually revealed, my card HAD been debited before either of us arrived [I think that it was √ä√£¬¢1100.00]. His card was then debited on his arrival, and then on my arrival my card was debited again, this time for √ä√£¬¢1300!!!. That though did not cause the cancellation of my original debit of √ä√£¬¢1100 nor the cancellation of his debit [I assume it was √ä√£¬¢1100, or perhaps it was √ä√£¬¢1300].Anyway, off we go out to supper that night, somewhere nice and with guests. My card, the only one I was carrying then bounced because there was over √ä√£¬¢1k missing!!! Fortunately my partner had one of his cards with him and he paid. This was not a good start! Obviously the hotel were not going to overcharge us BUT they had reserved over √ä√£¬¢3.5k of our credit for a two night stay. So BEWARE!!!!Anyway, our room, Junior Suite was really lovely, perfect in every way. A nice touch was that when we returned from supper on the Friday we were offered complimentary bed time milk and cookies.Breakfast is a unique affair in Refuel.Am I wrong, but when you have an English breakfast in a smart hotel at √ä√£¬¢21.00 aren't you entitled to have some cereal and or fruit from the buffet? Not here you aren't. I had two Weetabix and a slug of milk, and was told that that meant that I was having the Refuel breakfast which would cost over √ä√£¬¢30, although, eventually I was only charged √ä√£¬¢21, but I didn't have any Weetabix on the Sunday because it's nice but not √ä√£¬¢10+ nice.These kind of details dim the shine on what should be a faultless hotel, and it is lovely, very stylish, generally welcoming, but it could do better if only they tried just that little bit harder.Shame really because I love the look and like the location and I want to rave about the place, but I have to be honest and so I have.Would we stay again? Probably yes.
