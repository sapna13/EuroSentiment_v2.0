{"text":"Very good hotel let down a bit by a couple of small slip ups The Sheraton on the Park is a rather nice and well run hotel. It would be near perfect but for a couple of small slip ups.Located in the city close to two MRT stations it can be easily reached from the airport in less than 20 minutes by train. The location right at Hyde Park is excellent. The hotel itself is well appointed. The entrance with the staircase is pretty and one of the nicer entries I have seen. Everything in the public areas was clean and well organized, a clear sign for a well run hotel.My room was smallish but the furniture was new and the white blinds are nice touch (rather than the huge drapes often found).The gym is spacious and well equipped with some of the better machines on the market. A letdown was that the free weights were rusty. Using them resulted in rust-stained hands. The opening hours also could a bit longer.The hotel has an excellent lounge on the 21st floor. The food and drink selection is far better than anything I have experienced in North America. Staff was highly attentive. But Internet and printing access in the lounge - the business center closes at 5:30 pm - were unbelievably complicated or dysfunctional. Half of all the people using the PCs needed staff support just to go online. The wireless access signal dropped off half a dozen times per hour. Printing on the available HP Laserprinters produced 1 page per minute (these printers can print 10+ pages a minute) - if it worked at all. During six hours in the lounge, I saw no-one else printing anything out successfully.Anyone who does not need to use the hotel's office facilities can have a great stay. Having to work can make the stay a tad strained.
