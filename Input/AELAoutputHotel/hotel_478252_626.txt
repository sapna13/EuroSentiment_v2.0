{"text":"Loved the Bahia! My boyfriend  I went to the Bahia Principe from May 26-June 2 and had an AMAZING time! We had read the reviews prior to going and I was so impressed with how informative and helpful people had been that I felt compelled to do the same for others.The grounds are truly stunning. The maintenance staff are working on upkeeping it 24\/7 and it really pays off! The grounds are very vast but there is really no prime spot to be at - unless you're right in the middle, you'll either be closer to the restaurants and lobby OR to the beach. There is a tram that runs every few minutes so if you're not one for the walk, it's no problem.We found the resort to have something for everyone. There were tons of couples, there were groups of young people who congregated by the swim-up bar, and there were lots of families with kids. It was a really good mix of people. Here are some tips I can give from our experience:-Go to the French and Japanese restaurants (seafood restaurant is crap so double up on one of the others)-Make sure to catch the Michael Jackson show (I think it's on Mondays) - you'd swear you were actually watching Michael!-Take the Marinarium boat cruise - you won't regret it!! And bring an underwater camera!!-Take tons of sunscreen - even if you think you have a base tan and you won't burn - bring it!! you will burn under the dominican sun-We were upgraded to the diamond club without knowing but I wouldn't have paid for an upgrade. it was nice to have 20min of free internet daily to stay in touch with family (and avoid calling), and we enjoyed a 4th a la carte. The Diamond club rooms tend to be situated in the centre of the resort and you get to have breakfast at the Italian restaurant, which was nice (so we didn't have to walk to the front to the buffet) but again, I don't I would have paid for it.-Bring Pepto or Imodium PLEASE. Our stomachs were going crazy down there and we had to run to the bathroom within minutes of eating. It's possible we caught a bug before we got there, as my bf was sick as soon as we got off the plane, but bring it with you nonetheless.-bring lots of dollar bills as the staff are so sweet and amazing.The beach i s BEAUTIFUL but I think next time, I'll refrain from travelling in May\/June. It was cloudy quite a few of the days but it's still super hot.All in all, we had a great, relaxing vacation. And I defintiely recommend this resort! Although I'm not one to travel to the same place twice, I was very impressed by the resort and I think I'd definitely look for a Bahia Principe at my next vacation destination.Have fun!!
