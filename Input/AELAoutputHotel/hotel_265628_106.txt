{"text":"Fab hotel - no dicky tummy probs here This is a really good quality hotel for the money. It looks beautiful from the time you arrive until the time you leave. The food is varied and available all day at a number of buffet based venues. The al a carte's are also good and make a change from buffet style food.The drink quality is great and the cocktails are fab - professionally made and unlimited. Loads of comfy seating space in the bar.Pool is huge and winding and has something for everyone, swim up bar, deep water part, toddlers parts etc etc. Beach is lovely, and cleaned daily, you can walk miles in either direction if you choose to.Sea can be rough - and snorkelling is very disappointing.There is a spa and gym which looked good but we never tried them.The room \/ suite, whilst entirely adequate and very spacious, is a bit lack-lustre, but don't let this put you off, it has all the things you need in a hotel room 2 TV's, 2 double beds, stocked fridge, safe, huge wardrobe spaces, balcony, fab shower etc etc. The only thing it lacked was a kettle (we brought our own).If you have children, there is definitely a playground on site, but it is in full sun and I never saw any kids club etc going on. This would worry me if I had little ones as there doesn't seem to be much for them to do in shaded areas.We ate and drank everything we could all week and never once had an upset stomach - I consider this is a major achievement for most AI hotels. I would definitely return.
