{"text":"Horrible Experience!! I had several problems from the day I arrived at this hotel. 1)The rate that I was given over the phone was not honored 2) I rented two rooms  had asked for ajoining rooms, which again was not honored 3)One of the rooms was not available until 5p.m., well after check in time 4)One of the rooms had a slow draining sink and the other had a constantly running toilet, both of which were reported to housekeeping  never resolved in our 8 day stay 5)The ice machine on our floor was inop for several days  we had to go to the other floors for ice 6)Housekeeping did not clean the room propely each day (Cleaning personnel even left bottles of cleaners in our room, as if they had been in a hurry to leave)7)-The coffee\/tea amenities were not filled everyday, as adverstised 8)We were given problems if we had the cooler at the poolside, even if we had just comed from the beach  didn't want to go all the way to our room to be drop off the cooler 9)On the last couple of days of our stay our keys were de magnetized  someone from our party went to the front desk  was told that he was a liar by the staff since his name didn't appear on the reservation (it was under my name and the staff memeber got into a yelling match instead of being helpful and resolving the problem) Horrible experience...We will never stay here again, not to mention the half hour I had to wait each day for the valet to get my car, I should have been paid the $22 a day for the amount of time I spent from my vacation on this. HORRIBLE!!!
