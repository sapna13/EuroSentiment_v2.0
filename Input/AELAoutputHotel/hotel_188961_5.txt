{"text":"Both a warm and professional experience My husband and I just stayed at the 41 Hotel in London for four nights and enjoyed a wonderful experience. We usually stay at the Capital but had heard of the many positive attributes of the 41 and wanted a change. The aesthetics encompassing the overall hotel design and culinary skills are admirable. The hotel staff is definately not the usual superficial standard of a large hotel, but that of the stature of a Relais  Chateau style of affiliation. Warm, hard working and knowledgeable, they are professionally trained beyond what we have come to expect nowadays. There are many nice touches such as in the evening, ice and a small tray of olives, lemon\/lime slices are left in your room in case you would like to prepare a drink. During turn down service, a floating candle is lit in the bathroom along with some soft jazz playing, a fire turned on in the small gas fireplace and the lights dimmed...not to mention the fantastic bed and plush linens.The only potential drawback if any is the gorgeous but small public area which does not provide any privacy. Also, the plunder the pantry idea is a nice one, however somewhat confusing. The clientele is upscale and relaxed, but most of us were perplexed (and embarassed to ask) about the set up in general. The hotel and food prices are very high and most items in the pantry including water, soft drinks and the like are not gratis as is standard in concierge spaces. Management would be smart to rethink this as it slightly cheapens their overall 5 star service. This is a small but important factor.
