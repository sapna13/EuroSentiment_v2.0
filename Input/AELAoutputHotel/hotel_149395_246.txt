{"text":"Great beach and food, shame for the rooms. After ending up stranded at the neighbouring Grand Palladium by Expedia (we never received the booking from Expedia and have no room left), I helped myself as Expedia would not help, tipped one of the employees and accepted a junior suite for 4 nights at the rack rate of $435 a night all inclusive at the Paradisus. After 4 nights, I booked via Sol Melia website for $335 a night a junior suite with jacuzzi.The good:Beach: very nice beach, several beach mattresses very comfy but to be reserved by towel early, long chairs being less confortable without padding.Food: several restaurants (Japanese, French, Chinese, Mexican, Brazilian meat, buffet, Italian) with good quality food, good choice of wines (from South American to French\/Spanish), service variable. Not perfect by all means (no Jasmin tea available in the Chinese), menu of the Italian available as room service.Bars: good cocktails and drinks.Green: a lot of green \/ nature on the grounds of the hotel, with a mini jungle between the recpetions and the villas.The bad:Rooms: not 5 stars, maybe 3. The rooms are all large (only junior suites in the hotel anyway) with terrace, but the first one had a musty smell probably due to water infiltrations (re-painting visible on the ceiling and was very much 70-early 80ies, with brown marble, worn out furniture and less efficient A\/C. Comfortable mattress though, which is key in an hotel. The second room was better decorated, had a combined jacuzzi tub\/shower, a remote for the TV from a different brand than the set, hence not working, and a cheap and hard mattress. Despite 2 calls to the room service, changing it for one softer would not happen.Noise: small cars drive around from early to late around the complex, to bring guests from the reception to the villas. Prepare ear-plugs, especially as some guest talk loud on the streets and kiddies obviously will not behave. So get a room on a first floor, looking away from the small roads and not too close to the pool.Service: variable. Staff is mostly friendly and smiling, but does not always master well English and feels fast overwhelmed, probably due to lack of training. Reception staff was consistently useless. Clientele was mostly US families or young or older couples. Nothing much to see outside the hotel.To sum up: if you are lucky with your room, nice beach and food can make make for a nice beach bum stay but I would not rate this 5 stars, as probably most hotels on the island. Much better experience in Asia.
