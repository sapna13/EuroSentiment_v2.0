{"text":"Can sum it up in one word...Paradise We stayed at PC Princess from 2-27 thru 3-5 2008 and adored the resort. The Amimacion Staff was wonderful...Danny, Andre, Selena and Katrina made each day and evening fun filled with activities. We got involved in almost every activity they put together throughout the day and in the evenings. I would advise anyone to join in when they ask for volunteers and if you don't join in...get front row seats and be prepared to laugh.The restaurants were great. We really enjoyed the food at Tex-Mex. The Margaritas are also very good there. Le Petite Fondue was excellent and I advise not waiting till the last night to go there because you'll wish you had gone at the beginning so you could have gone back for more! The beach area and the pool area were clean and tidy. We never had a problem finding somewhere to lay out in the sun or rest in the shade. We did do an excursion to Saona Island and it was a great trip. Bring lots of sunscreen because you don't feel yourself burning. Although the bus ride to get there was long, it was worth it once you got on the catamaran and headed out to the Caribbean Sea. Our only bad experience was our deep sea fishing excursion. We booked through the resort and the company was Gone Fishing. The fumes from our boat caused severe illness\/carbon monoxide poisoning. It was a terrible adventure and I would not recommend that trip to anyone. We had 8 foot swells and in the 4 hour trip only 1 fish caught the line. It was an expensive trip and not at all worth the $100 per person. We heard the Safari Trip would have been much more worth the money we spent. Overall I would say our trip was excellent. I would return in a second if I could. ","annotations":[]}
