{"text":"Decent Hotel  Hotel is not in the best convenient location but shops are a 5-10 min stroll away. Causeway Bay MTR is around 15 mins away however the closest entrance is the Time Sq entrance which requires another couple of minute walk to reach the platform. Not a real issue as the hotel provides a complimentary shuttle from hotel to time square, admiralty, central around 15 mins interval however the shuttle service finishes quite early around 9:30pm (last pick up from time square to hotel). Usually, the night life in HK extends beyond this hour and I usually take a taxi back to the hotel from Time square costing roughly HKD$18... the walk is not too bad but I caught the taxi as there is a underpass which is quite quiet at night time which I wanted to avoid (the morning is OK).The complimentary hotel shuttle was availble at HK Airport Express station at 8:00am to transfer to hotel so if you are taking the HK Airport express, this is not a bad option.The walk to time square from hotel - you will pass a market which is close to the bridge (this is where the locals buy their meat and vegies and fruit)... the side store generally do not open until 11am but try the Saint Honar (?) bread store, they have freshly baked chicken buns, char siu boa, glutinous rice which is quite delicious when they are hot and soft. Room was nice and clean, small but sufficient. No free internet access if you do not have a laptop (i think they have free wifi if you have your laptop). Hotel provides complimentary water (they have 4 different brands sitting in the room for you to choose) - i recommend you take one before you head out for the day esp if you do a lot of walking.Aircond was strong and tv reception could be better (just the clarity wasn't good but still watchable).No swimming pool, however, there is a gym (which I didn't use as all the walking in HK was more than a gym run!).There are plenty of taxis (ask the staff to hail you one). The porter boys are quick to attend to your luggage. I booked my hotel via travel agent for less than $100 per night for a superior room which is quite a good deal. The room has frosted windows so you will not see the cemetery if this is your concern.
