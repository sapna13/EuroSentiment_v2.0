{"text":"Paris is perfect! We just returned from an 18 day trip through Europe. Spent two days in Firenze at the Paris Hotel. The hotel was in a perfect location in the city centre. Walking distance to the train station and all of the museums, churches, etc. Our room was on right on Via dei Banchi, so if we looked left we saw Piazza del Duomo and to the right was Piazza Santa Maria Novella. The staff was excellent and provided perfect recommendations. They were all so eager to help; Front desk, bell desk, maids, parking, breakfast staff....everyone. We were only there for two days but I think we managed to meet and enjoy service from everyone who worked there.This is an old world Tuscan building with history so rich you can feel it. The art throughout the hotel was very impressive and provided the perfect atmosphere, especially for those looking for classic Florence charm. I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend, especially given the price\/value ratio... a bargain.Three bits of Advice: 1) This hotel is located on a one-way street (heading toward SM Novella). If you drive, know your route to the hotel and park right in front. Let them park your car.2) This hotel, like most in Europe, have few power outlets. Ask the staff to borrow an extension cord if you have more than one device to charge at night, i.e. PDA, Phone, laptop, etc. 3) Let the staff handle your bags. Even though there is a lift, you have stairs and steps to navigate for some of the rooms and if you over pack like most people do, then you should take advantage of the great service and let the pros handle the bags.
