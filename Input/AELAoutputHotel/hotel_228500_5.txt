{"text":"Great trip!!! Myself and my partner stayed at the Expo Hotel whilst on a 4 day break in Barcelona. Upon arrival in Barcelona it was a very quick transfer, we caught a taxi from the airport to the hotel and this took around 20 minutes and cost about 20 Euros. Check in was very quick we were delighted to learn we had been upgraded to an Executive room. However when we got to the room it looked very much like a standard room, I was not sure what you got from an Executive suite, but we got 2 singlebeds and I had booked a double so we pushed the beds together. The room was clean and good view over Barcelona. I found the receptionist very helpful when we asked for the best route to the Harbour.This hotel is about 2 minutes from the Metro, and very quick but it was very very hot inthe subway!! 37 degrees outside so you can imagine how hot it was underground!I would not recommend eating or drinking in the hotel it is just too expensive. The rooftop pool is lovely if you can get in it as there was an awful lot of children jumping in and out of the pool!However I would recommend this hotel and its location. Good staff and very helpful!I would recommend one restuarant if you like a beautfully cooked steak the catch the metro to Drassanes the head for Sedna lovely restuarant!!! Anyway all in all loved Barcelona could have stayed longer! ","annotations":[]}
