{"text":"mixed feelings We stayed at the Magda Etoile for three nights this November. We booked it after reading the glowing reviews on Tripadvisor, thinking it would be an impeccable experience. The many 5.0 ratings are convincing, yet a bit misleading.First off, the location is truly terrific. Having been to Paris many times, I can attest to the fact that the Magda Etoile is in a great location to see the city. It is around the corner form the 1 line, which crosses Paris horizontally and takes you pretty much everywhere. The stop is called Charles de Gaulle-Etoile. From the hotel it's about a minute on foot.Now for the buts...The hotel is small, one could say intimate, and rooms are not very large. They are very very clean, but our room had clearly been smoked in. The smoke smell was quite intense and if you're very sensitive, you'd be mad, I guarantee it. The bath towels we used after showering, upon arrival, smelled strongly of smoke. I called reception and we received new ones, but I will admit that it skeeved us out that we had the previous guests bath towels on the shelf... he\/she didn't use them, but still...Then, the front desk. The girls were great, helpful and pleasant. But one scraggly, skinny dude we asked to make a reservation for us couldn't have been more arrogant. When we asked him to call a well-known restaurant to see if we could get a table, he insisted it was a chain and that there was another one nearby, which we should just walk to. I knew for a fact that wasn't the case, so when I asked him to find the one I meant in St. Germain, he asked if I had the telephone number...like as in call them yourself. I said i could look it up online, but that I was hoping he could make the call, since my French is rudimentary and sometimes it helps when a hotel calls. He sighed...he made me wait...then he said he would call back...and didn't. When my husband went downstairs and asked him, he seemed put out and said he hadn't had time yet to find the number, along with the roll of the eye. In short, he was a jerk. It kind of colored our view of the rest of the staff, perhaps unfairly.The breakfast was ok, but at 12 euros per person not exactly good. Some croissants, some baguette, wrapped cheese, jam...coffee..oh well.So all in all it's not a total disappointment, it's an adequate hotel, but we won't give it a 5.0. We decided not to drink the Kool-Aid..;-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2009,"mention":"roll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread_roll"],"startOffset":2005},{"endOffset":2200,"mention":"croissants","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Croissant"],"startOffset":2190},{"endOffset":2215,"mention":"baguette","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Baguette"],"startOffset":2207},{"endOffset":2215,"mention":"baguette","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Baguette"],"startOffset":2207},{"endOffset":2236,"mention":"jam","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fruit_preserves"],"startOffset":2233},{"endOffset":2236,"mention":"jam","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fruit_preserves"],"startOffset":2233},{"endOffset":2236,"mention":"jam","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fruit_preserves"],"startOffset":2233}]}
