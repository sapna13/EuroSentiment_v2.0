{"text":"A lovely time spoiled.... What a shame! This property has much to like. Lovely grounds teeming with native birds and beautiful flora. Handsome, if faded public spaces. Great golf. Very good tennis courts and a head pro (Felix) who is excellent with all levels and ages. Nice (but not great) beach - only 30 feet of which is easily swimable, and much of which is covered with seaweed and a surprising amount of trash. Good (not great) food. Nice pools - including a hidden pool by the tennis courts. Nice horseback riding experience for all ages. Good water sports. However, the service experience was absurd! A literal laundry list of irritations including:- missing room reservations on arrival compounded by surly, not my problem front desk staff - preponderance of staff that doesn't speak any English - sheets that don't fit the bed (perhaps they don't have fitted sheets in the DR)- next day laundry that never shows up and requires several phone calls- activities staff (for bikes, carts, etc) that is rarely at their desk, and when there is surly at best...no bikes today- mini-bars that don't work- A\/C that doesn't work - insufficient beach\/pool towels, beach chairs, wait-staff- random items that appear on all bills, and are waived only if questioned at check-outThe ownership has really dropped the ball. This is a resort that has clearly seen better days and a management team that needs to be given a wake-up call. What could be a great family vacation spot is well on its way to becoming a bargain basement facility better suited to the transient flight crews that fill the lobby each night than upscale travelers looking for a nice getaway. Perhaps if management was spending less time and money building gazillion dollar golf chateaus, they would have more time and attention for the base facility.Important note - you can't drink the water in the DR (or even brush your teeth with the tap water). First hand experience shows that one accidental mouthful in the shower and 36 hours later you are bent-over in cramps and on you way to the resident Doctor. While that is the case everywhere in the DR, at this resort, it is made more galling at this resort due to the fact that water bottles cost $1 - 2 each and are a constant challenge to find - make sure to buy extras at dinner and bring them back to your room.
