{"text":"Beautiful looking, but hit or miss on everything else Just arrived back from a Sunquest vacation to the Blau Natura Park. It is hard to give an overall impression of the hotel as some things were great, while others poor. The hotel is a short 20 minute drive from the airport (nice looking airport, but the staff will try to extort as much money from you as they can...). It really is in the middle of nowhere, and the area is not pleasant smelling once you get off the resort property.The property itself is quite nice, more natural looking than most - with the exception of the fish ponds\/lagoons that are very clearly artificial. It is fun to see and feed the fish and birds that are all over the place. The buildings incorporate a lot of natural materials, which give it a more rustic feel. The beach is a decent size, but there is a lot of seaweed. This is mainly due to the strong winds (which actually help keep you comfortable during the day).The rooms were a disappointment. Everything in them smells musty, and we had little ants of some kind in the bathroom and on the desk. Thankfully, they didn't get into our stuff. The beds were harder than any futon I've ever slept on, and I had a sore neck all week as a result. The electricity is definitely an issue - some of the lights didn't work, and a surge blew out my battery charger. We did have hot water and the A\/C worked well, so we were lucky compared to some. Don't travel with anyone you might be shy around, as the bathroom doors are made of slotted wood, and only slide back and forth. Note that noise carries pretty easily, especially near the theatre.The food was hit or miss. Generally, when the meat was cooked properly, it was quite flavourful. The pasta was generally okay. There were issues with keeping food hot though, and both me and my friend ended up with intestinal problems (and when they say don't drink the water from the taps, this includes brushing your teeth!). The a la carte restaurants weren't anything special. Service varied wildly depending on who you had, although the people at the bars were quite nice. Considering the variety of countries that they draw visitors from, I was impressed that most staff could converse in English, French, Spanish or German. The entertainment staff tried, but some of the shows were a litlle slow. Excellent dancers though.The prices at the hotel store were decent (good selection if you forgot anything), but you could get better if you haggled well with the merchants that came on site a few times a week. Don't accept their first or second offers though! They do get a bit annoying though as every one of them wants you to stop and look at their stuff. None of it is really original, as you can get the same items elsewhere on the island if you go into town or on a tour. Do take a tour though, as it will give you a better idea of the island outside of the hotel.  I am glad I went, but I wouldn't go back to this hotel again.
