{"text":"Great business hotel near Suntec with a few disappointments The Pan Pacific Singapore is a first-rate hotel in the Suntec City area, connected by skywalks or underground walkways to all of the major venues in this section of town. I stayed here for four nights and found the hotel and its location spectacular, with only a few customer service quirks. Read on for more...LOCATION:The Pan Pacific Singapore is located immediately adjacent to Suntec Convention Center  Suntec City Mall, as well as the Marina Square shopping center. It's in the cluster of hotels that includes the Mandarin Oriental, Conrad and Ritz Carlton. The hotel is about a S$25 taxi ride from the Changi airport, during the late-night hours when most flights to Japan and North America arrive and depart. While the MRT is not easily accessed by this hotel, it's a very simple walk to just about anywhere in the district, and Singapore taxis are extremely inexpensive by most international standards. (The MRT can be accessed by walking through the Marina Square mall, to the One Raffles Link shopping area, then through the underground passage to the City Hall MRT station.)Tourists, be aware: This hotel is definitely situated to be primarily a business property. Unless you plan to take a lot of taxis, you're not really within footsteps of major attractions, or even transit links to reach major attractions. It's a great hotel if you don't mind walking to reach those places, but be aware that you probably will be doing a great deal of walking.ROOMS:The rooms are typical high-class Asian business hotel fare. The sleeping area is spacious with comfortable beds and a work area. The bathrooms are spacious and well-appointed with a large bathtub, a separate shower, and a toilet area with a door separating it from the rest of the bathroom. There is a separate luggage nook and plenty of closet storage. The light switches for the room can all be separately controlled by a bedside console. The rooms all feature full floor-to-ceiling windows (or sliding doors, if you're on the side of the hotel with a balcony), with both sunshade and blackout curtains to control light in the room.AMENITIES:On the Executive Floors, Internet access is included with the room. On the standard floors, Internet is an additional S$25\/day, however that is billed in increments of S$0.25\/minute up to the maximum, so if you only use a short time on the net, your cost will be less than the daily rate. There are several restaurants offering a variety of International cuisines, an excellent lobby bar with live nightly entertainment, a spa, an in-house tailor, and ample shopping options within steps of the hotel. Given the connection to both Suntec City and Marina Square, literally hundreds of food options are within a 2-5 minute walk of your room -- without even going outside -- if you find that the hotel services are not to your tastes.FRONT DESK \/ SERVICE:The front-of-house staff are all well-trained and helpful. Luggage service is prompt and friendly. Check-in is reasonably efficient and responsive. However, problem resolution could use a bit of improvement. When I first arrived, the Internet connection in my room was not functioning. After sending an engineer to diagnose, they offered to switch me to a new room the next day. However, the replacement rooms offered were either on lower floors, or did not reflect my room preferences -- or were generally not of the same quality of the room I was leaving, with cause. I would have expected a hotel of this quality to offer a room upgrade for an involuntary relocation, if a room of the same caliber was not available. In the end, we settled on a room in my original class on a lower floor that was acceptable, but still somewhat disappointing to me.ROOM PRICE:Like many business district hotels, the cost of the rooms here seems to be wildly variable. Due to slightly differing check-in dates and length of stay, different people in my same group had rates ranging from S$189\/night to as high as S$300\/night for a standard room, over mostly the same span of days. Given the high cost of hotel rooms in Singapore in general, I think most visitors will be happy at this property at whatever the best-available price during their stay. Just be aware that substantially better rates may be available for the length of your stay here with only minor tweaking of your arrival\/departure.Overall, the Pan Pacific is a great hotel if you'll be doing business in the Suntec or Beach Road areas. I would recommend it to anyone traveling to Singapore.
