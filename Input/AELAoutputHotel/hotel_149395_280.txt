{"text":"A wonderful trip! We traveled with a group of 5 couples and one has already written a review, so rather than repeat what she said, I wanted to mention a few more tips that I think you would find helpful. Towels: They give you a card that you exchange for a beach towel, the first day, they ran out of towels by 12:00 and guests were told to come back in 20 minutes. After finally getting towels on the second return, we learned to get towels on the way to breakfast in the morning to avoid this problem, and also to keep our towels for more than one day. We also traded dirty towels for clean towels at the end of the day rather than just turning in our towels and getting our card back. As long as you have your card by check out, you won't be charged the $15.00 per card charge.Food\/Drink: The food was great, one tip we learned is that at the Italian restaurant, you can order pizzas to go. One day, our group ordered 6 pizzas and ate them on the beach. The coldest bottled beer and bottled water is at the lobby bar. Most bars have machines with frozen pina coladas and a drink called a paradisus (yummy). However, these are virgin drinks and you have to ask for them with rum if you would like alcohol added. When they add the rum, these drinks lose some of their thickness. A good alternative that they make from scratch is the banana mama. The Hibiscus, where they have a buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner closes in between meals. They are times when the only food that you can find has to be ordered thru room service (no charge, we just tipped the delivery person). The hamburgers at the pool snack bar are bad, would not recommend them! A few of us prefer Diet Coke over Diet Pepsi but thought they didn't have diet coke since nobody ever asked us which one when we orderd a diet soda. We later learned that they did have Diet coke, we just needed to order Coca Cola light!Weather: We had several spotty thunderstorms while there, many came up suddenly and were also gone quickly. There are umbrellas in the rooms, we didn't have one and managed to avoid getting rained on, but if you don't have one in your room and want to be prepared, think you could call and ask for one and take one with you in the late afternoon and evening.Transportation: The resort is large but easily walkable. We chose to walk most of the time rather than wait for the trams. Flip flops and sandals get slippery on the tiles and sidewalks surrounding the resort so be careful! Phone Calls: Research with your cell phone company before leaving how much it will cost to call the US and whether your phone will work. Some in our group did not have service. I had to get something added to my service plan in order to make international calls (it didn't cost extra). There is also an additional fee that is charged on the Dominican side and nobody could ever tell us how much that was. We won't know until we get our bill how much we really spent on two 10 minute phone calls. The easiest way to communicate with our kids back home was by using the computers in the lobby and sending emails. 60 minute ATT calling cards purchased in the US before leaving only had 6 minutes of calling time when calling from the DR. Special Occasion: We were celebrating my 40th bday and my husband arranged through guest services for our group to have champagne and birthday cake at El Romantico on the last night (again, no extra charge). They decorated our table, dimmed the lights and brought the cake out while singing Happy Birthday! It was VERY SPECIAL! We loved our trip and would definitely return to Paradise at the Paradisus!
