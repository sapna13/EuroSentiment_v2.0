{"text":"Upgraded through problems We had arrived at the resort and had to wait approximately 2 hours to get into our room. We would have gone directly to our room but there was some confusion with the reservation. We had an e-ticket with 4 people on it for 2 rooms. They gave us rooms at opposite ends of the complex. We asked for ajoining rooms but they don't exist in the Dominican. When they did finally give us our room, they upgraded us to the 5* part of the resort. We had a private dining room, private pool and beach area with free internet and safe for the room in the royal club. We were given 2 suites. We enjoyed all that comes with the 5* experience. The only problem was that we had rain for 3 days and on the last night that it rained, it was coming in under the patio door and down the wall from the roof. The one main complaint that I have is that the bathtub was disgusting. You would not want to take a bath there...that's for sure. The maid was constantly in our room and we rarely saw her. There is a turn down service and we got chocolates 2 nights when we returned from the nightly entertainment. All of the staff were very accomodating and in the Royal Club, the staff were well versed in the english language. There were many activities to part in but we enjoyed just relaxing. I would definitely recommend this hotel especially in the Royal Club section.
