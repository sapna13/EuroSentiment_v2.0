{"text":"Very clean  I stayed in 4 other hotels in Spain during my trip and the room was one of the smaller ones but the bathroom was the best at Hotel Europa. I always like to take a nice hot shower in a spacious  comfortable bathroom, which I got at this hotel.It's located in the center-center of the city, very convenient for sightseeing and getting on the Metro. The area around the hotel is always full of people (except for early in the morning) and you can get the feel of Madrid. I knew from (thanks to) other people's review that the hotel was undergoing renovation. I didn't ask for it when I made reservations directly with the hotel but we did get one of the renovated rooms so it was very nice and clean with a tiny balcony. The noise from the outside didn't bother us but sometimes we heard a kind of gurgle noise probably from the other rooms (maybe someone flushing the toilet or using the shower, I'm not sure). I was a bit surprised when I first heard the noise but it was just once in a while and it didn't bother us much. The lobby was going through some construction but we didn't hear anything from our room although our room was just 1 floor above.We didn't have any trouble with the airconditioning, probably because we stayed towards the end of October. Not too cold nor hot, so we didn't have to bother with it. Breakfast was not included but there's a cafe next door. The price ranged from 2.40 (coffee  toast) to 10.00 euros depending on how much you want to eat! Other things I liked and that was helpful about the hotel was that all 3 people I met at the reception spoke English and there's a shuttle service to the airport (I believe several euros cheaper than taking a cab). In some of the websites I saw the hotel is rated 1 star but I found in one of the guidebooks I bought it is rated 3 stars. I don't know how they rate hotels and which is true but if you consider the location, price, cleanliness and comfort of the room and bathroom, I think it's worth staying here.
