{"text":"not worth the money............ Whatever you do dont get the shared hotel bus form the airport! The driver charges over the price from the booking office to make a profit (and then you end up in the unmarked minibus, which left way after the official minibus!). The busses also didn't leave the terminal for a very long time, far far quicker and easier to get the train into Centraal station (15 mins) and then the tram (5, or 2) to Musuemplein which is then 2 mins walk from hotel.Rooms are clean, but boring(furniture looks like something from a chain motel), locks on the doors are flimsy  very awkward, tiny unventilated bathrooms, no airconditioning and look nothing like the hotel website photos! The dinning room also looks nothing like the photos on the website! Shame it is a period property but needs redecorating urgently.When we were there, another in the party had scaffolding outside her window and the hotel couldn't understand the security concern. It also says it is non-smoking, but all the staff there come into the bar for their breaks and smoke in there! The broken glass windows downstairs are also attractive!Its not worth the price, booking agents ( various websites) try to make out its a very, very good 3 star hotel worth being a 4 star, its not! Its a low 3 star with a high room rate, so if you want a hotel thats pricey for what it is but in a good location go for it. ","annotations":[]}
