{"text":"Disappointed\/lots of smoking The resort grounds were beautiful and for the staff that spoke English, they were helpful. As far as kid-friendly goes...not for my kids. At 2 1\/2 and 5 years old the only thing for them to do was swim. The pirate ship (*this was what really excited them*) at the Kids Club was being renovated and we could not use any of the Kids Club facilities ourselves. Plus the activities they did offer for the kids in the evening were very late (8:30-9:00). We never ate at any of the restaurants besides the buffet because my kids couldn't sit to wait for food service. The food we did have was good and fresh. Room service was a joke, there is no menu. You have to call room service directly and they tell you what is on the menu. It was very tough to get milk for my kids and snacks in between normal meal times. I finally learned to just take food from the buffet so I could give them a snack. The pool was beautiful but we could never get a chair or a float. People marked their chairs with towels and took floats back to their rooms at night. Really dispicable.Rooms were simple and very small. We had ants. The entire resort wreaked of cigarette smoke. If you don't like smoke, don't go here. We moved our room 2 times because the smell of smoke was so strong I couldn't stand it.All in all we were disappointed. Would we go back to Dreams???NOWAY.
