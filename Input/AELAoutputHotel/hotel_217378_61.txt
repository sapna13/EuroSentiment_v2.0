{"text":"Never Again... I looked at other reviews on this property and I'm not sure what kool aid folks are drinking. I stayed at this hotel for three days and it was the worst of my life. First, I can't belive this is a LXR hotel, it's way old and in need of a massive rennovation. It may have been hip and cool in the 60's but not now. Granted they do have great views b\/c of their location but the rooms have carpet that's old and grimy, everything has a patina (and not in a good way) on it, and you can see the wear and tear all throughout. My issues at the hotel also included: internet access was via a port that was located behind the bedstand, so any work on the computer was done on the bed...very uncomfortable. I ordered a pizza and had to go through three rounds before it was right...first time wrong toppings, second time ice cold in the middle, third time and 2 hours later finally right. I didn't find the staff friendly at all but a bit rude, I arrived and had to wait 5 min for someone to help me with my luggage even though it was obvious I needed help and had just gotten out of a taxi. The elevators...well hopefully you are not in a rush to go anywhere. They are as old as can be, slow as can be. On my last day there, I had to wait for 15 min to go upstairs and 15 min to come back down b\/c they were slow and everyone was waiting for them. On my way down, we stopped at every single floor, which had folks who had also been waiting a long time but the elevators were full. On one good note, the beach is right there but I think I would have sacrificed a longer walk for a nicer hotel. In short if you want to go back in time and don't mind that things are rundown then I guess this is the place for you. I hear they are going to have a 50 million dollar rennovation and my comment to that would be...is that enough?
