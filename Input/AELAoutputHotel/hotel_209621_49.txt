{"text":"Beautiful space but poorly managed Loved the lobby and had no problems with the room once we got in the room....We requested a non-smoking room with two beds on an upper floor (paying extra for a suite) and we were given a smoke-saturated room on the second floor with one king bed. After a friendly but firm conversation with the manager, we were moved up to a non-smoking room with two beds on the 7th floor (after being told that there were no other rooms available). This hotel could and should be a 4-star but it needs to improve its service. We couldn't even get a cup of coffee in the morning because the restaurant was understaffed (the buffet bar was cluttered with dirty plates and the coffee urns were empty by 10am???). So we took our dollars to the Hilton Caribe next door for breakfast.On the second night, the hotel teamed up with a local radio station for a pre-New Year's Eve event--which meant loud pounding music in the 7-story atrium pouring all the way up into the rooms. It was great to see lots of people having fun in the lobby but the noise spilled into the rooms (and the live music did not stop until 1am). The hotel management did not consider the comfort of the paying guests when they organized this event. After this experience, I don't trust they are able to provide a high level of service you would come to expect from a 300plus\/per night room.
