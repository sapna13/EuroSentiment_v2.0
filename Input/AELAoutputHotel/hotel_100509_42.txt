{"text":"Good Value and Location I contacted the property directly for my reservation. Staff was pleasant and helpful, our room was small but clean and quiet. Yes, there were condoms in the room, a candle, and a Kama Sutra book but we didn't mind. Bed was comfortable and there was a sink area as well as a desk. Free wireless was available which was great! A member of my family also has asthma but suffered no effects of mold while staying here (didn't see any in our room either). We opted for the shared bathroom and they were always clean and available. There was heat lamp in the bathroom which was nice when drying off and soft jazz music playing in the bathroom which I found nice. My family and I stayed here (2 of us w\/a 4 yr old) and the hotel was a perfect base for sightseeing-in Belltown, blocks from Pike Market, the Waterfront and the Space Needle. Don't stay here if you don't like walking! Also, if you are taking the Victoria Clipper, Pier 69 is a short walk down the hill which was convenient. One downside was there is no stairs at the entry and they are a little steep if you have luggage. The person at the front desk hurried down right away to help us up with luggage. The self-serve light breakfast in the morning was good: juice, yogurt, granola, toast, coffee or tea which was served in lounge area downstairs where you could also watch a shared t.v. We loved our stay here and would stay again.. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":935,"mention":"Victoria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Victoria_Bitter"],"startOffset":927}]}
