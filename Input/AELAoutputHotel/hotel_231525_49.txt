{"text":"Great small hotel in fantastic location Just returned from a four day stay at this great little hotel. The location is perfect right in the heart of the gothic quarter. Our room was small (207) and had no view - but having said that, the room was clean  had everything we needed (except no tea\/coffee making facilities - I don't know about anyone else but I need a caffine fix in the morning so poor Nick had to get up and pop out to the coffee shop and bring it back up to the room - no great hardship as it was only 50 paces away). The staff on the front desk were very helpful and always smiling. We would definately stay here again because I think to location is pretty hard to beat - I would ask in advance though for one of the larger rooms and bring my travel kettle (for the early morning brew!!!). A couple of tips for places to see. We loved the Spanish Village (which you can get to from the Blue Route on the tourist bus (very good value and a great way to orientate yourself with the city). We had a lazy afternoon including a leisurely lunch and found it to be a nice restbite from the hustle  bustle of the city centre. Cuitadella park was another quiet spot to while away a couple of hours. A great eating place was Sinatra's which is located just off the Plaza de Reil. It's a minute away from one of the main restaurants right on the square that always has a queue!! Another is down on the marina. It is actually a moored boat but I can't remember the name (but there is only one that's a restuarent too) and they did the best tapas we had all trip. All in all a great little hotel in a fab location in an amazing city. Anyone thinking about visiting - should just go and book it  ENJOY...
