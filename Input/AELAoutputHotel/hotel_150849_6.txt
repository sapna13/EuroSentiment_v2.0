{"text":"good time! I travelled to the Riu Bambu last year at the end of December, and was there for New Years Eve.I am a teenager and I travelled with my family along with another 23 great friends! (ages 4-55). We all had a great time. The beach was beautiful and there were always chairs and towels available. The bartenders and animation team(entertainers) always stopped to talk and spend time with what they called us la familia 27. Games at the pool and beach were very entertaining, as no one was ever bored. Even our fathers got into it! The nightly shows were good, some alot better than others. New Years Eve was amazing! The food was excellent and so was the entertainment. There were balloons, creative displays, banners and signs everywhere. The music was also very good.The rooms were OK, but really how much time do you spend in it? I stayed in a room with 3 friends and we were only there to shower, get ready and sleep. If you are spending more time than that in your room.. why even go somewhere hot and pay large amounts of money?The food was good. I come from a very Italian background so nothing like what my nonna makes, but everything was cooked and there were no illnesses. Its a buffet so I dont know what these people are expecting (obviously its not going to have gourmet foods, they need to accomodate everyone with their food). Sometimes it was hard to find a seat but we made friends with one of the waiter people so there was a section for 27 waiting for us every night.We did not spend much time at the pool, it was not very large but it served its purpose. As a teenager I was hoping for some more nightlife with people around our age, but there were more younger people so we had to go to a family-friendly hotel.Overall I had a great time, with great friends, its all about what you make of the vacation. We all had alot of fun and are going to another Riu this new years coming. ","annotations":[]}
