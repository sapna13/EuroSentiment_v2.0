{"text":"Classic Luxury Should have written long ago on a wonderful trip to Amsterdam. My friend is quite the cannibis conniseur, and had a blast, but I was there strictly for some luxury relaxation and escapism. This was THE place for it. Room services including cleaning and food services were seamless and efficient!. Our room faced the front of the hotel ( and was nearly directly over the front entrance with a generous view of the canal Prinsingract--sp? It was late fall and a little cool but everything about the hotel spelled deluxe. Our room was VERY large for a standard room and was about 200euros nightly but well worth it. We were afraid we were going to be stuck with the average European Suite the itty bitty room with the giant price, but not so. It could see how difficult it would be for a physically challenged person to navigate for there were many, many steps up and down through the connected houses as you moved toward your room. The room was well worth it however. The bath was all marble with a rainshower head sprayer and a couple of other fixtures there that I havent ever seen since elsewhere. The turn down service was timely as well. The hotel restaurants were VERY expensive and so we ventured down to Dam Square for good eats of all different nationalities. Overall, the cleanliness, classic style and spaciousness of the hotel room and general helpfulness of the staff made this hotel stay worth the price. I would stay here again in the warm season and request the same room for a fabulous view! ","annotations":[]}
