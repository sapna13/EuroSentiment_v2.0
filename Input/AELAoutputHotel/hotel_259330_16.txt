{"text":"Grand Paradise Bavaro totally ruined our honeymoon We departed on Dec 6 from Toronto after a 2 hour delay and then had to be de-iced which took close to another hour. The flight was ok - Skyservice really doesn't give you too many luxury's. We arrived at the airport and had to wait in line to have our photo taken for a souvenier which we though was overkill at that point considering we had been travelling for about 8 hours. Airport staff were very friendly and brought our bags to the bus. Bus ride was good. Arrived at resort which looked completely desolate. We were trying to explain to the front desk staff that we were on our honeymoon and wanted a king size room but they didn't listen and didn't even ask for our travel voucher. We were given a double room in building 7 - Select section. This was a decent room. We tried to find food that night around midnight. Absolutely NO ONE helped us!!! It was rediculous. Finally after finding the 24 hour sports bar we were offered some popcorn and ham and cheese sandwich that was who knows how old. Good thing we packed some pringles in our luggage or we would be very hungry all night. Overall the food was horrible! I survived on omelettes, french fries and pasta. I found the selection to be very european, desserts were all made with custard, the pastries that I did try were very tasteless. The a la cartes that we went to were horrible except the italian place. Good food but stingy on helpings. I ordered ravioli and there were only 6 pieces on my plate. My husband who will eat pretty much anything was even complaining that the food was gross.Drinks were way too strong even when you asked for them to be weaker they didn't listen. Bars were decent. Bar staff was always friendly and most spoke english.We went on an excursion called Tropical Storm! It was so awful that we complained to the Sunquest rep and got 1\/2 our money back. The didn't do half of the things outlined in the brochure and to top it all off the staff sold drugs to one of the other travellers on our bus and then the drive was smoking a joint on the way back to the resort! We couldn't believe it.The beach was fantastic - best part of our trip...lots of chairs and huts to sit under. Very clean water - no seaweed. We spotted fish swimming in the waves. The stretch of beach is huge and you can walk forever, taking a look at the other resorts along the way. My only complaint about the beach in on our last day I found a syringe (without the needle thankfully) on the beach. Don't know where it came from but that was pretty scary to find.Our biggest complaint for the entire week was the day we were leaving. Saturday's at Grand Paradise Bavaro seem to be a free for all with the locals. We were amazed at how many people showed up. They come by the bus-full! We couldn't get a seat at the beach, on the tram, or at the bar. Couldn't find a beach towel in the whole resort. They were everywhere and they are rude to the point of almost barbaric! We had to check out at 1pm but our bus didn't arrive until 6 so we were told there was a courtesy room for us to shower and clean up before we left - NO SUCH LUCK!!!!! If I hadn't have raised my voice and caused a stink we would have had to travel covered in sand and salt water. They allowed us to shower in a room in another section which was a horrible room. Ugly ripped bed spread, cracks in walls, no fan, horrible horrible room. We were told that there were no towels (again because of the [--] locals) and had to dry ourselves off with a bathmat!We are trying to put forth a formal complaint with Sunquest. There is NO WAY this hotel is a 4 star...not even a 2 star. We had read reviews and some were good, some bad, so we went with an open mind to make the best of what we were given. We really tried but this resort was just horrible. I don't even want to go back to Dominican because of it!
