{"text":"One of the best in the world Truly a place that knows its business.From start to finish, the experience is everything one would want. Arrive at the discrete entrance, an intelligent and interested employee sorts your car and your luggage whilst escorting you across the bridge to check in. The rooms are mainly in single level villas, spread along various winding pathways in beautiful and immaculate gardens - so there's noise neither from above nor nearby, and it never feels crowded as you make you way through the hotel. Every detail is carefully attended to - the valet parking noticed I opened the roof on my car, so afterwards always delivered it to me with the roof ready down, the rubbish cleared out, fresh bottles of chilled water in the cup holders. The pool attendant placed a towel on the ladder the moment I dived in - and had everything from fruit to sun lotion and magazines to hand in case you wanted it.The concierges really made the place. Tickets for the Getty Villa, arrangements for the best studio tour you can get, advice on good routes to destinations for seeing interesting stuff along the way, all this and much more. The best was to describe a type of skateboard I wanted to take back as a gift, but didn't know the name of - and come back to my room to find one sitting on the desk.Rooms are excellently specced out and every one of the staff was of the highest calibre - from the gardener I asked about some work they were doing to the parking staff, the bar waiters - and of course those concierges.
