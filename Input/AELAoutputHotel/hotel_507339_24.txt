{"text":"Friendly, quiet and great for a long stay My wife and I stayed at Venice-on the Beach Hotel for a month in December 2006 and for another month in December 2007. We enjoyed our first stay so much that we convinced our family members to join us over the Christmas holidays. Most of our family members stayed a full week. There were 10 of us, two persons to each of 4 rooms and my wife and I stayed in the suite. Each of the four rooms contained a microwave oven, refrigerator, private wc \/shower and a large plasma TV in addition to very comfortable new beds. The suite contained a fully equiped kitchen; a large living room with dining table, sofa, and several chairs; a bedroom with a plasma TV; and a private wc\/shower. The living room easily accomodated all 10 of us for meals, conversations and entertainment. We even connected our new Wii (a type of video game) to the TV in the living room and enjoyed a variety of contests. There was a patio off the living room where we BBQed most of our meals. The manager, Greg, was exceptionally friendly and accomodating to all our requests. He made sure there was a freshly brewed pot of coffee in the hallway each morning as we got up. The hotel is located in a quiet part of Venice Beach, but was only a 3 minute walk to many good low as well as moderately high priced restaurants. Gabe's restaurant was our favorite. The hotel seems to attract a very nice clientele -- guests who enjoy talking to each other on the patio at sunset but who respect each others' privacy and quiet. We have enjoyed both stays at this hotel and hope to go back again for another month's stay. Our family members, too, enjoyed their stay and some will return this fall to use the hotel as a base for participating in the L.A. triathlon.
