{"text":"Bit disappointed by Oriente I stayed at the Oriente with my husband on a very busy weekend at the beginning of September. We struggled to get a hotel because of a large conference going on. All hotels were either fully booked (we started to try and book in March) or charging a premium. We picked the Oriente because we knew where it was, having been to Barcelona several times before, and it seemed to be the best of what was left, we did pay much more than the usual rate. The hotel has been undergoing some refurbishment, and we apparantly had one of the refurbished rooms. On arriving, the reception staff did the basics but no more. It might have been useful to know where the lifts were and that to get to the 3rd floor you have to take the 2nd lift along. Service with a grunt I'm afraid.The room was quite small and the bathroom initially looked quite swish. We had no bath, just a shower, but the design was ridiculous in that the quite powerful shower (with an already broken hose) was trying to be contained by a small glass screen, no wider than a foot. Whenever we had a shower we had to take the loo roll out of the room because the whole room got soaked, and we spent much of our time mopping the floor. This was not designed to be a wet room!!There was no safe in the room. (I still have no idea why, after we'd checked in and the room was fully made up, the maid let herself into our room early evening - we were having a siesta and so she exited fast with no explanation. It was not as though there was a turn-down service!)The breakfast room was okay, would have benefited from a bit of natural light, food was usual continental buffet, nothing too special.I can say the hotel was clean and everything worked, but it was nothing special.Location was central ","annotations":[{"endOffset":285,"mention":"premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":278},{"endOffset":1118,"mention":"roll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread_roll"],"startOffset":1114},{"endOffset":1118,"mention":"roll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread_roll"],"startOffset":1114}]}
