{"text":"Beautiful palace stay, kid-friendly too My husband, 17month old and I went to Florence for a 3day weekend in Feb 2007. We loved the look of the old Palazzo and magnificent rooms online and were not disapponted. The lobby was dark and cavernous but had a lovely, sun-filled courtyard on the side. The velvet seated, gilded cage elevator, though cramped, was source of great amusement to my son. The stting area shared by the rooms on the second floor was breathtaking with their murano glass chandeliers, and the coffee\/tea amenities the hotel stocked was a nice touch. There is a rooftop balcony which is a long climb up the stairwell but which had the most amazing views of Florence. Definitely worth the hike up and it would be lovely on a summer's evening as there is a small bar up there to serve drinks.The breakfast room turned sleek, sexy bar at night (no, really!) had the largest chandelier I have ever seen; at night, the room turned into a place for a cocktail with a pool table lounge next door. Candles filled all the walkways and it was truly impressive.The area south of the river was a nice quiet section of Florence, which is easily covered by foot. A walk into the heart of the city would take 20-25 minutes. For dinner, we booked a babysitting service through the hotel (very easy and the sitter was lovely) and went for a great dinner at Borgo San Jacopo, a sleek restaurant overlooking the river and about an 8 minute walk from the Palazzo. We also booked a daytrip out to the outlets, which we arranged thru expedia but which the hotel can also arrange for you.A lovely visit, beautiful hotel, fantastic service and we would be happy to stay there again on our next 3day getaway to Florence from London.
