{"text":"Great Service but... Spent 5 nights at the Hotel 41 after lots of research (especially due to positive reviews on this site). I won't rehash everything that's already been written but here are the pro's and cons:Pros: - Service was EXCELLENT, I mean bend over backwards polite service for anything you could ask for. I've stayed in many great 5 Star hotels (I'm writing this from a 5star in Madrid now) and the employees at Hotel 41 are the best I've encountered. I can't say enough good things about the staff they work very hard to make their guests comfortable. Requests were met almost instantly via the whatever\/whenever button on the phone. So fast it was almost freightening! One employee, Chantel was particularly charming and enjoyable to meet. - Food was also very good and breakfast in bed was well done every morning. (Included in rate). Plunder the pantry was also a nice touch each night. The BBar was excellent but for some reason is only open on weekdays.Neutral:- Location - right near Buckingham Palace but not really in the middle of too much in London. The neighborhood is basically residential once you walk a block or two. If you are flying in from Gatwick, the hotel is in walking distance to the Gatwick Express Train that is a godsend going back and forth. There is actually a show within easy walking distance to the hotel - Billy Elliott - which was wonderful.- Size of hotel - it does feel like you are entering a private club however you miss out on big hotel features like a spa or gym (although they do have free gym passees to LA Fitness just down the street)Cons:- The rooms. The room (executive King) nearly drove me crazy. Upon entering the room for the first time my instant reaction was that I made a mistake in choosing this hotel (The level of service from the staff made me stay and I have to say I enjoyed my stay overall). Maybe I needed a better room category or something but the photos posted online make the rooms look so much bigger and welcoming than they really are. Although the rooms have everything you could ask for (including great water pressure and even an IPod player) there is so much crap and decor and extra furniture that you bump into something on any trip across the room. I felt like I was in a rickety old cruise ship not in a 5-star hotel. Although everything was very very clean, to me, it just felt old and not charming. I hope someday they renovate with a slightly more modern and less cluttered decor. The black and white seemed charming at first but after 5 nights I slowly started to lose my mind ....I don't think I'll ever get the vase of dried BLACK roses perched atop of the fireplace out of my mind!
