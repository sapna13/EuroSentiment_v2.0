{"text":"Learned my lesson - major disappointment I've used the online service on which I booked the Ramada Limited - Tukwila (where you find out the attributes of the hotel and the general location, but not the name until you pay your non-refundable $$) numerous times in three years. I've always been satisfied. This experience changed my travel reservation habits forever. Dissatisfaction doesn't even begin to describe my experience there. Stunned is more like it.There seems to be large confusion in Seattle about Ramadas. There are 4 or 5 of them. Most of them are called Inn's. Such as the Ramada Inn and Suites very near Sea-Tac. This place I'm talking about is the Ramada Limited in Tukwila. Very should be part of the name. I will never again book a hotel without knowing which one it is. And, I will never again stay at a Ramada. Just the fact that they have this facility in their system scares me.I stayed two nights, and wanted to run from there one hour after arriving but I was stuck as I already paid in full and it was late. First, the van they picked me up in was very old and didn't look business-like, and the upholstery was very stained. Next, it was well over 2 miles North of Sea-Tac, on the old Pacific Highway, in a run-down\/transitional neighborhood. Casinos and smoke rooms in the area. Two miles North of the Ramada Inn and Suites (someone in October confused them in a review). Last, on arrival, there was a group of around 6 or 7 very unsavory (scary) looking characters hanging out on the corner on 139th, just as we were arriving. Only a few feet from the door.I walked into the lobby at night, after getting out of a medical conference at the Marriott-SeaTac and the lobby was very small and Court-TV was on full blast in the lobby. The lobby had a look of decay, with old, dusty fake flowers and unhealthy plants and ugly furniture.The place only has 38 rooms, so (lucky me) I got the room right off the lobby. Could not sleep as the lobby TV was so loud. I was too afraid to ask them to turn it down as I didn't want to leave my room or draw attention to myself, being alone.Decided to have a cup of Decaf coffee, and turned the coffee cups over and both were totally filthy. Had coffee residue (easily seen and felt) from the last resident, (not washed) as did both water glasses. Absolutely filthy. Almost made me sick. I turned them in the next morning and there were clean ones in my room when I returned late last night, but still? When I pulled back the covers to go to bed, someone either did not know how to make a bed, or they didn't make it --- from the last person in there. Everything was very rumpled and unkempt-looking. I've never seen anything like it in all my years staying in hotels. Furniture was very old, spare and plastic. Plumbing didn't work well, as both the bathtub and sink did not drain. I took a shower in the morning, and when I left the room an hour later, there was still standing water --- despite my attempts to get it to go down. Not to mention the hair and ground-in dirt on the floor.This morning, when I left for the airport, I showed up downstairs and they said the driver would take me right there. In actuality, he spent 30 minutes doing other things, while I both waited and made two more requests. Paid no attention to my need to get to the airport. Ignored me, while I was standing there. And, I had to get to my flight!Even with making reservations online, there were so many problems and misses with this hotel that I'm appalled and will definitely change my reservation habits.Evidently, they call it Limited because it is. Not to be confused with the other Ramada Inn's, including the Ramada Inn and Suites near the airport. The limited is very far from the airport and not in any neighborhood a tourist would ever want to visit. People probably confuse them because they are both on International Blvd. But, the other one is near the airport and is probably much nicer. This one is out in the boonies and, for the price I paid (opposed to what I got....I could go on), is definitely a dump.
