{"text":"perfect retreat We booked this holiday with First Choice and we wanted 2 weeks of relaxation doing not alot. We had never flown with First Choice before and I have to saying they are simply supurb for a charter flight in fact better than alot of leading airlines. We arrived at the hotel in the afternoon and our room was ready, we were a bit dissapointed to see that half of the reception was closed off and very noisey work was taking place. (I suppose they have to do works at some point.) The resort itself is very nice extremely clean and well set out. Our room was in Villa 9 on the second floor and had a view of the pool and just about the sea. The room was very big and the bed huge. The bathroom was big as well and we had no problems with the water pressure infact when we were burnt one day it was a little strong. The only downside is that the comunial corridors are very noisy and it does not help when people are shouting at 3am. The pools were huge we spent most of our time by the blue pool the quiet one never had a problem getting a bed there or at the beach. The pool was a little cloudy some days. The bar man at the blue pool bar is the best always smilling even when he is dealing with some rude people. The Food was great and would recomend the italian I think the hotel needs to thing about a reservation system for the Restraunts its a pain to have to wait outside in the rain for 40 mins for a table. I would highly recommend this hotel and first choice. ","annotations":[]}
