{"text":"By far, hands down, the best of the very best My family and I are extensive travellers, going to Europe\/the US more than once a year. Our wonderful experience with the Chesterfield Mayfair is unparalleled and their exceptional, professional and courteous services began even before our arrival. This is going to be a long email, but they deserve it. When we first made our booking for a triple room, I contacted the hotel via email, asking if it would be possible to get a somewhat large room because my elderly mother was to be with us and she is a bit claustrophobic. As the triple room also did not have a minibar, I asked if it would be possible to put one at an extra charge. In less than ten minutes, I got an email stating that a larger room would be made available and a minibar included in the room FOR FREE. Once we reached the lovely and charming hotel, we were delighted to find that the hotel decided to give us a complimentary update to a junior suite for my elderly mother's sake! The junior suite was lovely, with all the amenities that one can think of. My mother requested an additional mattress because of her bad back. Again, only a few minutes passed and a charming member of the management team, Ms. Devlin, came to apologize that they do not have additional mattresses and for that, they are offering a COMPLIMENTARY single room on the same floor to my mother. We were speechless. This proved to be a sample of the wonderful, courteous and personal touches that mark everything at the Chesterfield. On a daily basis, you get complimentary biscuits, candy, tea, coffee, hot chocolate and bottles of still and sparkling water. There is free internet in your room and free access to the internet and a printer in the lower level of the hotel. The suite, as well as my mother's lovely single room had also: a hair dryer, pens, paper, pencils, earser, post it notes, ruler, sharpener and scissors. Basically, everything you can think of and need whether you are on a business trip or if you are there for lesiure.The rooms and especially the bathrooms are spotless clean and shower and bath gels, soap and lofas are replinished daily. On your way in and out, you are greeted with a smile from everybody asking if you had a good time, if there was anything they can assist you with, directions, cabs, suggestions for places to go, and they also alert you if the weather was about to change. The doormen always gave my mother a hand as she got on and off the cab. We once had dinner at the hotel restaurant and not only was the treatment superb, but a few days later (we stayed for a week), we ran into the gentleman who was serving us, and he remembered our names! Ms. Devlin also ran into my mother at the hotel's lovely library and was keen to stop and ask if she was enjoying her stay, if the liberary room temperature was comfortable, if she needed anything at all.One day, we found letters, signed by the hotel manager, alerting us that neighbors were having a party that could stay a bit late into the night, apologizing if this was a bother and assuring us that the hotel would make sure that the music would not extend beyond 10:30 PM. We thought that this was a very nice and caring gesture. But that was not enough for the Chesterfield; later in the day, we got a call again from Ms. Devlin relaying the same message and the apology. What really sets this hotel apart is the personal touch and the extra mile that each and every member of the hotel staff go through to make sure that you are comfortable and that you are special. As to the location of the hotel - unbeatable. Within minutes, and on foot you can be in Berkely Square, Piccadilly, Bond Street, Regent Street, Oxford street, Park Lane, the Palace, everywhere. There are loads of restaurants, shops, bars and cafes under five minutes from the hotel. A Boots and a Sainsbury are practically around the corner.Would I recommend the Chesterfield to anyone else? I already have to business associates and friends alike. What a lovely lovely place, wonderful people and the best choice for a memorable stay in London. Cannot wait to go back. Our enjoyment of London was to no small part thanks to the Chesterfield and their staff.
