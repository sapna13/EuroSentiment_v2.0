{"text":"Perfect base to explore New York City This hotel is conveniently located on the corner of 50th St and 3rd Ave and provides an ideal base to explore this wonderful city. We stayed here for 10 nights on our honeymoon and had a huge 1 bedroom suite on the 12th floor overlooking 3rd Ave. The room was clean and well appointed with a neutral, pleasant decor and was serviced daily. There was a kitchenette and average sized bathroom and the bedroom and lounge\/dining room were both of an excellent size. The bed was huge and comfortable with the added bonus of a pillow menu to choose your perfect pillow. The wine  cheese in the club room on level two was a nice touch as was the welcome home you recieve from the doorman upon returning but we didn't have breakfast in the hotel, instead prefering to try the range of diners and bagel places nearby. This hotel is adjacent to the main tourist hub, so you get the best of both worlds; it's quiet enough to relax after a long day of sightseeing, but close enough to a range of sights such as Rockerfeller Plaza, 5th  Madison Avenues and Times Square. If you're an avid walker (as we are) it's a most enjoyable walk to Central Park, and also downtown towards the Flatiron district. The number 6 subway stop is at the end of the block which is great for getting to Brooklyn Bridge\/City Hall stop and Grand Central Station is only a few blocks away for getting downtown.There are a number of great restaurants (relatively) close, Asia De Cuba (on Madison Ave) and Brasserie Ruhlmann (at the Rockerfeller center) were two of our favourites. Overall, I can highly recommend this hotel as a fantastic base to enjoy all that this amazing city has to offer.
