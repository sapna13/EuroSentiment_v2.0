{"text":"Love Hawaii but not necessarily the Hyatt . . . . As with most of the 5 star hotels on Waikiki, this hotel is NOT a resort. It is a nice, upscale hotel that is comfortable. There are better values to be had than the Hyatt. The room is comfortable in that it is spacious and the bedding is very nice. The pool is TINY and given the hotel has 1200 rooms has the potential to be overcrowded. A band plays in the evening by the pool til 10:00 and if you have an ocean view room, it feels like the band is on your lanai! The doors slam in the hallway which is disturbing - the echo is quite loud. The Terrace restaurant was great for lunch. Try the Hula Grill (above Duke's in the Outrigger) for breakfast - it's a great value especially if you are looking for something other than the buffet scene (the staff are wonderful as is the food). Be aware you will be charged $15 to have refrigerator in your room ($15 for the entire stay) which is a ridiculous considering you are at the Hyatt! The least they can do is offer you a small frig. You can sign out beach chairs by the pool which is a very nice feature. The staff were very hospitable and accomodating. Drinks (poolside) are fairly reasonably priced. All in all, we would stay there again if the price was right . . . but it would have to be a great price.
