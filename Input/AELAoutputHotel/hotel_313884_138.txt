{"text":"A Wonderful Holiday This is one of the smallest hotels in Punta Cana and because of that there is a wonderfully intimate feel. The absence of children means that it's a very calm, peaceful environment. The hotel, the grounds and the beach are kept immaculately clean. You very quickly get to know your way around and the staff become like old friends.There are less facilities and activities on offer than at other hotels but you can always visit the other Princess hotels if you're feeling bored. Similarly the choices at the buffet restaurant were more limited than we're used to but the quality was excellent throughout. When I mentioned to the restaurant manager that I was vegetarian I was overwhelmed by the response. The Head Chef came and spoke to me every day to ask whether I would like something special in addition to what was available in the buffet.We visited two of the a la carte restaurants and both were very good. We also heard good reports from everybody who visited the other two. There were a further six a la carte restaurants available at the Caribe Princess hotel as well as a larger buffet restaurant but we were more than happy with the food at the Punta Cana Princess. There are three bars and the choice and quality of drinks was very high.The animation staff do their best although the entertainment , particularly in the evening, is very low key. Again you can visit the Caribe Princess next door for a wider choice of activities and evening entertainment.The beach is stunning and there were always plenty of sunbeds available.I can't praise the staff highly enough. There were too many special people to name individuals but everybody that we came into contact with was friendly and helpful.The rooms were large, clean and very comfortable with all the facilities you would expect and need in a holiday hotel.Overall, a wonderful holiday in a fantastic hotel!
