{"text":"wonderful stay at the Lenox Having looked at various reviews we picked the Lenox for our 5 night stay - and weren't disappointed.We had two rooms - one for me and my 12 year old daughter and the other for my Mum and a family friend. The aim was to shop, eat, shop and shop some more and we certainly did.The Lenox was in the perfect location for us as it was easy to get around most of the local shopping areas, and if we did want a taxi there were always plenty outside Lord  Taylor next door to the hotel.One room (504)was really spacious, a view across to the huge Boston Library, two double beds, plenty of storage, a sofa and room to walk around despite all the shopping bags! Our room (523) was a huge corner room with the same contents, plus even more space, a (non functioning but ) beautiful fire place and 2 large windows on two sides.The beds were comfy, the robes provided were great - as was the wonderful aveda bathroom stuff. My daughter was treated like a princess throughout our stay, which certainly made her feel very grown up.Before arriving I'd asked for help (via e-mail) to book a surprise on arrival and Keith was brilliant. We walked out of arrivals to find someone waiting with a sign saying my daughter's name. We followed and headed off, to our waiting stretch limo!I'd also asked if they could help arrange a bear for my daughter to find on arrival, only to be told all their younger guests received one. Sure enough on check in my daughter received the softest, cutest bear - complete with hotel ribbon and welcome card.We ate in the Azure restaurant for breakfast every day and found the food great and the service very good.We wanted to visit the outlets, book a Duck Tour and a car ( no limo but big enough for 4 people and 10 bags!!) to return to the airport and once again the concierege (Cindy this time) were really helpful.During our stay we had a few small problems - one day the telephone packed up and the next the remote to the TV. Both times they fixed them really quickly, and the maintenance guy was really friendly too.My daughter kept all the delicious Lindt chocolates placed on the beds when turned down at night, to bring home for her Dad.Will definately stay there again:-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":27,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":22},{"endOffset":27,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":22},{"endOffset":80,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":75},{"endOffset":313,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":308},{"endOffset":313,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":308},{"endOffset":574,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":568},{"endOffset":2116,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":2106},{"endOffset":2116,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":2106}]}
