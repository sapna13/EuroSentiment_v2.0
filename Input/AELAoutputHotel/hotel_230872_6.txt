{"text":"Nice Hotel Booked the hotel and flights through Expedia and everything went smoothly. The hotel is clean tidy modern but lacks any soul. Its ideal for a short stay break but if your looking for a hotel set in a charming location with an active night life look elsewhere. It backs onto the train station and the S bahn runs every 3-5 minutes so isnt a major problem. We had rooms at the front of the hotel. They were well designed and the double glazing really does block out any noise from the concourse. There was no airconditioning which didnt effect us as it rained! However the rooms were warm and at busy time was a choice between noisy travellers or being hot. The beds were comfortable and shower room (no baths in the rooms). There is a mini bar but no tea\/coffee making facilities which I could really have done with at times.There is a small number of shops attached to the train station so you can grab a snack. There are no bars or resturants nearby to pop out to in the evening and if you go out you will have to jump on a train for a few stops. The hotel does sport a resturant in which the food is reasonably priced and I have to say delicious! There was only 4 other people in it on a Saturday night which was a shame as the food really was good.Id like to pick the hotel up and put it more in the Mitte section where there are a few more bars for socialising. Its a great hotel, reasonable prices, good travel base but only to be recommended if you prefer cocoa to alcohol! Taking everything into account this hotel is to be recommended ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1478,"mention":"cocoa","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_liquor","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hot_chocolate","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1473}]}
