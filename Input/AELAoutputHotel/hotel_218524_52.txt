{"text":"LOVED EVERY MOMENT I cannot not tell you what a great time we had on our Honeymoon and Excellence and their staff is to thank for that. Let me start from the very beginning:Ride form Airport to Hotel: A bumoy ride but a great change to see what the Dominican Republic looks like. Also we rode with VIP and they stopped at a local store so we could get beer for the ride so I was a happy camper.Arrival: To say the place takes your breath away is an understatement....it was absolute perfection. We received smiles and a welcome home and this treatment never stopped.Room: We were suppose to have an Excellence Club Honeymoon Suite but they had given our room away and I was pretty pissed about that but they put us in an Excellence Club Suite and it was very nice. Looking back now we will always get a normal room because we were not in the room very long. Needless to say my anger didn't last very long once I saw our view and got my bathing suit on!Food: Absolutly amazing my favorite was the Italian Restaurant and the Mexican for sure. I did contract a bacterial stomach infection but I wasnt very careful while I was there. My recommendation would be stay away from milk all together there pasterization processes arent like those in the states. Also watch drinking the slushy drinks from the machines because they are not required to keep those as clean like the states. Even with my tummy issues I forced myself to eat because the food was to good to pass up!Pools: I cant even describe how great they are!!! We miss our pool buddies!!Leaving Excellence: What a depressing day when you have to leave your new home We did take the helicopter ride back from the resort to the airport and it was worth every penny because the pictures and the views are priceles!!!Best honeymoon spot in the world it is all adult couples and I cant wait to go back!!
