{"text":"Breathtaking from Seattle Washington We just returned from a wonderful vacation at Dreams in Punta Cana. What can I say but that it was outstanding, fun, and quite an adventure. I researched for months before I decided on this location and this resort and as the former guest commented, my family owes me big time!  We had an absolute blast and have never been treated so wonderfully by hotel staff and we have taken several vacations. Now, I will say the ride from the airport to the hotel was exciting and I just tried not to look forward at what might be coming at us as we passed! The ride was not as long as many have stated. I felt it took no longer than 30 minutes to get to our hotel. A big hello and thank you to the following wonderful employees: 50 Cent, Mickey Mouse, Stephanie, Enderson, and Francisco! Stephanie, if you are reading this review it's papas wife.  We took one outside adventure to Saona Island via a catamaran and what a day! It was an excellent way to experience the culture of the Dominicans and see how it really is outside the resort. This jaunt on a van and then a bus made the trip from the airport seem like kids play lol.  There is also a flea market about 7 blocks to the right of dreams, go there for your souvenirs, they love to barter. If you can go to this country and stay at this gorgeous resort do so! Hi to all the wonderful friends we met even those Republicans! lol ","annotations":[]}
