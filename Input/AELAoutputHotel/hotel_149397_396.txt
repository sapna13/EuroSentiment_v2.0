{"text":"Not even close to 5* rating !!! I booked my trip to Dominican Republic through applevacations.com. For starters, I got my papers 3 days late, even though they sent it through FedEx.The flight from SFO to Atlanta was ok, then i connected there to Punta Cana. That was also ok. Let me start with the rating applevacations.com gave this hotel. It's not accurate at all. At the most, i'd give it 3.5 stars. The property is old, the mattreses in my suite were covered in G-d knows what. The mini fridge had a broken freezer. Barely wam water in the shower. And those monstrous cockroaches !!! i have never seen that big of a cockroach. It flew too. Now the stuff speaks minimum English, when u tell them to fix a broken hairdryer, their 5 minutes, sir turned into 2-3 days. One of the floor manager by the name Armando is a liar !!! When we booked on of those dinners at the 5 of the restaurants on site, the stuff at Chopin spoke no English at all. They showed us a wine list and we thought it was all included. At the end of our dinner they brought us a piece of paper, saying that we owe 53$+26% tax for the bottle of wine. I had a huge argument at the check-out day with that Armando guy. When i called applevacations.com to resolve that issue for me, he lied to them, saying that stuff speaks perfect English. So on that sour note, i say this place is a big No-No !!!
