{"text":"Horrible!!! Do Not Even Consider It!!! This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. It is supposed to be four star, and was our way of spoiling ourselves at the end of an eight week trip. Well, we definately felt like something was spoilt! This hotel doesn't even rate 2 stars, I have no idea how they got their four star rating. The foyer is barely big enough to put your bags down in, the lift didn't fit both of us with 2 bags in it, the lift doesn't have doors and stops about 20cm below the floor, the hallway doors look like something off of Degrassi Junior High, the bathroom was mouldy, the toilet had poo stains in it, the carpet was rotting, the room stank, the restaurant was no more than a couple of tables for stale bread breakfast, the cupboard (not wardrobe) didn't have a hanging rack, the beds were small, the chair was broken and there was only one chair, the tv didn't work, there was no minibar, there was no room service, and I don't think the room had seen a duster or vacuum cleaner since the end of the war. Oh yeah, and the balcony with a view was 30cm by 80cm - not even big enough to fit the broken chair on. The two nice factors were the view was pleasant (but you could get it anywhere else in amsterdam) and the staff were friendly, oh and it was only about 150m from Anne Franks House. Please Please Please do not waste your money staying at this hovel, there must be other places to stay.
