{"text":"perfect vacation My husband and I stayed at this resort in early May, along with 11 other friends in our group,some of them had been at the Macao before and loved it, my husband and I had never been to the DR, but had heard great things about this resort, so it had a lot to live up to. We were not disappointed!!!We loved the fact that it was a small resort, with lots of staff to take care of you, that was exactly what we were looking for, and were never unhappy with any of the service we received. Our room was extremely clean, and comfortable, and cleaned daily. The bed was never a problem, and we didn't have any issues with a mildew smell. Our room was always cool and the balcony was one of my favourite features, I brought a book light with me and read every night out there before I went to bed, it was perfect.Our fridge was always stocked daily with everything we needed, especially lots of water. The turndown service at night was also a nice touch. The great thing about staying at this resort is that you can visit the surrounding Riu resorts, we went to a couple of the other pools and played volleyball with some people we met from the US, and had some drinks at the swimup bar at another resort. We still preferred our pool because it was spotless and never crowded. We loved the watersports at the pool as well, we never anticipated playing any of the games, but when we got there we played games every day. We never felt out of place, everyone was so friendly, staff and guests both. We were surprised to hear other comments about the food not being that great. This was a concern to us before we went because we like to eat at nicer restaurants at home and we do not like greasy food. We couldn't have been more satisfied with the quality of the food, wine, and pepsi (we love pepsi). We chose to eat at the buffet most nights. The food was excellent, we loved how they prepared their vegetables. You never felt as though you were at a buffet, absolutely perfect. We really enjoyed the wine as well. Sure wish we had some right now.As for the service, we couldn't have been more pampered! We were served drinks at the beach every half hour or so, and we only ever tipped $1 or $2 depending on the amount of drinks we ordered. We never had to wait forever for drinks like we read in other reviews.For our final thoughts, we would like to say that if you want to be treated like family members of the staff, and feel comfortable on your resort, this is a great place to go. We are Canadians and we treated the staff very respectfully, and they loved us, they even referred to us as Punta Canadians. We will go back there again, and hope to take some of our other friends along with us, we know that we will love it just as much the next time.
