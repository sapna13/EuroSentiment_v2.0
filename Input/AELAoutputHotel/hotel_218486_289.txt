{"text":"Ok Experience The hotel itself was nice. The rooms were fairly clean. We had a view of the ocean from our Block 5. The mini fridge was always stocked with water\/soda. There was no iron in the room. The food was good with a large variety. The Japanese restaurant was the best. The beaches were cleaned every morning. The staff was very friendly. The entertainment was aweful. We had gone to Allegro Resort in March, and the entertainment differed extremely. The Happy Club in this resort wasn't all that happy, more like annoying. The resort had a MC for the shows, and then there was an assistant MC during the days at the beach. If he talked and made noises like a baby one more time I didn't know what I was going to do. The night shows were very dry and lame, I enjoyed only one show the entire week. The loudness of the speakers in the theater was too high. You would come out deaf. If you want excellent entertainment I would recommend the Allegro Resort, not Ocean Bavaro. We had book our trip through applevacations and it all went well until the last day of our trip. To our suprise just before departure from Punta Cana we had found out we were first traveling to San Juan, then a stop in Miami and then finally to Boston. We had no knowledge of this 2 stop flight until the morning we left. Out iteniary from Apple did not mention this at all. Before leaving for our trip I noticed that it was taking longer to get home then to travel there so I called apple and asked why the difference, The rep told me that they take a different route, and sometimes it with the wind and against the wind, so I believed him, I had no reason not to. Come to find out we booked our flight with 2 stops from the beginning and apple never made us aware of this ever. Of course the direct flight from san juan to boston was overbooked so we were unable to get on. So it took us 18 hours of travel to finally make it home, when it should of taken about 5 1\/2, thanks to apple.
