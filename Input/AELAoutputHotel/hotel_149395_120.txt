{"text":"Excellent time at the Paradisus We stayed at the Paradisus Punta Cana from 3\/9-3\/14. Stayed in a garden view Royal Service Suite. Arrival was quick and easy. We paid the $30 cab ride, and arrived at the Paradisus around 12. Our room wasn't ready, so we checked in at Royal Service and made dinner reservations for a few nights. We saw a sheet listing the resort as being 51-59% of capacity for the duration of our stay, so while we made the reservations figured we could change or do whatever we wanted if we had different things in mind. Room was ready by around 1. It was nice. Not great, but nice size and clean. Needed an update, but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean. Interestingly, I think we found exactly one mosquito flying around the room for the duration of the stay. Additionally, we never had ANY problem with bugs the whole week. Not even at the outdoor dinners, the walks back from the casino or reserve at night. etc\/ And none of the people we spoke with had issues, either. I don't doubt at all that there have been the problems expressed on this site, but I want to stress that those problems are certainly the exception and not the norm. Excuse me if I jump around, but figured I'd just freelance our experience a bit. The beach was amazing. Never spent any time at the pool. The beds were super comfortable, the waiter service was pretty good (though always easier to walk up yourself to the bar). Spent a lot of time just walking up and down the beach aimlessly and reading our books under the hot sun that was always tempered by a nice breeze. Service overall was ok. Sometimes fantastic, sometimes mediocre. The better restaurants had better service, as well as a larger assortment of bilingual staff. Our Spanish is ok- we communicated fine with those who did not speak English, but it was of course easier when the waiter had at least the same working ability of english as we did of theirs. Food overall was good. Vento was excellent, we liked Gabi, Japanese good as well. The Italian was ok, but we were there for spaghetti and pizza and it hit the spot. Buffets just ok- food is fine, but we got tired of the same stuff. Not big drinkers, but the included wine was good enough for solid table wine at dinner and the mixed drinks were all good as well. Butler service in Royal was a joke. The girls at the desk in the lounge were way more helpful than our butler, who spent the whole week trying to get us to go on the vacation club tour. Never got us anything. His name was Lenin, and we didn't care much for him. Madeline and the other two women in the lounge were MUCH moe helpful. I like the breakfast buffet (fruit was a tad better and more attentive service for coffee, etc.) in the royal lounge, like the internet and papers. Was it worth the upgrade? I'd have to see the other rooms, but we got a good deal on the royal room so I didn't mind paying a few extra $. We saw a reserve room, and there is no comparison in quality. However...for those who like the beach the reserve is either a 10-15 minute walk or a shuttle ride away. Maid service was great every day but our last full day- when they forgot to clean at all. No big issue- we simply tracked her down and exchanged towels. Overall......the Dominican Republic is beautiful. The Paradisus is gorgeous as well, and the food is good to very good for all inclusive. Service lacks a little in relation to the other qualities, but considering the cost is lower than comparable places on other islands we were quite happy with the experience. Very much scared a week before going after reading some reviews on this site.....however we realized that the vast majority who have a fantastic time come home and don't bother with reviewing. A much larger percentage of those whose experiences are not so great will come here to share those opinions. One last note. I've been to many islands in the Carribean, and I find the Dominican people to be amongst the friendliest. Almost to a person they are happy and aim to please. I think the only reason service lacks is that they tend to be a bit green in high-end service, and expect that to improve vastly in the near future.
