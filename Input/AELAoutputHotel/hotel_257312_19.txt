{"text":"Fantastic location, rooms and hosts We stayed at Simpsons for 3 nights at the beginning of our Honeymoon to Australia, and again for 1 night before returning home. We were warmly welcomed by Keith when we arrived early at 6:30 am and were able to get into our fantastic room (Cloud Suite) to freshen up. Keith gave us some great information and maps to help us around on our first day in Sydney - a fantastic host with lots of local knowledge. All of the Simpsons team were friendly and welcoming.The location of Simpsons is fantastic. Walk to the end of the road and you have a great view of the Sydney skyline, Opera House and Bridge which really took our breath away. There is a small, public gardens at the end of Challis Avenue where you can relax with the views and locals walking their dogs just 2 minutes from the Hotel. Central Sydney is a wonderful walk away (30 minutes or so) through Woolloomooloo, past the Finger Wharf and Royal Botanic Gardens to get to Circular Quays where you can reach anything with public transport links.The rooms are clean and very comfortable, breakfast is delicious - particularly the Rhubarb Compote and the Muffins are great too. For a splash of luxury in Sydney, Simpsons offers reasonable value in a fantastic location as an alternative to a lot of chain \/ boutique hotels.Potts Point itself is a great area with many caf√ã√\u2022√ñs and restaurants right on the doorstep. A particular favourite for us was Dolcetta (walk down from Simpsons, turn left into Victoria Street and it's on the right after about 8 minutes walk). This is a wonderful streetside providore serving excellent food (BYO wine) and fantastic coffee with flawless service. We really felt like we were experiencing a local treat here.For another amazing Sydney experience, we ate at Ripples Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ by the Olympic Pool beside the Harbour Bridge on our last night. Another BYO, I cannot recommend this restaurant enough for food, service and location. Fantastic.
