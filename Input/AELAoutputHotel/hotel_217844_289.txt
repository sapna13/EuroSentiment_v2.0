{"text":"A wonderful experience We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in early May, for a weekend break between business trips.The experience from start to finish was excellent. While being priced similarly to other boutique hotels, the Orchard featured so many little touches that just made your stay so much more pleasant. For example:- Large room, with king-size bed, and more pillows than anyone could ever use- Free (wired) internet access (wireless only on first 2 floors, due to range of the signal)- Large TV, with combined DVD\/CD\/Surround-sound system - with even (surprisingly) a bass speaker, that made watching any of the extensive range of complementary, up-to-date DVDs from the hotel reception a real cinematic experience- A 'calm' book and music CD on the table for those who have trouble sleeping- Amazing 'natural flow' taps in the bathroom, that, cheesy as it may sound, reminded me of a mountain stream!- Walk-in shower- A (quite stylish) laptop for guest use just by reception, with printer, on which I printed my Alcatraz tour tickets, and boarding passes for my onward flightThe staff were also very well turned out, professional, and always friendly. The overall experience was such as to make it impossible to leave the hotel feeling anything but positive.The location is also great - two blocks uphill from Union Square, and 20 paces from a Cable Car stop, which goes to Market Street in one direction (major 'real' shopping street \/ thoroughfare), and Fisherman's Wharf in the other (extremely touristy area).The only two hiccups: the breakfast in the downstairs restaurant, while complementary, is pretty limited in size, range and quality; I'd simply ignore it unless you really don't want to go out.The other was the Valet parking charges; the rate was advertised at $34 per 24hrs, which seemed just about reasonable - however, the valet's services are added on-top, as is tax - leading to just under $100 for two nights' parking, and taking the car out once in-between! This was as much as a week's car rental - and there is no other option. Parking in SF *is* expensive, but the price is $10 higher than at the local car parks, so the additional valet charges (I tipped as well) were unexpected.Overall, however, it's a wonderful hotel. Stay there. ","annotations":[]}
