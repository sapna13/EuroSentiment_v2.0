{"text":"A great place to stay to experience real Venice The Hotel is a lovely find. We booked here because of the No.1 rating on Trip Advisor for hotels in Venice and the pictures. Being a same-sex couple we are naturally apprehensive about how welcoming small family run places will be, however the owners were really friendly, chatty and conversational and made a real effort to make us, and all the other guests feel totally at home. The lady serving breakfast is delightful - so attentive and again, very friendly, not to mention the quality  choice, second to none. We stayed in room number 2 on the ground floor, behind reception. The room is small, but so is everything in Venice. The quality of the fittings and attention to detail is amazing and so clean you could swear it was all brand new. The only problem was that the bed was too firm for us and we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ sleep well because of this, not really the hotels fault as everyone has different preferences. The night watch man was very friendly, even when we were last in gone midnight, we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel we had to be in early or anything. Venice itself was fantastic, carnival is a good time to go as there are lots of street performers and people wearing traditional costume \/ masks - it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ like stepping back in time. The water buses are frequent and run 24 hours and very cheap if you buy a 1, 2 or 3 day pass which covers the land bus to Marco Polo Airport too. If we were coming back, we would stay here again for sure, but would pay more for a larger room perhaps. ","annotations":[]}
