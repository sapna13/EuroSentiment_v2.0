{"text":"excellent customer focust hotel Arrived at the b\/p punta cana on 14\/12\/06, travelling with my partner and our two teenage boys, unsure weither we had connecting rooms or not, because the hotel could'nt confirm this until we arrived(still wonder why not) but fortunatly we had one. our sons room did smell very musty but didn't want to be moved incase we were not connected, the hotel is absolutly immaculate, gadens and interiors,although i did spot cockroaches one night, were the chef was making pasta dishes, also a rat was chased from the restaurant on christmas eve by julio the catering manager, we were not happy with the waiter in the gourmet restaurant who was very very rude, i think his name was hanibel or somthing similar, we actually left the restaurant before eating, julio could not apologise enough and made reservations at the garden grill, which in our opinion was the best one ,for service and food, japanese excellent, italian ok mexican not the best,i was worried about the weather because the fore cast did say showers and cloudy every day, don't worry the weather was very hot with the odd shower, my only complaints would be one, the lobby bar closes down at 11pm on the dot which is too early as it is a lovely relaxing place to sit and have a chat a take in the atmosphere, you have to finish you drink quickly or it is poured into a plastic glass(not very 5 star) then the only other area is the market square which is not to every bodies taste, many holiday makers agreed with us on this point. two, there isn't really any wherw near the pool areas to have a coffee, and no icecreams for the children, but i would still reccomend this hotel the customer srevice was excellent ","annotations":[{"endOffset":503,"mention":"pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":498},{"endOffset":503,"mention":"pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":498},{"endOffset":1594,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1588},{"endOffset":1594,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1588}]}
