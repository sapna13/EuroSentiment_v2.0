{"text":"Very Happy With This Hotel Stayed here for the first 2 nights of an 8 day stay in Sydney. Chose this hotel for its proximity to Central Station, Oxford Street, and walking distance to Paddington (restaurants, shopping). I checked out many hotels in this area by rates and reviews before deciding on this hotel. I got a very reasonable rate for the hotel by going directly to the Choice Hotels website, and prior reviews sounded like this would be a good choice. I was very happy with what I found!!It was about a 20 minute walk to the hotel from the Central Train Station (albeit uphill the way I went and pulling my suitcase). There was an area to leave my luggage as I arrived before check-in (2:00 pm) and wanted to wander the area. ($10.00 key deposit to lock up luggage, refunded when you pick up luggage and return key.) My room was good size with 2 double beds, couch, table and chairs, dresser, fridge, etc. Bathroom was large enough and everything was very clean. Beds were very comfortable!! My room was on the pool floor, but I didn't hear any noise associated with pool use. There wasn't much of a view from my room, but honestly, having a view was not a factor for me. Hotel desk staff were friendly and helpful, assisted with directions and suggested restaurants. Oxford Street was just a few minutes walk which meant plenty of shopping and restaurants, and walking along Oxford Street for a half hour or so gets you to Paddington (more shopping, food and open air market on the weekend). Little Italy was very close by too and we found some good restaurants there. There is a bar and a restaurant at the hotel, but I didn't use either except the latter for coffee to go. (I just preferred to partake in what the area had to offer.) There were 2 computers available in the lobby; $5.00 for 1\/2 an hour of internet. Taxis were easy to hail from out front. I wasn't in my room much except to sleep, but I did want a hotel that I would feel safe and comfortable in, was clean, and convenient to what I wanted to do and where I wanted to go. I feel I definitely received all this, found a great value for the price, and was very pleased with this hotel.
