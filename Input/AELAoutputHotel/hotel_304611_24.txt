{"text":"Very nice place to stay and close to Orchard Road. This is our first stop for our Singapore\/Indonesia trip. After a LONG 18 hour flight from Los Angeles (transit at Taipei), we arrived at Singapore. We only stayed there for one night before heading to our Indonesia diving\/snorkeling trip. We were both tired and just wanted to check-in the hotel and rest. We told the receptionist that we want a quiet room and were given an upgrade to their deluxe room with see-through window connecting the bathroom and bedroom. The room is nice with all the 4 star hotel amenities (plasma TV, 320-thread-count Egyptian cotton comforter), but the real standout is the free mini-bar and nice bathtub with separate shower. My girlfriend enjoyed her bubble bath especially after a long flight. The bath tub is decent size, and you can watch TV from the tub (through see-through glass), but can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hear it too well or change the channel because the TV is not in the bathroom. If you want some privacy in the bathroom, no problem, there is a blind you can pull down in the bathroom to cover the glass. The separate shower is decent size too, you have plenty of room in the shower (compared to Hilton, which is a separate report), and the best is the huge overhead shower head. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the size of basketball which has really good water pressure too (very relaxing after a long flight). The free mini bar consists of roughly 10 bottles of drinks (2 tiger bears, 2 water, 2 juices, coke, diet coke, Milo), sorry memory is fading, should√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe taken a picture of it. It is a very nice touch and most hotels would probably charge you $30 for all those drinks. Oh, forgot to mention, you can use their computer at business center for free the first 15 minutes. The only thing I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like about Royal Plaza is they charge you $5.20 Singapore dollars for advance booking a taxi for you. Our flight next morning was at 9:25am, so we need a taxi 7am in the morning and was afraid that we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get a taxi that early in the morning if we don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ book in advance. But I think you can just call the concierge early in the morning and have them call a taxi for you, and that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ free of charge. For the price we paid for on expedia.com: $150 including tax, we would definitely stay there again.
