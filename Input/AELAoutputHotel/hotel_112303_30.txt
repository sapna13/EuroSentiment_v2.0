{"text":"Noisy but nice The Hotel Diva was nice, and had we been able to get a good night's sleep, I would have given it five stars. But when I figure that the main reason I'm staying at a hotel is to catch an uninterrupted 8 hours' sleep, I'll have to only give this otherwise friendly hotel only three stars.It has great location right across the street from SF's Broadway theaters and is only a block from Union Square. The rooms were not fancy, but decorated nicely with a bit of modern flair, sort of like Ikea with a hotel twist. We got a room on the inside where it was fairly quiet, but the heater was really noisy... an old Amana (do they even make them anymore?) wall heater and a\/c that was left over from before the renovation. We had to turn it off in order to sleep.There were some late-night revelers who came home when the bars closed, and the door slams were pretty loud; police sirens woke us up once, as did some hallway chitchat. The noise problems were about the only really negative things about the place, yet we didn't sleep well as a result, and that pretty much ruined us for the following day. On the plus side, the hotel staff is super friendly and helpful, the elevators worked nicely, and an obvious effort had been made to make the interiors pleasant and modern. The rooms were clean, the beds were comfy, the bathrooms tidy, and the fixtures new. They have a small gym, free Wi-Fi, and a bunch of offices for guests to use. Valet parking is $35, which is about the same as 24-hour parking in the area, but if you park it yourself at a garage around the corner on Taylor, it's $28 for overnight ($18 on Wednesdays and Sundays, for some reason).This obviously is an old hotel that was recently renovated. It has a lot of good things going for it in terms of location, style, service, and price, but I don't think I'd stay there again unless the place had better soundproofing and upgraded heaters and air conditioners.
