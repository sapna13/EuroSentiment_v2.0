{"text":"Nice albeit overheated room Spent four nights at the Silken Concordia with my fiancee in early Feb 07 at √à√\u2020√ü?0 including tax for a double room. Our first impression was very good as it√à?√¨s a step up in polish from small family-run hostals around Spain, but our opinion suffered a bit by the time we left. We got a very clean and spacious room with two twin beds (this seems pretty standard around Spain). Bathroom was roomy and very nice with a good shower. There is a mini-bar\/fridge and desk.We loved the location. Just far enough away from La Rambla, etc. that you pay reasonable prices for meals and eat amongst locals, just close enough to walk where you want to go. Poble Sec metro (Line 3) is directly across the street which links you in three stops one way to Sants train station (also airport train connection) and 2-4 stops the other way to the center of the old city. The Barcelona metro is cheap and easy to use. We found a rough and ready 1√à√\u2020√ü?min internet cafe 5 mins walk away, and two great restaurants across the street. Facing the Agip station, there is a creperie and an Italianish place on the block to the left. Both had very friendly staff and great, cheap food.On the downside, the staff is pretty indifferent and only recommended restaurants from the Lonely Planet guide. Not much use for local color. The room was REALLY hot, consistently 27-29C. Like other reviewers, I discovered that turning on the A\/C only made it hotter, and asking the front desk only made me more frustrated. The window opened a few inches and that had to be good enough. On the Friday night of our stay, the fire alarm went off around 1am due to too many smokers in one of the 1st floor meeting rooms. The fire department didn√à?√¨t come, and the staff weren√à?√¨t overly concerned about doing anything or explaining what to do. That is, no one was in charge. If you felt like evacuating, fine. If you felt like taking your chances in your room, go for it.In summary, it√à?√¨s comfy and clean but a bit generic with apathetic staff. If I√à?√¨m back in Barcelona, I√à?√¨d look for a different hotel and consider this a backup.
