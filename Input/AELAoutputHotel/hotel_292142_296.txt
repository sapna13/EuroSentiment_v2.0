{"text":"Ideal for Travelling with young children Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Hotel. It was ideal as we were travelling with a 6 month old and a 2 year old. The hotel room was big enough and as we had booked a suite we could sleep the children in the bedroom while we relaxed in the sitting room area. The kitchen area allowed us to prepare meals for the kids at any time. We were 5 minutes from the Empire State building and close enough to 5th Avenue to walk with the pram - saved us jumping into cabs with a pram etc. The room was clean\/quiet and well maintained. Two negatives - Firstly - when we had booked I had requested several things in the room, high chair\/cots\/allergy free bedding etc. None of these had been prepared so we had to wait for several people to come and deliver cots etc. As we arrived late and were lagged this was an inconvenience. Secondly - when we requested the concierge to organise a cab back to JFK - he offered to get us a private car for $100. As we had paid a flat rate of $45 to get us there I thought this was a real rip off. All we needed was was of the larger yellow cabs which he could have called for us. In the end my husband went out onto the street and flagged down a larger cab. The concierge did not even offer to help my husband with the bags\/prams, he did not even open the door for me with the pram!!! Overall we had a really good stay, its disappointing that one individual stopped it from being an excellent stay........ ","annotations":[]}
