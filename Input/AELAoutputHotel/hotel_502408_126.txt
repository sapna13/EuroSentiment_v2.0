{"text":"Deserves its place in the Top 10!! My husband and I stayed here for 7 nights in February and absolutely loved it! We booked the Affinia 50 mainly based on the reviews on here and we were not disappointed. From the minute we stepped out of the taxi we were made to feel extremely welcome. Every member of staff we encountered was friendly, polite and helpful. They had even put a complimentary bottle of red wine in our room for when we arrived.Our room was a standard guest room on the 4th floor (#402). It was a large room with plenty of storage space. It came equipped with TV, hairdryer, iron and ironing board, tea and coffee making facilities and an in room safe. The bed was big and comfortable and the pillow menu is a nice touch.The bathroom was small in comparison but had enough space for toiletries and the shower was good. The aveda toiletries were topped up on a daily basis even if we hadn't run out!! The whole room was very clean and none of the decorations were looking in need of 'tidying up'The only small moan we had was with the heating. It was really hard to regulate the temperature.The location of the Affinia is everything. Its only a few blocks walk to 5th Ave, The Rockefeller Ctr, Grand Central Station and Central park. The subway is a block away and is very useful for getting downtown for Statue of Liberty ferries, Brooklyn Bridge, Soho and Greenwich.There are also lots of bars and restaurants in the area. The New York Luncheonette a few doors down is a good place for breakfast.We only used the club room on the 2nd floor once for coffee but it is a nice area to relax. If you want to check in online and print your boarding pass before leaving you can use the free service on the computers in the business centre. This is an extremely useful service and much better than having to pay the pricey internet rates.I would highly recommend the Affinia 50 to anyone travelling to NYC. Its my 4th visit to the city and its the best hotel I've stayed in by far. I'll definitely be staying here on my next visit.
