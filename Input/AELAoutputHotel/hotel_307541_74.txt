{"text":"Fantastic hotel! I have just returned from 9 nights at the Hyatt and wish I was still there!This is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in, in terms of how much I enjoyed my stay - I travel regularly for work and often stay in well-rated and expensive hotels, albeit usually in cities rather than resorts.It would be impossible to run an operation like this in the West. The time and care thast goes into everything is incredible - people are continually clearing up, sweeping sand off the path, clearing up leaves from the gardens, etc. Take a wander up the beach beyond the hotel and it will dawn on you that the beach isn't like that the whole way up; rather, it is immaculately maintained by the hotel staff. Hence, if you stay elsewhere in Sanur you will probably have a much less nice bit of beach in front of your hotel or villa.We stayed in an Ocean View room in Bougainvillea Court, the nearest of the 3 blocks to the sea. It was nice to have the view but all rooms have balconies or terraces and the gardens are so beautiful that the Garden View rooms are no doubt very pleasant too. The hotel was built in the early seventies, since which time hotel design has probably moved on a bit, but the rooms are large and pleasant with a bit of character from the Balinese furniture. I also liked the bathroom - not brand new in gleaming marble but quite attractive.The bed was massive and very comfortable, with quality bed linen that is changed very frequently. The minibar prices were pretty reasonable and for a change we made quite a bit of use of it.The hotel restaurants are good - in particular the fish from the Omang Grill. The Chinese restaurant is also excellent, an open-sided pavillion in a lily pond that serves more interesting food than the usual sweet and sour, beef in black bean sauce etc. Both are expensive compared to restaurants in the village but it is only relative; the proces are styill pretty cheap by European and in particular UK prices, especially for the setting and quality.Breakfast is served in the Wantilan Cafe - this is modelled on the temple meeting halls of the same name and is a large, open-sided timber building with a grass roof. It was wonderful to have your breakfast in the sun, alongside the ponds, overlooking the beautiful gardens. There is a full range of food available, from fresh fruits, good breads, pastries and yoghurts to Asian choices (looked nice enough but not for breakfast, thanks) to a Fatty Counter for the Anglo\/Saxon contingent (US, UK, German), serving eggs, bacon, waffles etc.We made use of the spa one afternoon, not cheap in local terms but pretty good value compared to the UK and again you would not find something with a comparable setting - beautiful private villas for the treatments with gardern showers, pools etc.The best thing about the hotel, though, is probably the gardens, which really are amazing. They surround the hotel and make the areas around the pools very attractive, as well as providing a bit of shade. They also soften or hide the hotel buildings quite effectively; time has not been too kind to the 1970s concrete and whilst the inside of the hotel is all very nice the concrete has deteriorated quite a bit on the outside. This would look desperate if the hotel were in somewhere like Greece or Spain, where it is drier and the vegtation usually a bit more sparse, but here you don't really notice as the buildings melt into the trees.A word should also be said about the staff, who are a real credit to the hotel. They are unfailingly helpful and friendly.For recommendations outside the hotel:Turning right out of the gate and walking up Jalan Danau Tamblingan, try LUMUT on the left for dinner. This is a beatiful restaurant on top of a shop and gallery. Very stlyish Balinese decor and great presentation. Slightly more expensive than aomwe of the lowest common denominator tourist places but a cut above (and still very reasonable).CAFE BATUJIMBAR is a very stylish cafe on the right, great for coffee (try the Balinese rather than the Lavazza) and lunch, and has a good deli attached.
