{"text":"Park Plaza: on the whole I was satisfied I happened to be visiting Boston, unwittingly over Harvard and MIT graduation weekend. I tried to get a hotel for weeks but there was not a room in the city until I tried Priceline for the umpteenth time and got a room at the Park Plaza for $200. As it happened, it couldn't have been a better choice. The hotel is located right in the middle of the heart of Back Bay, close to all the shops and restaurants. The lobby is stunning, in an old European kind of way, and was full of gorgeous flowers. The bell captain, concierge and front desk could not have been more helpful, I was impressed at their professionalism in the midst of all the chaos of a full hotel. The elevators, lobby and corridors are lovely. My room was very nice, too. My bed was wonderful, with loads of fluffy pillows and a duvet and really crisp sheets. The view was nice from the 14th floor. It seemed as though the room had recently been upgraded because the decor was beautiful. The bathroom was marble with stainless fixtures, plenty of hot water, a little cramped but the fluffy towels and the depth of the bath made up for that. Everything was super spotless. I was extremely happy. My only problem was that there is no wifi. The ethernet cable stretched about 18 and the plug would not stay in my computer. I didn't ask for another one because I was in and out doing stuff and could manage but that could be a problem for a business traveler. One very nice thing happened, I had put a doorhanger on my door to say I did want USA Today. But there was no USA Today. I asked the staff for one, and a nice gentleman arrived within two minutes with a copy for me. I thought that was impressive because these days you don't usually get service like that.I was very happy with the hotel. No complaints from me.
