{"text":"This hotel was fantastic! A clean, comfortable and spacious place to stay that was reasonably priced. If you are looking for a place to stay that is right in front of the beach this is the place to be. Luckily, this hotel had nice guests during my visit (except a guy named Nelson) and our room had a kitchen, bathroom, and a plasma TV in the living room and bedroom. There was also a washer and dryer in the hotel which was fantastic b\/c I could wash my dirty clothes when I came home√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√Önd sometimes I wanted to wear something twice so I was able to wash it there. It felt like I had never left home! It was wonderful. Every afternoon the maid came in and organized our room after we left. Thus, the entire time we were able to relax without being disturbed by the maid, b\/c we had put the sign on our door (good thing to remember to do when coming in the wee hours of the morning- We had left the door sign out not to disturb us while we were there, in the mornings, and put the sign out to tidy our room when we went out in the afternoon, so the room was ready when we came back.). Therefore, the maid and the manager were very helpful.So, basically my advice is: if you are not a caveman\/woman and can appreciate the finer things in life and want a nice, relaxing place to go, the definitely stay here. Venice on the Beach Hotel rocks!
