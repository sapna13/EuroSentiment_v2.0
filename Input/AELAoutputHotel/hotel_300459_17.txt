{"text":"Solid hotel for business travelers I often travel to Tokyo for work and usually stay at either the Hotel Okura or the ANA InterContinental Hotel.The best thing about the ANA is the location. It's steps from the Tameike Sanno station on the Ginza and Nanboku lines. Plus, it's only a 10-20 minute walk to Roppongi and Akasaka.The rooms are average for hotels in this price range. Everything is in good order, but there is not much to wow you. The size is okay for central Tokyo. The furnishings are nice, though a little old (particularly the carpeting). The beds are comfortable but nothing like the fancy mattresses in most upscale hotels in the US these days.The bathroom feel especially outdated. The bathtub and the tiles are right out of the 1970s or 1980s. The shower curtains are quite utilitarian. The towels provided are merely average. I think you should get more from this level of hotel.The gym on the 6th floor is not bad. The equipment is relatively new and well maintained. If you are staying on a corporate or government plan, you can use the gym for free.Internet access in the rooms is provided by Ethernet jacks (not WiFi). Cat-5 LAN cables are in the desk drawer to connect your computer. As with the gym, if you are staying on a corporate or government plan, Internet access is free.Noise can be an issue if you are staying on the side facing the the elevated expressway. Cars and motorcycles zoom by at all hours of the night. I recommend asking for a room on the Tokyo Tower side of the hotel if you wish for peace and quiet.The level of service from the staff is good. They are both polite and helpful. No complaints on this front.Overall, the ANA InterContinental is a solid choice for business travelers. You won't be lacking anything. ","annotations":[]}
