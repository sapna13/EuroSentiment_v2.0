{"text":"Great Hotel, Unbeatable Location! My husband and I booked a week-long stay here in early September 2007,along with my parents, who also booked a room. I typically travel to SF a couple times a year for business and stay in some of the pricier hotels (St. Francis, The Fairmount). However, on my own dime, I wantedto find a decent value without sacrificing the great location that Union Square has to offer. We stayed on the 2nd floor, in one of the two front rooms facing the street. We had a king size bed, desk with a chair, dresser, and a very roomy closet to store our suitcases. Granted, these rooms are small, but that is very typical of San Francisco, even in the more expensive hotels sometimes. If you are planning to run around the city every day and do the tourist thing, room size should definitely not be an issue. We were out all day and just came back to sleep (beds were VERY comfortable). The room did nothave air conditioning (also typical in most hotels in the city) but you really did not need it. Just for air circulation, we would leave our ceiling fan on and sometimes crack a window. The free breakfast was so convenient and saved us the expense of a meal each day! Walgreens is right across the street, which was great for times we needed snacks or drinks or ATM access. Finally, the reason this hotel is a true gem is the location. It's just a few blocks to Chinatown, or you pretty much can stumble out the front door and down a block to get to Union Square. You're also right on the cable car lines, so getting around the city is practically a no-brainer. We bought a city pass so we'd have open access to all trolleys, cable cars and city buses and quickly understood routes and could get to any destination in the city. We never once had to rely on a taxi-cab! Our stay at the Cartwright was a great experience. We recommended the hotel to a friend who is staying there as I type this and we would definitely stay at the hotel again. ","annotations":[]}
