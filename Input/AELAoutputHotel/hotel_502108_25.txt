{"text":"Superb Bargain hotel!! This is how all Novotel Novation hotels should be. I really could not fault this at all. Got a fantastic rate of GBP25.00 per night on [--] and this is brilliant value for money especially when one thinks of how overpriced UK hotels are compared to what you can get in Berlin.Hotel is situated on Strasse des 17 Juni right by Tiergarten S-Bahn station. Having stayed in a few Berlin Hotels, this is no problem to get around anywhere regardless of the other reviews you may have read on here about this being out of the way. The Hauptbahnof is 5 minutes away, Alexanderplatz is 10 mins away. Bahnhof Zoo is 2 mins away by S-Bahn. If this is out of the way, i dread to think what areas like Pankow, Wilmersdorf and Charlottenberg are for some people!!Hotel lobby and corridor areas are modern, although in typical Novotel standard they are modern without being too flashy. The rooms are of a nice standard about 27 Square metres, with TV, honesty minibar, Tea and coffee making facilities, shower and seperate bath. Seperate toilet too in the room.Plenty of storage space, In room safe and a quiet interior room, I really couldn't fault this at all.For a hotel amongst the same star rating as the Park Plaza WallStrasse, its not as nice , but its equally on a par with the Park Inn in Alexanderplatz or the Novotel Berlin Mitte or Suitehotel at Potsdammer Platz.Rack rate at this hotel is about 145EUR per night which is reasonable considering what you are getting. Try getting a similar standard in a UK hotel for the same price turning up on the day!Top tip is to skip the buffet breakfast at 17 Euro and go across to the Wiener Fierbacker across the road and have a continental breakfast for a 2-3 Euros.This is without doubt the best Novotel I have had the pleasure of staying in ","annotations":[{"endOffset":917,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":913},{"endOffset":980,"mention":"Tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":991,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":985},{"endOffset":1228,"mention":"Park Plaza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_Park_Plaza_Hotel_&_Towers","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hyatt_Toronto"],"startOffset":1218}]}
