{"text":"Serves its purpose for the night before a cruise. I had read other reviews about the great shuttle to and from the airport. We only needed it from the airport, and called upon our arrival in Miami. We were told to just stand outside by departures and the shuttle would be by. We asked about a specific place and they said just outside anywhere by departures. So we stood outside. FOR AND HOUR!!!! We saw the hilton shuttle 3 times, the marriott twice, the red roof inn twice and even the LaQuinta west once along with countless other hotels but no LaQuinta East. We called 3 times and were told it would be there shortly. It did finally show up. It was a crappy van, but we didn't care it was finally here. So we walked up, and were told sorry they were full, we'll be back in 30 minutes. I thought, Jeez!!!, forget this dumb shuttle. So we took a cab which ended only costing a flat rate of $10 for all 5 of us, and it only took 5 minutes to get there. Should have done that in the first place.Anyways the rest of the stay was great. Check in was a breeze, the hotel served its purpose as we were staying the night before our cruise the next morning. The room was nice and the beds comfortable. The shuttle to the cruise ship was great (By far the best feature). We went to the Marlins game that night, and cab was $50 each way. I would stay away from the Bennigan's next door. I eat at Bennigan's all the time, and love the restaurant, but this one was dirty and had very poor service. No internet at this hotel, we were told to go to the Red Roof Inn next door. We should have used there shuttle too. ","annotations":[]}
