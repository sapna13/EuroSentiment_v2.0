{"text":"Not so majestic after all........ My husband and I (early 30s) stayed at the Majestic from 8\/11 to 22\/11 and have vowed never to return to the Dominican Republic!This is undoubtedly a lovely hotel, however, I would think twice about booking a holiday to the Dominican if you are reading this.We booked in April when this resort was receiving almost flawless reviews and as big believers in trip advisor, thought we couldn't go wrong and were so looking forward all year to a magic holiday. It was far from that!The first major problem was the weather - a LOT of rain and big black clouds and this kind of complex is completely dependant on sunny days. Weather is obviously never guarnteed to be good though, is it? Perhaps it was an affect of the tropical storm Noel, I don't know.We had food poisoning TWICE forcing us to cancel two excursions. Violent vomiting and diarrhea all through the night and following day. The temperature of the food served at the buffet restaurants is worrying. You spend the days when you're well, scared to eat anything other than soup or pasta for fear of getting sick again! Food is a major let down at this complex.Mosquitos - we travel abroad each year and have never been bitten until we went to the Dominican! Repellant doesn't seem to stop them either!On a positive note, the rooms are lovely, amazing pool, lovely bars (they did lack atmosphere mind you), great nightly shows and the casino is good although we were robbed (aren't you always!). I wasn't overly impressed with the beach - have seen a lot better.We originally wanted to go to Mexico but settled on the Dominican as it was more affordable - I wish we had paid the extra money! We always had reservations about this island in that so many people we know came back with food poisoning, but still booked thinking we would be ok. Maybe we were just unlucky, but unless you want to spend your days nursing the toilet bowl in your room, go somewhere else and don't be disappointed in your much awaited holiday!
