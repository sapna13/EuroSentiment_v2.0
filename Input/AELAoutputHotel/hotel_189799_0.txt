{"text":"What a gem! Traveled to Paris in mid-May. My daughter, who was traveling on business, booked the hotel online through their website. I arrived very early via shuttle from Charles deGaulle airport. It let me off near the Arc de Triomphe, whereupon I walked a short distance and then hailed a cab. Paris was so beautiful; the weather was delightful, only a little rain near the end.What a delightful surprise when the cab dropped me at the Hotel. It is a boutique hotel, not too large, but immaculate, with very friendly and helpful staff. The room for two was decorated tastefully in red and ochre. It was as quiet as a tomb. Big tall windows with draperies. A big closet, wonderful bathroom. The room was very very clean and neat. The hot water was plentiful, the toiletries very high quality, and the light was great. The night staff was so helpful, even when my daughter arrived late and the draperies fell down when we closed them. They were fixed in a jiffy, the night clerk smiling throughout. The rate was 215 euros for several of the nights.Vanessa and Fabienne were the daytime staff at reception. They were helpful with restaurant suggestions, etc.Internet access was available; I can't remember how much, but 30 minute increments were available. Breakfast was included for our stay; the breakfast room was downstairs, very attractively fitted out. I loved the the little pots of plain yogurt, with all different toppings. Eggs etc were available for an extra charge. Coffee, tea, croissant, little pastries also included. The only criticism of this breakfast was the croissant; being in Paris, the pastry is fabulous. I stopped in many little bars\/taverns\/cafes and ordered pastry at all times of day. So wonderful. We don't have anything like this in the USA, unless you are in NYC. So why weren't these pastries served at breakfast??? Pre-packaged do not make the grade. That is the only criticism. This hotel is located near the metro, near Gare de ST. Lazare, near Place de Concorde, Arc de Triomphe, walking distance to Jardin de Tuilleries etc. For our return, the hotel arranged a shared shuttle to the airport; I think it was about 20 US $ each. Worth the cost!!!!You will love the hotel, its location, the restaurants and parks nearby. Even the little Vietnamese restaurant right next door was very good and very reasonable. I hope you will consider such a lovely spot with personal attention and friendly clientele. In fact, we saw one French couple dining at the same restaurant in the Marais on Sunday. Several guests confirmed that they were repeat guests. Hope you like it.
