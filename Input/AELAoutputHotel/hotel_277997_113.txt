{"text":"Great customer service Pro's: 1) Noteworthy customer service Every staff member that we encountered was friendly and efficient. They must have tons of employees all over the property because even though the property is spread out, they always addressed my concerns very promptly. After expressing some concerns about the food to our waiter at the Different Pointe of View restaurant, the manager came to talk to us about it and gave us a discount off the bill.  2) Good rooms for the price ($159\/night) My suite was roomy and I really appreciated the separate living room area. The rooms are not ultra-posh but definitely nice enough and impeccably clean. It met my standards and was appropriate for the price point, if not better than most.  3) Comfy bed!Con's: 1) The exterior is a little dated and worn. Not enough to bother me.  2) The setting didn't appeal to me. It was just set in some brown dirt hills. I thought the cliffs would be more majestic. Maybe I don't appreciate the desert much, but it just looked like the hotel was put in one of the less-nice areas of where I come from (southern CA). 3) Food is not great. Some room service dishes were decent, others were not much better than the Olive Garden. Also ate at Different Pointe of View. I could not understand how my vegetarian dish could be worth $26. Tiny nouveau portions and bland, bland, bland. As mentioned above, the manager did address our concerns. The view and the restaurant and lounge itself were nice, though.Overall, I would not hesitate to stay here again for about the same price. I was very comfortable here for 4 nights. I will recommend it to my friends. I didn't try out the pools, spa or exercise area. Although it was fine for me, I can see where parking might be a problem.
