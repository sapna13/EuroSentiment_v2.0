{"text":"Excellent Hotel  Having booked the Ritz Carlton Bali based on reviews on this site, we departed the UK with an air of concern at the some of the recent negative comments about the hotel. However, we can honestly say that for our entire stay (10 days) the staff, service and facilities were superb.We chose to stay in one of the Club Level Rooms and made good use of the Club Lounge and the services of the welcoming and attentive staff. The entire team went out of their way to remember your name and preferences. The food and beverages served in the lounge were excellent and the small library of books available was a useful addition.Restaurants: Very good mix of restaurants offering a broad selection of food. Kisik was a particular favourite offering fresh seafood and an excellent setting. Prices in the restaurants are comparable to other 5 star hotels.Swimming Pool: The hotel has a myriad of pools to service all tastes. If you want peace a quiet then head for the villa pool or the newly opened ocean pool. During the day staff bring you cold towels, fruit and a small smoothy!Gym: The gym has a good mix of machines and free weights and doesn't get overcrowded. The staff will also give you a good stretch is you ask. Aerobic and yoga classes are also available. Golf: The mini- 18 hole golf course is excellent and well worth a round or two.Spa: Apparently the biggest in Asia, the Spa is fantastic and offers an impressive list of treatments. The bali massage and facials were both very good. However the aquatonic pool is a must. TIP: Go to the aquatonic pool around 4:30pm so you can catch the sunset whilst going round the different elements. Beach: Kuba Beach is very nice though we would recommend you take a shuttle car to get there unless you want a long walk. Also there is no lift to the beach, so you will need to be fit to climb the 180 steps. Grounds: Set in 70+ hectacres the resort is massive. Therefore despite the hotel being 90% full the resort did not feel overcrowded.Tours: Whilst external taxi's are available at the hotel, we chose to use the hotel cars and driver for our excursions round the island. The price is a lot higher but you get a betterquality car, the driver speaks good english and knows some good places to visit, and the hotel provide you with a basket of cold drinks and towels. Places to Visit: See the sunset at the Uluwatu Temple and then head over to Nusa Dua for a meal at Bumbu Bali. We highly recommend this hotel. Don't be put off by the location -taxi's are very cheap and feely available if you want to spend some time away from the resort.
