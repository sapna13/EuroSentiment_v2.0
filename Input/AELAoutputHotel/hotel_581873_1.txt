{"text":"Started badly - Got worse. Stayed at the Shatan at the end of Nov for 4 nights.Although the location appears good as its only a short walk to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Sq. it is also very far from almost anything else.As many have said before, it is on a very narrow Hutong full of local shops and although this can be seen as a good view of local Chinese life, for a first timer in the city it can initially be a bit daunting. (However, despite previous comments a taxi will be able to drive down the Hutong) The taxi (which you will need to get almost everywhere - the City is vast) situation is very strange. Whenever you try and take one from elsewhere in the city the driver invariably has no clue what or were you are talking about (just keep a map with you and point to JinShang Park). But - at various times throughout the day there is literally 8 or 9 waiting outside the hotel lobby, so obviously some of them know it!Lastly the staff are pretty poor, the staff wont let you leave the hotel after check-out until they have sent in a cleaner to check up on you, whilst you stand at the front desk. They then charge you if one of the hand-towels isn`t sparkling white still (which is fairly unlikely as the never changed them for 4 days!).Do not put yourself through this - it is a great city - but stay closer to the Sunlitun Embassy district for a better experience.
