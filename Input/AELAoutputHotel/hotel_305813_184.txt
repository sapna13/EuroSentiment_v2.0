{"text":"Loved the Langham It is not surprising that The Langham Place in Hong Kong is ranked at number 1. We spent 5 days at the LP during our honeymoon. We booked the hotel limo service to and from the airport via dealing directly with the hotel. All communication with the hotel was fast, efficient and professional. Finding the hotel desks at the airport is a bit of a challenge. As a tip, walk straight through the arrivals hall and all the hotel desks are situated on the very far right hand corner, right at the back. We spent a good while finding it! The cost of the hotel limi is 550 HKD each way (around 33 GBP). We checked in on the club level and were given a beautiful suite on the 36th floor. We took advantage of the 'Suite Dreams' package and I think its definately good value for money. The Club Level is certainly worth the extra cost. It's lovely to have somewhere to go when you are jet lagged and need a snack at 3am! Non alcoholic drinks are provided 24\/7 and alcoholic drinks during most of the day - a few hours in the early morning when they are not provided.The rooms are absolutely beautiful. Our suite was complete with 2 bathrooms, 2 big plasma screens, a massive bed and 5 telephones throughout! The rooms were made up in the morning and then given a quick once over in the evening (fresh towels and turn down service). We had a view over the city and can look down into the bustling streets below. Breakfast was included with the deal. You can either have continental breakfast at the Club Level or in the main restaurant 'The Place'. We only ate at The Place and the selection and service was exceptional. There is a good mix between Chinese fare and more traditional breakfast items (fresh omlettes, bacon, hash browns, fruit, toast etc).Also included as part of the package was a spa treatment. My husband and I both had wonderful hour long massage treatments at their beautiful spa on the 41st floor. The gym at the hotel was also amazing. Definately the best gym I've ever seen at a hotel. All the equipment was modern, clean and the cardio equipment was near the window overlooking the city.One of the best assets to the hotel are the staff. The hotel is very professionally run and is apparent that their staff are trained very well. One other reviewer commented on the youthfullness of the staff. This is certainly something we noted as well.Agreed, the location is somewhat out of the way, but it does provide an element of authenticity being in a heavily populated local area. We did not take the underground to get around, instead we did a local tour which we booked via the hotel concerige. It was the half day Hong Kong Island Orientation tour. The cost was 320 HKD each. I think this is well worth it as it takes you to Victoria Peak and Stanley Market as some of the highlights. We found Stanley Market somewhat disappointing compared the ladies market which is just 2 blocks from the hotel. But then again, we were visiting during Chinese New Year and some of the shops were closed.The hotel is also connected to a large shopping mall. This is great for quick and inexpensive meal options.Overall, 10 out of 10 for the Langham Place. We will definately be back next time we are in Hong Kong.
