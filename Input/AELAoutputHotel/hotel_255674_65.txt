{"text":"Great Hotel My wife and I stayed for 7 nights in a club room on the 29th floor commencing the 24th November. This was our second stay at this hotel as we stayed in November 2004.We arrived via taxi from the airport at a cost of $50 on a Saturday evening and the traffic in the city was gridlocked so this accounted for the higher than normal cost.Checkin was efficient with no lines and our room was spacious and very clean. We had a standard city view but through the buildings we could see a bit of the harbour. Staff were very helpful and friendly and could not be faulted.Other people have mentioned the superb location of this hotel and it truely cannot be beaten, it is only minutes away from the Rocks area, the bridge and the Opera House. In addition there are ferries, buses and trains to everywhere in just Sydney minutes away from the hotel at Circular Quay. People travel some distance to go to the Rocks area which is the old part of Sydney yet it is less than five minutes walk from this hotel. This is a great benefit on an evening and there is something to suit all tastes from very upmarket eating places to old English style pubs that serve good wholesome food with lots of choices inbetween.We had access to the executive lounge and this served complmentory food from 5:30pm to 7:30pm with complmentory alcoholic drinks being served from 5:30pm to 9:00pm. The views from the lounge was across the harbour to either the bridge or the Opera House. Breakfast was also served in the lounge with a good selection of hot or cold food.This is a very good hotel in an outstanding location and this is a very difficult combination to beat, we would thoroughly recommend this hotel.
