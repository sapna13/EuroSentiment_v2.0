{"text":"Stop looking for Hortels in Florence - JUST BOOK DAVANZATI! This hotel, and the people who make it a home-away-from-home, was the high point of our 3 week Italy trip. We took our two daughters (older) and they loved it as well. Family run, Hotel Davanzati is about the finest example of hospitality that I have run into in over 40 years of world travel. Fabrizio (your host) is a genius at helping you with whatever you need! We took the plunge and rented a car for some side trips (Pisa, Lucca, Chianti wine region, Sienna, etc.). We had been warned that having a car might be troublesome, but Fabrizio made it so easy. Each day, we just pulled the car up to the curb in front of the hotel, and a private company whisked the car away to parking garages unknown. Each morning, when we came down to breakfast, the car magically reappeared at the curb. (Of course we did pay 20 dollars or so per day for this service, but it is indispensible if you decide to rent a car.) If you do rent a car GET THE GPS. I don't care what big city you are from, you will NOT be able to get into or out of Florence without the GPS unit. It saved us HOURS. The roads are large and well maintained, the drivers in Tuscany competent and courteous. But back to the hotel - the food was great. I guarantee you will be spoiled by the staff. The rooms were the larget we had in Italy, and the unique character of each room makes it feel like you are living in a large mansion instead of a hotel. The location is stellar. There are more restaurants in stumbling distance than you could eat at in a month. There are probably 8 Gelaterias in a three block radius. You are so close to all the sights that it will take you 5-10 minutes or less to walk to most of them. If you decide to stay somewhere else in Florence, you are going to miss out one one of the highlights of a lifetime! ","annotations":[]}
