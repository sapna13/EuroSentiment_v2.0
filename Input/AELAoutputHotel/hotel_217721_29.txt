{"text":"Do yourself a favor and stay away!!! Forget about service and respect. This is one of the most incompetant group of people I have ever come across in a all my years of traveling. They are rude and dont care about service. The room I was given had a fan above the roof which made a disturbing sound all day and night. Two days in a row I got wake up calls at 6:20 am. repeatedly for 15 minute which I had not even requested.When I complained, no one cared and they even treated me as If I was making it up. They finaly changed my room but the key did not work when I came back from dinner. I told the front desk which happened to be the night manager. He told me that I was not in the room that I had told him but another. I explained that he was wrong and he insisted that I was the one wrong, he made me go up to the wrong room just to prove it. Then when I came back and told him, he actually wanted to move me again. I finaly got to my room and found the extra key in the envelope which had my room # on which proved the manager wrong... He never called to apologize. The hot tub was out of order my whole trip. In the mornings the hot water would just stop working. The hotel gym is a joke and they charger $14 for valet parking which is mandatory. They also had given my room to someone else before my checkin and cancelled my priceline reservation for two nights while charging me for it. I will never stay at this Hilton again even if they comp. me. ","annotations":[]}
