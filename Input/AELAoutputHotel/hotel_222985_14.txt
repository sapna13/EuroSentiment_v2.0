{"text":"Good Hotel for Overnight Stay Before a Cruise My family booked 2 rooms for a 1 night stay before we departed on a cruise. My Brother and his family flew into Ft.Lauderdale and got a private car service down to the hotel. My family flew into Miami and took a taxi. The cab driver found the hotel with no problem. (After reading some of the other reviews, maybe you might mention to the cab drivers that it's the old Clarion downtown, next to the Hyatt.)After reading some of the other reviews, my brother and I were suspicious of what was to come during our stay. My sister in law booked the hotel directly online with them and after seeing some of the pictures and reading the negative reviews, we were seriously planning on cancelling this out and paying big bucks to book another hotel. We decided to gamble and take our chances, as we were only staying for one night. I've been in the travel business (working for airlines and as a travel agent) for more than 20 years and I've stayed at dives before, so we figured what's one night going to do?We arrived around 6:30pm and found the lobby to be filled with a group of approximately 35-50 people. By the time, our luggage was unloaded from the cab, we made our way to the lobby to check in, the group was using the 2 elevators and it took several minutes to wait. The lobby seemed nice and clean, and the front desk staff was friendly to us. We got 2 rooms, one on floor 6 and the second one was direclty above My brother's room on floor 7. Our rooms faced the River and appeared to be clean. We could not find any problems with the room. Sure it was slightly old and worn, but for the price we paid compared to some of the other Miami hotel rates that was quoted to us, again we felt that it would be fine for 1 night.The bathroom appeared clean, and the only complaint was that there were 2 sets of towels, for 3 of us staying in the room. I called to the front desk who said they would send another set up. It took a second call and we received the extra set of towels about 2 hours after checking in. The beds to me were comfortable and I had a good night's sleep. (no bed bugs, or dirty sheets or spreads).Although the Miami River Park Hotel is not a 5 star property, it's not bad for a night or two, and the room rates seemed to be reasonable for this hotel.
