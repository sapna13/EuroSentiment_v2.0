{"text":"silken not sunken I have never written one of these reviews before but I find them very usefull when going on Holiday , So here goes.The world is so small these days, a 4.00 A.M Start and Easyjet flight from Liverpool, and you are checking in to your Horel by 10.00 A.M.The Silken Diagonal is fine for the Job. A nice modern hotel, that ticks all the right boxes. The decor is very modern, and clean. It is supprissing however, how quickly a Hotel starts to look a little shabby on the Edges, The shower leaked, the Pipes, were visable in the Bathroom and the veneer, was peeling away in the Bathroom. but that said this is an excellent Hotel. They are taking the P### a bit in Chargeing 16Euros, for Breakfast. If you go over the road to the Shopping Arcade you can get 2 Cups of Coffee and a Sandwich, for about 3 Euor's . If you have sampled the many resteraunts, that Barcelona has to offer the night before , thats about all you would want anyway.A few tips, for travelers to Barcelona. At the airport buy a T10 ticket at the train station this will allow you 10 trips on all metro's, tram's and busses,It costs about 6 Euro's, Great value and Hassle free. Buy an art ticket at the main Museeum's and this will allow you access into the main museum's in Barcelona including, the Piccasso Museem and the Maccba modern art one. ( However, give this a miss unless you really get the Modern art stuff ) I don't.Go for the set meals at the resteraunts, we ate at La Fonda, by the sea one night and for 15 Euros, we had a great 3 Course meal, with wine water and a Liquer, great value.If you wish to go to Parc Guell, dont take the Metro, find a Bus, Its a long walk from the Metro station.November is a great time to visit this Great, young and Vibrant City, It was warm , quiet, plenty to do, the resteraunts, were quite,and were very welcoming.
