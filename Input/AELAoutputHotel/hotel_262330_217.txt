{"text":"Great City We stayed in the Millenium Hilton from the 29th of December through to the 8th of January. Firstly, the connections to everthing here are excellent, we took the subway to and from the airport, it only takes 45 mins not sure how long a cab takes but it is around $45, the subway is 2. The subway is also excellent for getting uptown with the 'E' dropping you right next to Macys in 34th or times square at 42nd or right up to the rockerfeller on 53rd all for 2 bucks, if your making a couple of trips a day as we did it saves alot of money on 15 - 20 buck cabs.The hotel was excellent we never had to wait long to check in and as I had requested on the hilton website when booking I got a high floor room on the 49th floor. Our room over looked ground zero out to new jersey, the view was excellent, we found that the noise was no problem unless you opened the window, though the air conditioning unit was noisy at night. The pool and sauna were nice though the buisness suite with the internet for hire was expensive, try to find an internet cafe. The only complaint I have is not to do with the hotel as such but the location I found to be a bit of a hassle, though the subway is right outside, if you were shopping up 5th avenue or in around times squre it was a bit of a trek to come back to the hotel for a change of clothes or to drop off bags etc, it was also harder to find pubs and resteraunts within walking distance.Overall though i would definatly recommend the hotel.
