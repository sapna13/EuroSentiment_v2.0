{"text":"Great Time, but.... Just got back Saturday night from an 8 day vacation to Excellence. We traveled with 3 other couples and have been anxiously waiting this trip for months! It was a great time, but there were some things missing preventing this from being 5 star.It is a beautiful hotel, beautiful beach and pool, however in my room the ceiling above the shower was caving in, and I could see all of the piping and tubes up there. Kinda creeped me out, like someone was up there watching me shower. The shower also had mold in it. Cleaning service didnt come until around 5 or 6pm every night which was very annoying since they wanted to come in right in the middle of us getting ready for dinner. We had to grab extra towels from the beach knowing that we might not have clean towels later on. Room service always took about an hour an a half, even just to bring a hamburger. We kept losing power for long periods of time. The room clocks were always off. Whenever I went to blowdry my hair, the fuse blew out the power in the whole room.The pool area is beautiful and relaxing, and the pool activities are fun if you chose to participate. The entertainment staff was great!! It was annoying to wake up as early as 8am and not be able to find a chair because they were reserved. Sometimes we just moved peoples towels anyway :) Also, pool floats are like gold there, people scoop those up by 7am, and keep them by their reserved chairs. So unless your up at 7, youre not getting one! The pool def. needs a little buffettarea where you can grab a quick bite, so you dot always have to go inside for lunch. This was one thing that annoyed me the most about my stay here. A pizza guy does come around at 3pm, but y then I had already eaten inside and couldnt wait. Also, I rarely ever saw a waiter taking drink orders. Most of the time we had to go to the cafe bar to get our own.I happened to think that the food was great at all of the restaurants except Toscana. I ordered steak figuring it was a safe choice and it was inedible. I loved the lobster house for breakfast and the grill for lunch. They have unbelievable french fries, onion rings, chicken sandwiches and caesar salads. The buffet breakfast and lunch was ok for a quick bite, but I couldnt really find anything I liked. Spice and Chez Isabelle were amazing! Best french onion soup and chateaubriand I have ever had. The lobster house wasnt too bad, but the Grill was one of out favorites for dinner. The fliet mignon was great! Its funny though, because although we enjoyed the food, we all had serious stomach issues and were living off of bottles of Maalox.We all did the dunebuggy tour and it was great, except for them stopping everywhere wanted you to buy jewelry and other souvenirs. We actually had way to much fun, and got kicked off of the tour at the end for being too rowdy and not following the tour guide! It was awesome!! You get incredibly muddy, like tidal waves of mud,,and had to throw out all of our clothes that we had worn. There was no saving them! The club was also a lot of fun,,it was pretty empty all of the time, but there were 8 of us, so we made our own fun! Overall, it was a great trip but they really need to improve their service and maintenance. Our honeymoon at Le Blanc in Cancun last August blows this place away in all areas. It was hard because my husband and I kept comparing it to Le Blanc and there clearly is no comparison. Excellence is just a 4 star resort with poor service, at Le Blanc we never had to leave our chair for anything!
