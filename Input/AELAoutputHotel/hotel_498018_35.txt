{"text":"A Hidden Jewel Our family of 3 travels quite often and are members of several major hotel chains. However, there are no major ones other than Hilton near the waterfront in Barcelona. We opted to try this hotel, Icaria BCN...4 star, 2 blocks from the beach, away from tourists and a 16 multi-plex that plays films in the original language. It is in the Olympic Village area which is very residential but taking #14 bus goes to Port Vell, Las Ramblas and Plaza de Catalunya. and it is only 1.25 euros. The hotel is walking distance to Olympic port with numerous restaurants. If you like to walk, the promenade will all along the waterfront. Now the hotel...It is very modern and chic without feeling pretentious. The regular room was large for European standards, sound proof, comfortable bedding and bed and good quality amenities. The suite includes a computer, so no need to drag a laptop. There are 3 computers gratis for your use in the lobby also. The dining was good. Breakfast was a buffet and dinner had interesting choices that are prepared fresh, so be prepared to wait. But it is worth it. Pricing is very good. We had also ordered room service in which pricing is better than any hotel I have seen in the past. Some items are available 24 hours. The hotel has two outstanding members at the front desk. They are pleasant, knowledgeable and very efficient. I know it is a difficult task when dealing with the public but they do so with ease and a smile, which is important. They make an excellent impression. We decided that this hotel is outstanding in price, comfort and location. We will definitely stay there in the near future.
