{"text":"B'way Manor does its job. I stayed here with my wife when we visited SF. Now let me just say that it depends on what you're looking for and you do get what you pay for. We stayed here because it was cheap! We weren't going to spend much time in the room so we decided to save money here. The hotel is nice; it does its job in giving us a safe place to spend the nights. It's literally a no frills approach. We had a TV, a nice bed, nice photos in the rooms. We even had a fridge which came in handy!! Don't underestimate the importance of the fridge. The hotel is lik 2 1\/2 blocks from the trolleys. Its an easy walk! And your a short drive from China Town, the Full House homes, and if you want to drive to Fisherman's Wharf, its no more then 10 minutes. On top of that, its super easy to reach the golden gate bridge from the hotel. I recall it like 2 lefts and you're there. BEST OF ALL, THIS WAS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES THAT GAVE US PARKING! NOT MANY PLACES HAD THIS. It is first come first serve, but there was enough for everyone. So many of the hotels either didn't have parking or charged us like $10 - $15 per day. Street parking is avaiable but not in all neighborhoods. One of the downsides was the coffee in the room. It was one of the most vile coffees that I ever tasted. But I doubt most of you will care about that. The staff wasn't always available. We'd go to the front desk and had a wait a few minutes to find someone. Hope this helps. Good luck.
