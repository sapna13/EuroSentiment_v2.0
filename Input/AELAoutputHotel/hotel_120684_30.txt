{"text":"Loved the Outrigger!!! I was a little worried about some of the reviews that the Outrigger had received before I stayed there. Comments about their thin walls, outdated furnishings and the dreaded fans from the Cheesecake Factory were posted many times. However, I couldn't have been more relieved when I got there and experienced this hotel first hand.From the time we arrived, we were greeted promptly and cheerfully. Our check in was a breeze even though we arrived well before check in time. We took possession of one room while we waited for the other to become available.The rooms were a decent size, very comfortably furnished and had plenty of room for two friends and a toddler. My room was above the Cheesecake Factory but because we had the door shut all the time, we didn't hear a thing. We were also on the 9th floor which probably helped!! Our other friends had a room across the hall which had views of the ocean and they had their lanai door open all the time and could only hear the waves coming in - except when the Aloha Parade went through the first weekend we were there.We ate at every restaurant and had breakfast at the Hula Grill every morning. All the waitstaff were incredibly friendly and helpful and often helped us with suggestions of where to go and what to do.The pool is lovely - it's in full shade every morning and although it's really deep even at the shallow end, it is busy all the time so get there early and secure your sun-lounge!The beach outside is pristine and warm and it's easy to find your own little pozzie and share some shade from someone else's sun umbrella! There is a lot to do just on the beach itself - surfiing, canoeing, catamaran-ing.Outrigger on the Beach is in a fantastic location - right in the middle of everything. We used the valet parking and were very happy with the service of the guys there. Also, having computer and ATM access right in our lobby made things that little bit more convenient. As did having a coin laundry to wash baby clothes.We were all thrilled with the Outrigger on the Beach, I don't know if were were more tolerant of our neighbours because we have all travelled extensively and we have a realistic expectation of what a hotel in the middle of the main street in Waikiki is going to be able to deliver, but regardless, none of us had any problems with noisy neighbours or loud flushing toilets and I am already planning to go back and stay again!
