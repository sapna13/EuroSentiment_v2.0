{"text":"Not Thrilled My husband booked this hotel based on the Tripadvisor ranking (it was not in any of the guidebooks and now we know why) for the last leg of our honeymoon for three nights in June. We've always had great experiences with Tripadvisor suggestions and this was the first deviation. Overall, the atmosphere and room were poor, the service was horrible, the attitude was intolerable and the location was not for us. Barely a 3-star hotel.Bad:Atmosphere - Can be described as wannabe trendy - superior than thou attitude with no style. We had just come from an excellent trendy hotel in Barcelona (Hotel Omm) and this place, unlike Omm, was rude and unappealing. Adding some vibrant wall color and Ikea furniture may impress some, but it's really only a cut above the Holiday Inn. Everything was old, wrinkled and slightly dusty. Neither my husband nor I liked the aura. Room was just ok and bathroom was small; shower poured water on the floor and there was no tub. Seemed to be populated mainly by not so attractive 40-somethings who like to feel superior. If you want trendy try the Urban, the Hotel Reina Victoria, the Puerta America or, for something in the same price range, the Roommate Alicia, all of which were in better locations. We also had a very good experience with a Hi-Tech hotel in another city booking through Tripadvisor and there were a couple of those hotels on the Gran Via.Service - Awful. Ostensibly a four-star hotel, right? Well, we called the front desk on our first day to ask how to make restaurants at Sant Celoni and Asiana, two of the nicest (and excellent btw) restaurants in town. They said they didn't know what those places were (!) and that if we had the number, we should call them ourselves. Mind you, my husband is a very polite native spanish speaker and we did not give them any reason to be rude to us. All of the members of the staff looked crotchety and reluctant to be there. Upon arrival, knowing that average dinner time in the city did not start until 8 or 9pm, we went to the restaurant at 6:30pm to see if we could get a bite anyway, it being a hotel restaurant. There were people eating in the restaurant and we asked the waitress if it was closed. She rudely replied But of course! and began whispering to the bartender as if we were stupid for asking that question. We thanked her and walked away. A couple hours later, we went to the rooftop terrace (not very impressive) to take a look at the view. The same waitress came up to us and said, Are you hotel guests? If not, I have to ask you to leave. We were dressed nicely and looked normal. My husband told her yes and she looked embarrased but by that time we were extremely soured on the place. Location - This is a matter of personal preference. The location on the Gran Via is like staying near Madison Square Garden in Midtown Manhattan: central to everything, but dirty, touristy, and shady at nght (or during the day, since the red-light district is nearby). The hotel had no security and anyone could walk up to the rooms. We would have preferred to stay further east, near the Prado (e.g., Westin Palace) or in the Salamanca district.Restaurant - expensive with mediocre food. Good:Maid service - very fast and responsive.Minibar - nice selection.Bed - did not have a crevace between the two twin beds pushed together to make a double, unlike most of the other hotels in Span (only the 5-star hotels had true queen\/king beds). The beds were pushed together but it had a good topper.In sum, we would not stay here again. Might be ok for some who don't need service and really want to be on the Gran Via.
