{"text":"Amazing boutique hotel We stayed at the hotel between 12 - 14 September 2008. The hotel itself is fantastic - it is steeped in history and the rooms are characterful and clean. The beds are amazingly comfortable. We were on the second floor facing the external courtyard to the front of the hotel and it was incredibly quiet.We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant the first night of our stay. The food was excellent, as was the service. The mojitos from the bar are the best I've ever tasted! The tapas was great - pretty big portions so no need to go too crazy on the ordering (like we did!). I didn't think it was a bad price for the quality\/quantity provided. The atmosphere was great and there was even some flamenco dancing on the bar.We went to Hacienda Caribali on the Saturday with friends - 2 of us were horse riding and 2 were going on the quad bikes. We had a fantastic time. The horses are all in great shape. They match the horse to your ability and my horse was responsive, well fed and well behaved. The stables are very clean and well maintained and the horses that were waiting to go on the trail rides were kept together, in the shade with fans blowing on them to keep them cool - they were cooler than we were! I'm happy to recommend this trip to anyone.The quad bike rides were also thoroughly enjoyed and the guides were excellent. The quad bike guide was full of interesting facts about the rainforest and its history.About half way through the trip we all met up together at the river so that the horses could have a break in the shade and we could go for a swim which was great fun.The hacienda is about an hour long drive out of Old San Juan. A representative from the Hacienda arrived around an hour and a half before our trip to collect us from the hotel. She was polite and knowledgable and there were refreshments waiting in the car for us. The taxi ride was complimentary within the trail ride price (which I think is very reasonably priced). We were taken to the hacienda and when we were finished riding we could take as long as we wanted at the ranch before our driver took us back to the hotel, via a different route so that we could see the coast and the famous strip of roadside restaurants.All in all our trip was fantastic and I will definitely be returning to do it again in the coming months. We will be staying at El Convento again - great location, great food and wonderful rooms.
