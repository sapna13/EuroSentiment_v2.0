{"text":"Central Location Istayed at the Palace Hotel in Tokyo with my wife March 07. My wife was there for work I was ther for pleasure,so the hotel worked great for both of us. It was close to the main buisness district for her and it was centrally located for myself. The rooms were nice they were average size,but the bathrooms were very nice. The staff was very friendly ,most spoke some english and some probably better than I do. It had several restaurants and bars, some of the restaurants were a little pricy,but not to much more than any other place in Tokyo. The beers in the bars were about $8.00 each, but once again an average price in Tokyo. There is a subway station entrance about a block and a half from the hotel, exit from the side of the hotel by the exercise room and turn right. If you plan on going from one area to the next as I did you might want to buy a day or week pass on the subway. The Imperial Palace is across the street and is worth walking around if you have the time. The hotel also has a bus service from the airport to the hotel I think it was about $30.00 ea., but worth it because the airport is about 60 min. away. To sum things up , it was a very nice hotel,I felt a little out of place ( everyone else was in suits and I was in shorts and T-shirt). Very classy, very friendly, great location I would definitly stay there again. Can't wait to go back , I LOOOOOOOOOVED Tokyo and I bet you will too whether your going for buisness or pleasure.
