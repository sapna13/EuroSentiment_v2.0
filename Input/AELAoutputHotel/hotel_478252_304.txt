{"text":"Amazing Beach We stayed at the Bahia Principe Bavaro from Feb. 8-15, 2008. To be honest, we were quite concerned about the negative reviews we read on tripadivsor.com and almost changed our destination. We're glad we didn't. The resort is absolutely beautiful! Perfectly manicured grounds, impeccably clean, large rooms with private balcony, fabulous pools but its best feature is, by far, the gorgeous, wide beach with white sand and plenty of lounge chairs and palapas. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to the Diamond Club (Villa 26). We were located relatively close to the beach, were entitled to four √ã√ë√∏ la carte dinners for the week and had maid service twice a day. All good perks.In general, we thought the food was very good. We enjoyed all four dinners at the restaurants. Our favourites were the French and Mediterrean. The quality, presentation and service were delightful. The buffet was terrific! Food was abundant, there were numerous choices (including a low fat menu) although I must agree that the food and coffee were not always piping hot. In our opinion, the wine was not very good but we were able to purchase respectable wines (i.e. Robert Mondavi) at a reasonable price.Other than the maids, the staff REALLY make an effort to please the guests. They are friendly, courteous and efficient. At the Diamond Club (not sure if it is available in all rooms) there is an Express Line where one can call with any request. Not only do they provide the service quickly, they also follow up with a phone call to make sure the guest's needs were met.Of course when compared to five star hotels in North America, it may appear as if the Bahia Principe falls a little short. But please bear in mind that the Dominican Republic is a developing country, yet in tourism it strives to be first rate. It provides one of the most exquisite beaches, warm weather and sunny skies. Make the best of it! Enjoy! Once the vacation is over, you may be back to frigid temperatures, like we are here in Montreal.
