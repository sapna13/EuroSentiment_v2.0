{"text":"Great Stay My friend and I had a great stay at Adagio. The staff was very pleasant and helpful and the lobby is very pretty. I especially liked the complimentary coffee in the morning and coffee\/tea in the evening. (don't pay to make coffee in your room - just go to the lobby in the AM where it's free). The room - an executive queen, queen had a surprisingly good amount of space. The bathroom's a little small, as expected, but the 2nd shelf on the vanity made everything very workable. To criticize: The bed was a little soft for my taste; the carpet seemed a bit dingy; and I wasn't crazy about the stand alone AC unit with the hose going out the window. However, these were not major factors; they wouldn't keep me from staying there again especially when you spend most of the time out of the room.  The walk to Union Square is about 5 blocks or so - less than some hotels but more than others. I like to walk. Some people on this site have complained about the homeless. Yes, they can be aggressive but that's life in a big city. Get used to it and keep a little change handy sometimes. I like staying near Union Square better than the other areas -- especially if you like to shop. And on a sunny day, it's beautiful to sit out around the square. I recommend a meal at Hotel Adagio's restaurant - Cortez. The service was slow on our particular night but the food was good. We had driven in from Napa on that day and were pretty tired - so it was wonderful to have a good meal without leaving the hotel. We also enjoyed lunch twice at Max's down the street and you might catch a great band at Biscuits and Blues nearby. If you keep up on the news and pop culture, and you like satire and musicals - dont' miss Beach Blanket Babylon (a cab ride away). Everything's a little pricier - it's San Fran - so expect that. I would stay at Adagio again, especially for a good rate. We got a sale on the travel websites so we averaged about 160\/day - lower than on the hotel's own website.  2 more recommendations: I rented a car for 2 days for Napa -- and got a great price on make a bid on priceline. And I had NO hassles with it. The total for 2 days (we picked up about noon on Tuesday and dropped off about 5pm Wed) with taxes was about 107 for a full size car.  Also - if you ask the hotel to get you a ride to the airport - BE SPECIFIC - if you want a taxi or a private car. They automatically got us a private car and it was a little more money -- albeit a more comfortable ride.
