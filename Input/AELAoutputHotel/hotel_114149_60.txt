{"text":"nice hotel...but a few glitches that were annoying I spent two nights in June 2007 at the Langham in downtown Boston while on business--my first stay in this hotel. The location was great, in downtown Boston, within walking distance of the Investor Conference I was attending and only about 20 minutes from the airport. Things started off just right, with the doorman offering to take my luggage, holding the door for me, and escorting me to the check-in desk. The lobby was attractive, and the attendant who checked me in was professional, friendly, very quick, and shared with me important details about the hotel before showing me to the elevators. He explained that there is 24 hour room service, which I was pleased to hear, since I was arriving late and needed to order dinner, a small gym that is open from 6am-9pm, and an indoor pool and spa, a nice amenity.Upon checking into the room, I was a bit surprised to see how small it was. It was smaller than a typical room in a 4 or 5 star US hotel; it reminded of the size room one might get in a business hotel in London. There was a very nice king size bed, with great down pillows and comfortable bedding, a desk with wired internet access that costs $9.95 per day (not wireless), a bedside table, a three drawer dresser, a TV cabinet (with an old 24 inch TV--not a newer, larger, plasma TV found in many 4 or 5 star hotels in the US today), one chair with a small round table next to it. The bathroom was adequate size, with a small tub\/shower. The room was big enough for one, but there was no room for a room-service table, so they brought the food on a tray, and I had to eat on the small round table--not the best set up.I ordered room service for dinner, and it was promised within 25 minutes, and they almost made it. It took about 35 minutes. The menu was limited for this type of hotel, but the food was fine.The bed was very comfortable, and I had a restful night. My only major complaint was that my wake-up call came 10 minutes early. Since I had traveled from the west coast and was a bit jet-lagged, I was a bit peeved that they called early, as I would have liked to have had another 10 minutes of sleep (and having 10 extra minutes in the morning before I had to leave for a business meeting was not enough time to eat breakfast or work out; what do you do with only 10 extra minutes!). I complained about the early wake-up call, and the operator said they often call early, because they have so many wake-up calls requested for the same time. The next night, when I requested a wake-up call, I emphasized that I did not want the call to come early! This worked.I used the fitness center during my stay, and there was a wide variety of cardio equipment (3 treadmills, 3 bikes, 2 precors, and 2 stairmasters) and a few pieces of weight equipment., not enough to really get a weight workout--pretty typical of a small hotel gym. The treadmills seemed a little old, but everything else was in good shape. There were a number of TV's in the fitness room within view of most of the cardio equipment, but there were no headsets, so with the volume for many of the TVs on all at once, it was a bit noisy in there. There was some complementary fruit available, which was a nice touch after a workout.All in all, this was a pretty nice 4-star hotel in a great location with good service. Beware though that the rooms are small.
