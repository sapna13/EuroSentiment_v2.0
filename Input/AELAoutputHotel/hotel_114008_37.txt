{"text":"Paradise The Kahala was the perfect honeymoon hotel. Everything about the hotel was relaxing from a lovely check in to the staff (everywhere), the room was lovely. It was renovated with absolutely no flaws and the biggest and most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. The maid service was exceptional and yes we heard a little bit of renovating noise - once during our stay. The concierge couldn't have been more helpful with our questions and requests. We used the shuttle to waikiki and the shopping centres and found it very reliable with nice drivers. The beach is great, nice and quiet (especially compared to the hustle of waikiki) There are a couple of hammocks just off the beach with a couple of gazebos and lots of loungers and cabanas (we didn't use the cabanas because I objected to paying $50 for what was basically a shade). The pool is small but there really isn't a need for a large pool when the beach is on your doorstep. The loungers at the pool are even more comfortable than the beach ones. There are staff there to give you towels and lounger covers as well as getting you drinks from the bar (never any need to wait). The only down side to the pool was that there were a few kids there.We ate at the Plumeria beach house and the food was lovely, (big portions). I think the only down side to the hotel is the price of the food and drink which is expensive although really lovely. I cannot recommend and praise the Kahala and it's staff enough - they made our honeymoon perfect and it was a joy to vist - it really was paradise.
