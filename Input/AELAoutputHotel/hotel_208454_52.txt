{"text":"Service Drops a Star from Last Visit I stayed at Sofitel New York in February, and wrote a review giving the hotel 5 stars for a perfect visit. Six months later, I would say the front desk service I received has cost them a star.Overall, I was happy. The room was clean and wonderfully quiet, the bed was great, and the room service we had one evening was lovely. We reserved the Chic Picnic deal that got us one free night out of 4, and a lovely picnic basket filled with gourmet sandwiches, salads, fresh fruit, and home-baked cookies, and a bottle of Champagne. It was fabulous, as was our welcome cocktail and the late checkout. The problem was, we had to ask for these things, when they should have been mentioned at check in. I presented my Sofitel Privilege card, which should be enough to get the conversation started about the welcome cocktails and the late checkout. I booked the Chic Picnic package, which should have meant that the staff would ask us when we'd like it. I ended up feeling like I was groveling for freebies, which should not have been the case.So, overall, things were great, but I felt sort of awkward with regard to the front desk. I'm not sure if my next trip will find me at Sofitel or not, but I must say if you are a light sleeper, this is the place for you. I cannot believe how quiet the room was- no street noise at all!
