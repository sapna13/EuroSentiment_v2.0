{"text":"Loved the Caribe Hilton! My wife and I anguished over reviews of this and other hotels in P. R. before settling on the Caribe Hilton. We arrived the week after the last review and missed the storm but saw some of the left over damage.We are so happy with our choice. While we can't speak for the views from other rooms, our room 538 in the Main building had a beautiful view of the Pool Area as well as the Private Beach and the Ocean. We could see the Ocean from bed. The room was very clean and nicely furnished with Tropical Colors and Wood Tones. The Room was large,Comfortable and very Clean. The Grounds were extraordinary with many Pools, Hammock Groves and the only Private Beach on the Island. The service from the staff was the best we have experienced. The Hotel is in an area by itself so there's not much to do around but it's a 75 cent 10 minute bus ride to Old San Juan. Adjacent to the Hotel is a Large Public Beach and Park which is very nice and has lot's of Palm Trees for shade. There were many choices for restaurants (6) and some were fairly expensive and others were moderate. The Buffets at the Palmeras were very good including the Friday Night Seafood Buffet. Cheap Breakfast and Lunch can be had at the Subway Restaurant across the street. All in all we are very happy with our choice and look forward to returning to the Caribe Hilton. ","annotations":[]}
