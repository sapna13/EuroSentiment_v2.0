{"text":"Overall, a Good but Not Great Hotel Having stayed 6 days at the hotel, I found the overall experience there as good. I would stay there again even though it would not be my first choice. Check-in was efficient although not as friendly as most of the other staff in other areas. The greeter at the lobby Aquamarine Restaurant was excellent- he was friendly and knowledgeable- he also offered wonderful advice about places to shop. The buffet at the restaurant was very good as was the Chinese restaurant on the 5th Floor.The employees who help secure cars and open doors when you arrive at the hotel were also very good and friendly. It is clear that the hotel, overall, understands how to deliver good service. Employees would almost always say hello when passing you in the halls.The biggest negative here is the loudness of the music from the 4th floor lobby bar (Check-in is actually on the 4th floor here). I was on the 16th floor and the music actually sounded like it was in the hallway outside my room. Most guests that I spoke with also complained about the loudness. While the atrium here is very nice, the design at the Marina Mandarin represents how form took precedence over function. It is just poor design to have hotel rooms that require people to use ear plugs to try to sleep. I certainly would hesitate bringing anybody here who needs a quiet environment. Internet use for every 24 hour period was high at $21 SG or about $15 U.S. A more accurate rating probably would be 3.5 stars.
