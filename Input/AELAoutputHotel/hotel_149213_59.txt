{"text":"A Paradise Vacation!! We stayed at Barcelo B.Beach May 20-25,mysely,husband,and 20 yr. old daughter.It was a vacation we cannot brag enough about.Airport,front check-in,no wait at all.There was more English speaking people there then what I had read about.No problems with communications.Domminicans are very hard workers  were all extremely friendly  nice.We always tipped a dollar or two,and they remember you,and willing to serve you first.Our room was no more than a 3 1\/2*,but the grounds,beach,food,and everything else there was a 10*.We were only in our room to sleep and bath.Bed always fresh,room cleaned every day.Who goes on vacation to stay in a room?We had an ocean view and what a VIEW!!!! Every morning to wake to see the sunrise ,thru the coconuts trees,over the ocean,AWESOME!While on the way to excursions,we picked up people at other resorts- 4  5*s.Resorts,also beautiful,but I wouldn't given up ours.Our grounds were so tropical  I liked hopping the train around to the other 4 sister resorts.Market place,just a little walk down the beach,bargin for great buys.Our highlight-was the Jeep Safari,a must do to see the rest of the island,90 us$.Driving your own jeep(or a guide will drive for you),starts in sugarcane fields,up mountains,thru the tropical forest(like Jurassic Park)ending on the beach to ride horses.Giving goodies and school supplies to the kids along the way was very rewarding.Glad I bought alot to give! Been to many Islands,but this one was the best!! We're planning on returning,and staying at the same resort,It was a wonderful family vacation:) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":356,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":352},{"endOffset":356,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":352}]}
