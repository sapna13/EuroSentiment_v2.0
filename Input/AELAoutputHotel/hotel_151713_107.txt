{"text":"Our PR Home away from Home I've been reading reviews at least 3-4 times a week since I booked this hotel in April 2006! We stayed here from Oct. 6-8. I am extremely satisfied with my stay here and paying attention to the reviews was well worth it. It is a 3-4 min ride from the Airport. Lobby is beautiful with a rainforest atmosphere. The atrium style setting of trees and small waterfalls is very relaxing. Pool in the back is nice with a jacuzzi and kids pool. And although the highway is behind the pool, it didn't bother us at all. Its kind of hidden by all of the trees. Also, we only heard like 2 airplanes our whole stay-but after living in New York, who cares! Breakfast is just as other reviews said; satisfying with all breads, juices, tea, coffee, cereals, fruits, and regular fare, as well as made to order omelets, waffles and pancakes. Yes, definitly get there between 7:30-8:30 because after that it does get crowded-towards the end, you may not even be able to find a seat, and there are plenty of seats! We ate enough every day last until dinner. Internet is $9.95 per day, so if you need to use it, make sure you understand it will be charged to your room or credit card. Live music nightly and just a walk to a local Ponderosa, Mi Casita  the other resort\/hotels on the strip, plus a grocery store. We stocked up on water and fruits. Having the fridge and microwave is a big plus. For your El Yunque tour, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Rafael from PR 4 LESS. Ask Bo, or the other managers\/staff to hook you up with him. He really enjoys taking people through the island, and if you're hungry after, he'll take you to a real authentic PR roadside stand\/restaurant to eat. That was one of the greatest parts of our trip. I will definitly return to Embassy Suites. Not only are the rooms\/accomodations great for the price, but it felt like coming home every night. We moved over to the Ritz Carlton after our 2 nights here and although the Ritz is beautiful, probably best for honeymoon\/anniversary vacations, the atmosphere is kind of stuffy with a lot of business people. Embassy has a very relaxed feel. There are a lot of families that stay here, and it is also a spot for locals on the weekends. The staff is not afraid to talk to you, and smile at you, and for that we can't wait to go back.
