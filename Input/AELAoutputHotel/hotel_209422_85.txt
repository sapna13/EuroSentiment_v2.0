{"text":"Great Hotel off the beach in Waikiki I've stayed time and time again at the Hilton Prince Kuhio in Waikiki. I used to stay here quite a bit when it was the old property, Radisson Prince Kuhio. Since turning over to the Hilton name the property and guest rooms have been renovated and many of the old problems I used to find are now gone. Overall it is very clean, very modern, has very helpful and friendly staff, and offers all the things you would expect when travelling on business as well as bearing the Hilton brand.I give this place 4-stars b\/c I travel here on business. For families or those in groups, I'm not sure if I would stay here b\/c the rooms are a bit small and it is a full long block away from the beach. It is not a bad walk and i don't mind personally, but some on vacation wishing to be closer to their rooms from the beach might be disappointed to not be RIGHT next to or on the beach in Waikiki. It is, though, in my opionion, on the prettiest side (Diamond Head) of Waikiki -- close to the Duke statue and the beautiful Kapiolani Park, zoo, aquarium, etc.One of the reasons I would think twice about sharing this room with friends or for families is this. The rooms are all modern now -- the bathrooms have these two windows designed of cracked see through glass that look into the rest of the room. It is a bit weird. If you have companions, when you use the bathroom, the light will shine into the whole room. There are metal blinds to offer privacy, but not that much privacy. The bathroom also is where the closet is. The only real problem i have with this hotel is I tend to get rooms that have adjoining doors to another unit. I assume there are rooms that don't have adjoining doors. But even so, when in your room with the TV off you can HEAR a LOT. You can hear doors slamming from the other rooms from the hallway and through the adjoining door you can easily hear conversations from the people next door. It can be disturbing and is disappointing for this hotel.Other than that, I would highly recommend this property. Everything else about the hotel is pretty superb. It is not a fussy, huge resort like you can easily find in the rest of Hawaii, which is what i like most of all being on business travel. Final notes and tidbits about the property:-The tub, tile, LARGE counter top and side tables, in the bathroom are very nice, super clean, and modern. Some rooms have nice stand up showers and no tub. Hairdryer, iron, tolietries, really nice towels are all provided.-The beds are super comfortable, there are plenty of nice pillows, and clean linens. You have a large flat panel HD TV in the room (with a data\/connection center), you have to pay for in-room internet ($10.95!), but it is free if i remember using wireless in the lobby areas and pool deck. There is a safe, a large cabinet dresser, a desk, night stand, and chair in the rooms with two beds (and i think the same for kings).-Parking is Valet ONLY and it can get backed up waiting for your car when events are going on or letting out in the hotel.-The Mac 24-7 restaurant in the lobby is GREAT -- has huge portions (prices on the moderate to higher than average side for Waikiki). It's open 24 hours making it convenient, but the food and service is great there (this is where the room service is delivered from, too).-The pool is on the 10th floor and is kinda small, but has a nice little pool bar (pupus and drinks) and large deck. It can get windy up there, but I love hanging out there.-The location is fine for me, rooms that are higher up that face the ocean actually can have a good view. Even the city view or mountain view rooms higher up can be nice.
