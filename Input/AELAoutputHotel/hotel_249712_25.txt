{"text":"Just Perfect..... Myself and my parents visited this hotel for 5 nights to celebrate my Mothers 60th birthday. Everything about this hotel was just perfect.I contacted the hotel before hand to request a high corner room we immediately received a reply saying that we would both be upgraded to corner rooms with executive privileges!! This did not dissapoint the rooms were fabulous, the views incredible we had the Hudson on one side and the ESB on the other and the heavenly beds a joy to jump into after a day of sightseeing. When you wake at 4am for the first few mornings the sunrise is gorgeous over the skyscrapers.The executive lounge provided us with a quiet place to sit and chat about our day and plan the next. Here we were able to help ourselves to complimentary tasty hors d'oeuvres and soft drinks. we could also have beer or a glass of wine for $5 (much cheaper than the bar!) The breakfast was lovely, from porridge to bagels and fresh coffee and fruit juice.We were made to feel so welcome by every member of staff at this Hotel, check in was a breeze, all bar staff , housekeepers and the concierge warm and genuinely wanted us to have a great time. Hotels can easily provide clean comfortable rooms but this hotel did all the little things that make a difference; My mother received a bottle of prosecco and chocolate covered strawberries on arrival and then a bottle of champagne and strawberries on her birthday with a gift of a photo frame all wrapped beautifully. We purchased a cake elsewhere and the hotel stored it overnight and then provided us with a mini fridge for her room to keep the cake chilled. They also sent up a vase for her flowers within a few minutes of asking. We had late check out at 4pm and after this they said we could use the executive lounge until out taxi came a few hours later which allowed somewhere quiet to sit instead of the busy reception.The hotel was perfect for us in respect for location, I loved just walking out and being in the midst of the hustle and bustle, a few minutes from all the theatres, shops and take aways. We found a superb restaraunt a few blocks away on eighth avenue and 50th called Sosa Borella, lovely atmosphere and excellent food a couple of minutes from the Wintergarden theatre. We shopped (although not cheap anymore, some bargains such as Levis √ä√£¬¢22 from macy's) and took in two shows both excellent; Mama Mia and Haispray, we got the hairspray tickets half price two hours before from the TKTS booth under the red steps in times square, short queues as there are 12 booths and its a great place to take photos of the illuminations. Although Times Square never goes to sleep (we were shopping in Billabong at midnight) as soon as you enter your room you have complete silence.Great things we did; Top of the Rock, 3 hr Circle line cruise and ground zero museum which we booked before hand on their websites after reading the reviews on trip advisor 'things to do' its really worth reading those as our whole trip was full and went so smoothly. Took horse and carriage through central park on my mothers birthday, watched people iceskating in the sunshine. Took subway which was cheap, clean and much more spacious than the tube. Easy to navigate with very friendly people to help if you are not sure. Went on this up to bloomingdales and had lunch twice in a Diner opposite which was just lovely, the portions were huge! and service excellent. We felt completely safe at all times in New york.A great bonus was that we were able to watch the Northern lights on our flight home, something we will never forget.Overall the Westin was a perfect choice for us so thank you to all the staff there and especially to Maryann for making my Mothers special Birthday so memorable.
