{"text":"High up in the clouds I was staying with my sister at the Swissotel when her husband came back early from his business trip, so I found myself having to book another room on no notice. I tried to book via a travel website, they confirmed but later rejected my email. I had only received the confirmation email so I kicked up a real fuss when Swissotel staff could not find my booking. One of their managers took me to their office level so I could use a computer free of charge to try to sort out the booking mess. I was mortified when I discovered that it was the travel website that had mucked up. The manager was still nice and polite to me. They gave me a slightly discounted rate as my sister was a long-stay guest in another room, and they knew I hadnt expected to have to book my own accommodation. I was given a room on the 55th floor, and the view was fantastic. My sister was on the 19th floor and the view was very average. I would recommend putting a request in for a high-level floor, however this isnt a good idea for those that are afraid of heights or elevators. I'd go up so high in the elevator, my ears would pop! The room was very nice, perfectly clean, with good facilities and a balcony. Their buffet breakfasts are great - lots of things to choose from, and a glass frontage so you could see when the morning sun shower had finished. Nice pool area. The best thing about this hotel is that you are right above a huge shopping centre, and an underground tube station. However if you're one to be paranoid about terrorist attacks, I'd stay away from this hotel. Otherwise it's fantastic, highly recommended.
