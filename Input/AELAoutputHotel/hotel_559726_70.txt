{"text":"A mixed bag We heard about the Aqua Palms and Spa from the Hawaii For Dummies book. Hotels in Honolulu, particularly Waikiki Beach, can be pricey, so we booked a room after reading some Trip Advisor reviews. The best mainland comparison to this hotel would be The Hampton Inn chain. This hotel was more upscale than, say, Motel 6 or Red Roof Inn, but it wasn't a Hilton. It basically lived up to our expectations. We got a nice room for a reasonable price and it was in a good location. There is a continental breakfast included with the cost of the room, although the food selections were somewhat paltry. There was a bowl of apples, oranges, and bananas and two plates of muffins. We had a nice lanai included with our room, but be aware that there is currently construction going on both on Ala Moana Blvd., on which the hotel is located, and across the way at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The hotel pool is tiny, but you are located a very short walk from the beach. The elevators need some work. They are slow and small and the doors close very quickly. The bathroom in the room was very small. There was some gunk on the headboard of our bed, which kind of grossed me out. It was hot in the hallways, but we saw a sign posted in the elevators that the hotel is working on that issue. We got very good massages for a very reasonable price ($65 for a one hour massage) in the spa. I put spa in quotes since it is just a hotel room with two massage tables, so don't expect a fancy atmosphere. Overall, a good value, a clean, comfortable room, but it's not the Ritz. It pretty much delivers what it says it will, and not a bit more.
