{"text":"Wonderful stay at the Hotel Nikko I stayed six nights at the Hotel Nikko on business earlier this month, and had read through all the TripAdvisor reviews before doing so to try to get an idea of what to expect. I found TripAdvisor helpful, and the Hotel Nikko's high ratings to be very well-deserved.The hotel is lovely - great location in the Polanco area which was safe and convenient for walking to nearby restaurants and sights (like the Museum of Anthropology, which was exceptional), as well as to my meetings which were nearby. I stayed in a superior room on the 30th floor, and found the room to be everything that I had expected and more - very comfortable bed, great amenities, wonderful bathroom with a shower that I wished I could have taken home with me, flat-screen tv, and a beautiful view of the park and city from my window. I honestly couldn't find a single thing to complain about if I had tried. Common areas in the hotel were clean and well-maintained, and the health club and pool areas were very well-equipped. I also have to say that the staff were some of the friendliest I have encountered at any hotel. Everyone had a ready smile and greeting and bent over backwards to be of service.The little pastry and coffee shop in the lobby was great for picking up a quick bite in the morning, and the breakfast buffet in the El Jardin restaurant was reasonably priced and delicious, with a mix of basic buffet dishes and some very good Mexican breakfast items. I would not hesitate to stay here again and would recommend the hotel to anyone considering a stay in Mexico City.
