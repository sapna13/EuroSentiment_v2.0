{"text":"Disappointing Having read all the amazing reviews in the site and after a very good experience with the authenticity of reviews on Trip-Advisor I was very disappointed with this hotel.This is a nice expensive hotel with pleasant staff, especially the concierge but this is by no means the fifth best hotel in the world or the first\\second in London. This is ridicules. I myself have been to several better hotels in London at similar prices.Rooms √à√\u2020\u2022?We booked 2 upgraded Superior King Rooms. The rooms were extremely small, pleasant but so small it was annoying. The rooms were facing an inside court that was looking straight at other rooms. Connecting Rooms √à√\u2020\u2022?At booking we asked for connecting rooms. We were told that they can not guarantee but let us understand that they will make an effort. Upon arrival we were told that no connecting rooms were available and that the hotel was fully booked. I asked three times the reception if they can move us to connecting rooms later on our stay and got the same answer. Only on our third day, one of the receptionists told me that they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have any connecting Superior King Rooms, at all in the hotel. Funny they did not mention it on the phone when I made the reservation.Service √à√\u2020\u2022?The concierge staff were very kind and helpful, extremely helpful, the best experience we had in the hotel.The reception staff as mentioned earlier were not helpful and were quite impatience to our simple request (we later understood why).Location √à√\u2020\u2022?The location is not as good as stated in the reviews. It is a nice area but a little to far to walk to places. Maybe that was because it was so clod.Restaurant √à√\u2020\u2022?we did not eat breakfast at the hotel (22 pounds per person) but ate one evening in the restaurant. The food was very mediocre, the staff pleasant and we had a visit of a mouse which did not seem to bother the head waiter at all. All in all, a nice expensive hotel but not nearly as good as described in the reviews. I was disappointed. I guess it is all a matter of expectations.
