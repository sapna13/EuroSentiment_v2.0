{"text":"Loved It!! I just returned from a beautiful stay at this resort. Other than a slight problem with our check-in, my family and I had a wonderful time! We arrived at the resort at 3:15 on Saturday, August 25th. Our room was not ready and we could not get a clear idea from the staff as to when our room would be ready. However, they let us change into our swimsuits and enjoy the pool while our room was being cleaned. Our room was ready at 5:30. Like others have written, the food at the resort is expensive. We are from Long Island, NY, so $10.00 for a Pina Colada or $4.00 for a beer s not unheard of. To save money, go to the Wal-Mart on Route 3 heading towards Fajardo and stock up on snacks, cereal, beer, wine or whatever. There are plenty of fast food restaurants on Route 3, but you need a car. We rented a car because several other reviewers recommended it. In my opinion it's worth renting the car since it is expensive to book tours through the resort. We valeted the car everyday and found the valet staff exceptional and we never waited more than a few minutes for our car. The resort was breath taking and immaculate. The staff was beyond helpful. We ate at a La Parilla in Luquillo, which was recommended to us by the resort, and we loved the restaurant. We also ate at Antojitos, which is down the hill from the resort. The food there was good and the prices were reasonable. Both of my kids, who are 9 and 12, loved the resort. I would definitely return to this resort. ","annotations":[]}
