{"text":"Not worth the stay As other reviewers have mentioned, this is also my first review on a hotel and I had to do it so that people know what to expect if they reserve. I've been to several hotels in the Punta Cana \/ Bavaro area of different types and this is really the first time I've been disappointed with my stay. First off, we were in the VIP Club area which is supposed to be a step up from the main area of the Grand Paradise. I would say it's more like 2 giant steps down or more.1) The building we were in (#9) was finished only 3 weeks before our arrival and it's easy to tell that it was a rush to open. The paint was botched, the floor of the balcony isn't angled right so that the water can flow into the drain, the jacuzzi in one of our rooms was beautiful but didn't work, if you didn't take a shower at 7am, there was no way to get hot water until late at night, the remote control for the tv was a cheap universal one that you had to press the number of the channel you wanted to see because it wasn't fully adapted to that type of tv (of a brand I've never heard of), the floors in the hallways were a slip and slide show every time it rained because the water accumulated everywhere, and on and on.2) The gardening will eventually look nice but at that point they were still putting down the lawn and planting flowers and trees. It was very interesting to see haitians go by our window every 20 minutes and just happen to look in to see if they could get a glimpse of us. Same story in the pool, they just HAD to look at the women when they'd take off their shirts and shorts.3) The food on that side was at most ok. Most of the time it was almost cold and very bland and there wasn't much variety. I'm not a picky eater generally but I had a hard time finding stuff I liked. Several times there was no bread or juice left by the time we got down (8:00-8:30am). The juice was horrible but there wasn't any other option. The waiters did their best but there just weren't enough to go around. The first day we joked about having to set our table. By the third day, we were resigned. 4) The distance to cover from the new area to the beach is almost ridiculous. The whole property is located perpendicular to a small slice of beach of maybe 250m, easily less. Thank god there's a train that goes back and forth constantly or we would have had to take a 15-20 minute walk back and forth at least 4 times a day (down to the beach in the morning, back to change for dinner and back to have dinner) and we were of the lucky few that had their room next to the train stop. Other people had to walk almost 15 minutes just to get TO the train. Once you got to the old area, it was just too crowded. One employee commented that they were now up to 2000 rooms and I personally think it's just too much for the amount of space they have. People generally go to the Caribbean for the beach and there just isn't enough beach for everyone. At least there are quite a few pools spread out all over the old and new areas but it just isn't the same.I really could go on and on about my experience there but I think it's just enough to say that I've had much better vacations and no other worse than this one. It's too bad the owners are looking more at the $$ side of the business instead of offering a good quality service and experience.
