{"text":"Out of this world Wow! What an amazing start to a holidayMy partner and I booked a trip to Austalia and as the journey is a long one we decided to stop over in Singapore for a few nights.Not knowing what Singapore was like let alone the hotels we took a gamble and chose The Oriental Hotel - the pictures looked amazing on the website so we thought why not!We arrived and I must say the pictures were great but nothing compared to the real thing! On arrival our bags were taken to our room which was the Premier city suite, and we got shown round the hotel by the staff. The hotel is faultless, the decor is amazing and completley compliments what the hotel is offering. The swimming pool is amazing which also has a childs pool too. Our hotel room was amazing totally out of this world, the bathroom was huge, plenty of strorage and a lovely comfy bed. What was a nice surprise was that as we was on one of the suite floors we had complimentary breakfast and evening canapes, all of which was fantastic and on our very own floor!!! What I loved about the hotel was how friendly people were, very helpfull and always smiling - just what you want when you are on holiday. The hotel was very very clean and we felt like royalty!The choice of restaurants was brilliant to, there were plenty to choose from continental, japanese, tai, american etc. The hotel is very very close to the harbour and shopping malls and is a 5 minute taxi journy to the local markets and orchard road. I felt that Singapore was very cheap but if you want to spend big bucks then head to Orchard Rd where all the boutique shops are - if your looking for something traditional, a bargain or electrical items at a great price then head to the markets at china town! In my opinion the price of the Hotel was very cheap considering what you pay for a basic hotel in England what you get at the oriental is loads for your money. If your thinking about going here then I would definatley recommend booking one of the delux, or premier suites as breakfast is thrown in (but double check before booking) !Overall the hotel and the area was spot on - we will be definatley be returning to this hotel - 10 out of 10!
