{"text":"Very nice hotel Stayed for three nights √à√\u2020\u2022?Dec 14-17th. Booked on package with Eurostar √à√\u2020\u2022?Damn their move to St Pancras. For anyone coming up from the South of England it's a pain. Beautiful building, but not a patch on Waterloo for ease of use. A most user unfriendly place with lousy sign-age. Thank goodness the staff are obliging.Anyway, back to the hotel. Excellent location in the centre of the Opera district of Paris. However, taxi driver didn't know where it was. After many about turns, and reversing after going down a one way street the wrong way, he found it. (Not in the same league as London cabbies).Very welcoming and helpful English speaking staff. Size of room was average with fair sized wardrobe with built-in safe. Good sized dressing table with drawers for storage. Very comfortable bed, but only one armchair. Good range of international programmes on TV with speaker in bathroom.Very clean and well appointed bathroom, with bath, with fixed and hand held shower overhead. Good range of toiletries. Towels and sheets changed daily.Heating only by air conditioning unit. Very quiet, but if fan turned off, no heating. But with outdoor temperatures at around 0√ä?√ª c, rooms held heat well, except for our friends on the top (6th) floor. No kettle or welcome tray, but 24hr room service for light meals and snacks. The included continental breakfast arrangement was very nice, with a good range of food to choose from.The only problem, was a horrible smell on entering our room on the fifth floor. It was either the drains or the air-con. Not bad enough to spoil our stay, but would have asked for a change of room had we stayed any longer. To be fair, Paris can be a pretty smelly place anyway. I often wondered why Parisians are so keen on smoking fowl smelling cigarettes and eating so much garlic. It covers a multitude of sins.
