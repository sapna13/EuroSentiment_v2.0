{"text":"Good choice for Fisherman's Wharf We stayed at the HI-FW the weekend of August 8, 2008. We found the hotel to be a good choice for our trip. We were in the Main Building (the one with the front desk) at the corner of Levenworth and Bay. This location is located right in between Ghiardelli Square and Pier 39. About a 10 minute walk to either.We stayed on the business floor since we are Priority Club members. I was able to see both Alcatraz Island and the Golden Gate Bridge from my room, so that was cool. I believe it was room 565.There is a Walgreen's drug store one block from the hotel so that made stocking up on water and forgotten items easy and affordable. We did not rent a car and took taxi's or public transportation. The taxi from the airport (SFO) was $50 including a nice tip. A taxi to union square is $10 from the hotel. About $15 to the downtown financial district.We love the garlic crab at the Crab House on pier 39. We ate there twice. We went to a Giants game at ATT Park. We shopped at Union Square and Chinatown. All were fun.The Holiday Inn has 2 buildings. The one with the Denny's is about 1 block East of the Main Building. Both are well located to all the stuff in the area. We go to SF every couple of years and the Holiday Inn was comparable to the other chain hotels in FW. Some are a little closer to Pier 39 if that matters to you (5 minute walk instead of 10.) I recommend the Holiday Inn if staying in the FW area.
