{"text":"Very Very overrated OK, I TRULY do not understand the rave reviews at this site. As a diamond HH member we had to fight to get an obstructed view room on the executive level but that is not a big deal.This hotel is really very odd. It used to be an old police station that was transformed into a hotel. Yes, the rooms are larger than most of Paris' hotels but the rooms are odd at best. The food in the executive lounge (if you decide to stay there and pay more) is mediocre at best as well. The scrambled eggs are runny and the food is not good. It is also the same boring food every day. Again, for the money that you would spend at the executive lounge (if paying) just eat meals you want to eat out. I cannot understand for the life of me how this place has a 4 star rating! I stayed at the Le Grand Intercontinental last time and it was MUCH MUCH MUCH nicer and less expensive, better location, etc.While it is near the Arc de Triomphe, there are barely any other attractions nearby and extremely difficult to get directions from people as they are unaware of its bizarre location. This is a shabby-chic hotel and that is it! Nothing outrageous and extremely disappointing. While the staff is extremely nice for Paris' standards, we still had to wait about 5 hours for the room to be ready. The rooms are not as big as we expected and the bathroom was OK but again, nothing to write home about. I really cannot understand, for the life of me, the rave reviews of this place at all. Sorry to be a downer, and believe me, I am not a complainer but this was not a great hotel by any stretch of the imagination. ","annotations":[]}
