{"text":"great time overall! We just returned from Barcelo Bavaro Beach in Punta Cana for a five day girls getaway. It was a nice time overall. The hotel is older, but was clean and well taken care of. The grounds were nice and well maintained. The staff was nice and attentive, although they spoke little english. They tried and if they did not understand something, they got someone who could. The room was clean and the maid came daily. We left her some money at the beginning of the week, asking for extra beer daily. The fridge was always fully stocked. The room was a little musty, but the AC worked great. We had a leak in the ceiling from the AC, which often left a little puddle on the floor. It did not bother us, though...we just put a towel down and walked over it....It's the little things like that that didn't bug us....Some people may have requested a new room, but we did not care.It is nice to tip as much as possible, however I don't think it got us better service at the bars. The bars were always very busy. The drinks are a little light on the booze, but ask for extra rum, which they provided with no problem. Try the potent MAMAWANA...it's great. The beach was beautiful and there were always plenty of chairs. The pool was OK, but not nearly as nice as the Caribe and Palace pools. The massages on the beach are the BEST!!!! $25\/half hour and $50\/hour...The trains take you to the other hotels in the complex and they run often. The casino hotel seemed to have to most nightlife and more younger people. The show Tropicalissimo was awful and we left after 10 minutes....But, I must say, you can tell they work really hard at it and it was quite elaborate. The food was ok, nothing special. My friend is very picky and barely ate anything. I am not as picky and would eat just about anything....The buffet food was the worst, and many of the foods I could not even identify. The mexican rest. was ok. the steakhouse was the best and the service there was excellent. The takeaway pizza's are pretty good. Take the trip to Saona Island....It was amazing and lots of fun!!! It's worth the $65 bucks... Nothing beats a booze cruise on a catamaran with dancing and reggae music!!!! I was very afraid of this hotel because of the numerous nasty reviews....But, it was a nice place. I think people should not have high expectations because the place is not 5 star. I stayed at the Riu Taino the last time I went to Punta Cana and I think it was much nicer than Barcelo....Make sure you bring bug spray....you can't see them, but they will get you! Also, it's a good idea to bring some $1's for tipping and because no one seems to have change.
