{"text":"Outstanding small hotel Nelly Rolland runs a wonderful small hotel that is perfect for couples and single travelers. Our stay from May 5-12 was absolutely delightful and mirrors so many of the other reviews. Nelly, Isabelle and the rest of the staff are gracious and helpful. Our room (41) faced the courtyard and was adequate in size with a nice bathroom. Closet space is limited, but we don't pack huge amounts so it wasn't an issue.A few notes on the area. There is a small market called Shopi just a short distance away near the corner of Rue Pergolese and Avenue de Malakoff good for a bottle of water or wine and some snacks. A larger (very upscale) market can be found in the lower level of the Galerie Commerciale L'Atrium du Palais des Congres (just across from the Le Meridien hotel where the Air France bus stops). Very nice takeaway food. Even better is the market across from Bon Marche at the Sevres metro stop.We had dinner out at Le Petit Retro, a bistro recommended by Nelly, just off Place Victor Hugo; also at La Villa Corse, a Corsican restaurant on Avenue Malakoff (across from the Shopi market). We found both to be excellent; Villa Corse ended up being around 270 Euro for two, Le Petit Retro was half that.Porte Maillot metro station is large but less crowded than many and is also an RER stop. We found it easier to purchase our carnets (10 tickets for the metro) in the afternoon. The ticket windows were more crowded in the morning.For the Louvre, exit at the Palais Royal Musee du Louvre and follow the signs to the museum. You can connect directly to the lower level of the museum where the ticket kiosks are and avoid the lines outside (we bought our tickets in advance via the web and avoided the ticket queue as well).
