{"text":"Great! The resort was beautiful, a bit expensive but if you catch a good sale -its worth it. The restaurants, bars and spa on site are pricey, but you can save lots of money on the tours by renting a car! The rainforest (El Yunique) is a free tour but the hotel charges $38 per person to take you there. El Yunique is directely up the long mountain road from the hotel. The hotel also offers a tour to Old San Juan which is $45 per person but they dont take you to the El Morro fort, it only goes to the forts by the shopping area. If you rent a car you can go throughout the entire tourist area and just pay for parking (much cheaper). Also, there's a great outlet mall about 20 minutes away from the hotel. The conceirge is very helpful with maps and directions so if you decide to rent a car - getting around shouldnt be a problem. I suggest you rent from the Avis car rental located at the resort because they'll give you free parking, otherwise parking is $15 a day for outside rentals. Also there's 2 really good spanish restaurants at the corner of highway #3 where the resort entrance is (Don Pepe  Antoniette's) their prices are way cheaper than anything in the resort. Also there's KFC's, Burger King's and other fast food places you can get to (if you have a car).Be sure to keep all your receipts charged to your room and review your bill before paying room charges. If your traveling with kids - the hotel feeds the iguanna's at 11am everyday for free - join in! The kids club is a bit a rip off, unless u really need a babysitter. Find a local liquor store and add alcohol to ur drinks at the beach. The spa was ok - but I've had better for cheaper. Sign up for Wyndam By Request and get extra perks such as late check out, free room upgrades, discounts to use at the resort, free snacks upon check in etc.Overall the hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating. The grounds were well kept, the pool and beach were great. I would definately stay at this hotel again!
