{"text":"DO NOT STAY HERE Firstly I would like to say I am not the sort of person to complain or get mad about things going wrong but this place was a JOKE!At 7 am we arrived at the hotel after being assured we would have a room straight away. We were told by the reception staff that our room had been cancelled by the mysterious mr knowbody. we had booked for a Superior King non smoking room and we were informed that we could have either the non smoking room with 2 single beds in or a smoking room with one double bed. We opted for the smoking room due to us being a couple and after being reasured that it was well ventilated.We were then informed that this room would not be available until 2pm. So with out offering any facilities or complimentary refreshments for the inconvienence we were left to wonder around singapore at 7am in the morning after a 13 hour flight from manchester.... When we returned to the hotel we found our room was ready. except it had the most disgusting smell of ciggerette smoke. It was infact still hazey from the last guest. Oh yes and you could not swing a hamster let alone a Cat in that room.After several complaints and finger pointing from both Virgin and the Hotel we were offered the room with the two single beds AGAIN. What the hotel failed to grasp was no matter how many times they offered us the wrong room it would never be RIGHT, it would never be what we paid for. Eventually the offered to give us some air fresheners and a deodouriser (which never arrived).Eventually we just gave up complaining. It was a pointless exercise. There is nothing I can say good about this hotel appart from the day we left. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL! ","annotations":[]}
