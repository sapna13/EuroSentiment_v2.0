{"text":"Simply beautiful hotel....why so many complaints?!?!? Okay, so I read a bunch of the reviews before my stay and there was a good mix of negative and positive. I'm a pretty easy-going guy, so I wasn't too reluctant in booking at the Condado.The hotel is a really well-designed, chic, contemporary hotel similar to those you may see on South Beach. The pictures don't do it justice. It was everything I expected and more. While check-in was a bit long due to the long lines, who cares, you're on freakin vacation. RELAX!!Initially, my girlfriend and I had a room on the 2nd floor, but not being completely satisfied, we went to Edjardo at the front desk and within minutes, we were sent to a beautiful ocean-view room on the 8th floor. So only positive comments as far as the room goes. And the housekeeper did a wonderful job keeping the room clean.Regarding the other facilities, great pool (even though I don't swim) and there were never any issues trying to find a good beach chair to lounge in. And being the gambler that I am, I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the casino is (better than most other ones you'll find in Puerto Rico), but don't expect the glitz and glamor of a Las Vegas casino.As far as food, definitely try the Italian restaraunt. Breakfast and lunch were wonderful...the pancakes are HUGE, but really tasty. We never had dinner there, but I'm guessing it couldn't disappoint. If you feel like taking a short walk, about .25 miles to the left of the hotel is a restaurant called Ropa Vieja. Their chicken and beef is to die for.Overally, would I stay at the Condado Plaza again?? Unquestionably, YES!!
