{"text":"Great Hotel but Mediocre Beach 1. Staff. The staff was great especially Wesley he greeted us when we arrived and really made us feel welcomed. He also gave us some really helpful tips to help get the most out of our great trip to San Juan.2. Cleanliness. This might just be the cleanest and well maintained hotels that I have stayed in for quite sometime I was really impressed.3. Location. Located right in the middle of Condado, In just a short walk you have quite a few places to eat, grab a drink and even a Walgreens. On the weekends the street in front of the hotel shuts down and there are people everywhere with live music, bands and djs elegant and casual its great. Oh and bus stop is right in front of the hotel it was free for us due to elections but in any case its only 50cent a fraction of a cab and really almost as fast to Old San Juan.4. Beach. Well its clean the waters warm and the sand is soft but its a real treacherous place to swim with hard shore pounding waves and lots of body boarders. The beach lounge chairs are comfortable. If you don't like the sand the pool is relaxing and it even has a slide.5. Overall It gets 4 stars because the beach is not the best if your looking for the beach go to Isla Verde its much better but if you want to be near old San Juan but still enjoy the ocean this is a great place right in the middle of it all. FYI: If you are looking to rent a car walk up Ashford Ave a little past the La Concha Hotel to 1050 Ashford Ave Condado, Puerto Rico 00907 call [--]. Amazing service the counter manager really helped us out and gave us a great price about 1\/2 of what you would pay at the hotel and took care of our parking ticket too.
