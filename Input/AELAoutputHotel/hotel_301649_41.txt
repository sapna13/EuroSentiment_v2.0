{"text":"Legian lovely but boring!! We stayed in the legian for 9 night s at the end of august. The Hotel itself is fabulous, very classy, we stayed in a deluxe suite which i have to say was amazing. We had fantastic balcony with the seaview somewhat obstructed by a big tree but still lovely. Food is the hotel was very nice but ridiculously over priced seriously, reason for this i would imagine is because of the guests that stay there, in other words rich people apparantly models,fashion designers etc.who don't mind spending serious money, every day by the pool because their to lazy to venture out of the hotel to actually see bali but i suppose different strokes for different folks personally i understand the concept of a relaxing holiday but i like to get out and about seen as i paid so much money to get there in the first place but yes. Staff were fantastic waited on hand and foot, very polite fabulous manners. One major thing i would say is i thought there was absolutely no atmosphere in the hotel or poolside, really disappointing, everyone keeps to themselves basically no fun, which is always nice to have on your summer holiday, but we had great time on our own done the tours monkey forest a must , kudeta restaurant a must although bring your credit card cause its em pricey, bali itself wasn't that busy main reason is the bombs, peoplel afraid to come to bali but i'm sure in a year bali will be bustling with tourists again.My advice if you ever make a trustworthy contact in bali and want to go back to stay in the legian ask them to book it locally apparently its cheap in comparison to what you would pay booking from abroad. Anyways we had fantastic time would recommend bali to anyone. ","annotations":[]}
