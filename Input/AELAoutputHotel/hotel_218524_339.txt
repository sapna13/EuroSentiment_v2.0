{"text":"A bit disappointed Having just returned home from honeymoon at the Excellence Punta Cana, I have to say I was a bit disappointed. I'd read so many good reviews about the place, I'm not sure if perhaps their standards are slipping. The main areas of the hotel are stunning and the rooms are okay, but not as fantastic as they look on the website. We had ants all over ours. We asked them to get rid of them but in the end resorted to spraying our own room with bug repellent. Although the staff were very helpful and friendly during the first week, that definitely tailed off in our second week, glasses of wine at dinner took so long to arrive that we'd already finished eating! We thought the Asian and French restaurants were the best, some of the Italian was okay but left a lot to be desired.Drinks were good although make sure you ask for things which aren't on the cocktail menu because you'll get something much nicer. The pools are large and clean, as is the beach and it's not too hard to find a sun lounger. The sea is relatively rough so don't expect the stereotyped calm carribean waters and there didn't seem to be as many water sports on as is advertised on the website although the horse riding was very pleasant.Some of the guests were exceedingly ill, which appears to have been more common than we realised having just read another review for the same week as us. Although we weren't very ill we definitely had dodgy stomachs and still haven't recovered completely nearly a week on, and the bugs are evil!All in all, it was ok but not as good as we had hoped. The only major benefit is that it's child free!! ","annotations":[]}
