{"text":"Paradise Regained First of all I must admit that I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to stay at the Four Seasons in Sayan. Why? √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022\u2022ause its expensive, and being Scottish I like to get a bargain. However, my wife was determined to stay at one of the Bali Four Seasons during our honeymoon, so after shopping a round a little for a good price I booked us in for the last couple of nights of our trip. So let me say this now, in hindsight √à√\u2020\u2022?its expensive, yes, but worth every penny. The location, was, for us, perfect. Located in a river valley, surrounded by trees√à√\u2020\u2022?just gorgeous. The hotel itself is famous for its architecture, and while I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not much of a fan of modern architecture, I must admit I was very impressed by the Four Seasons in Sayan. I just loved the way that you arrive on the roof (nothing more than a lotus pond and a couple of benches overlooking the valley) and then descend into the hotel. We stayed in a suite room rather than a villa, which I think was a good decision. The suite was large and fabulously appointed. We had a nice suite at the Intercontinental Jimbaran Bay before coming here, but it had nothing on this place. I could have spent our whole stay here just lounging around our rooms. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ sure the villas are very nice, but wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ consider the extra expense unless I had kids and needed the space. Only one problem with the room √à√\u2020\u2022?bugs! There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a double set of sliding doors from the living room to a balcony (there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ also a bedroom balcony, too) and both doors close at the corner. Unfortunately the outer set of doors don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ close completely, so that sometimes you open the inner doors to discover some wee beasties who have snuck in. Not a serious problem, but as the hotel is in a jungle, they might have made sure that the doors actually keep the wildlife outside your room√à√\u2020\u2022? As for the hotel facilities, we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have time to use the spa\/gym, but they both looked very good. My wife and I both loved the twin level pool than follows the contours of the river and spent a very pleasant morning just lazing around beside it writing postcards and occasionally taking a dip. As you can expect, the food at the hotel was very expensive but also very good. We had one dinner at the Terrace Restaurant and my steak and wife√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ gnocchi were both absolutely incredible. The smaller, more informal restaurant next to the pool was also good as well as slightly better value for money. Of course, there are cheaper alternatives in town.This brings me on to another problem √à√\u2020\u2022?the hotels rather infrequent shuttle surface. Ubud is a great place to wander around √à√\u2020\u2022?full of shops, cafes, museums and art galleries, yet the hotel only runs a free service every two hours from 9 to 5. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not a problem getting back after this time (plenty of people offering √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??ransport! Transport!√à√\u2020\u2022? but I think the hotel should at least extend their service. Apart from this service at the hotel was top-notch. The staff were professional, yet friendly, and were attentive without making us uncomfortable, unlike in some of the other places we visited. On the last day I wanted to do some sightseeing, and the concierge was very knowledgeable about times\/distances\/places which was very helpful.  The Four Seasons Sayan has the reputation of being one of the best hotels in the world. Deserved? Absolutely. If I ever come back to Bali, this will be the place I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be staying.
