{"text":"Wonderful stay at Adiago! We stayed at Hotel Adagio for 1 week on vacation. We booked our stay through travelzoo.com and got a great rate. As soon as we arrived the staff was there to assist. We arrived 3hrs before check-in and they went above and beyond for us to get checked in early. Our room was very clean and updated. If you like more of a modern feel this place is for you. Our room was a king suite on the 11th floor. The hotel staff was very friendly and showed us all the ammenities in our room. Bed is very comfortable\/great linens. Air conditioning was available but was not needed. When you stay here please keep in mind that you are in the CITY. There will be street noise. Don't let other reviews you may have read make you think twice about staying here. TIP: at night we closed the windows and you couldn't hear a thing. Location is great, only 2 blocks from Union Square. There is also a Walgreens near the hotel. I recommend picking your snacks\/drinks up here for the room instead of paying the mini bar prices. There is also free coffee and paper in the mornings downstairs in the lobby. You can make coffee in the room with mini bar charges or go to the lobby for free. The doormen was so knowledgable about the city and helped us along our way every day. I would stay here again and again. Great value, Great customer service, Great location, Great Experience, hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
