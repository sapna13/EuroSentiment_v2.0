{"text":"looking for a bargain? cheap but go elsewhere barely adequate facility offset by friendly helpful staff - stay could have been unpleasant but you make the best of things and have fun anyway altho i would not reccommend going here. everything is VERY claustrophobic, they wouldn't honor the rate quoted me and charged $75 more because they hadn't sent me an email confirmation. (like i was supposed to know i needed it to be in an email?) Cats fighting under my window on the first night sounded like sombody torturing a kid. air conditioner had no temp setting, so it was either on or off. overhead fan had 5 speeds, starting at paper blowing speed and getting faster. inhouse bar restaurant was terrrible food. only people using it were newcomers who would only go once. Our Gyro didn't use fresh ingredients, greasy meat, stale pita bread and definately not prepared as advertised in the menu. unit kitchenette very bad. freezer didn't work, no micro, no toaster, only elec stove. utensils, pots, pans, etc all in a box under the sink. bathroom so small i had to sit sideways on the crapper or fit knees under the sink. sink has a shelf only twelve inches above it so whatever you do be it brush teeth, rinse face, etc becomes dificult and mirror is on wall behind toilet so shaving involves a lot of turning around to see whats going on. lots of steps with very narrow passage ways. pool is pretty in foto but i've seen bigger bathtubs and it only holds three people in the entire pool area. location not bad. not good, but not bad. no windows to speak of as they are louvered and topped by plants so neighbors can't see in. i talked to some neighbors and their unit was literally a cave beinbg under the pool overlook decking and they had only one window that couldn't be used, their stove burners didn't all work and when you opened their door it was dark and illumination was too feeble to make it in any way comfotable. their 80 yr old parents were in an upstairs unit which due to narrow steep stairs made their stay less than pleasant, etc etc etc. Bottom Line is pay the extra $30-$40 a night and go somewhere else where you can feel like a human being and have an enjoyable stay.
