{"text":"I enjoyed the stay very much Axel advertises itself as a gay hotel, and the clientele did seem to be mostly gay men (of all ages). However, it is in a quiet but very central location in the city, and the hotel is comfortable enough to suit most open-minded travellers. It is just 10-15 minutes' walk away from the main hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya, and there are quite a few gay bars and restaurants within one or two blocks of the hotel. The staff are also very friendly and helpful.Sure, I have to admit that the reception area seemed small and the decor at the entrance didn't grab my attention straight away. But the room was simply but stylishly furnished, and there were plenty of unusual and pleasantly surprising touches (such as the unlimited free bottles of chilled water on each floor, and complimentary packs of condoms among the designer toiletries in the bathroom!)The rooftop terrace seemed to be a focal point for many of the guests. There were a jacuzzi\/hot tub, a swimming pool, a small gym, sundeck, and a rooftop bar serving drinks and cocktails. On a nice summers day, it was very easy to meet and chat with other travellers, and the atmosphere was friendly and relaxed. On different nights of the week, there were various events and the rooftop bar became a stylish drinking venue for non-hotel-guests as well. The hotel also had a restaurant on the ground level, which other hotel guests highly recommended (although I didn't get to dine there).
