{"text":"Tranquil and Beautiful sums up the Bali Hyatt We stayed in the Bali Hyatt over Chinese New Year in February and loved it. The gardens are beautiful and resplendent with wonderful birds, squirrels, fish and lizards. It really seems to be a peaceful and natural spot. The rooms were up to standard in a 5* hotel, we had a big balcony and views over the gardens. The fruit bowl was replenished daily with lovely tropical friuts and complimentary water. The rooms were cleaned twice a day and towels replaced reguarly. Yes, the bathrooms are a little old and the toilet position a bit strange but clean and useable. The air-con was a little hot for us even on the lowest setting. We had a top floor room and never heard any noise from other rooms or guests. Everything we asked for in our booking was provided - connecting and non smoking rooms. We greatly enjoyed the Recency Club, with free daily tea and coffee and nibbles and cocktails from 5-7pm. The service in the club was wonderful and the ambience relaxing. Our boys enjoyed the food there and the drinks. The other restaurants in the hotel were good, we enjoyed the spectacular breakfasat buffet at the Wantilan Cafe, the Italian resturant and the Wednesday buffet evening meal with a traditional Balinese dance performance. The dance was very impressive! The restaurants outside are of course cheaper but beware the ones that use MSG in quantity in their cooking! The exception was the excellent Italian Restaurant 5 mins walk left as you turn out of the hotel. This served great food, at a good cost with no MSG - watch out for the impressive range of ice creams at the stand at the entrance. Our only slight gripe about the restaurants in the hotel (and the Italian up the road) were the small non-smoking areas. Being non-smokers we found the hotel and Bali in general had very few areas for non-smokers to enjoy fresh air. The Wantilan Cafe smoking tables were far better situated than the non-smoking tables and the hotel seemed to have loads of smoking guests when we were there. The hotel had good facilities, including the fabulous swimming pool areas and beach. We also enjoyed the badminton court and the bikes - cycling along the beach path was enjoyable and easy. Its a shame that the hotel imposes small charges on facilities, many other 5* hotels provide these for free. Try to get to the Waterbom park at Kuta (go by taxi) if you have children, they will love the water slides and book yourself a pagoda for the day to relax in with shade. We also enjoyed a tour to Lembongan island with Bali Hai tours and a look at the area around Ubud. We will certainly reurn to Bali, there is so much to do, but next time we will be sure to bring US DOLLARS as well as Rupiah as so much is charged in US $ and the exchange rate is much better at home than in Bali.
