{"text":"Great Place To Stay Very Clean And Excellent Service This place was great, hands down. The whole setup and aesthetic appeal of the hotel from the lobby, restaurant, bar, pool, and rooms were top notch. We especially liked the torches lit at night and how the lights were dimmed. What really impressed us was the great service and hospitality portrayed by the hotel staff, primarily the valet. They even let us borrow some body boards and floaty thing for my girlfriend. Directions were always offered whenever we took off somewhere also. The $25 dollar parking a day wasnt that bad considering parking prices all around waikiki. You did get to go in and out as much as you wanted throughout the day. A little background info:Our age group is between 21 - 24 as far as people who stayed and this review is pretty much coming from that age group's point of view. We stayed for 4 nights in the hotel with another group of our friends staying in a similar 1 bedroom suite 2 floors higher. The suite could comfortably sleep 4 people and was full of commodities that we wish we had at our previous hotel such as:free high speed internet, free local calls and mainland call for 15min. brand new furniture and appliances, spacious and modern bathroom, flat panel tv's and great distance to the strip of shops on waikiki. the continental breakfeast thing was kinda weak but we just used the vouchers for a bunch of bottled water and some iced coffee instead of buying at abc so that was ok denny's was across the street anyways. it also had this cool heated salt water pool that can be used and was also used by the spa for a type of treatment or something. it was so nice (94 degrees)...perfect for a night swim.If you are also interested in going to clubs and stuff like that it is literally 1 block away from Zanzabar and Fashion 45. We would hit up Ala Moana and Mai Tai bar usually in the evening and it was only a 5-10min drive. You can easily access h1 from the location as well.BOTTOM LINE. we really really loved this hotel and WILL stay again when i return in october. sorry for the lack of pics. ill try to upload some when i get back home from work!
