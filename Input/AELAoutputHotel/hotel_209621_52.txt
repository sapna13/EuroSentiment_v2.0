{"text":"Could've been better... What you need to know about PR:--definitely visit PR. beautiful island, great people, great food, rainforest is beautiful and visitor-friendly, caves are gorgeous. be prepared to spend money on (a) cabs and\/or (b) a rental car.On to the Normandie:--this is not a 3.5\/4 star hotel. --our stay was enjoyable, but this hotel (unlike the Caribe Hilton next door) is not a vacation\/getaway in and of itself. the pool is tiny, which didn't bother me as much as the fact that the surrounding sunbathing area is tiny as well. besides that, the entire pool area is basically in disrepair.--the hotel is not close to anything. the Caribe Hilton has a few restaurants, which is where we went to eat. Normandie restaurant is OK, but overpriced for the amount of food you get. At least at the Hilton, you are shelling out $$ but receiving a good portion of food in return. the service at both the Normandie and Caribe Hilton leaves something to be desired.--it will cost you $20\/RT to old san juan, and about $20\/RT to condado. a RT to isla verde will be between $30-$40. since there's a paucity of food options around the hotel, you may be cabbing it a whole lot.--the hotel abuts a tiny strip of public beach full of garbage, crabs, and local fishermen\/folks looking to blow some time. it's only about 20 feet long, and the tide is high enough at all times to prevent anyone from laying out there (not that you would want to, trust me).--the hotel is adjacent to a public beach called Escambron. it's about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. this isn't the pearl of the Caribbean or anything, but it's definitely a decent beach. it's usually populated with locals, and has some OK snorkeling (often little fishies would be swimming around our feet).--the staff at the Normandie is great. the doormen\/concierges were always very helpful, especially in booking tours. the housekeeping was also above average.--the following would've ensured the hotel's 3.5\/4 star rating in my eyes: a mirror in the hotel room (besides the one in the bathroom), the ability to open our windows, a decent poolside area, more food options, a better fridge, attention to detail (smudges all over the hotel, dirty furniture, etc.), a functioning bathroom sink, a balcony. we would walk over to the caribe hilton in the evening, buy a drink or dinner, and then walk around their beachfront facilities. i don't recommend trying to sneak into the pool during the daytime, they check for room keys.Overall:The Normandie is a pretty hotel; you can tell it once had a heyday. The staff is friendly, the room is a great size, and all of the furniture is super comfortable. Plus, at least at night, you can head over to the Hilton and enjoy a great dinner and an awesome beachfront and pier.However, if we could do PR again, we probably would not stay at the Normandie. We easily spent $150+ on cabs, and only visited the dingy pool area once. The hotel restaurant food was tasty, but badly overpriced for the portion size. No free continental breakfast, either. And the $14\/day municipal fee plus hotel tariff definitely didn't help.The Normandie was a decent base of operation from which we explored PR, but next time we'll go with a hotel that is oceanfront, with a nice pool area, and in the proximity of restaurants\/food\/stores\/local flavor.
