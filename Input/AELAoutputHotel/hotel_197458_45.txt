{"text":"Good value, great location I would not give this 5 but rather 4+...it falls in between above average and excellent. We had the deluxe room - the standard room is truly small. European rooms tend to be on the small side, coming from Amsterdam I should know; but the standard room - when we looked at it - was really TOO tight. That said, if you are there for a night or two, it would be ok. We stayed longer and therefore needed more space.The staff were lovely and polite - they assisted us in answering questions, provided us with loaned out umbrellas when the Paris weather wasn't cooperating, made reservations and were generally very polite and accomodating. The room was lovely and clean - with a great closet and a lovely modern bathroom. This place is for real lovers of minimalist and modern. The carpet - as pointed out by others - was in fact a bit worn. That is my only complained. The rest was very nice indeed. The location is great - tucked away on a side street just a stone's throw from the Arc, it has easy access to the metro (Argentine - 5 minutes walk at most). In any direction, it is a brief commute or walk and you are nearly anywhere you need to be. It's central without giving you the rushed feeling of being in the middle of the crowd.The food: don't know. Didn't try. But there is a GREAT boulangerie on the corner. They were lovely to us (and we don't speak of word of French, they spoke no\/very little English and the experience was still warm and friendly)...the breads, pastries and savory meals\/snacks were well priced and delicious. We didn't feel the need to attempt hotel fare when fresh baked goods were just next door!All in all, I would stay there again and certainly recommend it to others. It's pleasant, clean and well located. The price is very reasonable. A certain consideration if you want a trouble-free stay when visiting Paris.
