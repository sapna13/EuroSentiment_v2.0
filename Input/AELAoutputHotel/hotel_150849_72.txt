{"text":"Disappointed The trip was through Apple Vacations. I did not see any Apple reps there other then the guy at the bus. The flight down was decent, the flight attendants were all in to the Vacation spirit, telling jokes and having a grand ol'time. The airport was quick and the bus ride itself was nice. The 40 minute ride to the resort provided plenty of sight seeing and re-enforced why you should NOT attempt to leave the resort. There is a lot of bad news outside the gate. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Bright side's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* The beach was really nice. The Palm trees hid the resort.*Scuba Caribe- Provides lots of activities, take advantage of them, book kayaks and such in advance. We did the Speed Boat\/Snorkel Trip... NICE!*You have access to the Palace Pool. It is 10 X better then Bambu, we hung out there often. *Lots of European guests... not only do you get the Dominican feel but you get France, Germany, U.K. and Canada too.*Wendy's is located at the Resort with 7-8 USD Value meals. Taste Great after resort food!!!!*Heading Home****The Bad!****As for RIU Bambu - This was my first all-inclusive vacation so I was going in with high expectations. Sadly I was left down. The resort at first glance is nice, the lobby is clean and inviting. As for the room... well that left something to be desired. I understand that all the room is used for is basically to shower and sleep at a resort. The Room -Well the beds were rock hard, we had to acquire beach chair pads from around the pool to help soften the bed. The liquor bar was a neat idea, but the liquor was HORRIBLE! Beware, i found lots a broken glass on the sidewalk. PLEASE wear some sort of footwear.They provide you with a couple of bottled Pepsi's in the fridge, cherish these because anything you drink at the resort is horrible. You can't use the tap water for anything but a shower, they provide a gallon of purified water so you can brush your teeth and I guess to drink, it tasted NASTY! The soda fountains located through out the resort were usually room temp and flat. The same nasty alcohol in the room is served at the bar. The top shelf stuff was refilled. You might want to pick up a real bottle at the U.S. Duty Free before leaving.The Food - The Buffets, well... its up to you. The steak house\/Italian restaurant is the BUFFET during the day, (feels like a secondary school cafeteria.) The steak dinner was not all that great. The CARIBE grill was located at RIU Macao The atmosphere there was wonderful, but the food, DISAPPOINTING I am not getting into detail. ((Saw huge roaches walking around by the main bar in the middle of the resort, under soda fountain,and on the bar.))Money - Americans are basically ripped off. If you are USA and reading this, Don't forget the little things! Europeans make out. One example of cost - a standard bottle of Banana Boat SPF 15 Sunscreen costs $20 USD. Night Club - Forget It!
