{"text":"Good value if you book online We booked with a website called not 1 nite and we got the room for $130AUD per night.From reading the other reviews, it looks like they tell everyone the get a free upgrade as we were told the same thing as soon as we checked in. The hotel has some minor renovations happening at the moment but other than that, this is a fantastic place to stay in Sydney. The facilities are modern and the renovated rooms have all the mod cons that you would expect from a Sebel hotel. The only points that I was disappointed with were the expensive Internet connection in the room ($25 per day) and the quality of the food could be improved as well, the pizza was very poor and the desert came out of a frozen packet cake. The gym is a waste of time and has limited equipment in it. The treadmill sounded like is was being strangled to death and the there were only 6 different weights exercises available. Other than that the staff were very friendly and it is located right next to central station in Sydney which makes it easy to travel to on the train from the airport. It took us between 15 to 20 min to walk from the Citigate Sebel to Circular Quay and Darling Harbour so it is not far out of downtown Sydney at all. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and recommend that you make use of the pool, sauna and spa too for a night there.
