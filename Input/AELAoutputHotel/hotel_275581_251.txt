{"text":"Exceeded all expectations After much debate booked this hotel based on the reviews of this site and was sooooo pleased :)Booked via hotels own website couple of days before we went and got a great deal, was offered club city room and breakfast for √ä√£¬¢109 per room per night or a suite for √ä√£¬¢175 per night, decided as it was a treat to book the suite.Entrance to hotel spotlessly clean, well staffed.Suite (as is all suites) was on the 12th floor, dining area, settee, bedroom with massive king size bed and large bathroom with powershower and bathtub.Booking the suite entitles all to VIP service and boy were we spoilt. Quick checkin, escort to room, room service (change of towels etc) twice a day and personal link on the telephone to answer all enquiries.Room was spotless, very clean , bright and bed comfortable. 2 LCD screens, cd player,etc. free newpaper per day, bowl of fruit, bottle of water and full english breakfast included in the price.fantast floor to ceiling windows and brilliant view from room.Room service was great and quick to respond.I have stayed in many hotels and never have i come across so efficient , friendly staff. They certainly made an enjoyable stay.The food was a bit expensive and ltd choice in the restaurant, however didnt think the drinks both in the restaurant or in the hotels additional lounge were to dear based on london prices.Only downside was the full (free) english breakfast, had to queue a bit to get seated, meal wasnt too hot and goodness knows what the sausages were made of ! but otherwise a fantastic stay.10 minute walk to nearest tube, pimlico station, then easy access to anywhere in london, we went to the 02 and with the walk to the station it took us just dead on 40 mins.getting the tube to oxford street for the shopping and theatre, took us 25 minsBus stop couple of minutes, right by the tate gallery :)quiet area, 5 mins to see thames , not far from the london eye.cant recommend this hotel more :) go and i hope you have as good as time as us!
