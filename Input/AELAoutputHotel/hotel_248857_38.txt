{"text":"5 star service, excellent hotel Two friends and I are just back from a wonderful stay in the Mandala Hotel. If you want to get away to relax this it place to go, so much so that my friends and I started referring to it as our oasis of calm. Although this Hotel does not have a big lobby it is very tastefully decorated and the suite we had was more like an apartment with bedroom, two bathrooms, a kitchenette, study\/seating area and Balcony. Everything was spotlessly clean and our rooms were made up to perfection everyday. Its also in a great location, the Sony Centre is across the road and its right next to the Potsdamer Platz S Bahn and U Bahn Stations. There is also a shopping centre at the back of the Hotel.I've read some of the previous reviews about the staff being unfriendly, i cant believe it, they were more than lovely to us. They organised a birthday cake for my friend's birthday, gave us a free bottle of champaign, advised us about where best to go out in Berlin, gave us umbrellas for the rain, gave us dvd's to watch in our room. They greeted us and waved us goodbye everytime we went in and out of the Hotel. The service was second to none. By the third day they new all our names and on our last night we got complementary glasses of champaign at the bar.We ate in the restaurant twice, once for breakfast, which was amazing and once at the Michelin star restaurant Facil which was out of this world. I've eaten in a lot of restaurants and never experienced service or food like it.I cannot recommend this Hotel highly enough, we were very sad to leave and will definitely be returning to our Oasis of Calm!
