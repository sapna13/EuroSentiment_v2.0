{"text":"Very Nice and Enjoyable - But Forget the restaurant MAC 24\/7 This is a very nice Hotel right in the heart of Waikiki, and one of the best i have ever stayed at and certainly one of the best in Waikiki, the rooms are unbelievably modern and looks like they have been recently renovated with awesome Plasma TVs and those very comfortable Hilton Beds and pillows. The Pool on Level 10 is great, and we spent many an afternoon relaxing by the pool and sitting in the heated spa, there is a bar by the pool also, both pool and beach towels are provided free. On the same trip and prior to this Hotel we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village resort and Spa but split up our accommodation so we could be closer to Waikiki Beach and this hotel was perfect, with just a 2 min walk you are right on the beach.The only negative I have about the Hotel is the restaurant called MAC 24\/7 which is located on the premises, if you want good food and service totally forget it and go to another restaurant on the main drag, we had the worst service experience we have ever had in this restaurant. Would you wait 45 mins to be served by a waiter who constantly ignored you?, and then when your food was ready you watch it be left on the bar to go cold and be picked at and played with by the children off another table., only to be delivered to your table with a here you go sorry about the wait. When we complained and said we wanted another meal the, waiter wanted nothing more to do with us, and we had to complain to the chef behind the bar who had to quickly make another meal, and excused the waiter as having trouble coping with the large area he had to wait on, this was total bull we watched him chat with Asian guests for 20 mins when he could have been serving our food . Yes we will remember the MAC247as having worst waiter we have ever come across. No apology from the Manager either.We cannot believe that a Hilton Hotel would have such a terrible restaurant associated with it. Excellent alternatives to this restaurant are Dukes at the Outrigger Waikiki Hotel, beautiful and right on the beach, The Cheeseburgers Cafe, The Oceanarium an undersea Buffet . But what Ever you do don't eat at the MAC 247 at the Hilton Prince Kuhio, or if you do set your watch, and keep an eye on your food, they may serve up something that is stone cold and has been fingered by a bunch of kids.All in all a great Hotel - But terrible restaurant.
