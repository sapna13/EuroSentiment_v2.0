{"text":"A very good all-inclusive resort My wife, 18-year old daughter, and I just returned from a week at the Iberostar Bavaro. Our experience was very good. The grounds and the beach are beautiful and VERY clean. The staff was excellent, everyone was friendly and helpful. The food was good, but not great. I would put it a notch below good cruise ship cuisine. But you can still eat well there. We found the Steakhouse and the Japanese restaurants to be quite decent. The regular buffet has a wide range of choices. We especially liked Dominican night when they served grilled giant prawns.Here's what we found to be the pro's and con's:Pro's - Beautiful and clean grounds, nice rooms, great staff, lots of available activities, good (but not great) food.Con's - Mattress was terrible (but a few after-dinner drinks solved that problem), the exercise facility is an open-air building; try working out at 90F and high humidity, the free catamarans were in rough shape so we ended purchasing the optional damage insurance for $15 since we didn't want to get hit with their inflated damage costs if something broke. One final note. Some previous reviewers on TripAdvisor reported having intestinal problems. We didn't hear anything about illness during our stay. You can drink the water served at meals and the icecubes in drinks are also OK, but do NOT drink the tap water in the rooms. We just brushed our teeth using bottled water from the mini-fridge, which was refilled every day.
