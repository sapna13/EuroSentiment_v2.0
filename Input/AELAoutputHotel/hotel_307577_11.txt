{"text":"Bali Bliss We have just arrived back from a most enjoyable 3 week stay at the Puri Santrian. We booked a Club Room and were happy with the room and location of it. Some aspects of room were dated and yes could be freshend up but it was kept lovely and clean - fresh bed linen daily and fresh towels twice daily. The Hotel Gardens are beautiful and this hotel has a much friendlier feel than the Bali Hyatt which we stayed at last year (we paid a return visit there on at least 3 occasions this time and were so glad we had chosen the Puri). Hotel spray the grounds 3 times weekly to prevent infestation of insects ie mozzies and flies and it worked! Arround the Club pool area, limited sun loungers\/shades which was a slight irritation. It was annoying to see some secured but not used for hours although pool staff are happy to remove after 30 minutes upon request. All staff were friendly and always acknowledged your presence. Food was good and worth the extra expense but menu was limited - there are plenty of cheaper restaurants close by to choose from too. Breakfast was plentiful with a good choice. The pool bar was okay but not used enough and there was no music (even low key) to entice anyone to use it and it does lack in this area.The Village Restaurant (Italian)is excellent. Caramels which is almost next door to the hotel on the right but set back from the road,is another high class restaurant with a fusion menu. There is something for everybody foodwise.Balinese night at the hotel was good for the entertainment but the food was not so good (banquet) and not worth the money paid. The Spa in comparison to the beach is more expensive but it is so luxurious and you will truly feel pampered. Waka Land Tour by landrover is a must, it was fantastic, well worth going on with the final destination being a trip to the jungle restaurant which was an absolute joy!!! Countryside seen on this tour was fantastic and the guide does give an insight into the history of Bali. Very accommodating and would stop to allow photographs over and above their pre selected vistas. A visit to the volcano and mountain lakes are worth viewing but spoiled by the street hawkers who are 'determined' to say the least but this must be said for the whole region of Sanur too. You can't take a step outside the hotel but they are shoving the obligatory holiday tat\/trips\/taxis in your face - constantly!! Everyone has to make a living but it is off putting. Remember to haggle for everything - they will up their prices (especially taxis unless metered) more so before you have a 'holiday tan'!All in all it is a great hotel and met with our expectations, the weather was fabulous and we met some lovely people - remember Club rooms do not permit children - hindrance or bliss - you decide!!!
