{"text":"Had a great time Just back from a week All Inc at this hotel. The hotel itself was lovely. the Beach beautiful. 3 pools to choose from catering for all tastes eg. one with full entertainment for the more energetic, one quiet and relaxing, one just rather small!The evening entertainment was really aimed at the under 14 age group and there is limited tabled seating (only 3 tables which would give you a view of the stage the rest is just chairs in rows in front of the stage)- shame as even cheesey entertainment i can enjoy but would always want a table to put my drink on!The room was always clean. We liked the fact that the maid didn't arrive until early afternoon as this meant we didn't have to rush out in the mornings like you do in some hotels.Food - fine if you're there for just a week. Any longer than that and you may get bored. This isn't due to the lack of variety as there is plenty there, it's just that with so many cultures visiting there is often only a few things you would be prepared to eat yourself. I like to try foods from different cultures but very little actually appealed.No children around as far as we saw, age range seemed to be mainly 20-40.We didn't come across any rude staff, and when our air con unit started dripping the engineer appeared within 5 mins of phoning reception.Even tho the above may sound negative we still had a really good time as all we were after was a week relaxing in the sun which is exactly what we got. I'd definately recommend it if that's all your after. ","annotations":[]}
