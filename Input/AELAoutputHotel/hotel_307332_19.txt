{"text":"Great hotel in excellent location Just completed a two night stay at the Dai-ichi Hotel. It is an easy walk from Shimbashi station. We reserved a premium floor room which was located on the 20th floor of the hotel. The main reason we selected this was to be on a high floor and avoid any train noise. The room was quiet, although during peak hours you could hear the trains (but minimal sound).The room was large with two twin beds pushed together as a king, bedside tables, two chairs with a table between them, desk and chest of drawers. The bathroom was large with shower (with shower massage), heated toiletseat with bidet and shower, and very large vanity, but single sink. The air condition\/ventiation system worked well. The room was equipped with in room safe, hot water for coffee\/tea service and a minibar. The linens were very comfortable (down comforter). We had great service from the hotel. We advised them of our late arrival, and when we reached our room, it was already outfitted with ice in the icebucket and the hot pot was already heated with hot water for tea or coffee.Our room rate included full breakfast, but we left the hotel too early one morning for the full breakfast (it is only available after 7 am). On that morning, we had a continental breakfast in the coffee shop . The other morning, we had the full breakfast delivered by room service (no extra charge), and it was everything we could have wanted and was delivered promptly at 7 am.The front desk, bell stand and concierge were all helpful. The concierge spoke and understood English quite well; the front desk staff was less experienced, but adequate. We went to one of the hotel's restaurant for dinner one night and enjoyed both the food and the view from the top of the hotel. We had our welcome drinks in the lobby bar. It seemed expensive to us and smoking was allowed. So, if we had any negative views, it would be of the lobby bar.In all, an excellent choice in a great location and we would stay there again. Reserving directly through the hotel was less expensive than any of the on line brokers.
