{"text":"Fantasy Island My wife and I just returned fron our dream vacation (Feb23-29) at Excellence Punta Cana. Everything we wished for and more was experienced.  Upon arrival at the beautiful,clean PUJ airport we found it to be calm and organized with a delightful breeze blowing throughout the building. It did not take us long to clear customs and get our luggage. Once outside we found our bus that would take us to the hotel. The ride took us about an hour and was quite bumpy on some sections of the road, but we enjoyed it and it became a sight seeing tour. We drove through a few small towns and saw what dwellings most people lived in. A real culture lesson.  When we arrived at the hotel we received a cool towel and glass of champagne. Check in was very smooth. We asked the desk clerk for an upgrade from our garden view room to a pool view. We were very happy to be accomadated and he graciously accepted our tip.  Our room in building #6 was beautiful ,clean,and spacious with a balcony overlooking the huge pool and swim up bar. SPLENDID!!!!!!  The refrig was stocked everyday with plenty of beer, water, and soda. Also a bottle of champagne and wine on ocassion.  There was a nice mix of guests all ages mostly from Canada, America and some Europeans.  The grounds, pools and beach were all kept immaculate. No seaweed at all on the soft sandy beach. The ocean's water was gorgeous and crystal clear. We enjoyed the sound of the waves crashing on the shore. A refreshing breeze off the ocean made sunbathing comfortable. There was no problem claiming a lounge chair if you were out on the beach by 10:30a.m. We also found plenty of towels located on various racks by pools and beach.  The weather was excellent mostly sunny everyday with some brief passing clouds that were welcome. The temperature was in the low 80's during the day and the low70's at night. Only a brief shower one day. We choose not to use our AC, we chose to open the balcony door and let in the ocean's refreshing breeze. There were no bugs or flies to speak of.  The food was very good with a variety to pick from. It would be impossible not to find something you did not like. Breakfast was either sit down at the Lobster House or buffet style at the Toscana.  At lunch time you could eat inside at The Grill or at the beach where there were specials of the day.Such things as hamburgers, chicken, hot dogs and local specialities prepared on the beach. Individuals pizzas were also passed out on the beach.  There were many varieties of restaurants for dinner. We had no problems getting served quickly and most meals were delicious.  The entertainment each night was very enjoyable. Something that all ages could find entertaining. Many bars were open with great tasting drinks made to your liking. Beach service was unbelievable with beach specials served each day. We found the best bar to be Cafe Kafe. Hats off to Pedro for his special efforts. Yeah 'Sammy Sosa(drink).  Most help was very friendly and appreciated a well deserved tip  We will most definatley return for another dream vacation at Excellence on this Fantasy Island.
