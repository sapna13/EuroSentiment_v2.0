{"text":"Nice Room and Hot Breakfast! Stayed at the Residence Inn Lake Union for one night on 10\/27. I was lucky to get the rate of $60 through Priceline. With taxes and fees it came to $76.45\/night. Check in was quick and easy. The front desk people were all very nice and pleasant. Self Parking is an additional $20.69\/day (this includes sales tax). I didn't want to waste time looking for street parking. There is a separate garage for SUV\/Trucks and sedans. We had a mini-van so we parked in the SUV\/Trucks garage. Parking stalls in the garage seemed small. So, I can't imagine what the stalls in the sedan parking lot look like! At least the parking lot felt safe and secure as you needed a key to get into the garage. The room itself was spacious. I had a one bedroom with a king bed. Small kitchen with full-size refrigerator, stove, and microwave. The bathroom was a little on the smaller side, but it was OK. The bathroom sink was separated from the shower and tub and there was plenty of counter space. There were two TVs, one in the living area and one in the bedroom. The free internet worked and we didn't have any problems getting a connection.I could smell the hot breakfast in the morning from my room so I knew it was time to get up! There was a wide variety from bagels, toast, eggs, sausage, yogurt, cereal, fresh belgian waffles, etc. All in all, a very nice stay at the Residence Inn and I would definitely stay here again.
