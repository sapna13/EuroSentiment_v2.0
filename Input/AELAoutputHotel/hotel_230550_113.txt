{"text":"Great Hotel! Stayed here for three nights as the first part of our trip around northern Germany. If you are flying into Schonefeld airport, it is very easy to get to as the S-Bahn goes directly from Flughafen Schonefeld station to Alexanderplatz station in half an hour. Upon arrival, it was only a five minute walk to the hotel from the station, just going round the huge Galeria Kaufhof shopping centre. Check in was easy and efficient and the hotel in general looked very clean and modern. The rooms were the same. Although they were quite small by comparison to other hotels, they were extremely clean and modern, with satellite tv, a minibar and a safe. The bathroom was open plan, however, with only a curtain covering the washing and bath area, so i'd recommend staying somewhere else if you're not staying with friends or family. The hotel was also linked to the shopping centre, making it very easy to get anything you needed, for example, for breakfast in case like us, you were on a room only basis. The station, being only a stone throw away, meant that you were only ten minutes away from most of Berlin's central tourist sights and a mere five minute walk to the huge 368m televison tower along with Alexanderplatz's bars and restaurants. The casino on the 37th floor requires you to register with your passport and to wear formal clothes (ie. a jacket and tie), but besides that, all the hotel's facilities are fine to use and I hear the breakfst is good too, although for us it was a little too expensive at 16 euros each. Overall, I think it was a hotel of outstanding value, given its cost of 97 euros a night for a double and its very convenient location! I would stay there again. ","annotations":[]}
