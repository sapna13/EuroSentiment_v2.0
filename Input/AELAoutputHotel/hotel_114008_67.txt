{"text":"nice but not 5 stars and not worth the price my wife and 2 year old stayed for 6 nights. lovely beach and nice heated pool. Saw Tony soprano there and apparently the prince of monaco was also there at the same time. We are not overly picky people but certainly for the price we paid we expected better even from a 1 or 2 star hotel. The cons are as follows:1) ongoing construction noise from noon to 5 pm, this can be heard in the rooms and around the pool and beach areas, it was absolutely BRUTAL. Forget letting the young ones have an afternoon nap. After complaining they promptly sent us to an ocean front room on a higher floor where the noise was slightly less appreciable. Seriously though, I've stayed at 60 dollar a night hotels in mexico that didn't have this degree of freaking distraction.2) the rooms are tird in appearance needs updating, hence the noise but give me a break shut down the hotel for a few weeks. Did they want to get Whacked by Tony Soprano.Anyhow, we then progressed to Turtle bay resort for 6 nights which was awesome and only at half the price. Anyways, stay at the Kahala if you are deaf or want to spot celebrities and have nothing better to spend your money on. I would not go there again simply because of their screwed up philosophy of service with the choice to disturb guests that pay a handsome sum to stay there. Also at breakfast they did not wash the grapes properly and after taking a few bites I noticed a bunch of lovely spider webs in the cluster, good thing I am arachnophobic. Come on even Wendy's washes their salads.I've stayed at the Westin in Maui, Fairmont Orchid on the Big Island, Turtle bay on the north shore, Kahala was the worst of the bunch of premium hotels.
