{"text":"Mostly good but some problems I have read so many of these reviews prior to my trip that I feel somewhat compelled to write one myself. First of all, I was impressed right from the time of my arrival. Catching the bus at the airport was really easy and we were checked in right on the bus. Unfortunately, because we had an early arrival (we were at the hotel by 11 am) we needed to wait until 3 pm in order to check in. Since we already had received our bracelets on the bus we were able to eat, swim and access any of the bars when we arrived but before we could access our room. You should pack a bathing suit and sun screen in your carry on bag as you will not be able to access the contents of your suitcase until you get to your room. Speaking of sunscreen- pack a lot! My husband and I went through 3 bottles in a week- they sell it at the resort for $20 US a bottle. The sun is extremely strong and you'll need lots of protection.The rooms were fine, better to be on the 2nd or 3rd floor as there is more privacy. We had to switch rooms halfway through the trip as some one who moved in next door was a heavy smoker and the smoke goes through the vents. Our room was engulfed in cigarette smoke every time they lit up, and was so bad that it actually woke us in the middle of the night.. If you are a non- smoker, there is very little escape in this resort. Without exaggeration, 80-90% of the guests were smokers and smoking is permitted everywhere. People were smoking in the restaurants, on the trolley, every in the pool. I found this to be the worst part of the trip. Most of the guests were spanish speaking and they clearly smoke a lot more than Canadians. Speaking of Spanish- you may want to brush up on some basic Soanish phrases as you will find it challenging to communicate without it.The food was not great. The French and Garden Grill restaurants were great. The seafood restaurant was HORRIBLE- I took one bite of my lobster and had to leave, it was putrid. The Japanese restaurant was also pretty bad but was great for meeting people. The buffet was alright but we got sick of it pretty quick. It was pretty much the same food day in and day out. There are no places to get a snack ie chips, crackers etc while there and I wished we had packed some. If you are hungry at 4 pm your can have pizza or chicken- both of which you will be sick of- pack some snacks- you'll thank me for it!Bring lots of $1 bills to tip- you'll be happy you did. The service is amazing if you tip- We got lovely decorations in our room, bubble baths drawn for us etc. and our fridge was full of the specific drinks we requested. Also if you tip the waitresses at the lobby bar (which is the best bar- they make the best drinks!) they will be like glue to you, always refilling your drink order.I don't think we would go back, but for the price, it was a great vacation...
