{"text":"A wonderful place to stay! My son and I stayed at this hotel on the left bank for a week during his spring break from school. We felt as though we had found the secret to a wonderful, comfortable, and friendly stay in Paris. This hotel has a first class location just over a block from the Pont Neuf on Rue Dauphine, within easy walking distance to the Louvre, Saint Chappelle, Notre Dame and, in the other direction, the main shopping district of St. Germain du Pres and the Luxembourg Gardens. The nearby Metro stop is convenient, just one stop away from Musee d'Orsay (though the Musee d'Orsay also is an easy 10-15 minute walk) and, best of all, is on the main line for the train to Versailles (we went twice). On a sunny day, we walked all the way up to the end of the Champs Elysee and the Arc de Triomphe but it was a bit of a hike. Our rooms, which were the smaller, less expensive rooms on the front side facing the street, were clean, comfortable, cozy and quiet with pristine baths, plenty of hot water and fluffy towels. Each room had a working desk, a sofa or easy chair and a tv with BBC and CNN as the English channels. The front desk is incredibly helpful, particularly with dinner reservations and tips on where to go and we found the service to be first rate -- from the front desk to the breakfast room, housekeeping and the bar. The breakfast is just wonderful and while it seemed expensive given the fall of the dollar, it really is a great value for the price (eggs, oatmeal, fresh fruit, croissants, pastries, etc.). Good coffee and hot chocolate too. There are a number of terrific restaurants within easy walking distance - we especially liked Les Bouquinistes which is a Guy Savoy restaurant 2 blocks away toward the Seine and a cafe called Cafe Atlas about 2 blocks in the other direction. The hotel has a jazz concert in the bar every afternoon and there is internet access from a computer in the bar and another computer off a nook toward the back. An altogether pleasant and thoroughly satisfactory stay.
