{"text":"Excellent in Every Way Normally stay at the Crescent Court when traveling to Dallas on Business, but this trip stayed at the Zaza and LOVED it!!!!The room was huge, full size sofa and oversized chair, large desk, big LG flat screen TV, very comfortable bed, big bathroom and wonderful shower. I travel alot for business, and generally miss my shower at home since I designed it - this is the closest I have come to matching the experience of showering at home - the shower was really big, great water pressure, bench to sit on while shaving, alcove to place coffee, razor, soap, shampoos, etc. and a really cool frosted glass window to the living area of the room with sayings etched on it. I loved it!!!! And yes, I like to sip on my coffee while in the shower in the morning or perhaps a beer or some wine in the evening :)The service was prompt and friendly from the valet, bellman, front desk and room service. During turn down service, they light tea candles in the room - very nice touch.One of the other touches that I really appreciated is the coffee station set up near the elevators. In the morning, you can run down the hall and get coffee or tea, very convenient and the coffee was fresh and good. In the evening there were cookies and I think iced tea, didn't sample any of that but again, just another nice touch at the property.Only had breakfast there and it was great - love steel cut oatmeal and the fruit platter was one of the best I've received at a hotel, better than the Ritz Carlton or the Crescent.Obviously, you can tell I loved this hotel, and I will be staying here from now on when traveling to my Dallas office.
