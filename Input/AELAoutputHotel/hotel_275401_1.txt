{"text":"Pricey, upscale hostel This hotel gave us a place to leave our luggage, shower (sort of), and sleep overnight while we explored the city for 2 days, but not much more than that. The positives of this hotel are that 1) the room had adequate space to accomodate 3 adults and a baby, with a sofa bed and two twin beds that were easily pushed together; 2) it is about a 7 minute walk to the Overamstel metro station (the stop is only 10 minutes to Centraal Station); 3) parking at the hotel is free; and 4) free wireless Internet access if you have your own laptop. The negatives are 1) the broken showerhead that leaked and sprayed water all over the bathroom floor, but not so much in the tub; 2) the dirty towels from the previous guest(s) that were left on the bathroom floor (which we informed the reception desk about on our way out to sightsee and still found when we got back 7 hours later); 3) the disgusting, visibly stained bed covers and carpeting; and 4) the lack of soundproofing which made every passing train from the tracks across the street and car on the nearby highway audible. The gas station, which is literally at the hotel's front doorstep, is convenient, but adds nothing to the hotel's external aesthetic. The security measures (key card access to rooms, elevators, garage, and the front door after dark) were appropriate given the hotel's location, which is outside the main downtown area and somewhat industrial.
