{"text":"Excellent Stay at the HOJO After having a nightmare of a situation at another resort hotel and having to find a place to stay during high tourist season. I called the Howard Johnson's and asked if there was availability for check-in the next day. For 5 nights we paid about 700 dollars including taxes. We were pleasantly surprised with the Marble pillars and elegant floors for a budget hotel. The pool was pretty good too. They gave us early check-in and showed us to our room. The rooms are the size of a standard hotel room...but we had a view of the beach from our room on the third floor across the street. It was a very clean room with a working refrigerator. The staff was wonderful. They are truly appreciative of your business. They arranged for us to do the Camuy Cave tour with one company (Hector was great!!). Then we did the Rainforest tour and Loquillo Beach with another company. Next door is a 7-11 and a Walgreens down the block...but if you head in the other direction about 1\/4 of a mile (the walk wasn't bad) there is a grocery store, Grande. I was travelling with my husband and 2 kids (2, 7) and I was able to get their snacks and juices and milk at the store. The hotel will recommend a seafood restaurant that is a block away...we went for lunch since we had the kids...the food was amazing. There is also a number of other restaurants within walking distance.At least once have breakfast at the restaurant on the top floor...the view is amazing and the service is great.The public bus stops right in front of the hotel. We took a cab to Old San Juan and a bus back...15 dollars there and 50 per person back.Our vacation could have easily been ruined by the issues at the other place...but Howard Johnson made it all better...for the service and value, I would definitely go again.
