{"text":"Had a wonderful time We stood in the Intercontinental from May 3 - May 7. We booked through beachdestination.com and had a great price. Arrived at the hotel at 2pm and was given a room right away. Even though check in was at 4 pm. Room was your average room not that impressive. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. I stood with my husband and 2 year old daughter. I read some reviews about the pool and the lounge chairs. I had no problem getting lounge chairs at all. I feel sorry for guest that dont know the area and dont know where to go for food b\/c it can be very expensive. A hot dog and fries for my daughter by the pool was $12. We went to the mini market accross the street and stocked up goodies for my daughter. The mall accroos the street has a restaurant called Mi casita and they had a great breakfast ( service can be a tad slow) we were going there everyday for breakfast 3 orders of eggs, home fries and panakes with juice and cofee $21 with tip. Better than the continental breakfast at the hotel which was 20 pp. We had dinner at truth steak house one nigt at the hotel. I was not impressed. being from New York and having great steak house here, thougth it was over price and not that great. Over all for the right price I will stay at this hotel again. The rooms were clean and service was good ","annotations":[{"endOffset":600,"mention":"hot dog","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hot_dog"],"startOffset":593},{"endOffset":610,"mention":"fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":605},{"endOffset":927,"mention":"fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":922}]}
