{"text":"a gem of a hotel My husband and I checked into the Hilton Hotel, a recommendation of a friend, but quickly checked out because of old-fashioned decor and its distance from all of the fun things to do in Barcelona. We got on the internet and reviewed our notes, quickly called the Claris and were lucky to find availability at a very good rate for our 8 day stay.We are experienced travelers and enjoy staying in 4 and 5 star resorts wherever we go. From our first phone call to check-out, we were treated like VIP'S by Ricardo and his staff. We found the Claris to be a charming boutique hotel only a few blocks from the Ramblis. It is convenient to exciting areas, very friendly and quiet. The suites are like little apartments but with no kitchen, and we preferred the floor plan that was all on one floor because it felt more spacious, rather than the floor plan where the sitting area was a loft.We were thrilled with the help and recommendations given to us by Victoria, their Guest Relations Person. We had some of the very best meals we have ever had thanks to her suggestions (we don't like fish or meat...so eating in Spain was a bit of a challenge for us). We HIGHLY recommend the Ming Dynasty for delicious Chinese, Bembi for perfectly seasoned and beautifully presented Indian and the magnificently appointed Thai Gardens. I must add that the breakfasts at the Claris were extremely satisfying and pleasantly served.We also enjoyed hanging out at the Magestic Hotel (down the street) for its piano bar and roof-top refreshments and view. It is a bit pricey, but it gave us the lounge experience that the Claris was lacking.We look forward to returning to the Claris!
