{"text":"Wonderful Trip For All We were in Punta Cana from Feb 20th to the 27th. When we landed the Apple rep was very helpful and got us and our luggage to the bus rather quickly. Once we got to the hotel we checked in and our daughter in law immediately made our 3 restaurant reservations for the steak house, Japanese and Mediterranean. We also tried the Cajun which I liked the best. Yes the buffet had some interesting food however; for the most part the food was good and plenty of it. I ordered a bandy old fashion which I explained in full detailed and received a fluorescent blue drink. The beach was beautiful, so was the weather. My husband and I highly recommend the Outback Safari tour. It really gives you a better picture on how the real Dominican people live. Yes there are topless women at the beach but this lends to the fact of the many cultures vacationing at the hotel. We met many wonderful people and participated in the daily challenges, arm wrestling, and beer drinking and daily bingo. My Son won both of the above. The grounds were beautiful and the rooms were clean to even my satisfaction however, we are still trying to get the musty smell out of our clothes. I love being tan and having such great warm weather so early in the season. Would we go back? YES√à√\u2020\u2022?.If you go please say hello to J.P (one of the staff) from Maddie√à√\u2020\u2022?I will be downloading pictures soon√à√\u2020\u2022? ","annotations":[]}
