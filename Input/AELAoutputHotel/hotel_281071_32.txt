{"text":"Extremely disappointing! My boyfriend really wanted to stay at the Mandarin Oriental, so we decided to do it for our last night in NYC (we stayed with friends the other nights). He booked an upgraded room with a Central Park view--it was nearly $1000 for the night. We were prepared for the cost as we knew it would be that expensive.We arrived at noon and loved the beautiful interior of the hotel. The staff was friendly and the concierge was very helpful. Our room was ready, but the key system wasn't working so they walked us to the room. It was nice--not very large and has a view of Central Park that is ok--unfortunately it is largely obstructed by the awful Trump building, but that can't be helped. The room and amenities were really just ok--I think that most Westins, Ws, and even up-scale Marriotts were almost as nice. and Ritz Carltons, Four Seasons, and others in that realm are easily comparable. There are some really nice a\/v features, and the bathroom is much larger, but I don't think that the marginal difference in quality is even close to the difference in cost. And there were weird things about the bathroom--like no separate light switch or a fan in the little room that has the toilet, terribly slow hot water, not very soft or plush robes, and even really low quality q-tips (to be petty). Also, there is not a coffee maker in the room, so you are forced to order room service every time you want hot water for tea or coffee. And the prices for room service are just completely over the top. I guess they just figure that once you are paying that much for a room, a $27\/pp (plus service fees) continental breakfast is no big expense. (And it goes up from there.)The worst part, however, is that we slept terribly! The pillows are so soft that you need at least two of them and there weren't extras in the room. The comforter is pretty and soft, but warmed up so much that we were roasting. And the air in the room was so incredibly dry that we really had trouble sleeping. We collectively got about 2 hours of sleep. We were pretty grumpy by morning.The service was very good--all very nice staff people. But the room just didn't live up to the price in any way, shape, or form. We'd have been just as happy at the W or a boutique hotel and would have spent $700 less. Lesson learned: paying the highest cost does not always mean a better experience.
