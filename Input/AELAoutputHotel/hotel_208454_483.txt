{"text":"Very good. Fantastic location We stayed here for 5 nights in November as a stopover from flying home from visting relatives from Houston. Having stayed in NY several times in the last few years this was the first time in the Sofitel and was booked purely on the strength of reviews from Trip advisor.Previously we had stayed at the Plaza as a 30th birthday pressie to my wife in a great room (sad to see its being turned into apartments) and before that I had stayed at other hotels around Central Park area. This was the first time we had stayed more centrally and to be fair I had some concerns that noise would be an issue. However, this was not the case.The room was good without being great, but being a light sleeper this was more than made up for by the fact it was quiet. And in a busy, hustling city like NY, this is a blessing. The location could not be better. Basically two blocks to Times Square and almost everything in close reach. Having stayed near Central Park previously the one criticism of that area is that it is a fair old walk down to the Theatre District and Macy's etc etc.From the Sofitel its fantastic. Everything is within walking distance altho I would still recommend the bus tour 2 day pass as a means to getting around New York cheaply. And you learn things on the way round also!The Hotel foyer and lobby is beautiful and spotlessly clean. The service is great and mostly the concierge is very helpful. The guys at the door are even more helpful and a good means of information. A couple of helpful hints.Use the Hotel's town car service for pick up and drop off's at the airport. It's only marginally dearer than a standard cab, and an aawful lot more comfortable. When you add toll fees etc to a standard cab its practically the same. The hotel arrange this without hassle. The guys at the door can also aid you with this on the way back.Avoid the Hotel bar...its pretentious beyond belief and the service here (unlike the rest of the Hotel) was very very poor. They were more interested in preening themselves and looking cool for the business people populating the bar than actually serving anyone. Besides NY is full of good bars and restaurants (by the way the Indian restaurant 200yds to the left down the street of the Sofitel is very very good).Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great starting base in NY. Its clean, comfortable and stylish. Even better, if you get a deal I cant think of better value in NY, as its location is perfect. We'll be back here...we'll just avoid the bar!
