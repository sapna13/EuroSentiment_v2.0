{"text":"Disappointed after reading other reviews -- dirty room, poor service We booked this hotel after reading the other Tripadvisor reviews, but were majorly disappointed once we arrived. First off, there was no one at reception when we arrived and my husband had to walk around the hotel before finding a staff member. Second, our room was stuffy and smelled like no one had opened the windows for a while; there were large patches of black mold growing in two different areas on the ceiling; and the rug was dirty and had paint chips all over it (probably from decaying paint that had fallen from the ceiling). Third, we had a rental car with us and their parking system was inane -- the gates are not automatic and are raised only when the receptionist happens to see your car in her security monitor. One time, we said bye to the receptionist, who knew we had a car parked there, and she didn't bother raising the gate for us. That meant walking back in and telling her to raise the gate. This receptionist was also extremely surly and gave us commands accompanied by cold looks, rather than talking to us like a regular human being. Their complimentary breakfast was okay and the water pressure in the shower was good...those are the only somewhat-positive things I can think of about this place. I'd rather spend the extra $50 next time and stay at the Holiday Inn Express, which is right next door and looked ten times better.
