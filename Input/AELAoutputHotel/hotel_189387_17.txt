{"text":"Loved IT!!! I stayed in this hotel in July with my family as we where heading to my wedding in Norway. Let me tell you that after a 22 hour flight and 7 hours in layovers, the hotel service and staff is by far above and beyond.Okay Let me start, I arrived at 7:30 in the morning and my room was available immediatly. The room I stayed in was freshly painted and remodeled. The A\/C- Well I live in hawaii so fresh air was great.The front desk, bell staff, and the waiter staff, literaly go above and beyond service to see you smile. Saide - the bellman is the man to go to for any questions you might have about dining, drinks, etc. etc. its amsterdam.I would like to give a personal thanks to David (the night time orderly) for making my stay the most memorable, with the 3:00am room service. I think I say this for everyone in my party that we wish we could have sit down and had a few drinks with you, and not in a gay way.The only thing I wanted to address was that the concierge Shawn I think is his name a very tall, slender blonde hair individual in his late 20 or early 30's. He was very rude and a cold individual I noticed through out my stay. The thing about this hotel is that its like a maze, but lined with artwork and as my feet already had blisters from sightseeing everything amsterdam had to offer. The weather started to take a turn for the worst with a cold down pour at 67 F . I asked this gentelman for an umbrella as he had 4 of them behind the desk and told me he didnt have any, and insisted I go to my room to get an umbrella in the closet. Well there is only one and if you have 2 people staying in your room, well i dont think i need to do the math. I pointed this out to him then he insisted he didnt have any left. (But there was 4 of them behind you)Other than that, I still give this hotel a 5 and still want to point out that the staff is very friendly, and helpful, and I will be returning to this hotel in November.
