{"text":"Outstanding People should be queueing up to book a stay at this wonderful resort and hotel! It honestly is the best hotel I have been to. Stand on the beach and you will have an endless view of sand, sea and hundreds of palm trees stretching to both horizons. The staff at Riu Bambu are perfect, most speak at least 2 languages and many who speak up to four (English, Spanish, French  German) They are all very helpful and friendly and you will get to know many of them by name. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and entertainment is provided on a daily basis throughout the day, with beach\/pool activities, sports, dancing, areobics and mini shows during the day. At night there is a show on stage, however, some of the shows can be a quite inappropriate for younger audiences. The bar staff are all very friendly and will even offer you drinks if they notice you're current drink is nearly finished (or even top you up without asking!) but again this is not an attempt to part you of your peso's (or $US) because drinks are complimentary as this is an All Inclusive hotel. Also, you are probably thinking that if its free drinks, then the range must be small. I can assure you it isn't. There are more than a dozen cocktails on offer, dozens of spirits, some more exotic (and worth a try) and of course home brands such as Smirnoff, Ballantines Whisky and others.The best thing about this resort is that because it is so large, you will not have to venture out unless you want to. Items such as food, souvenirs, beach apparell etc) can be purchased at reasonable prices on 'Carribean Street'. There are many restaurants which can be freely used by All Inclusive guests, even if they are part of another Riu Hotel (There are 4 Hotels in the Resort). To that ends, you can also use most of the facilities of all the other hotels, such as their pools, beach, restaurants, and go and watch their evening entertainment.Rooms are excellently equipped with satellite TV, complimentary mini bar containing Sprite, Pepsi, Water, Soda, Rum, Vodka, Brandy and Gin and is refilled every second day. You will be surprised to see the beautiful Towel Origami in your room and around the villas. Every effort is made to ensure your stay is perfect, the receptionist will even phone you to check the room is to your standards soon after you check in. We did not have any problems or complaints, but Im sure if you do, it will be dealt with efficiently and quickly.
