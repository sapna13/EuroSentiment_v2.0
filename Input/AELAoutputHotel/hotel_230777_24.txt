{"text":"Fantastically swanky! We booked this hotel through lastminute.com and was amazed at the cheap deal that we got - we paid about √ä√£¬¢160 for 2 nights. The hotel is 5* and is completely luxurious - very modern and swanky.It seems to cater mainly for the business end of the market and we felt like a couple of scruff bags trotting in with our rucksack, whilst everyone else was making full use of the very smartly dressed porters with their enormous cases. However the staff were very welcoming and were always on hand to offer whatever service you required. Our room was enormous - however we did have a city view which was slightly misleading as it actually looked straight across the road to another hotel or office block - you can pay a little more for a river view which is probably worth it.The hotel has several bars and restaurants - there were all really nice, although quite expensive - the hotel is also home to Harry's Bar - one of Berlin's top bars which is in lots of the guide books (as is the hotel under the luxury section). It also has a really nice pool and gym.The location of the hotel is pretty good - not far from Berlin's Tiergarten and only a five minute walk from the nearest underground station. It is surrounded by embassy buildings and is close to several bars and restaurants.We had a fantastic stay at the Grand Hotel Esplanade and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.
