{"text":"great location, free parking and newly renovated We stayed at the broadway manor inn for 6 days. It's newly renovated with brand new furniture and we had a room with a window with a view on Broadway street wich was really nice, if you don't care about the traffic noise. the rates are so inexpensive less than 50$ and the room have everything in it, microwave, refrigerator and wirelss internet. The free inside parking was very convinient and If we talk about the location, it's just fantastic...In the middle of everything, In a VERY safe residential neiborhood. You can walk to mostly everything in the city in less that half an hour. Polk street, the street next to the one of the motel have so many good restaurants and a really nice veggie grocerie strore. Like other reviews said, the management was not that friendly expect that young girl, who was probably the daughter of AJ the rude owner. But anyway we only talk to him the first dayThe drawback was that we could smell the neighboords marijuana. It was comming from the shower fan. Since it was A non smooking motel, we immediatly advise the office because we didnt want to be charge the 150$ fine for smoking in the room But I guest it was an isolated case. I don't think they did anything about it because it smelled like weed night after night. My girlfriend is very very picky and it was one of her favorite motel in our 5 month trip around USAGREAT LOCATION, FREE PARKING, AND CHEAP!!!
