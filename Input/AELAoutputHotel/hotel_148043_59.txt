{"text":"Definitely would want to return...... El Convento is one of the most amazing places to stay in Old San Juan. It is the ideal base to explore the Old city. It has the most beautiful atmosphere and the grounds were outstanding. It is within walking distance of everything such as restaurants, interesting tourist sites, and the waterfront area. They have gorgeous historic reminders of the convent as it once was, and it really made you wonder what it was like to have been there in the day. The staff was very friendly, the service exceptional, we felt like family in this homey small hotel. Each evening we enjoyed a complimentary wine  cheese reception by the library, with quality wines that were delicious and well chose, as well as internet access so we could do two things at once. The restaurants in the hotel were excellent, we tried two out of the four due to limited time restraints. We definitely recommend El Patio del Nispero and lunch at C√ã√\u2022¬¥na, both were unsurpassed. Room service was also quick and efficient. We spent alot of time reading  relaxing on the incredible roofdeck, which boasted amazing views and a small pool for cooling off.Our room had a partial view of San Juan Bay, which made the room so enjoyable, and the luxurious sheets, towels  toiletries lived up to our high standards. The bed was abviously of the highest quality and the flat screen TV was a luxury we don't get to enjoy at all hotels. If only we had planned more for our trip, we would have gladly stayed there longer, but we would definitely stay there again in the future. Thank you. ","annotations":[]}
