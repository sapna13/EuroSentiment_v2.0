{"text":"Decent stay but could have been better We were in NYC for the US Open for labor day weekend. We picked this hotel cuz there were three of us including a 17 year old and most hotels wouldn't allow all three of us to be in one room. We were tempted to try out the Embassy suites near Wall Street coz it was cheaper and roomier but decided to settle for the Marriott coz we have Elite membership and we get points. The location was a contributing factor for this decision as well. It was a bit tight especially when the pull out bed was open. Room was clean and they have a full size refrigerator in the room with ice maker. Bed is comfortable and the linens were top notch quality. Pull out bed was not bad either. Closet space is very limited. Safe in closet fits laptop. Free internet access in rooms not wi-fi though. We paid $330 per night and includes breakfast. Breakfast is pretty decent - eggs, sausage, waffles and all the other regular stuff. Location is great - close to theaters and 30 seconds from subway. Valet parking or nightly parking is $48 per night. If you take your car out during the day and check it back in, that's an extra $48. We were disappointed coz we asked for early check-in yet when we got there around 1 pm, the room was not ready. They said they would call when the room was ready but didn't. So we came back at 3:40 pm and they gave us the keys. Also we requested an extra hour for late check out - 12 noon instead of 11 am but they flat out refused. If they are that adamant about that then they should be able to accomodate early check-in - can't have it both ways. If it was just the two of us, we would rather stay at some place like Sofitel coz its definitely a cut above and cheaper.
