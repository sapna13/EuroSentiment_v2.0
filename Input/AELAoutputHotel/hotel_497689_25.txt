{"text":"A well deserved first place Return visit to the Soho Hotel, absolutely fantastic, booked a Luxury Junior Suite and was delighted to be upgraded to a Deluxe Junior Suite, good start. The junior suite is very spacious with a superb king size bed, sofa table chairs working area, well presented bathrooms one common theme the rooms are immaculately clean!We arrived early morning and dropped off our luggage before indulging in a little retail therapy with the promise that the front desk would contact us as and when the room was ready which they duly did. Returning early afternoon we were immediately taken up to our room, luggage already in place, other hotels please take note very annoying to check into room and then wait for the luggage to follow on!As we were visiting Xcel in Docklands for a concert we asked for some travel options and within 10 mins concierge had secured car and driver for a return journey. We enjoyed a couple of drinks in the bar before our car arrived and took us to our destination, at the end of the concert driver was there waiting to take us back.Sunday morning was something of a lazy morning with a late breakfast in the room.Other reviews compliment the staff and we have to agree very professional, very friendly without being overly friendly, small details like remembering our names, our plans and offering assistance when ever required. Having stayed in many of the great london hotels this has been the first time in many years I can honestly say I could not find fault anywhere not in the accommodations, food, service etc.A perfect 10 ","annotations":[{"endOffset":58,"mention":"Soho Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Soho_Hotel"],"startOffset":48},{"endOffset":58,"mention":"Soho Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Soho_Hotel"],"startOffset":48},{"endOffset":58,"mention":"Soho Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Soho_Hotel"],"startOffset":48},{"endOffset":58,"mention":"Soho Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Soho_Hotel"],"startOffset":48},{"endOffset":58,"mention":"Soho Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Soho_Hotel"],"startOffset":48}]}
