{"text":"This Place Was AMAZING! First I would like to mention that I am a General Manager of a hotel so I know how important it is to get and give feedback. My wife and I stayed at this awesome property for our Honey Moon, August 5-12th, wishing we did 9 days instead of 7. We booked through Liberty Travel. Very nice, accurate and very courteous. On to the Resort... This fine establishment deserves the highest rating it can get. We booked an Excellence Suite double ocean view balcony, (2nd floor room 1109, I believe it was in building 1). I am so glad we chose that room type. The view was incredible! Plenty of space and storage areas. The air conditioning could have used a little maintenance but it was fine, your body adjusts to the difference of temperatures. The resort grounds itself was immaculate. We were amazed by how many people were always cleaning, mopping, picking up stuff, organizing, hosing down the grounds, landscaping, but most eye catching to me was the fact that you never really saw a manager. It was like they all managed themselves and new exactly what to do and what it takes to continuously keep the resort top notch. I was IMPRESSED! I left this resort truly inspired. We loved how they were so nice to us, and so sincere. They always smiled and greeted you. Even the guys renovating some of the rooms said hello to you with a smile, and I am sure they were outside contractors of some sort. The funny \/ cute thing was that every time you asked the staff how they were doing they would say Excellente (EX CELL LENT TAY), and you never got tired hearing it because it was so sincere. These people worked hard every hour of every day we were there. I know my money went to the right place, unlike some places you stay and pay a fortune but you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ physically see any return for your dollar spent. So the service there was #1. Then came the Food in a very close #2. Fabulous food. Like eating in a 5 star restaurant every day. We exceptionally liked Spice. It would be unfair to list a few select names so I will not, but trust me, everyone stands out. Everyone is fantastic. You will see. Everyone appreciates that fact that you are there. My wife really liked the fact that while we ate they were always organizing our table, and how they escorted her to her seat. The pool was very nice, all different sections for if you wanted to be in a quiet area or at the swim up bar, or nestled under a palm tree, or near the pool activities for the day. There really was never a dull moment. They had Water Polo, Volley Ball, Water Aerobics (my wife loved that), and even a kayaking game. There was also never a time you had to wait. Maybe one person in front of you at the bar but that was it. There was also never a time you had to fight for a place to sit or lay down or anything. Lots of availability. Beds by the side of the pool, and on the beach. The entertainers were really good at what they do. They were always entertaining you whether you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e at the pool or walking by or in the theatre. The theatre was great, the only show we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like was the Magic Show. It just didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have ooooo ahhhh factor. Overall I rate this place a 5 star resort. If you are going to this place as a couple I seriously recommend that you get your pictures taken by the free lance photographers that are there onsite. Truly amazing pictures. Well worth the extra money. The beach was great, water was a little rough but was still soothing. Check the spa out when you are their, look for the infamous parrots, try some mamajuana (drink), and get plenty of sleep before you go because you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e not going to want to waist your time sleeping. Enjoy, you won't go wrong selecting this resort. Ohh yah, NO KIDS. Its Was EXCELLENTE!!!!! I could go on and on√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®?br\/> ","annotations":[{"endOffset":309,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":305},{"endOffset":1759,"mention":"fortune","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fortune_cookie"],"startOffset":1752}]}
