{"text":"Quiet haven in Paris My mother and I stayed in Hotel de Varenne just before Christmas 2006. We wanted a hotel in a quiet and safe area, within walking distance of the city centre (St German des Pres etc.), and not too expensive.Hotel de Varenne proved to be just that. We booked the winter special offer (129 euro per room, breakfast included) and for that price, we got an authentic, nicely furnitured and comfortable place to stay; a quiet haven from the moment you walk into the entrance garden.Initially, we had a room on the fourth floor based on our miscommunication, but the staff was more than helpful to transfer us to the second floor; less stair-climbing and somewhat spacier.Considering the price, the room was good: nice furniture, excellent badroom and well ventilated. Not much view since we booked a room on the courtyard, but we had absolutely no traffic noise at night. Only the polyester blankets we considered out of date and not too clean, but this was not a great problem.Breakfast is (like in almost every hotel of this pricerange) typically French: tea, coffee or chocolate, orange juice and a basket of bread. If you don't expect an English hotel breakfast buffet, then it's all very fine.The hotel lies in the eastern part of the 7th Arrondissement, a very safe and well-heeled neigbourhood, with some nice restaurants quite nearby. We particularly recommend Le Ferme de Saint Simon (in the Rue de St Simon), a lovely restaurant with very kind staff, however somewhat expensive.Even late at night, this area is very safe, also for two women alone. You can walk to St Germain des Pres (twenty minutes) or to the city centre via the Tuileries (half an hour). There are also two metro stations nearby. If you want a quiet place to stay in a authentic, charming hotel on a moderate budget, Hotel de Varenne is just the right place to you.
