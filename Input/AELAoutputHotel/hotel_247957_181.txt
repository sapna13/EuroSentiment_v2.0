{"text":"If you are expecting 5.0 star this is not for you I traveled from March 12-March 18. I didn't put my expectations to high cause I knew I wouldn't be exceptional. While in line, I saw several people waiting for their room but I didn't have a long wait. My room was decent but their was a slight stench of a moldy smell. I don't think it was urine because the bathroom didn't smell like that. I could have been the old linen. Anywho, the bathroom is a bit rusty but i didn't mind. I was clean nonetheless. After unpacking I made a phone call in the hotel lobby that cost 41.00 for 3 minutes. Total rip off! I had a phone card but the phone doesn't except them and my celly wasn't working. So I had to choke that up. I food was great at the BUFFET suprisingly. Everthing was fresh. You have to be one that is open to trying new things but there is french fries and pizza for the lames. I don't drink so I can't comment on the liquor but every one that was drunk seemed to be having a good time.The pool was nice. The beach was nice. Weather was beautiful. The hotel front desk isn't very complimentary after they take your money. There will also be sales people on the property trying to upgrade you to a Royal Club membership. They will harass you but just ignore them. They'll get the picture. The night shows were nice. There is a local night club that gets hella crowded but it was OK. The beach party is ok as well. I wouldn't recommend booking this trip for more than 4 days. that was my mistake but all in all it was ok. The best part of it all was the food and the nice weather. Great for youngings like me that don't care too much about ambiance. But i wouldn't recommend this for couples or honey mooners looking for excellent customer service. I would return but not anytime soon.
