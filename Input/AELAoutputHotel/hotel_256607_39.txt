{"text":"Not very good Stayed here for 5 nights in July 2006. Our travel agent booked us in.We arrived at about 7.30 am and got our room right away. No problems there. On first glance it looked very well. Some of the staff were helpful, others were not. They were probably all doing their best, but there were quite a few glitches:- On day 3 the maid removed 2 big towels and returned 1. I had to go fetch a towel for myself.- I noticed some green stuff in the cornflakes container at breakfast. The waiter just scopped the green stuff out, in front of me, instead of taking the container away, throwing everything out and replacing it with fresh cornflakes.- Our used room service tray was sitting in the corridor outside our room for a whole afternoon, without anyone picking it up.- There was a nice swimming pool, but usually no towels. Or rather, someone had used the first 5 towels, and we had to call reception to get some new ones. Two mornings in a row.- The night clerk didn't know how to log into Windows on the two internet computers in the lobby. Some other guest must have logged out of windows, not only the browser. He had no idea on what to do about it, and didn't check if there was any information available for the staff either.- One morning, a tile fell out of the elevator ceiling and on to my foot. When my husband notified one of the staff at the reception desk, the staff member asked if they should call maintainance... Fortunately, the General Manager was a bit better at customer service, and asked if I needed ice and a doctor. The next General Manager on duty called our room and asked if everything was OK.- One of the staff members in charge of organizing rental cars messed up our reservation by not following Avis's rules. We did eventually get the car, but the whole rental car procedure seemed to be very confusing for a lot of staff members.All in all some things were good, but a few more were really bad. I wouldn't recomend anyone staying there, and am going to tell my travel agent about our stay.
