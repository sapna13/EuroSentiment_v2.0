{"text":"Francisco Bay Inn--not even worth the cheap price We were transferred to this hotel by the Castle Inn after they booked our stay, took our payment in full months in advance, and then told us that they had no reservation and no room for us when we showed up (see my other review on them!)From my experience, I basically think that the Francisco Bay Inn is a cheap, dirty, run-down hotel that has a scam running with their partner, the Castle Inn. The Castle Inn books you for a decent price, then they get other people to stay there for more $$$, so they take your pre-paid booking and transfer you to the Francisco Bay Inn, professing that the accommodations are equivalent. They are not, not even close. This motel typically goes for about $50 less per night.Everything here was cheap and dirty, the staff are rude, and I was trapped in their run-down elevator for 2 hours and almost missed my flight home. The only reason I even used the elevator was that I wanted to put all of the suitcases on it instead of carrying them down the stairs from the second floor. Thank god my husband was not in the elevator with me because he eventually figured out that I was missing for a while...the staff there are so clueless that all of the screaming and pounding on the doors would have never clued them in. Anyway, once they knew I was trapped and that the elevator had stopped between 2 floors, they tried to fix the situation by trying to pry the doors open with a crowbar. That just caused the elevator to fall further. They finally gave up and called a repair company.Worst experience I have ever had on a trip! ","annotations":[]}
