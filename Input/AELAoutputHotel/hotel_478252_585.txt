{"text":"Never again, What a mistake!! Food:Rate it - 0I have been to Punta Cana for 3 years in a row. I have stayed everywhere, and everything has always been perfect. One of the reasons i kept going back was the food. Lobster, Great Seafood, etc. This year i made the mistake of booking this hotel. I went to the seafood restaurant and all they had was salmon. I really was not expecting that in the carribean. The only had lobster one night in my whole 7 day stay. The excursions all promise you a lobster feast, and when you get there you get pork chops if you're lucky. You also have to make reservations for the restaurants, and of course there are never any reservations for the time or date you want. The food in the buffet is ridiculous. I felt like i never left the U.S. Frenchfries, Salmon,  Burgers... Nothing worth getting fat over. Service:Rate it - 9For the most part the service was excellent. The servers did the best they could to accomodate the fact that the food was horrible. At the end of the day they can't do anything about it, the problem is way above them. The preople there are very friendly, and speak various laguages. They were overall very nice. Room  DecorRate it - 10Well, If they would've spent half the money they spent on the marble floors on the food, maybe my vacation wouldn't have sucked as much. The decor was beautiful. Everything in marble, Very clean and new, it was very nice.Atmosphere  ActivitiesRate it - 3One word, Boring! Beach and more beach. If you don't leave the resort on any excursions, you will be bored by the third day of your stay because there's nothing to do there but sleep  tan. The casino was the size of my bathroom at home. The club was no where near what i would call a club (maybe because i live in miami, i expect a littlemore). The entertainment shows at night aren't very etertaining. So once you eat dinner, all there's left to do is sleep. The beach is very pretty, the water isn't as clear as the bahamas but the sand is very soft. The rental place for the beach activities such as the catamaran, kayak, etc. is a nightmare to deal with. You also have to reserve whenever you want to use any of the equipment and let me giveyou an example of my experience... My appointment to for the catamaran was at 12 pm and was finnally able to ride it around 4 pm. Overall reccomendationRate it - 4I don't reccomend it at all. Unless you just want to lay on the beach for 7 days and not eat, don't bother.If you do go you must:See-Samana Island (not free)Saona Island (not free)Laguna Gri Gri (not free)Eat - (If they have it)ManguFondongoLimocillos (Mamones)Coco Loco (Drink) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":801,"mention":"Burgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":794},{"endOffset":801,"mention":"Burgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":794},{"endOffset":1690,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1686},{"endOffset":1733,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1729},{"endOffset":1733,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1729}]}
