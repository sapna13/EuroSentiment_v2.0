{"text":"Beautiful Hotel with Minor Problems DON'T BOOK THROUGH EXPEDIA- WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH A MIGRAINE, AN ILLEGAL CONNECTION AND CANCELLED FLIGHTS. THANKS BUT NO THANKS.First of all, this Hotel is absolutely beautiful inside with a touch of class and chicness to it. Very impressed by the view from the 8th floor Atlantic View Ocean Vista (which i highly recommend). The first room that we had was on the 9th floor -had minor problems. The electricity was not working- had to have someone come and reconnect it under the side table, very dusty and floor still had hair from previous guests, sink was stopped up and would not drain, elevators are extremely slow and very time consuming. You would probably spend most of your time at the elevators. After all of my complaining- I spoke with Edjardo which was very nice and accomodating to switch us to the 9th Ocean Vista which was clean and beautiful. View is absolutely breathtaking. Bar at the pool is great, however is closes to darn early 9pm to be exact. Love the satrbucks in walking distance!!!! Please guys dont be fooled- RENT A CAR! you would not be able to go anywhere fast waiting on the bus. Excursions are a ripoff. Elyunkie(sp) Rainforest is an experience that you will NEVER forget and your legs will not either. Drive and go to the viewing at the center 35-45minutes away. You can do it for 55 dollars cheaper than paying someone to drive you and then you have to walk and find the way by yourself anyway. Oh yeah- Parking is a trip-16 a day..RIDICUL... email me and i will discuss parking with you...finley33@yahoo.com....overall the trip was great... feel free to email me if you have any questions and I would be glad to email you back. luv2travelallof thetime.
