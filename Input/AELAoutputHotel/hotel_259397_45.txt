{"text":"Location, location...but no view I do not think you could find a better location than this in Toronto. Most things are close by both from a business and entertainment point of view. The view from most bedrooms ranges from average to poor but if you do not want to stare out the window it is not a problem. Some roomes at the back are quite overlooked but they have see thru sun blinds on the windows that protect ones modesty!The first room I got was (I think ) #434. This room is smaller than most and right next to the lifts which have the loudest bell tones I have ever heard so avoid if you want a good sleep. I got moved to one further down the corridoor and found it very adequate. There are good working facilities with plenty of light, a comfy bed and a large TV with numerous channels and film options. The bathroom was excelent and there is plenty of hanging space for ones clothes in a seperate area.The public areas are very pleasant in a boutique kind of way. There is a trendy bar with excelent staff and a very adequate dining room. Breakfasts are nothing to write home about but again quite adequate. If you want to find somewhere not too expensive (but top quality) to eat try just around the corner at the cafe\/restaurant called Spoon. I stumbled upon it and had a memorable meal.So, if you avoid any rooms near the noisy lift and do not care about views give this place a try. i think you will enjoy it. ","annotations":[]}
