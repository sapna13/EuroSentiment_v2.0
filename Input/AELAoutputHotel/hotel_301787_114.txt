{"text":"Welcome to Paradise As you enter the Hotel you will see a sign that says  Wecome to Paradise This is exactly what you are entering.... From your arrival at Paradise we where made feel like you are the only guest in the Hotel. The Staff couldn't have done more for myself or my partner on our 3 week stay. The small little touches in the hotel and our very spacious and comfortable room. From Cool towels on arrival to the flowers left on our bed a night. This Hotel is just in a whole new league of making you feel welcome. My Partner organised a Romantic meal on the Hotels Special Table, This I would highly recommend, for a really nice romantic evening and a fantastic meal with superb service.You can be at a different pool every day, from a little lively to pools that are very quite and relaxing and you also have a beach to choose from. The pools however have sand as you walk in to give the beach effect :-). I could not fault our stay on any level at this Hotel and we are already planning our next stay. I could write so much more about how wonderful our stay was but I think you will be just better off experiencing this for yourselfThe Sheraton Luguna as however changed it's name to the Laguna and Spa resort... This is due to the massive renovations the hotel has been upgraded from a Sheraton to Starwood property. Hope you enjoy your stay as much as we have.....
