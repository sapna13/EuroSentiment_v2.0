{"text":"Wicked, cool  Wicked, Just returned from a 10 night stay at the Establishment in Sydney. Fistly and most importantly the rooms are fantastic. Really spacious with a lovely bathroom (bvlgari toiletries) very nice. Seperate walk in shower and bath tub that you can see the tv from. Nice bed and good aircon. Now the food, the breakfast is really great and i really liked the room it was served in. The pastries are awesome and the mushrooms are really tasty. I'm a bit of a foody so usually hard to impress. The food in the room is quite a simple menu, but nobody minds that when its done well. The lamb salad is fantastic and chicken burger great but ask them to go easy on the mayo if watching your weight. The bars in the hotel are known as the best in sydney apparently and don't let you down and as a hotel guest you can use the swanky private bar hemisphere. Which in my opinion is more relaxing than the main bar, which can get over crowded. Service, it annoys me that us english cannot do service like the ozzies as they are professional and really friendly. In all honesty we didn't have any probs and Dion the manager was extremely chatty along with his staff. Advice: the hotel is full quite often by the sounds of things so don't expect a room to early in the morning when you arrive. If you are coming off an early flight from the u.k you should book the room from the night before. Make sure you get your room turned down @ night as they give you some really nice cookies every time. Go too the restaurant Garfish in manly, wicked value for money and seriously good fresh fish.
