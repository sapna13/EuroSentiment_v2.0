{"text":"Great location, great staff!!!!! Great hotel and highly recommended. Definately book through an online hotel company as they offer much cheaper rates. When I initially checked in I was given a room on the 2nd floor and for security reasons (walkway outside window and missing window pain in the bathroom) I asked to get a new room and was immediately moved to the 6th floor. I definately felt more safe and secure in this higher floor. I was a little put-off with the fact that there were no in-room safe although the safe deposits boxes were plentiful at the main desk (in various sizes) and I kept mine for my entire stay with the staff not being put off by opening the safe whenever asked.The rooms, although small are very clean and well appointed. ALl the similiarily priced hotels int he area have small rooms as well so this should not be a deterent. The in room ammenities were fine and all worked well including TV, clock radio\/cd player, Lather bathroom amenities, iron, toilet and shower, etc..... Definately above what I expected for a $85 room.The breakfast in the morning was excellent and included home-made waffles (you make them yourself easily), yoghurt, bananas, apples, boiled eggs, several types of toast, hot cereal, cold cereal, orange\/mango juice, milk, Starbucks coffee, tea PB and J. Definately took advantage fo the free food and even used some as a snack throughout the day. The breakfast are served from 7 - 9am Mon-Fri which ended a little early for me one morning although on the weekend breakfast goes until 10am. Free newspapers were also present.I ended up extending my stay 4 days into my visit and I re-booked the hotel on hotels.ca and had no trouble in the turnover without having to check out of my room or have too much hassle with the front desk.The staff were great at offering tips of what to do, where to go, which bus to take, etc.... Definately felt like they appreciated my business. The complimentary wine and apples and cookies in the evening were also appreciated.The location was excellent being so close to Union Square and some of the other higher end properties (Westin, Crowne Plaza, etc....) The Powell Street cable car stopped at the corner of Sutter and Powell, a few steps from the hotel doorway. Union Square with its varied priced restaurants and fast food outlets was also convenient. A Wells Fargo is a block away, Walgreens accross the street and lots of convenient shopping all at the hotel door step.I definately would stay here again.
