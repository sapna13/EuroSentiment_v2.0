{"text":"Mixed Experience I read others' reviews of this hotel on this site and was looking forward to spending two nights here while I was in Boston on business. Some things about the hotel were great -- the night I arrived, for example, I did not get to the hotel until 1:30 am and had not had dinner -- room service quickly brought me sandwich and a pot of tea and I was grateful! Their internet access was excellent, wake-up calls flawless, and their staff was invariably polite. The room was comfortable, with many nice amenities and extras, including a CD player. I liked the decor a lot. Their express dry cleaning service was super.A few negative experiences, however: (1) The room was not as clean as it should have been, particularly the bathroom -- it did not meet the standards of a standard business class hotel like a Hilton or Hyatt. The walls were dirty, the sink and floor in the bathroom had splotches and sticky patches, the drinking glasses were dirty, the upholstery and carpet had spots and stains, and the bathrobes were frayed and worn; (2) On the second morning, I ordered a french omelette off their room service menu, as I had done the day before. Twenty minutes later, I got a call from room service asking me what the ingredients were for a french omelette. I told the person that I wasn't sure exactly but didn't they know since it was on their menu? She told me that the french omelette was not on their menu. I told her that I had ordered the same thing the day before from their menu, which was sitting in front of me! 45 minutes after I initially ordered, my french omelette did arrive -- and was delicious as usual -- but this was an annoying interlude on a busy morning; (3) Both mornings, the housekeeper knocked once on my door and before I could get to the door to see who it was, had unlocked the door and entered my room (this is not reassuring for women traveling alone); (4) There were errors on my bill which had to be ironed out -- a valet parking charge when I didn't even have a car. To their credit, they rectified the situation quickly and politely -- but it was time-consuming. Bottom line -- the hotel was comfortable and the staff was polite and friendly, but no hotel can lose sight of the basics: cleanliness and a well-trained staff.
