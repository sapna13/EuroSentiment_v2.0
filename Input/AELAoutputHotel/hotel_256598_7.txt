{"text":"Exactly what we wanted-and exceptional service We were meeting up with my mother and two teenagers for two nights in Sydney so had booked two rooms at the Mercure Central (as they were coming by train) and one room required a rollaway bed. To make matters more complicated for reception we were delayed and they had to check in first but I had made the booking with an Accor Advantage card. This was handled easily and the staff even offered to set-up the rollaway later so as to leave more space. We stayed in quite a few hotels lately but the staff here really impressed. Was their 10th anniversary and the opening night of the Olympics so they were handing out fortune cookies with free and discounted drinks as the message. Saving around $20 in the bar certainly got the stay off to a good start. Rooms had a 'funky' feel to them with vibrant colours. Lovely big TVs. Bar was really cosy and the free drinks helped. Breakfast was the real treat with the sort of dishes and little touches that you would only see at a 5 star establishment (individual poached eggs, breakfast sundaes etc). Seemed to be a few airline crew using the hotel including pilots which is a good sign. Negatives: quite a few Asian and American tour groups but they didn't impact too much on us, there was a mild 'backed-up' smell from the toilet on both days we stayed but I doubt that they can do much about that. Internet access for 24 hours wasn't cheap ($25) but they may have forgotten to charge for it. Parking garage was easy to find and the fee was around $30 which is pretty average for Sydney. Overall we loved our stay here primarily due to the 'can do't attitude of all staff that we met. Would definitely stay here again as the price is right.
