{"text":"Perfect hotel in Florence! My husband, 17 year old son and I chose to stay in the Hotel Europa for six days in March after hearing my sister rave about how much she loved the hotel when she stayed here last October. She did not exaggerate what a great hotel this is. We found the hotel to be spotlessly clean, very comfortable with large spacious rooms. and ideally located right in the center of things, but away from the noise. We had a suite with painted ceilings that were incredible, rooms that were just huge and a terrific multi jet shower. The best feature though is Miriam and her father. They are both gracious hosts who make you feel welcome immediately. We received great advice on where to dine and reservations were happily made for us (definitely try Zaza's and Il Latino). When we unexpectedly extended our stay, Miriam managed to work out a way to accomodate us. And, when we had time to kill before our flight took off, we were welcomed into the lounge room where we were able to comfortably relax, use the computer and await our departure time in a friendly, homey environment. This hotel reflects the standards of days gone by with excellent service, large rooms, great breakfast , the ability to converse in multiple languages and genuine concern and interest in the guests. I cannot say enough about this hotel. There is no doubt that when we return to Florence, we will stay here with our new friends, Miriam and Gassim. Thank you both for making our stay so wonderful!ps - shoppers tip : the prices in the market right near the hotel are cheaper than the market in piazza del repubblica, plus the selection is greater.
