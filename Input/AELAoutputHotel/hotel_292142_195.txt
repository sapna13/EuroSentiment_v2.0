{"text":"simply the best Stayed for 5 nights and it lived up to the reviews on tripadvisor(i checked tripadvisor before i booked it). We stayed on the top floor 37th and wow what a view. Im scared of hights, but i wasnt in the room or looking out of the windows. The size of the room was enormous the room service was excellent and the staff were really helpfull and friendly and always had a smile for you. The barking dog next door was really nice although i warn you one plate would feed two of you. If you want a good steak go to the Rare Grill in Murry Hill (ask for directions its a five minute walk) the food is fantastic and try the cowboy steak, its the best steak we have ever tasted. Macys is 10 minutes walk away and well priced, Bloomingdales worth a visit but a bit pricey, Century 21 is great for mens clothes but not womens although the bags, belts are good. One department store that i have never seen advertised (and should be) is Lord and Taylor on 5th Avenue, a few blocks away. Fantastic and well priced like Macys. Hop on Hop off bus is great, if you buy the ticket off one of the touts its fine but they tell you the 48 hours start when you get the first bus, its not, its when you buy the ticket. We will definatly stay at the Affinia Dumont when we return to new york. ","annotations":[]}
