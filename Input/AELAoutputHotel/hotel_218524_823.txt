{"text":"Loved Excellence--Again!!! Arrived on Wed 10\/17 for 7 days. We had been here before when it was still Secrets Excellence. That was 3 yrs ago. Now that the owners have taken over the management of the property, there has been some improvements (not that we had any complaints the 1st time).Check In: Got there at 3pm and the room was ready--booked garden view and that is what we received. They asked if we wanted to upgrade to Excellence Club for $700 for the week and we declined. The room was clean and in the back of the resort (8208). No view but peaceful and to be honest, we were in the room a total of about 8hrs a day--just to shower for dinner and sleep. We were hoping to be upgrade to oceanview because of being returning guests but we weren't. No problem--room was just fine.Weather: Perfect every day. Waves were awesome as it did get kind of windy a couple of days but we love to watch those big waves come rolling in.Beach: Totally beautiful with golden sand that is raked and cleaned of all debris daily. You can walk at least 3\/4 mi either way of the resort and it is so peaceful.Food: We never had a bad meal. Grille: Very good steaks and seafood both for lunch and dinner. Italian: Our favorite--great sauces and that is where the breakfast buffet is which was great every day. Chez Isabelle: We ate there once and thought it was just fine but not over the top. Chataubriand was different from what I remembered but not bad. Lobster House: Order the lobster grilled and you'll like it. We ordered it steamed the 1st time and it was just ok. Their normal way of preparing it is grilled and it was really good like that. Barcelona: I had the best tenderloin there! Did not eat at Spices(Pan-asian) or Agave (Mexican). During the day, they always have a different item cooking on the beach and the barbecued chicken was the best! We did not try the Paella but eveyone we talked to who tried said it was awesome. Drinks: Excellent quality and speedy service (whether or not one tipped). Spa: Was beautiful but we did not take advantage of any services. They have specials on different services everyday and we got a certificate for $15 off when we arrived. The gym is on the 2nd floor of the spa building and was adequetely equipped. Service: Can't say one negative thing about the service. We have been to the Dominican Republic (Punta Cana) 3xs and the reason we return is because the people who live there are so darn sweet. Always a smile and if anyone of our servers or the housekeepers was having a bad day, we sure couldn't tell. In summary, we didn't want to leave and even tried to stay an extra couple of days but with the flights, it's just too much of a hassle. We will return and everyone we spoke to said the same. As a matter of fact, we met one couple on our last day there that was on there 7th return trip to this resort!! I guess that says something!!! Any questions?
