{"text":"Never again. The best thing this hotel has is its location and they know it, this is the only way I can explain they are still in business. The staff is unexperienced, and rude; there is only one person at the front desk (that is when there is actually one at all)I arrived one hour after the check in time and the room was not ready yet, I had to wait for another hour because the maid was too busy. When I finally made it to my room the linens were dirty with every kind of stains and hairs you can imagine. I had to request new linens but the maid refused to change the pillow cases because she had forgotten them, she got very upset when I told them changing them the next day was not an option.The internet connection is awful, most of the times is not working and eventhough this can be solved by resetting the modem, there is only one guy who can do it and he will only do it if you insist a lot.If you are planning an extended stay here, do not bother on paying for cleaning service, the maids will only clean your room when they feel like doing it and they cannot even do the bed on a decent way.The thing that shocked me the most happenned the last day when I tried to check out. It was about 5am and the desk was unattended and the doors unlocked, and it lasted like that for at lest 20 minutes until I was able to wake the person in charge up. ANYONE on probably the most unsafe neighbourhood of the city can get into the hotel at early hours of the morning.Other things I think people should know are:-There is only one elevator, and it is stinky, small, old and very slow.-There is no phone not cable TV in rooms.-The building is old and the floors squeaky.-You might have to share your room with cockroaches as I did.-There are no electronic keys.I have been in budget hotels before but this one should not even be called hotel. I would have changed somewhere else but with Memorial Day around those days every hotel in the area was full but this one, now I know why... ","annotations":[]}
