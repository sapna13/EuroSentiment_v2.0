{"text":"Classy, consistent, and a pleasure Went to HK for business and stayed in the old wing of the Mandarin for one night. The lobby is uninspiring for a hotel of this stature, but thats where the mediocrity ends. The check in was smooth and you are personally escorted to your room. I was given a room on the 18th floor overlooking the harbour which was a lovely view - binoculars were strategically placed on the table for you if you wanted to look across the harbour. The room itself was right at the top end of hotels that I have experienced: flat screen TV with many choices including digital TV, excellent double bed, the technology everywhere was cutting edge from the phone to the electronics. There was even a flat screen TV embedded in the bathroom mirror which enabled you to watch TV while in the bath, shaving etc. The bathroom was of excellent design, bath, roomy shower cubicle with a high end shower, Hermes toiletries, soft towels etc. The only catch is that it seems a bit odd to be staying in a top end hotel and have to pay for wireless internet. In this day and age - when public hot spots are being set up it is a bit of an aberration but then again the Mandarin is not alone. In the morning they deliver two newspapers to you including the IHT which was another special feature compared to other hotels.Went to the gym in morning - it had a spa which I did not use, but the other sports equipment was very high quality and brand new. I am a gym fanatic so I know the difference. Very helpful attendant who makes sure you have everything you need.Breakfast was part of my package, and this was served in the coffee shop (?). Sensible range of food varying from vegetarian, Western and Chinese breakfasts. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Checkout was smooth as silk and the concierge was very helpful. He made sure he escorted me to the door and briefed the taxi on my destination.Overall what impressed me is that the hotel understands their customers needs and their high quality service is predictable and consistent. This ranks among one of my best big city hotel experiences and my compliments to the hotel and the team!
