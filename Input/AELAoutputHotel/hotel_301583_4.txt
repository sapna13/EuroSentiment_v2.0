{"text":"A little disappointed We arrived at Singapore Airport and used the Quayside Service which was truly fantastic. Collected as we left the plane and driven for what seemed miles around the airport to a private lounge where we had our own immigration officer. We were offered champagne in the lounge while we waited for them to collect our luggage. After about fifteen minutes we were walked to our waiting car - the luggage was already in the boot!The driver called when we were nearby and we were then greeted at the hotel by our personal 'Butleress'. She took us directly to our suite (The Somerset Maughn suite), where she took our passports and advised us of the call bell we should use and she would be there within five minutes! After unpacking we decided to call her and ask for a tour of the hotel. She did not arrive!! - We found our own way around the hotel which had a huge number of restaurants and bars and a very upmarket collection of shops.Our first meal was local delicacies and was okay though the restaurant was pretty empty and had no atmosphere. The price of wine was very high - food costs reasonable. We then found our way to the Long Bar where we ordered the signature cocktail, Singapore Sling - very disappointing in that it was pre-mixed and the barman just added some ice cubes - at 32 sd very disappointing. We took breakfast the next day in the pool bar and the guy who runs the pool bar was the best thing in the hotel - he was attentive, friendly and yet discreet.We asked our butler (who arrived after pressing call bell and finally resorting to calling reception on the phone) various questions about the hotel - she seemed not to know the layout at all and we were certainly not offered a tour nor run baths or taken to the Long Bar for complimentary drink as other reviewers have stated.Whilst the staff were very friendly we certainly were not made to feel 'special' and they certainly did not know our names.The Tiffin Room's curry buffet was awful. It had good reviews but was no better than the local curry restaurant with less choice, cold and tasteless food. The suite was very nice though quite dark - plenty of room and no free wifi - 6 sd for 30 minutes!In all we enjoyed our stay in Singapore but if we returned we would not stay at Raffles again.
