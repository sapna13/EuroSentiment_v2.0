{"text":"Could not be better We stayed for 11 nights at the Chesterfield that included New Years Eve. We stayed for 11 nights because we got an amazing deal on a website that offered a number of free nights with our booking. The fact that we had paid less than the normal rate had no bearing whatsoever on the courtesies that we received from everybody at the hotel. The service was just brilliant. Clearly, management has instilled in the staff that they are in a service business and that the customer is their lifeblood. The staff responded superbly. There was not a hint of stuffiness, and they responded to all our requests with a smile and efficiency.Our room was small, but very functional and had many luxuries, including free coffee and biscuits; free bottled water ( a rarity in the States) and extremely luxurious bathrobes and towels. The bathroom was small, but, again, very functional. We had dinner in the very stately dining room on two occasions. The hotel and its public spaces have a very clubby feel. They are mostly dark woods with an old world charm. The food is well prepared, but not spectacular. Again, though, the service is top notch. They simply could not do enough for you. And, the bar area and the bartenders are extremely engaging. After watching the fireworks over the Thames on New Years Eve, we came back to the hotel for a drink in the bar. It was packed, but the bartenders on duty made sure that they found a space for us and served us without undue delay. The location of the hotel is fabulous. It is about a five minute walk to the Green Park tube station and a ten minute walk to Oxford Street. If walking is your thing it is about twenty minutes to Picadilly Circus and about the same to Trafalgar Square. It is actually only about thirty minute walk to Harrods. All in all, the hotel lived up to everything that we could want in a hotel. And, for Mayfair, the prices are downright reasonable for the rooms as well as the restaurant. What a great place!
