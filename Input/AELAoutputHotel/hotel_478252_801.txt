{"text":"5 Star all the way We just returned from the Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana and we had the greatest time ever. As most people do ( or should do ) we did a lot of research on the Gran Bahia and read the many reviews before we booked our vacation. My wife and two boys 13  15 went during the March break from the 11th to the 19th. This place is very large but it is spread out and there are little buses that take you all over the resort. We stayed in the Club Golden suites which was right beside the beach. Excellent room service from the maid, just leave a $5 US tip every morning and you are treated like Kings and Queens. Also bring a few little gifts for the maids, they love facial creams etc. The 24hr room service is great also, we never had a problem with anything that we ordered. If you needed extra beer, food or wine no problem it was there within minutes. Our room was clean, spacious, we always had fresh towels and the Fridge was stocked well every day. The beach was close to us so I had the same spot every day. I thought that it would be a problem finding a spot every day due to it being the March break but you would never know it. I got up at 6:30 AM every morning and claimed my area. The restaurant, bar and washrooms were right beside us, what more could you ask for. The food in the reastraunts were great, we never had any bouts of sickness and we ate lots of everything. You just have to be careful when you eat at some of the out door reastraunts during the day and make sure that the hamburgers are cooked. Other than that we had no complaints about the food. The whole resort is imaculate with the grounds being cleaned and maicured all the time. I don't know what people were saying about mosquitoes in some of the reviews but we never saw any.The night life finished at 11PM but the disco is open late. We never had an issue here because we would just order a few extra rounds and stay in the reception area longer. The Micheal Jackson show was so,so. We brought US cash with us which was a great idea as everything is in US funds. I will keep this reveiw short as I could go on and on but the bottom line is The Gran Bahia in my view is a 5 Star Plus resort. It does not matter where you travel there are always going to be negative reveiws from people, mind you some of them are pretty petty. Here is a couple of tips if you plan on staying at the Gran Bahia.(1) Bring US funds(2) Thermos Mugs for cold beverages on beach(3) Keep all reciepts from purchases at Resort(4)Tip the maid and leave a small gift every second day(5) Upgrade to Club Golden package(6) Relax  Enjoy ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1523,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1513},{"endOffset":1523,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1513},{"endOffset":1523,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1513}]}
