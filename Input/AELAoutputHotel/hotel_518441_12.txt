{"text":"Eerie luxury with one fatal flaw I agree wholeheartedly with the two reviews posted below from Brandenburg5 and LikesALittleLuxury. The Chedi Club is wonderful, but has some serious drawbacks and we do not intend on returning.The Chedi Club is beautiful and luxurious, set outside Ubud proper about 15 minutes. Formerly an estate, it has been converted into a collection of luxury villas and bungalows, looking out over the rice paddies. The service is absolutely impeccable, with each villa assigned a butler to help coordinate reservations etc (and yes, I agree with the other reviewer- these people are obviously charged with repeatedly encouraging guests to sign up for revenue-generating hotel activities). The resort is completely private - you never have to leave your villa if you don't want to. Each villa is equipped with what you'd expect of a 5-star resort, including Bose sound system, flat LCD TV, high threadcount sheets, free mini bar etc. Laundry is also included in the room rate.Now onto the problems. One of the first things we noticed were the birds in cages. Everywhere. By the restaurants...outside the villas....in the lobby. You name it, there are birds in cages. This is a little unsettling given you're in the middle of the jungle and it seems that birds should be flying free. But let's put that aside for the moment - the biggest issue with the birds, some of which are PARROTS, is that they shriek and squawk starting around 5 in the morning, and proceed throughout the day. The villas are not sound proofed and it was like having a bird sit on your head to wake you up in the morning. When we complained, to their credit, the staff of the hotel moved two of the birds directly outside our villa and we ended up with 2 quiet mornings before we departed. If you go to the Chedi, request - or demand at these prices - that you be located in a villa without birds nearby. Also a challenge was you need to plan your trips into Ubud if you want to use their shuttle. One morning I called to arrange a shuttle and was told they were all booked at 10 am but I could go at noon. Not a wonderful response at these rates.Other reviewers have commented on the sterile atmosphere. We noticed that as well. While in Bali, we stayed at 4 different resorts, and made friends at all but this one (perhaps because we were so cranky about the birds, no one wanted anything to do with us). Many people seem to stay in their villas all of the time, so you feel you have the whole place to yourself. At first it's nice, but after a couple of days you start feeling like you're in the movie The Shining. One final thing: the restaurant. Breakfast and lunch at the beautiful restaurant, which is in our opinion the best part about the Chedi, were wonderful. Dinner, however, was overpriced (again, we agree with the other reviewers) and inconsistent. The Ahi Tuna was wonderful, but many other dishes were uninspired and bland. Prices were comparable to New York or London, not Ubud, and we've stayed in several 5-stars around Ubud. We noticed the restaurant was empty at dinner most nights and assume that guests take the complimentary shuttle into town for better and less expensive food. The view from the restaurant, which is open-air, was gorgeous, especially at night when they light candles in the rice fields. We also enjoyed complimentary tea at 4 pm every day there, and cocktails from 6-7 pm.In summary -where does that leave us? Very difficult to write a review that's composed of two extremes... we would recommend Chedi for the first couple of nights of a honeymoon, where sleep may not be a priority. Chedi is so isolated and such an artificial atmosphere, it's hard to recommend Chedi for anyone who really wants to experience Bali, unless they want to do it in a Disney-atmosphere way. We also stayed at the Warwick Ibah in Ubud during our trip and much preferred this resort - again at 5-star luxury. Read the reviews below carefully... you have been warned!
