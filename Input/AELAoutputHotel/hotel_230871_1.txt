{"text":"Beautiful hotel in a good neighborhood Hotel Air Berlin is an inexpensive hotel near the Tiergarten in the center of Berlin. Location is wonderful; it's very close to several u-bahn stops, as well as some spectacular buildings, sites, and during the holidays, Christmas Markets.I had a single room, and it was the tiniest room I have ever stayed in. I had previously stayed in a hostel in Berlin and my room was much bigger. If you're only there to sleep, it shouldn't be a problem. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. However, there wasn't a trash can in the room; just a tiny one in the bathroom.The decor of the rooms was plain, but the hotel building itself is beautiful. The hallways are exquisite and there is so much detail. The front desk staff was nice. Breakfast is not included in your stay and is, I think, 13 euros.On their web site and on expedia it said wireless was included, but that is false advertisement because while they do offer wireless access, it's through tmobile and you have to pay extra. The only plans offered for access are 8 euros for an hour, or 29 euros for 30 days. I am a student and while traveling in Europe, needed to have access to the internet for more than an hour at a time in order to attend my classes via webcam, so even though I was only at the hotel for one night, I had to spend 29 euros for the 30 day tmobile pass to sit through a 3 hour lecture and then do a lab and a quiz. If the hotel doesn't actually offer this service and the service comes at a much higher cost, they should put that on their site because I honestly wouldn't have stayed here had I known, since I knew I would've been spending 5 or 6 hours using wireless.
