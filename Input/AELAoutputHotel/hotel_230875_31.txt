{"text":"great location, friendly staff, nice hotel We stayed at the Radisson SAS Amsterdam for 3 nights over easter 2008. Booked the hotel online via Expedia.de.First of all, the location of the hotel is perfect, right in the middle of the city, at the edge of famous red light district and at a little canal.We knew the hotel from passing by at several other visits in amsterdam, so I knew it has a huge atrium lobby with rooms facing into the lobby.So I mailed to the hotel, that we would like a non-smoking room with two beds with a window to the street. I assume windows opening to the lobby make the room sticky since you dont get fresh air from the outside.Arriving at the hotel we learned, that they could fulfill all of our wishes and we got a very nice room on 4th floor - 406.Compared to the Marriott where we usually stay rooms are smaller, but still very nice. Bathrooms need some renovation, but still OK, nice amenities and good water pressure.Staff all over the hotel is really nice and helpful. We did not eat at the hotel since its very pricy, bar is very cosy but also exxpensive.Very positive: Hotel has free internet wifi access all over if you bring a laptop and offers free access to the internet in the business center including printing.On departure day we asked for late checkout and were allowed to check-out at 3 PM.Again, a very nice hotel, PERFECT location, rooms are OK, staff is very helpful and friendly, we would stay there again.One additional tipp: If you are looking for great, local food. For 9 years now we have dinner at our favourite restaurant in Amsterdam. Very close to the Radisson in a little street, Berenstraat 12-Family owned, very cosy atmosphere, great food. Also a lot of locals eat there, thats always a good sign for us. Make sure you reserve in advance, since its quite small, they get full every night.http:\/\/www.zwaantje.demon.nl\/ ","annotations":[{"endOffset":753,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":749},{"endOffset":915,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":911},{"endOffset":1353,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1349}]}
