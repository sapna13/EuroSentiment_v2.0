{"text":"The best vacation ever!!! I have just returned from one of the best vacations ever at the Catalonia in Punta Cana!The hotel itself is very nice and well mentained. The lobby is very nice and tropical loved the side beds near the casino. The floors are always sparkling clean, however the walkway to the beach and all the villas gets very slippery when it rains - so becareful!! The people that worked at the resort were the best part of the vacation. They were so nice and friendly, it was a pleasure dealing with them. and I LOVED how they would always sing and dance wether they were cooking or bar tending or behind a counter at one of the shops, they were just always full of spirit. As for the entertainment team: Mario, Kate, Jennifer and Shane - amazing group of people. Very friendly and outgoing, they made our vacation this much better. Michael at the lobby bar - I LOVE HIM!! the greatest bartender!The service was excellent. Guest services would call everyday to ensure that everything was going ok!! it was safe enough for you to leave your valuable stuff in your room and ensure they'd be there upon your return. As for the resort activities. They'd begin around 9:30am by the beach and end around 5\/6 by the pool. The activities are alot of fun, it gets people to interact with one another and you end up meeting tons of people. The beach party night was a blast, a good start to the week (but it kinda set the bar too high for what to expect for the rest of the week) should have it twice a week maybe?. The shows are great the dancing is a little repetitive, but still very entertaining to watch. Miguel (the guy with the ponytail - not sure if that's his name) - amazing dancer!!! Love the dancing before and after the show with the entertainers!! really good idea!! keeps the guests entertained! love the chocolata song!The club was a good added tough to end the night, it got packed on fridays and saturdays! As for the resturants the japanese and the mexican were amazing. the pizza beside the pool - YUM!! ok, getting tired of typing so to sum it all up. amazing resort, amazing staff and an amazing experience!!! definatly would go back..
