{"text":"Second Visit...even more impressive than the first!!!! This was my second visit to the Langham and it was nothing short of fantastic .I arranged for the Limo, which for 3 people works out at around 200HK ($30A) more than the Airport ExpressIts door to door and Luxury all the way.The location of this hotel is perfect ,close to the markets ,adjoining a huge shopping centre and the MTR which takes you anywhere,but to be honest when there is 3 people its almost as cheap to use a taxi .The area around the hotel is very local and very safe you dont get all the touts trying to sell you suits and foot massages etc as you do in TST .Its a great area to just walk aroundWe had booked a suite on the club floor and it was fantastic We made full use of the Club Lounge which is open 24 \/7 for drinks,snacks or just enjoying the view .Our suite was spacious and had everything you could want for a totally enjoyable stayLovely bathroom ,great TV and sound . The the bed was a little hard for my liking and when I mentioned this to the club receptionist it was fixed in an instant.This time we also tried a couple of the restaurants including the dim sum restaurant and had an exceptional meal at a great price.One final note I met a lady in the lift and I asked her if she liked the hotel as much as I did ,which she very honestly answered that she was the wife of the GM and appreciatted my commentsDo I have one complaint ---yes I only stayed 3 nights -3 weeks would have been better ","annotations":[{"endOffset":94,"mention":"Langham","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Langham_Place_Hotel","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Langham_Hotel,_London"],"startOffset":87},{"endOffset":701,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":697}]}
