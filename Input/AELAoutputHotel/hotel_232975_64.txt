{"text":"A Gem We were delighted to find availability here when booking late for a quick 4 -day trip to look over some art schools in Florence. Guilia and Federico could not have been more helpful handling our booking (by email - in English - and with a couple of telephone calls, for the reason described below). We were offered for no extra cost the epicure + glamour package that consisted of some lovely goodies (organic olive oil, balsamic vinegar, preserves) and tickets to a fabulous exhibition on the history of contemporary haute couture in the Palazzo Strozzo. Which was a wonderful way to spend Sunday afternoon. But back to the hotel. We also accepted, 2 days before arriving, an 'upgrade' at no extra charge to the 2 bedroom suite on the 3rd Floor. This suited us, as a couple + single, gave us loads of space, with sitting room, kitchen, 2 bathrooms, etc. It was peaceful: v. little street noise. (Windows are double -or triple glazed, in any case). I guess it helped the hotel's occupancy rate too by freeing up the two rooms we had booked. The gastronomic tasting on Friday evening was a treat at √à√\u2020√ü? each including a couple of glasses of wine and some terrific local delicacies. We didn't need a restaurant after that, so we went to a fine little wine bar called Coquinarius in the Via delle Oche. However we succumbed to the temptation of a few crostini and some salad after the first bottle of a delicious red Bolgheri. (No, I hadn't heard of it either). But back to the hotel:The location is wonderful, very convenient for Duomo and Academia - only 5 minutes walk from the very heart of the city.Staff were unfailingly helpful, booking taxi's  making reservations for museums, galleries and restaurants cheerfully and efficiently. We'll definitely come back - If it's just the 2 of us, then we'll ask for a room on the 1st floor, as these are more impressive and seem more luxurious than those on the 2nd and the Suite on the 3rd.
