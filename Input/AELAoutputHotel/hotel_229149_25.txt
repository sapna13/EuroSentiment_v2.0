{"text":"An experience in minimalism Lately I have been making a study of sorts about how little space one really needs to live comfortably, What with Flat screen TVs, Stereo equipment that gives fabulous sound from a shelf top unit the size of Kleenex box and all manner of other downsized home furnishings, who needs a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢c Mansion√à√\u2020\u2022? So it was interesting to check in to a single √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºtar√à√\u2020\u2022?room at the Ramada City Centre Amsterdam. This is a small space about 6 x7 feet with a tiny triangular annex bathroom the size one might find in a train compartment. Some interior decorator went to incredible lengths to make this tiny space look larger than it is. The carpet runs up one wall. The bunk like bed is mounted against another and a desk and small closet complete the furnishings. The desk chair is clear Mylar plastic (and very uncomfortable). The strange (and I suspect rather expensive) bathroom door is made of heavy tempered glass, and swing s out not in. The middle of the glass is frosted but the top and bottom are clear creating an effect not unlike a public restroom. It does allow light to pass through making the space a bit brighter which was probably the idea. Staying in a single room alone this is innocuous enough but if one was sharing with anything but a very intimate (and good natured) partner it would be kind of creepy. The bathroom sink and small glass surround allows no space to put anything like cosmetics or even a tooth brush. Storing cosmetics on the floor may be a bit off putting especially for the ladies who may also not like the lack of a tub..Still except for these minor issues the space actually works and is quite comfortable. Honorable mention goes to the semi circular shower which actually has doors that close, not one of those silly glass half panels that European hotels often have. The bathroom actually stays dry. The price was reasonable by local standards especially when you factor in the free wireless Internet which can cost upwards of 22 Euro a day even in some 5 star properties in Amsterdam. Would I stay here again alone? Sure no problem. With a companion? Only if she√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a really good sport ","annotations":[]}
