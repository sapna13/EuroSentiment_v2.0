{"text":"Ron,Judith\/Hull,England. My wife and I stayed from 24th July until 7th August,when we arrived we were greeted with a glass of champagne,which was great,we booked in and where taken to our room,the mini bar in the room was fully stocked and the room was clean and tidy,good start.The first morning we had breakfast and headed for the beach,the sea was blue and the sun hot,plenty of sun beds and shade if required what a start.The restaurants we visited the first week were very good and we got to talk to the head chef and he gave us some recommendations on what to try,he was spot on.The 2nd week the head chef was on vacation and what a differance.We booked a romantic meal in the Lobster house as it was our 28th wedding anniversary,turned up dressed for the occation only to be told they knew nothing about it and told to go to the bar,we had booked this meal well in advance and had a ticket to prove it,the girl who greets you on arrival and the same girl who told us to go to the bar tried to get the booking slip from us and when I refused to hand it over was very indignant with us,the next morning we were offered in compensation Spa treatments at a reduced rate but when we tried to get them,they said they knew nothing about the offer so we gave up,but we did get a bottle of champagne and a bottle of wine in the room,both of which you could get from the bar at any time of the day.As I have already said the room was clean and tidy but some days the maid did,nt turn up until 5 o clock in the afternoon,now this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel,well my wife and I have stayed in some of the best 5 star hotels around the world,this is not one of them,dont get me wrong, the staff are great and the entertainment was good,but this hotel is trading on the reputation of the previous owners,Secrets Exellence,and I,m sorry to say this but 5 star it is not,other guests we met had similar experences.Big shout to Kenny,Josey and Amerilys at the Cafe Bar near to the beach,they were Excellente and kept us well serviced with a drink and kept everyone entertained at all times of the day.We made some good friends whilst we were their,Kev and Claudia,Mike and Kathy,we had a ball especially on our fishing trip,sorry you did,nt hook the Marlin Kev,but hey next time mate.All in all a good holiday,but as far as a 5 star hotel, I'm afraid not. Go on the Mega Truck to see the island with Munchie absulutely fantastic. Dress code - we had a meal next to a couple in the French restaurant, him in a open shirt and the female in very short hot pants and a revealing top, and as for manners they were none existent,we felt sorry for the poor waiter who had the misfortunate of serving them,they say ignorance is bliss,how true. Be very very wary of the casino,you have been warned, I will leave it at that. ","annotations":[]}
