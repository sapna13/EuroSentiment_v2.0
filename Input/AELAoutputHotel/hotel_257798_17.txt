{"text":"Genuine 1970s theme I have stayed here dozens of times - really only because of it's location - it's very close to my Sydney office. But really everything about this place is very variable...- The quality of the decor in the rooms varies - depending on if\/how recently the room was upgraded. - The quality of the service is variable - the wake-up call doesn't always happen.Good luck using the bedside in-built clock radio - the thing is so old that the labels on the buttons have worn off !- The aircon is variable - sometimes it works well and is quite - sometimes it doesn't work well, sometimes it sounds like the space shuttle in launching in your room.- TV - a couple of times my TV wouldn't turn off at all !- Breakfast - you are forced to choose if you want the full greasy buffet or the continental buffet before you sit down ! Which means you can't look at the quality of the cooked food to see if you fancy it or not.- In heavy rain - I have seen the staff collecting water in buckets in the lobby.- I'm not sure how breakfast bread can be that stale....There have been some recent attempts to update this place - the lifts have been done up (probably about 15 years too late) - they upgraded some of the restaurant area.... but it's all still a bit 1970s brown.....Still there is one thing - it can be pretty cheap...
