{"text":"Great place! The Affinia Dumont is a great base in New York. It's a tiny bit off the beaten track and in an area that, in countless trips to NYC, I hadn't been to before. This didn't detract from our experience at all - in fact it was great seeing a new bit of the city. The Affinia Dumont is a few minutes from the Hudson River and about 10-15 mins stroll in a straight line to Macy's and the Empire State. Since it's in mid-town it's perfectly located if you want to go either downtown to the Village or uptown to Central Park and the shops at the top of 5th Avenue - both are a relatively cheap cab ride away. My biggest recommendation is to stay local for breakfast though. When we first arrived we staggered out to find somewhere to eat and stumbled across Penelopes, the cutest little cafe\/diner a few blocks away (turn left out of the Affinia, left at the top of the road and it's on the corner of 32nd or 33rd). Go early or late for breakfast at the weekends because it fills up FAST but don't miss the nutella french toast and definitely throw the diet out for a night and try a burger for dinner, one of the best I've ever had...Back to the hotel - beds are SUPER comfy, the size of the room is great, bathroom is all you'd expect with lots of lovely towels, on-site gym is a really great bonus and staff are very helpful (we asked for a cot for my niece and, unlike in some other hotels we looked at, were told that this was no problem at no cost). Ask for a room on one of the top floors and get a fabulous view of the Hudson at night too.My only gripe with the Affinia is that I turned 30 while I was there and my dad had read that they treat you to a cake on your birthday and mentioned it in advance. Thankfully I didn't know this so didn't expect anything but no cake ever appeared so don't expect one if you too have also read about it and go to NYC for your birthday!
