{"text":"really good stay A group of 12 of us stayed at the Agon Opera for three nights in late March 07. The staff were pleasant and helpful; they even purchased flowers and chocolates at my request and arranged for them to be in our room on arrival (it was my wife's 50th birthday). The rooms were clean and a reasonable size. There were no tea\/coffee making facilities which was disappointing, especially as we thought we had seen them advertised on the hotel web-site, but otherwise everything was fine. Breakfast was also fine - continental style but plenty of choice. The reception doubles up as a bar, so we were able to have a nightcap before heading off to bed. There is also free access to the internet - just one terminal in the reception area though. Location wise the hotel is a little bit away from the main attractions but there are plently of taxis around - taxi stand just outside the hotel - and if you have a car-load it actually works out really cheap. There's a good Irish bar a short walk from the hotel (actually closer than the one the previous reviewer found), and also a number of reasonably priced restuarants. We actually eat in the revolving restaurant in the TV Tower the night of wife's birthday, which was a really nice experience - if there's group of you they do set menus - five course meal starting at 38 euros which is pretty good value, given the quality of the food, and the really excellent location. Like other reviewers we didn't get to see all that we wanted (which probably means a return visit sometime soon) but we did get to see the Riechstag - had to queue for 90 mins though which was a bit of a nuisance - suggest you get there early to avoid the crowds; it opens at 0800hrs. To sum up, the Agon Opera is a reasonably priced mid-range hotel, not much to look at but rooms are a good size, staff are helpful and breakast is reasonably substantial. Recommended.
