{"text":"Excellent Hotel experience Arrived at Central Station after catching the train from the Airport and kept right as we walked out of the Hotel. We crossed the road to be standing at the bottom of Nieuwezijds Voorbergwaal road. About 100 metres up on the left you will see the Hotel. Arrived at reception and the young girl was welcoming and informed us that our room was not quite ready, but she took my mobile number and said she would call when it was, so we could go for a wonder around the city. Once we were booked in our baggage was taken and stored until we were able to get into our room. About an hour later we returned to the Hotel and were shown directly to our room which as clean and well maintained with a good selection of toiletries. Bed was very comfy and had trouble getting off of it in the morning. Hotel bedroom was quiet and cleaned twice every day (in the morning and a turndown service in the evening) During our stay the staff were very friendly and professional and I would recommend this Hotel to someone who likes to be close to everything, but not quite in the middle.Within a 1 minute walk from the Hotel are a selection of bars and resturants and many places to have breakfast. Also a number of coffee shops are easily accessable if thats your thing. The Red Light District is a short 7 minute stroll away from the Hotel across the Damrak.
