{"text":"Great location We booked this hotel through hotels.nl after searching reviews both on here and their website and having had some dubious experience with hotels in Amsterdam before.Location-wise this hotel is fantastic, it's right opposite Centraal Station so no taxi's required from the station and it's right in the heart of Amsterdam, within walking distance to Dam Square, the Red Light District and all the great bars and restaurants.This hotel is clean and fairly comfortable and believe me, I have stayed in a lot worse in Amsterdam. I think the price you pay possibly reflects the location rather than the hotels amenities but in general I thought this hotel was fine for the price.The hotel reception is open, clean and welcoming, the front door is locked and opened only by the hotel staff which makes it really safe once you are inside. There are a few steep steps up the reception area which may pose a problem for those less able as the staff do not have a concierge service, although we did not have a problem.The corridors are narrow which is pretty much the same in every hotel I have stayed in this city and sometimes the corridors smelt of cannabis smoke and although this did not pose a problem for us it may for others. I would suggest though that you will find this in most hotels unless you go to the really expensive upmarket hotels.The bedroom was a little cramped, we had a double on the second floor and there wasnt much room to walk around after the case was put on the floor, the wardrobe was a good size, one half was shelving and the other half was hanging space although there were only 4 hangers so there is a limit to what you can hang up unless you take your own.The bathroom was lovely, very clean and a good size, the shower was excellent and there were clean towels every day. The room was cleaned and the bed remade every day, I could not fault the cleaning staff at all.We never used the breakfast option when we booked as I knew there were loads of nice cafes for breakfast nearby.On the down side, the hotel charge for storing luggage on the day of departure which I think is a bit of a rip-off. It's a standard rate of 5 euros which I think is steep considering we were only leaving our case for 1 hour. On check-out they don't print you out a receipt and I think they may have over-charged us for the mini-bar, their card machine was not working either when we checked out which meant we had to go to find an ATM to get cash before we were able to leave. Luckily we had plenty time before our flight or this may have become a problem.I thought 10 euros for internet access per day was a little steep, although the wireless connection was perfect and we never had any problems at all.We had a room at the back of the hotel (room 243) which was fantastic as there was no noise issues at all. The room was always nice and warm too, but not stuffy.All in all, I think I would go back to this hotel which is a first for me in Amsterdam.
