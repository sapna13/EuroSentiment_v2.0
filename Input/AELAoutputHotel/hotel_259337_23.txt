{"text":"Not perfect, but you'll love it! Hope this helps...Weather:amazing, even with the threat of hurricane seasonit only rained one day but the rest was unbelievable!Food: 9\/10...very cheesey, great selection, great quality\/quantity, dont count on good sushi if you're a sushi lover like me... it's not the same.... but all other theme nights were awesome!Sports bar has the same selections though : pizza(awesome) burgers, fries, salad, popcorn etc...open 24\/7 which is very convenient after the disco:)Service: crappy lobby service, there's a pretty girl with blue eyes who speaks english  treated my boyfriend like SH** when he asked a question, I shut her up tho :) Poolbar service is slooowww in the pool, but the dry section is pretty good...All restaurant service is excellent!! Those waiters\/waitresses deserve those tips!Beach: stunning! lots of boobies tho so if you're bringing children, or are insecure  bringing boyfriend, you've been warned! It's not that bad tho, no one's bouncing around...Disco: lots of fun! Great service, great crowd, very big so never too crowded!Rooms: pretty good, little creepy crawlies on the floor tho ( just tiny baby ants)  we had a little friendly lizard livin on our ceiling for a day or two... Excersion: we booked w a guy from Extreme (not affiliated w the hotel) so make sure the weather is good before you book. We almost got screwed, paid 110US for the both of us  the day we booked for the ATV excursion rained like a mofo  we couldnt find the rep or anyone to tell us it was cancelled so we thought we got ripped off. Fortunately, the rep showed up (an hour after we were supposed to leave)  gave us our money back. Our friends who we met up with there did the ATV  loved it so dont be discouraged, just make sure the weather is good before you book it. Pool is great, very refreshing the activities are fun  we won a few bottles of rum so we were pretty happy:)It's a very big resort but once you follow the paths, you'll get used to it... The a la carte: was pretty good, 8\/10... service takes a while depending on how busy it is... desserts are delish!Live entertainment is truely fantastic.... in the lobby  in the theatre... the michael jackson show is insane! Those dancers are talented!  the live music in the lobby is what we looked forward to after dinner when we just wanted to chill, drink, play cards or just have a cigar.... very relaxing!The gift shops are ok, arm a leg if you ask me so come prepared!!There's a mall about a ten minute cab drive away that has cheaper suveniers but more expensive clothing but wonderful unique styles... called Palm Real...phone cards there are10US as opposed to 20US at the hotel ...just a quick tip.Overall it was beautiful! I would highly recommend it to everyone!
