{"text":"Doesn't live up to its reviews I stayed in this property alone for 2 nights on my way to visiting a friend in Andorra. I selected the property based on the rave reviews and was most disappointed. The hotel is trying so hard to be hipper than hip but at the end of the day, the value is very poor. The room was just OK and smaller than a typical 5-star hotel. The electrical socket in the bathroom doesn't actually do anything and when I called for help they just took my shaver and plugged it into a socket on the floor in the bedroom. Same for making morning coffee in the room. Hmm?! I paid a very high rate which did not even include breakfast. Upon check-in they went out of their way to point this out to me and that breakfast was available in their restaurant at 23 Euros. I passed.OK the location is geat but there are other properties at lower prices equally well located.Overall. I found the hotel quite pretentious but very ordinary and poor value for money. I have given a lot of thought to why the reviews of this property are so good and I can't really figure this out. I do spend a lot of time in Asian hotels where far better rooms are generally available at far lower rates in 5-star properties. Perhaps I am spoiled for choice by this. It's not really the price. i don't mind paying a high price but I do expect value and this hotel simply did not deliver.I would definitely not stay here again or recommend it to others.
