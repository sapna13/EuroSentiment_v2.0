{"text":"Great location, average hotel Like many travellers before me I highlight the location of the hotel as its main attraction. Indeed, airport bus stop literally around the corner, takes you 15 minutes to and fro. Metro stop at the doorstep. Conference hall - for those of us on business trip - at the same roundabout. A walk downtown though - for instance to Ramblas, port area - takes you at least over half an hour. Just going for a stroll and immediately be in the nicest area of Barcelona therefor is not what you should expect, you'll have to take the metro at least one or two stops. The hotel is huge, certainly not intimate and cosy. Large groups of tourists gather in the lounge. Breakfast ditto: wide choice, but one has to be used to eating with hundreds of others. Rooms are large, bathroom good, some repair and maintenance would not be bad. TV set for instance did not work, was only fixed after 24 hours. Very expensive Internet connection in the room (22 euro's for 24 hours, expensive considering that one at least sleeps around 8 hours of this time phrame). I rather favour the option of other hotels to give you IN TOTAL 24 hours surfing time (clock stops ticking when you log off). Rooms at road side to be preferred, fabulous view, bit noisy due to traffic. Health club very old, dark, not equiped with the latest machines to put it mild. Have not been able to find a sauna. Swimming pool is on the roof, small, not very well maintained, but nice to be in the open, with great view over the city. Not a soul seems to supervise that part of the hotel, one can be alone for many hours. All in all, I enjoyed the stay but things could be improved.
