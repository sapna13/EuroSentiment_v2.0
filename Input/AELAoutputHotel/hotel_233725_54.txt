{"text":"Great for a first Paris visit We booked nearly five months ahead. Specifically asked for e renovated room with good views- as advised by others in this forum. We arrived around 10:30 am, really tired. Expected to be told that we could not check in yet, but they asked us to wait in the lounge for 15 minutes while getting the room ready. Offered us coffee. We had a Junior suite on the fourth floor, with a very narrow balcony (single file standing!). Wonderful view- Eiffel tower, Jardin de Toulieres, Louvre, Orsay, National assembly building. That night there were fireworks near Eiffel, we had a balcony seat! Never tired of watching the Eiffel tower at night.Clean room, one queen bed and a sofa bed. Rather thin, but clean carpet. Furniture looked good, not chain hotel type. Some ill fitting drawers. Large bathroom and separate toilet (but no place to wash hands in toilet). A separate shower. Difficult to keep the shower head up properly, the wall fitting was not strong enough. But on the whole, very adequate. Noise from street can be bothersome, but very tolerable if you can use earplugs at night.Hotel staff were courteous. However, they had trouble calling in restaurant reservations- forgot twice! Have to pay for Internet access. This hotel is very convenient for the main tourist attractions and sits near some very expensive hotels. I recommend this hotel for a first time visit to Paris, one can walk to all the attractions. Avoid the nearby cafes, venture out a little. The nearby Marche st-Honore square has a bakery, good cafes, a laundromat. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":355,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":349}]}
