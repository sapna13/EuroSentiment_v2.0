{"text":"6lbs heavier... weightwatchers here I come (AGAIN) Have just returned this morning...6lbs heavier in 10 days.Great trip, helped by good flights with mytravel, we struck lucky and got a good flight deal and paid just √ä√£¬¢15 each for extra leg room (each way !)Were very lucky that we missed the end of Hurricane Noel, weather was fab.First must do, is pack zillions of mossie stuff in your suitcase,nearly everyone at the hotel was suffering with bites, and although there is on on site pharmacy it was very expensive.Fodd, huge choce, great service and never had a problem with trying to get a reservation at any restaurant (worth going early in the morning, they open for 0800 for reservations for that night ot from 1600=1800 for same evening.Found trips through all companied to be very pricey about $140 for two for the cheapest trip and upwards, after recovering from cabin fever rapidly decided to stay put for 10 days of PURE RELAXATION!Cocktails were fab, good measures and choice, Mamujuana the local stuff is a brain blower, so watch out\/The Animation team at the hotel were excellent, many activities if you want to join in, but no pressure if you don't, they will leave you well alone.Stayed onTropical side, good large rooms and great housekeeping, try and get a room upstairs if you can, nicer balconies.Well time to have the one thing we missed whilst away, a good old curry...so hope you will enjoy your sat as much as we did and as a footnote if you are booking the old rectory guest house at Gatwick for pre-departure night, cancel at once, it is the dirtiest place I ahve ever seen in my life, we checked in and out and stayes at the Manor House.Hope this helpsRegardsJayne ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1391,"mention":"curry","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Curry_powder","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Curry"],"startOffset":1386}]}
