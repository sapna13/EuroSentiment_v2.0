{"text":"`Will definitely be back!!!! Having spent weeks searching the internet for a hotel in London, we settled on the Luna Simone on the Belgrave Road. We were looking for a place with good links to the city centre, with breakfast included and value for money (in a city where hotels are way over priced!). I found the Luna Simone thanks to the Tripadvisor website and was very happy with my choice.We travelled from Stansted airport with the Terravision bus to Victoria station and from there the hotel was a short walk over Eccleston Bridge and down Belgrave Road.Our room was on the ground floor nearest tot he reception desk so thankfully we didn't have to haul our bags up the stairs! We never heard any noise form the street in front either. The room was on the small side but immaculately clean with the most comfortable bed I've slept in while on holidays. There was a much needed fan over the bed (weather was roasting!) and a good sized safe in the wardrobe. Breakfast was great and filled us up for the day.Free internet access was a bonus too.Number 24 bus stops outside the hotel and goes in the direction of Westminister, Trafalgar Square and beyond so that was handy but we mainly used the Tube from Pimlico station and got a day ticket each day.Belgrave seemed to be a very quiet area, lots of lovely local bars and restaurants and plenty of nearby shops for bottled water etc.Overall we had a very pleasant experience at the Luna Simone. For location and value it is top notch. I like to travel and have been abroad 5 times in the past 11 months and so I feel that I have alot to compare this hotel to.I would definitely recommend it and will be back again before the end of the year.
