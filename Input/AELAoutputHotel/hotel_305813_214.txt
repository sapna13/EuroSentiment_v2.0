{"text":"Good value for money for HK I lived in Langham Place for 4 months in 2007 and have stayed there a total of 10 or so times in the past few years.The basic rooms are small and the finish on many rooms is a little cheap for a 5 star (veneer panelling, poor grouting technique in the bathrooms, cheap knobs and buttons etc), but the rooms are generally well appointed, modern, feel clean and new and are good value for money for what you get in Hong Kong. (I lived here remember, so I experienced many, many, many rooms so maybe I am being a little fussy, but hey.... I kept coming back).I would recommend upgrading to the executive room as the bathrooms are that little bit nicer with glass walls and separate shower.The hotel pool is small but nice, and the change rooms (AKA, relaxing havens) are wonderful. I used them all the time as they felt like a day spa. They had piped relaxing music, stone finishes, candles, plunge pool, sauna, steam room, mirror backed showers, lockers, facilities for getting ready like hairdryers, cotton buds, mini towels. They even have a machine that sucks the water from your swimsuit! The staff are great and we have always had a great time here. The 'pink ladies' manning the lifts are useless, but a nice touch! lol.I always get my family and friends to consider staying here when they visit Hong Kong because the suburb of Mong Kok is a great base for tourists. At the Lanham Place, you step out of your luxe hotel into the one of the most densely populated parts of Hong Kong and are in the thick of things. It is right near the Mong Kok MTR and hundreds of buses to almost every part of Hong Kong run up and down Nathan Rd which is close by.The Langham Place Mall (shopping) is connected to the hotel and has some OK restaurants and kitsch Asian shopping experiences. Also, if you wanted to walk through this mall to the MTR and travel to many other shopping malls underground by train all across HK, you could in fact never have to go outside if it's bucketing with rain or hot. At the end of the day, the hotel bar is great and they always have jazz singers to entertain. It's a great spot to meet before heading out.All of the Qantas staff stay here too, so it's interesting to watch the pilots and stewards arriving and departing for each flight to and from Melbourne\/Sydney. At least you always know when you'd better leave for the airport to catch your flight back home!
