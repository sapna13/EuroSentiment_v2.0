{"text":"paradise gone bad We have recently came back to what we hoped,a great 15 year anniversary trip. This place came highly reconmend to us by people who have traveled extensively and who I trust. The hotelis renoun for its service our so we thought. I booked through the casino at the resort because me and my wife like to gamble a little. The casnio is small but with a cosy personailty. Here is where the nightmare began on our anniversary night we had a great dinner at the strip house with is a premire steak house the food was excellent and service was above average. We decided to go to the casino around 11.30 p.m. for texas holdem limt play . My wife gracelessly asked if I would like to take the only empty seat at the one table they had. I sat down while she put her name on the waiting list for the next seat several others that came in after us also put there name on the waiting list. About 35 minutes went by, be for there was a open seat at the table, a gentleman who had just arrived at the casino took a seat my wife informed the dealer that she had been waiting for the seat for 35 minutes and her name was next on the list. The dealer continued to ignore her and continued to allow the gentleman who afford to give the seat up since there was a waiting list the dealer informed my wife that he would have the seat since he is a man and she could wait. Sexual Discrimanation at its worst she in formed the pit bose who also ignoed her and then procedded to ask for the casnio manager who also gave her lip service wanting to voice my opionin in the mattter but not wanting to trump my wife handling of this matter I continued to be a spectator, after the situation continued with not the slightest apology or resolution ,she told me she was going up stairs to pack and that we checking out after that, but for me to continue my game till then. They had numerous opportunities to apologize to her but they never did . They did offer us dinner on them witch we refused. This casnio is poorly ran with the dealers not knowning the rules and pit boses who are not capable of making sound judgements as to the gaming rules , not all the dealers and pit boses, but most are poorly trained . When my wife came down to say she was ready to check out at 3.00am, I gatherd my chips and in the hast to leave took my cards that we in play at the table with my chips. They offerd me a 3 night comp Till this day I have never recieved our room comp that they said should make up for the blatent sexual discrimination that presist in the el conquistador resorts casino . .So women beware sexual discrimination is alive and well in that resort. It truely could be one of the premire resorts in the caribbean, It is a shame the management will not step up and address this issue, as any competent resort would. They will never make that 5 star if this is not changed .
