{"text":"Great hotel. Minor flaws I just returned from a long three weeks touring Australia. Having never been there I decided to go with a travel expert. She gave me a few hotels to choose from and I chose the Rydges World Square in Sydney for the location, but got a lot more.The location is in the heart of the CBD and has connections to just about anywhere you wanted to go. The front desk people were very professional and accomodating. Especially since I arrived in Sydney at 7:30 am only to find (understandably) that my reserved King room was not ready. I was SO tired that I asked the nice man behind the desk if I could upgrade to a suite for a few nights. He found me a suite but that room was not ready also. Later on we found out that the whole city was sold out because of a big concert, a few major rugby games plus it was student holiday! It was remarkable that they even found me a room. I checked my bags with conceirge and left for only one hour. I came back to find my bags checked into my room and was ready to go! The suites are beautiful except for the room I got has two bathrooms, which is great except the first one by the front door smelled SO badly that I had to close the door and not use it. It smelled like sewage. I don't know what the problem was but I was not going to complain, since there were no other rooms for me to go into. With your executive suite, you also get access to an executive lounge which twice a day would offer a complimentary breakfast and in the evening a happy hour with wine\/beer and appetizers. It had to be the best deal in town. The food was excellent and the lounge was peaceful and quiet. Even when they were not open officially for happy hour, you were allowed to go into the room, with your hotel room key and they would leave snacks out for you, like cookies or fruit.That was a highlight of extra customer service and for a room that was not that much more.The only problem we had was one night there were loud kids at the dance bar across street that kept us up until 4 am. That was the only complaint. If you book a room ask for a room on the higher level floor. You won't hear so much street noise.I'd stay there again. WE were able to walk everywhere plus there is a shopping mall on a lower level right under the hotel. It has a small grocery store and liquor store, plus a japanese market and food booths if you didn't feel like going out.I would like to see Sydney in their summer next time.
