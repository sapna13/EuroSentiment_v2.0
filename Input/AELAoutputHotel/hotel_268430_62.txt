{"text":"Mixed feelings After a 10 hour flight to San Juan, we arrived at the Courtyard by Marriott Isla Verde, a hotel highly recommended by many Tripadvisor readers. A short unspectacular driveway from the street to the hotel and a reception area that is overwhelmed by adjacent casino activities did not provide an initial wow factor, and we immediately questioned ourselves whether the long journey was worthwhile. (It also made us think twice about tripadvisor comments). The spacious room and comfortable bed compensated our feelings. However the carpet was very damp and the room air much more humid than at other Caribbean hotels we stayed. (We asked about the carpet situation the following day, but did not receive a response). Daylight revealed a nice beach, however the water was more of a surfer's delight. The pool and surrounding garden area were unspectacular.  Overall our positive feelings about the hotel are:-The room was a good size, clean and with a comfortable bed (although feather\/down pillows were scarce).-The staff members are excellent- friendly, and helpful.-The night music is great- the place really swings during weekends with locals who dance fantastic.-The breakfast buffet was good and reasonably priced (for San Juan). Our negatives were:-The reception area and outside grounds are not to par of other Caribbean hotels in the same price range. They looked tired. The feeling of being on vacation was diminished.-The casino appears to be the main focus of the hotel. -The airport runway is very close to the hotel (the takeoffsstart at a runway parallel to the hotel about 300 meters away). The hotel has tried to quench the noise, although it is not entirely successful (our room faced the ocean not the runway).-Isla Verde is quite far from areas of interest such as Old Juan (a $20 20-minute cab ride) or any shopping area. The few restaurants near the hotel were several blocks away. Stores (clothing, art, etc) are not near the hotel. -The supper cafe is squeezed in a small paved area between the beach and the hotel. The supper prices are a bit outrageous even for San Juan. -There should be more information about local activities, such as placement in the rooms of booklets such as Places to Go- your passport to San Juan and Que Pasa rather than by-chance enounter at the conciege desk. Copies of the local newspaper were scarce (even at the hotel store).If we had to do it again we would look for a place at the Condado area where there is more activiity and proximity to places of interest- the total cost of the Marriott at Condado would have been the same, given that the latter offered one night free following 4 nights occupancy.
