{"text":"the best yet We stayed at the Casablanca hotel for 6 nights in Nov 07.We like everyone else had high expectations from all the excellent reviews on trip adviser and we can only whole heartedly agree. From the moment we pulled up in the taxi the doorman was ready to take our cases , all of the staff were very friendly and chatty and always ready to help and if they didnt know anything they would get back to you.Our room was on the 3rd floor we were offered a room at the back or the front, we chose the front whats the point of being in new york with out the noise. The room was very clean and homely with bathrobes and slippers the bed was big enough with comfy pillows, we had a tv with a large selection of channels there was also a dvd player with complementary dvds available from reception (and all of the films were set in or named after new york it was a nice touch and you'd be surprised how many films there are).The bathroom was small but well equipt with nice toiletries and all mod cons including a phone (well you never know when u'll get the urge to chat) theres also a safe in the room which was complementary. Ricks cafe was really nice and a relaxing place to sit and chat there was a good selection of bagels and coffees in themorning and the wine and cheese was very popular but the room never felt crowded even though most people used it at some point. We have previously stayed at the Marriott Marquis and said that we would go back but with the price increase there we decided to try the casablanca its not cheap but its worth every cent if its all about location then what more could you want than just metres away from times square.
