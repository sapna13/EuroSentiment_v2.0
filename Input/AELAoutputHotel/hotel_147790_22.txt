{"text":"Luxury camping for too much money! A friend and I stayed here while in Vieques for a wedding. Having read the reviews on Trip Advisor, I was at least forewarned about what kind of experience this would be, but I never expected it to be as extreme as it was.As others have stated here, there are people who love this hotel and the experience they get with it, but for about $300 per night, it is really not for me.The good first, the staff is really wonderful and friendly. The pool was cool and natural, the perfect temperature always without the nasty chlorine that is a part of most hotels. We felt safe on the grounds even though there are no lights to see your way around in the dark.Our room was really no more than a garage. Unfinished concrete walls and floors, no rug, paint or much of any decoration. We actually had a heavy garage door that we had to pull up and down if we wanted to access the patio. There were 2 twin beds that were okay, but not luxurious in any way. We spent the 20 minutes before bed every night fighting all manner of bugs (spiders, mosquitos) and other wildlife (iguanas, lizards). Being that the room was all concrete, any natural sound from outside would reverberate loudly around the room and was deafening while you were trying to sleep.Again, the only saving grace was that I was slightly prepared for this from other reviews, but I hoped for the best. I can definitely appreciate the benefit of an eco-friendly enviornment, but I suggest there also be a benefit of less cost to the consumer if there are going to be no luxuries for luxury prices.
