{"text":"Review worth reading I am a Canadian who stayed at the resort from Jan. 19-26, 2008. I have never been to an all inclusive before but I have done alot of travelling in both North America and Europe. I read the mixed reviews on this site before I left and wasn't really sure what to expect. All I can say is WOW- alot of these reviews were way off. I had an EXCEPTIONAL time at the resort. I'd like to begin by saying that the construction in the Main Pool (which now includes a swim up bar) and the lobby are complete. There is still abit of construction on site but it does not affect tourists. The food was good, the staff were pleasant, the animation team was phenominal and the beach was GORGEOUS. Yes, there was a language barrier at times but you need to be patient with yourself and the staff as they are doing their best to accomodate you. In Canada, we wouldn't expect staff in our hotels to learn multiple languages to accomodate tourists, so people need to have the same courtesy when they are visiting other countries- you are on their territory therefore it is up to us to make the effort. I would recommend doing the free activities that the hotel has to offer- snorkelling, Kayaking, etc. but I'd also recommend spending the money on other activities such as Quading with extreme adventures to dominican villages, sugarcane fields, caves and other beaches. It is worth the money. I did travel with people who had been to all inclusives before and they said that this hotel was one of their top hotels that they have stayed at. I would definately stay at this hotel again. I hope this review is helpful to those who are interested in this hotel. ","annotations":[]}
