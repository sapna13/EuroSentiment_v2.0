{"text":"Excellent for the price Some of the other reviews made me concerned, but I decided to go ahead and try this hotel, since the price was right. The room was very clean, with a large bathroom and a window seat. Our window was right on Lombard Street, which is a major thoroughfare, but we did not have any problems with noise since we brought our trusty white noise machine. The free breakfast was much better than I expected after reading the other reviews. Yes, the coffee was instant, but if that's important to you, there is a coffee maker in the room. The organge juice was not top quality, but certainly better than Tang. There were lots of different pastries and fresh fruit and hot chocolate. My kids loved it. You do have to bring the food back to your room to eat it, and there's only one chair there.We arrived with two adults and three kids, and they were fine with us having more people than beds (kids took turns sleeping on the floor). They also let us park our car there before check-in time. My kids also loved the very small, old-fashioned elevator.The hotel seems to be run by a family whose living quarters adjoin the office. The same woman I spoke to on the phone in the early morning and late at night making my reservation (it did take several calls to get the reservation settled) was also there most of the times we went in the office. There was an older guy whose English and computer skills were lacking, but the woman was there to assist him. Location: this is both a plus and a minus. It IS in downtown SF, but is really a hike to most attractions. It was four VERY uphill blocks to a cable car stop; we bought a day pass and rode it all day to Chinatown, Wharf, etc. Then at the end of the day we ran downhill back to the hotel. The crookedest street part of Lombard Street begins where the cable car stop is. The other days we drove our car to our destinations. Golden Gate Bridge and Exploratorium were fairly short drive and had easy and cheap\/free parking. Parking at Pier 39 to go to Alcatraz was expensive. It was hard to find good places to eat dinner nearby. Toward the end of our stay, we discovered that if you go one block north and several blocks west along Chestnut Street, there are lots of neighborhoody shops and restaurants.I think your experience at this hotel partly depends on how much you are paying. Rates seem to vary widely with the season. For the $70\/night I paid, I didn't expect much, and we were quite pleased. If I were paying $200, I would have been disappointed. We were happy to be able to stay IN a city in a clean room at a rate we could afford.
