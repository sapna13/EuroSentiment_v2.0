{"text":"Disappointing Disappointing. On arriving at noon, slightly ahead of normal check-in time, we were happy to be given a split-level room that looked really nice. Because workmen were in the room next door hammering so hard the mirror was shaking on the wall, we decided to go out for the afternoon and look round the hotel later. Got back at 5 to find the work was still going on √à√\u2020\u2022?we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° naively assumed it was just a quick bit of maintenance. So we went to the front desk and asked what was going on. Turns out the work would be ongoing, all day, every day, throughout our stay. With five floors of rooms and a hotel that seemed at best half full, why the **** put us next door to it?To √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√¨pologise√à√\u2020\u2022? they moved us into another room that was an upgrade to a suite. To be honest, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° rather have had the first room, just elsewhere in the hotel. The suite was right at the end of the corridor on the very last floor, and felt like the room that never gets used except for last resorts. The bath was an ancient plastic thing with jets that were broken and rusted. The bedroom, far from the spacious and modern feel the split-level room had had, was a tiny bare room where the bed just fitted in, with nothing on the walls, and a TV with a broken remote control. Being a suite, there was a separate sitting area, which was fine, and a huge hall\/vestibule which was pretty meaningless really √à√\u2020\u2022?what use is that?Worst of all was the constant noise from the plumbing. A steady dripping noise and wheezing pipes, 24 hours a day. The noise of guests in another room flushing the toilet was incredible from our bedroom √à√\u2020\u2022?like a cascading flood, and much much louder than the toilet in our bathroom itself. On several occasions both my wife and I were shocked awake by it. On the second night my wife even went and slept on the sofa in the sitting area as she couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ sleep for the plumbing noises. Hardly five star.I suppose we should have asked to move again, but by then we were fed up and just wanted to leave really. ","annotations":[]}
