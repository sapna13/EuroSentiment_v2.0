{"text":"What a Joke... Terrible place 1) The rooms: To start, when we had just arrived, we're informed by the front desk that there was no king or queen size bed rooms available for the category that we had chosen and paid for (although I had booked on your own website for a king size bed) and we were assigned to a room with 2 single beds and an very nasty mold smell. After begging for a change, the only option that I was given was to upgrade to a royal service room, spending extra 600 dollars for the room for the week. I had no other choice than take it.2) The building: We were given a decent room. The inside of the room was clean and without a mold smell but the outside was a mess. The stairs and the corridors where dirty as I've never seen in any hotel in my life (not even two start road side motels). We had to co-live with dirty and smell and as a consequence, lots and lots of mosquitos. Be prepared because there are lots of them there... 3) Food: I chalenge whoever is reading this email to please go eat at one of the restaurants in the hotel. The food was TERRIBLE and fairly expensive for the quality (avg 60-70 bucks for a very bad food). They cold even mess up a simple french fries (cold and mushy).4) Breakfast: Because we had to pay extra for the room, we had a Continental Breakfast for free at the RS lounge. Should be good thing if it wasnt for the fact that you had to be there very early otherwise you would risk not to have milk or bread.The only good part was the personal. We only found nice people there.
