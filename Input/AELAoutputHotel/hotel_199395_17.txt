{"text":"Good hotel but surrounding area looking old We stayed for 6 nights. The hotel is well run and very friendly, if a little expensive. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff - try the pillow menu!The Spa on the third floor was excellent.We found Sam's Bar to be very pleasant (although expensive) for a late drink or meal.Breakfast was not included. We tried it a couple of times but it was expensive - however the service was excellent.Our room on the 6th floor was enormous. The decor was a little dated. The bathroom had a bath and separate shower.There were two twin beds connected together to make a double - this was not very comfortable and let the room down, somewhat.The room can get a little noisy if you leave the windows open - but not with the traffic noise, the animals in the famous Zoo, that is close by, get a little boisterous it seems!The Zoo S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations are very close and ideal for central Berlin and for excursions to Wannsee (pronounced Vannzee) and Potsdam (Sans Souci is a World Heritage Site and worth spending at least a day there, but make sure you also visit the Forbidden City where the KGB had their German headquarters).You can walk from the hotel to the very pleasant Tiergarten, although take a one-stop trip on the S-Bahn if you like.Buy a day ticket that covers all travel on the S-Bahn and U-Bahn - although check which areas it covers. You can get week tickets but they end on a Sunday so not of any use to us. The S-Bahn and U-Bahn are excellent.The local area has lost much of its charm since the Wall (and the government handouts) stopped. The Europa Centre which is next to the hotel is one of the earliest shopping centres in Europe and you can tell. We found good restaurants surprisingly difficult to find.Overall a good relaxing stay.
