{"text":"Great trip to Iberostar Bavaro We just returned from our week at the Bavaro. That was just about right but we'll miss the beach. You can't beat the weather this time of year in Punta Cana. 80's and sunny all but 1 day this week. Here's a few items that I hope might help you decide.1) Getting there: Be sure to check the State department website for info before you go. No troubles at the airport. There was a $10 entry fee to get into the country. The porters were very aggressive. We booked with Apple vacations. They were top notch. If you don't go with a tour company, suggest you pay the extra for the bus transfer. A taxi ride didn't look very safe. Get your luggage and find your bus. The ride to the hotel was a bit scarry. Terrible blight and poverty all along the way. (Note the guy on the right with a rifle). The road was quite horrible. 30-40 minutes to the Bavaro from the airport.2) The Bavaro: Everything is CLEAN. Many workers to do this. Check in was a snap. Communication is still a problem from time to time. There aren't enough english speaking people, yet. They're getting there though. The room was a little worn but more than adequate. Buffet meals were pretty good but mostly leaning toward the European's. Book your specialty resteraunt reservations the day you get in. They fill up fast. The steak house is the best. Enjoyed the presentation at La Coupal's. The japanese resteraunt was weak. Can't trust Dominicans to serve good sushi I guess.:} Still, It wasn't horrible, just not great. Pool lunch barbeque closes at 1:30. Best lunch food at the BBQ. The rest is open later. The people were very friendly and work very hard 6am to 11plus every day for 12 days straight.3) Drinks: They claim to have Premium liquor. HA I say!!!! Yes they had tangeray, a few whisky's and stoli but that was about it. Be sure to ask for it or they'll give you the local swill. Also, the wine was like homemade stuff uncle Tony would make at 11% alcohol content. Not terrible but definately nowhere near high end. Champagne was good though. Best drinks in the place-Coco-loco ( ask for double rum), Bahama mama, and a dirty banana. No good taquilla on the island at all. BYOT.4) Beach\/pool: Get up early (6:30-7) and stake your claim to an umberella. The sun is murder from 12-3 and you'll need some siesta time. General trend was beach in the morning and pool in the afternoon. It's a great walk up and down the beach and close to the local beach shops. Beware: Ladies don't go to the beach shops without your man. The merchants are very aggressive and touchy!!! 2 decent volleyball courts. Snorkel right out in front of the resort. Plenty of fish about 30 yards out.5) Excursions: We only did the Marinarium snorkel tour. It was $70 each. Had a good time and swam with some sharks and sting rays. We also road around as a party boat for awhile. Wasn't worth $70 but was adequate. Apple rep suggest we should not parasail or horseback ride. Too many accidents due to safety concerns according to him.6) Entertainment: The shows were slightly entertaining. Very corny. The disco doesn't open until 11:30. Table games at the casino didn't open until 8pm. Lost money. Watch the dealers. They make mistakes (Not the reason I lost money).7) Getting home: Bus left 4 hours prior to flight. The line was extra long getting checked in. Our tour flight actually left an hour early. Security was a joke but they did have the drug sniffing dogs. Again, porters were aggressive. Minimal food options. NOOOOO COFFEE??!!!8) Misc.: We spent about $75 in tips. $1 to $2 at a time, occasionally a $5 for great service. We tipped the maid extra for extra water. It was worth it. Bring your own singles. They're hard to come by. Get a key to the safe at check in and lock up your stuff. Hope this helps you. We had a great time and would recommend it to anyone. It's definately a nice resort destination.
