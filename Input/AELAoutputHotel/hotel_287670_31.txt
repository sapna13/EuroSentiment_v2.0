{"text":"Definitely going back! I and my daughter (14) have just returned home to Toronto after 4 nights at the Banys Orientals. We'd read the reviews on Trip Advisor and decided to stay in a suite for the extra space and to avoid the street noise. We paid 129 Euros a night with no additional taxes. The main hotel and reception are located on a pedestrian street so the the taxi driver was unable to drive us to the door of the hotel. He hustled us and our extensive luggage out of the car at the top of the street. In the end it was only a 1-minute walk to the hotel but it was disconcerting at the time.The reception staff are friendly, efficient and English speaking. It is a 3 to 5 minute walk to the suites which are also located on a residential street. The location is excellent for 3 reasons. First we loved feeling part of local life - our suite had 3 of those skinny balconies where we could look out onto street life and into the apartments opposite. Second it only took us a minute to reach the square at the front of the imposing Santa Maria church where we could enjoy a perfect breakfast of fresh squeezed oj, croissants and cafe con leche at the oh-so-hip Bubo bar, or a great tapas dinner at Taller de Tapas ; or the very best gelati at Artisan (?). Third we could walk to many places including La Rambla for shopping or to Barceloneta to eat on the seafront. The building in which the suites are located is a total and modern reno. Our suite was very stylish, spacious and immacuately clean. When the doors to the balcony were closed, I don't recall hearing any noise at all. The mini fridge was restocked daily with multiple bottles of water (with and without gas). The only drawback was the phone service - friends found it very difficult to get through to our suite and, if they did, they could barely hear our voices. Oh yes, and like many hotels these days, it had one of those annoying hairdryers where you have to keep holding down the ON button the whole time you dry your hair. Reception provided a cable to connect to the Internet and the connection worked well. Both I and my daughter will definitely want to stay at this hotel when we next visit Barcelona - we won't even bother considering any others.
