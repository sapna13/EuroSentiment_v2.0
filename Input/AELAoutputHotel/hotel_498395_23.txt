{"text":"Very Disappointed We booked the hotel after reading mostly favorable reviews. We checked into our room on the ground level which had no windows. We thought, only one night, we can deal with it. Before heading out for dinner, I plugged in my electric toothbrush. When we returned, I put the key in the power slot and there was a flash and then nothing but darkness. The night desk person came into the room with a flashlight and starting ranting about overloading a circuit. I tried to explain to him that all that I had plugged in was a toothbrush. Being an engineer, I know there were other problems not caused by a damn toothbrush. We then turned on the air con and it started to rattle like crazy (it was old and partly taped up). We pointed this out to him and he said he would see if there was another room available. After 15 minutes, my wife finally went to the front desk and asked him if he had found another room. Without looking at her, he said nothing and handed her a key. No offer to help with moving our luggae to the new room up on the third floor. This room was much better, with windows, but they did not seal properly and we spent a sleepless night kept awake by the noises on the street below. In the morning when we checked out, the day staff were there and they were just as cold as the night man. I'm not sure if this was just towards us. But this counts as one of the worst experiences I've had in my 20 years of extensive travel. ","annotations":[]}
