{"text":"Spritzers, Moonlight and Warmth Taking your wife to one of the most romantic destinations in the world may be the norm, taking your mother and your wife is probably not. But, off the three of us went to beautiful Venice. As a surprise we took the motor taxi to the hotel, very James Bond, but my mother both shaken and stirred by the somewhat bumpy trip was very happy to see the hotel, but not so happy about getting from boat to land. Never a fear, with a toot of the horn, we were met not by one but three attendants who all but carried the septuagenarian from the boat. And then there was Matteo, with movie star looks and a perfect smile, he took charge immediately, and the worries of trying to keep everyone happy just drifted away. Do yourself a favour, don't hesitate, stay here. There are so many good things I could say, but in short, it is a gem, it is beautiful, it is ornate and well posh without being stuffy, it is intimate and charming and the care and attention that Matteo, Oliver, Thomas, and all the others paid to us and particularly the attention that Matteo gave to my mother made the trip truly something special. We had memorable evenings spent drinking spritzers in the moonlight looking at the Rialto Bridge with good company provided by the other guests and our evening host Oliver, it was truly magic. Breakfasts were wonderful too, with the speciality eggs any way you want, and views of the comings and goings on the Grand Canal, Venice's main street. So as it must, the end of our trip arrived, back onto the motor taxi but this time the now very relaxed and very happy Grand Dame was quite looking forward to the experience, especially as she was to be waved off by Matteo, who without his knowing had come quite close to being adopted. Thanks to everyone at the hotel and especially Matteo and Oliver for their kindness, warmth and care. We will be back. ","annotations":[]}
