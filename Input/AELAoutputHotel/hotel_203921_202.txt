{"text":"3 star hotel with 5 star value! The Hotel David in Florence is so wonderful, I could easily run out of adjectives to describe it. Located on the opposite side of the Arno River, it's blessedly devoid of tourist mobs (and noise!), but still within walking distance of all the major sights - plus a few you might overlook, staying in the more centralized areas.My husband, daughter and I recently enjoyed a 5 night stay, and here's what we experienced for around 95 euro a night: a beautiful, *huge* room with a king-sized bed for hubby and I, and a lovely sleigh bed for my daughter; ensuite bathroom with heated towel racks, a bathtub and shower, and complimentary hair dryer; double French doors leading to a small balcony overlooking a lovely outdoor sitting area; in room TV, phone, mini-bar\/fridge and safe; free WiFi in our room (and complimentary Internet connectivity at the workstation in the lobby); a spacious lounge area downstairs filled with travel books and plenty of brochures on sights and activities in and around Florence; nightly happy hour with complimentary wine\/beverages and snacks; a gorgeous breakfast room with a yummy selection of food and beverages to start your day off right; an in-house bar with a really good wine selection, and close proximity to great restaurants, shops, food markets, a Bancomat, tabacchi, bus lines,and taxis.The very best thing about the Hotel David, though, was the outstanding staff. Every single person, from the front desk people, to the young lady who prepares breakfast, to the maids, are overwhelmingly friendly, cheerful, helpful, and go way beyond the call of duty to make your stay in Florence as pleasurable as possible. I'm sorry I wasn't aware of this hotel last year when I visited Italy - but now that I am, I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else. Grazie mille, Hotel David!
