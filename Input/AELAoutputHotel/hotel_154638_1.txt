{"text":"Great location but rock hard beds! I have stayed in lots of moderately priced hotels in big cities and the number one thing we look for is... location! This hotel is a great base camp if you plan on spending most of your time exploring the city. It's a 2 minute walk to the metro stop Insurgentes on the pink line and almost anything you might want to do in the city can be accessed via the metro. However, Mexico City is HUGE so things seem closer than they really are. There are mediocre restaurants in the hotel, but with several Sanborns and Vips neaby, there's really no reason to eat in the hotel even if you're not adventurous enough to look for other more authentic places to eat. It's a short walk to the Independence Angel and strolling along the Paseo de la Reforma is a nice way to digest dinner. There's a good indoor market nearby that opens at 10 am for picking up souvenirs and other crafts. And just as an FYI, you are right down the street from a bunch of gay bars, so the area is very lively at night and there's lots of PDA around. If you are a homophobe unfamiliar with metropolitan areas or are travelling with young children who are kept sheltered, this might be a problem for you. As for the hotel itself- it is a large hotel and there isn't a whole lot of personal service. The area overall is a little noisy, after all, you are downtown in a big city with a lot of police presence. There is adequate space in the room and bathroom - in fact, by European standards, the place is huge! The views are nice - better from the upper floors, of course. The room decor is hideous and the pool is tiny - but if you're rarely in your room or swim, who cares? Probably my only complaint is the the beds are the hardest I've slept on in my life and the pillows are like sacks of old heavy clothes. If we choose not to stay there again, that will be the only reason why. (Oh, and my daughter Shelby just reminded me that the toilet got clogged and there wasn't enough shampoo.)Taxis are not nearly as cost-prohibitive as in other cites so even if you don't choose to take the metro (it does get ridiculously crowded), it's still a great base camp. We travelled with a 4, 7, and an 11 year old and you can ride in a special section on the metro with kids. Definitely visit the Zocalo, Chapultepec Park (especially the palace and museum of Anthropology), the Basilica of Guadalupe and Xochimilco. And take a day trip to the pyramids. Off the beaten path is the Leon Trotsky house that he lived and was murdered in after his exile from Russia and the Freida Kahlo and Diego Rivera home - very educational and worthwhile. But even 6 days was not enough to see enough of this amazing city - we'll be back. All in all, this hotel was a good value and we had a great time in Mexico City. But if you're a traveller who needs more plush accomodations and hangs out in your hotel, you might want to spend a little more.
