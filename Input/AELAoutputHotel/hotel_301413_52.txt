{"text":"They spent 140 million dollars?!?!?!?!? My first impression, walking into the lobby of the Mandarin Oriental three weeks after it re opened following its refurb, was this is AFTER they spent $140m ?!?!.It's so dark and sombre. OK, one man's meat is another man's poison and I'm sure Wallpaper* readers may love it, but it looks to me like the set from a 1960s James Bond movie - black marble, gold relief on the walls, chintzy chandaliers. Dark dark dark. I expected Blofeld or Dr No to step out stroking a fluffy white cat and say Ah, Mr X, we have been expecting you. The only thing to lighten up the place was the rather funky orange jackets of the staff.This is 100% a business hotel and not for the leisure traveler (like me, who was on vacation). All around, from the bars to the restaurants, the average guest was a slightly paunchy middle aged businessman in an expensive suit looking rather pleased that he was staying here and able to expense the whole thing back to his company.The gym is good, but the pool is small and enclosed - no where to catch a few rays on a sunny day.Food? Had breakfast one day in the Clipper Lounge which was good, and on another day in the Grill where, I have to admit, the atmosphere was great, but the food mediocre - I am the world's greatest lover of eggs benedict and these were just ordinary. My partner's pancakes were, she said, nothing special either.Again it's a personal thing, but the way the staff fussed about, without actually being that efficient, I found annoying.My bedroom - again, geared up for the business traveler with every data port and socket you could ever want - was quite small and again dark, with a low ceiling that felt quite claustrophobic. The bathroom is integrated into the main room - my partner peeing on the toilet came through in glorious stereo as I lay in my bed. Similarly running the shower sounded like Niagara Falls.Re reading the above it all sounds negative, but, those are just my personal thoughts - as I said, one man's meat is another man's poison, and I'm sure there'll be people out there who love what's been done to the hotel, love the decor, love the business facilities etc etc etc. But, as a leisure traveler, sorry, I was underwhelmed. You hear so much about this hotel, it's so iconic, and then I went there and..........well, it was great to say I've tried it, but next time I'm in Hong Kong I can definitely say I won't stay here again. In general I'm a Mandarin Oriental fan (for example, love the properties in Singapore and Miami) but this almost seems apart from the rest of the group, different styling and ethos altogether.
