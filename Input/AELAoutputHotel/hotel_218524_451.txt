{"text":"Overall Disappointed We stayed here 3 days having spent 3 days previously at the Paradisius Palma Real which is admittedly more expensive but the Excellence in comparison is not good value for money. We had mixed feelings about the resort but would not go back and overall didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like it. . Firstly, what we did like were: the beach, the gym (really nice) and the generally very friendly staff (although not always so helpful in the face of problems).This comes across however as an all in resort trying to save money - it saves money on the quality and range of the food, the quality of the drinks and the resort feels like it's seen better days. Also during the day in the resort is not a fun lively place and a proportion of the other guests looked bored and not really enjoying themselves. Part of this we put down to the layout of the resort, and its sombre nature. I think the biggest disappointment was the food however, to such an extent that we were happy to skip meals and had little enthusiasm for what was on offer even though we were there just for 3 days. When you are in an all in resort which no other alternative this is a problem. The oil which the breakfast is cooked in has a very unpleasant taste.Other isolated points which might help give a picture of the resort-- We had problems with black water in the bath. We were eventually moved into rooms prepared for honey mooners by mistake and were pleased we were not there on honeymoon - the way the room is prepared for honeymooners is very cheap and cheerful - a cheap bottle of sparkling wine, a few petals and a plate of unexciting fruit including a pear which was never going to ripen no matter how hot it got. - The inclusive unmotorised watersports are poor, consisting of just one of everything, and a strong emphasisi on selling other trips - Punta Cana is used in hotel names very liberally for the whole of the coast; this hotel along with a couple of others is nowhere near anywhere else being a very long way up the coast to the north. This was very apparent as we were independent and couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ drive as quickly as say a taxi who would know where the pot holes and speed bumps are. Even for him it would represent a very long transfer.- Dress code for the restaurants regarding shoes is absurd - women can wear beach shoes\/ flip flops but men can't wear very smart (although) open shoes. The staff are not flexible on this point.. Put your running shoes on which will look very unsmart and you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be fine however.
