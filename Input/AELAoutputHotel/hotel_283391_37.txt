{"text":"Fun and Relaxation at the Palladium Pallace I have just returned from a two week holiday at the Palladium palace and loved every minute of it. I was a little sceptical about this hotel after reading a few poor reviews but all I can say is those people must never be happy as I had one of the best holidays ever at this hotel.On arrival we received a welcome drink and were greeted by friendly reception staff, check in was fast and efficient. The rooms were beautiful, very clean, comfy bed and nice views, I did have a few minor problems in the room ie my safe kept saying low battery and the shower did leak a little but nothing really to worry about. The maids came in every day and kept the room very clean they also added nice touches by leaving flower buds next to the towels. The mini bar was also restocked daily.The pools were all lovely and much quieter then the beach there was often beds with shade still available when we were going for lunch, staff came around the pool at regular intervals offering drinks which was excellent as although the bar was only a few feet away and there were swim up bars it was so hot it was nice that someone got the drinks for you. The only problem with the pool is the P.O.P staff which work at the hotel as in the afternoon they constantly tried to get you up to play different games, mini golf, darts, volleyball and they are quite persistant but you just have to say no and they will leave you alone.The beach was truely beautiful it was just idelyic to look at the beautiful turquiose sea but the fighting over the sunbeds\/shade is something I will never forget!!! It was unbelievable people stealing beds and pretending they had been there all day i really have not seen anything like it before, 2 people in my party had to get up just after 6am to enable us to get sunbeds with shade.I am not that adventurous with food but I enjoyed all the food in all the restaurants we went to 4 al a carte restaurants and the spanish was my favourite, the domincan restaurant was my least favourite I didn't like any of the the food apart from the desert which was just like melted fudge yum and it was so hot in there as there was no air conditioning!!!I went to the spa and had a great massage it was very relaxing and all the staff were friendly.I have to say that the staff in the resort were friendly and always smiled apart from the shop staff, I went to buy a handbag from the beach shop and the lady serving was the most misserable woman I have ever had the misfortune to meet it was as if i was inconviencing her for wanting to buy something from the shop totally ridiculous.Well to sum it up I had a great time and would most certainly go back if I had the money to do so. The weather was beautiful the hotel was beautiful and the beach was beautiful what more could anyone wish for!!!
