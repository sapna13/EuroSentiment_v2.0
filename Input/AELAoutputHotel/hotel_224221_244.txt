{"text":"Possibly the best hotel experience yet. Anywhere! My girlfriend and I have just returned from a 4-night stay at The Library Hotel and it rates as one of the best hotel experiences I've had.The location is fantastic (provided you want to be in Midtown Mahattan of course!), the rooms are impeccably decorated, clean and very, very comfortable (although reasonably small - it is Manhattan - and a little dark) and the hotel amenities are great, if limited (this is a small 60-room hotel so there's no pool\/gym\/conferencing but there is a very nice top floor terrace bar and wonderful reading room for 24h coffee\/refreshments etc.). But the best thing has to be the staff. Anyone can buy an expensive property, decorate it well, keep it clean and call it a boutique hotel but when nothing's too much trouble for the staff, they're kind, friendly and attentive and, above all else, make you feel valued and welcome, you get the experience you want from this type of hotel.I've stayed at lots of hotels from very large high-end chains to very small boutique places and the most disappointing thing is when, for some small, petty reason, the stay doesn't live up to expectations. The Library Hotel lived up to everything I hoped it would be and that, combined with the fantastic property and great staff, makes it a seriously good place to stay in my book. Small, but pretty much perfectly formed.When I'm in NYC, this is where I'm staying from now on in.
