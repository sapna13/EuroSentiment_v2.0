{"text":"Great hotel in a great location!! If you're looking for a very central hotel in west berlin, close to all the hot spots - shopping, sight-seeing, caf√ã√\u2022√ñs, restaurants, bars, etc - then the Steigenberger Hotel is for you! Having read some rave reviews and even some rare mediocre ones, I booked the hotel and on arriving I quickly realised that I made the right decision! The hotel is very central and yet is located in its own oasis of calm, as it faces onto a parkland!It was our first time in Berlin, and my sister and I spent a great weekend (Sat-Tues) in this truly amazing city, and would definitely return. In fact, four days is too short....there's so much to see and do. I had emailed the hotel in advance to enquire about early check-in, as our flight from Dublin was an early one, and staff could not have been more helpful and facilitated us as much as possible. We got a good deal on ebookers for the three-night stay, which included breakfast - the hot and cold breakfast buffet offers more than a substantial start to every day! The hotel is within easy walking distance of both U and S-bahn stations, and also is on the doorstep of all major sightseeing tour stops. After a long day sightseeing, the hotel is a welcome respite to relax and unwind in either main bar or piano bar or terrace before heading back out to sample the varied range of restaurants and nightlife that Berlin has to offer. The hotel has its own restaurant but as a minor downside, it seemed to lack any atmosphere, so we opted for the great choice of local bistros and restaurants nearby. Berlin.....we will be back!!!
