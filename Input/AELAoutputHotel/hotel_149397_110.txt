{"text":"Avoid this poorly run complex We spent a week at the Bavaro Princess in April. Let me first start with the positive. The beach is beautiful. Drinks are readily available all day and night. The grounds are well kept and very attractive. The rooms are a good size. Unfortunately, with all the naturally positive attributes this resort enjoys simply by its location, the overall experience was marred by lousy service, poor management and the constant noise of the service trucks and trolleys that share the same path you use to navigate this enormous resort.It's not that you can't have a good time there - if you don't mind lots of noise, larges crowds, lining up for food, and herding into trolleys to get to and from your room to the beach. If you are the sort that can over look all that and just enjoy the incredibly beautiful beach regardless how crowded it is, then you may enjoy this place.The pool was beyond disgusting. At night, while the water was still, you could see all the un-skimmed biologicals floating on the surface and you could not see the bottom through the cloud of filth. To be fair, they did treat the pool later in the week which elevated it from disgusting to dirty.The service was awful everywhere except the bars. The bartenders were always friendly and upbeat. If you pay for a Platinum room, don't except to actually get one. They consider any room that is near the platinum area to be platinum. The rooms themselves are no different, they are just closer to the beach then most and closer to the platinum lounge.Overall, since there are so many places in the Caribbean that try so much harder, we will never return to this mammoth complex.
