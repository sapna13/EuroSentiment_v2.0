{"text":"A Fab Hotel! After reading some of the reviews about this hotel I was very worried, but had already booked so decided to go with an open mind.... We went with our teen daughter and another couple with their teen. We all had a great time, the rooms were spacious, comfortable and spotlessesly clean, our maid Sunilda was excellent! The food was fine, I am very fussy but found somthing I liked every day, there is an excllent choice, fish, seafood, chicken, pork, ham, pizza, pasta etc - all out party ate very well. the service was great, staff friendly, and the entertainment staff were just brilliant - really funny, friendly and put on some excellent shows.All the staff were very friendly, including the gardeners and pool staff, who would sing while they worked. The pool area, gardens and beach were beautiful, kept spotlesslessy clean, there was poeple sweeping from morning till I went to bed at 3am! We went on one trip, booked through the hotel beach shack (where you change your towels) to Catalena Island, it was 85 dollars and included, air conditioned coach to the boat, snorkling gear, food and drink - all of which was plentiful. Many on the trip went scuba diving (this is extra and you have to be qualified) while the rest of us snorkled, this was great, take a banana to feed the fish and watch as they feed! the island is lovely, and you don't need to snorkle here -at waist height in the sea we had fish swimming around us. the boat crew were great, dancing, music, with plenty of food and drink., really recommend this trip! We loved this hotel and would recommend it. This is a developing country and we tipped our maid a dollar a day, plus we tipped in the restaurant, cleaner in the bathroom etc..- We didn't take any small notes and had to keep going to the gift shop to buy chocolate (what a shame!!) to get small notes to tip, so make sure you get lots of small notes when you change your money.
