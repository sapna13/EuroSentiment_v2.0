{"text":"Nice Enough This was our second stay at The Imperial Hotel due to business meetings and our overall hotel stay was pleasant. The Imperial definitely caters to the business traveler in light of its location and meeting space options. The staff is friendly and efficient.We stayed in a standard king size room located on the 31st floor in the Tower Annex and although the decor and furnishings were a bit dated and reflected wear and tear (i.e., worn carpet, worn and stained upholstery, scuff marks on furniture), everything was comfortable and clean. Being a business oriented hotel, we were surprised that the internet access was a bit spotty. We had a view of the train tracks and Hibiya Park. We did hear train noise even being on the 31st floor. The bathroom was large and the shower had great water pressure.Room service breakfast and coffee were fine and delivered promptly by friendly staff. I dined at the hotel's diner style restaurant (for lunch) as well as its tempura restaurant (for dinner) and the food and service were fine.The workout room is ok with some treadmills, a couple of stationary bikes, one elliptical, and three Cybex machines. All of the equipment was acceptable albeit not the most current models. Be sure to join the hotel's complimentary Imperial Club to access the gym at no fee and receive discounts on the hotel's restaurants.A minor concern was that the Concierge team was not overly welcoming and even appeared a bit unenthusiastic. When asked for recommendations and tips for some sightseeing, the concierge rushed through a few options, their access, and all with a dismissive attitude.Overall the Imperial Hotel provided a pleasant stay and their location is convenient to many areas, including the Ginza district. It's a very large, almost generic style of hotel, and understandably cannot provide personalized service. As far as stellar rooms, amenities, and staff, the hotel was fine but the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo is of much higher caliber in every respect.
