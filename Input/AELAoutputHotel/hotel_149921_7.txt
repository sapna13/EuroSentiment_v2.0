{"text":"Not worth the money I am writing a long review, so if you are busy, here's the bottom line: there are better deals than this hotel.When I made a reservation in a world famous Hilton resort hotel chain, paying a certain amount of money, there was a certain expectation, but this hotel didn't meet my expectation.First Impression:My first impression of this hotel was that it was old and crowded. I saw wear and tear, here and there, although our room in the tower seemed new.Location:The location was good for old San Juan and Ashford Avenue, and about one hour or more one-way driving to the biobay, scuba diving, ferries for Vieques, or El Yunque, which is ok.However, it was not easy to find a market or a restaurant nearby.Room and Tower:Our tower room was nice and new.Our bed throw had black spots here and there, which I strongly suspected as mold, so we never used the throw. Other bedding stuffs were good and comfortable.The bathroom didn't have a bathtub and ventilation, which was a minus, but had a nice shower system with good hot water pressure.No minibar, which translated to a free empty refrigerator.The tower didn't have any security, so anyone from the street could go in and out freely. Also it was a little bit away from the private beach or the swimming pool.Beach and Swimming area:The swimming pool was OK but didn't look as good as other resort hotels' pools I visited including other Hiltons although it didn't matter for me because I spent time not in the pool but on the beach.The private beach was good and safe for children as it was protected by a breakwater or something. There were some floating things to climb up and enjoy, and a sunbathing balcony on the sea. Although it was crowded, we had a good time on the beach.Food:Everything is overpriced. One bottle of Bud Light will cost you $8+tax+tips. A McDonald quality hamburger was $13+tax+tips at a bar, and it was the cheapest snack you can get in the hotel except Starbucks, which was the only place with reasonable prices in this hotel.If the food quality was good, we wouldn't complain about the price because we were on vacation and ready to spend some. However, we didn't want to pay that money for this quality of food, so we always drove out to eat and to shop for the next day's breakfast.BTW, this hotel claims that its pool bar is the birth place of the pina colada. If you want to try it, it is $13+tax+tips.Staff:Most of the staff was friendly and nice except for the front desk manager. The concierge was so helpful, and even house keepers were always smiling although they were not good at English. However, when I was in trouble, the front desk manager was very unhelpful and gave me a why-should-I-be-bothered-about-your-fault attitude. How she neglected me really astounded me. Fee, Parking, Internet, ETC:You need to pay the additional resort fee (about 13 or 14%) even if you already paid for your room.Everything costs you money. I already wrote about the overpriced food. Parking also costs like $15 a day, and the parking garage was not connected to the hotel facilities which was very bad while raining. Internet was also like $15 a day. Although they said the wireless Internet on the lobby was free, we couldn't get the signal at the lobby and ended up paying the money to get the wired access.Overall, I am willing to re-visit Puerto Rico, especially to do the biobay tour again, but I would not stay at this hotel next time.
