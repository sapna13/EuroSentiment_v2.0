{"text":"the place to stay when in boston I researched hotels in Boston extensively. I wanted a room with a balcony as I dislike the closed in feeling you get in boxy rooms with windows that don't open and I wanted a hotel that enabled you to feel the history of Boston. I wanted casual elegance, where you can feel comfortable wearing a suit or jeans. And I got all that at the Millennium Bostonian. Room service is speedy. Some of the selections are yummy. Their cheese selections are delectable as is their flat iron steak sandwich and club sandwich. And though there is no ice machine, call for ice and you get it straight away. Everyone at this property aims to please. The maids all greet you warmly in the morning and the sit-down check-in is most civilized. The step-out balconies overlook a historic square and the hotel is in walking distance of Boston's most historic sites. It's also one of the closest hotels to Logan Airport and yet none of the plane noise is heard. The superior plus room, while a little bit more expensive, is the way to go--rustic beams on the ceiling, a huge oversized bath, and it's much more elegant than the standard rooms. If you're looking for romance, definitely spring for the superior plus room. Seasons Restaurant is where the power brokers of Boston go to breakfast. The eggs are great and the bacon is cooked to perfection. For an extra ten dollars, you can have room service breakfast. Ask for the bed and breakfast package. I've never heard of a breakfast\/room package where you could get breakfast sent to the room...and for ten dollars only...what a value! I just love this property. Very homey, the address to stay at when in Boston. Whatever you do, at least, get the superior room with step-out balcony, but again, spring for the superior plus. A dear friend of mine recommended this hotel as the place to stay and I'm grateful for the recommend. He was so right! I will be staying at the Millennium Bostonian the next chance I get.
