{"text":"Very satisfactory, no-dissapointment hotel We booked our room at The Orchard Parade Hotel for our stay last Oct 18-21, 2008. We paid 180SGD\/night (110 USD), inclusive of all taxes and charges. For this price, I would say that we got a good bargain given that the hotel was in a good location and had very likeable facilities. This hotel has a good arrival, it has a big facade, and immediately tells you that you are going to have a good stay. A bellhop cheerfully collected our luggage as we checked in in less than 15 mins. It was 11am at the time but the receptionist gave us our rooms right away without early check-in charges.The hotel's configuration is quite unique. We had to negotiate about 7 turns along the corridors since our room was quite far from the elevator. In our excitement to walk around Orchard, this is something we can easily forgive.Our room was a decent Superior room. It had a decent amount of space (just enough), right amount of furnishings and amenities (a sofa and side table, TV, bar, internet, office desk). It has a walk-in closet where the luggage counter is integrated. The bathroom was clean, had a bathtub, hot shower and toiletries. I coudln't find anything that I didn't like. The bed was good, wasn't hard or soft, it was just right. The bedsheets and pillocases felt good on the skin. We had a good night's rest every night. We also used the Internet (7SGD for 30 mins) just to check on e-mail, not bad at all. We also received a daily copy of the Straits Times, good for waiting while the spouse was int he bathroom.We didn't get the chance to try out the other facilities (swimming pool, bar, restaurants), since we just used the room for sleeping and showering. But this is a great-value hotel for this price! It met our minimum requirements, decent staff, good facilities (not spectacular, but good enough), and for that price, it's worth considering for a future stay. ","annotations":[]}
