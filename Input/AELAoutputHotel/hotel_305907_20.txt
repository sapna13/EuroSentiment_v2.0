{"text":"Gr8 Hotel in Sha Tin We decided to stay at this hotel for just under 2 weeks as a way to see the rest of HK, and for the price it was absolutely great! The hotel is situated in the Northern Territories, and if you plan on staying in HK for more than just a few days, this is an ideal way to see the city, as it has great transport links, which are pretty cheap and efficient. The hotel is situated right next to the huge Sha Tin mall, which has all the usual Western brand names, as well as a wide variety of Western chain restaurants, and some very good Chinese restaurants, all of which are open fairly late.There is currently construction work next to the hotel for a new cinema, but we could not hear any of the noise from the 8th floor, although they had sent us a note saying that the water supply to the rooms will be cut off for a few hours, but this did not really affect us. We did make use of the bar on a number of occassions, and drinks were not too expensive...we did not make use of the restaurants, but the prices seemed much higher than eating in some of the nearby restaurants.As suggested by other reviews, the A41 double decker bus services runs every 15-20 mins between Sha Tin and the airport and only costs 20HKD per person (use exact change), taking 40 mins or so, and this works out much cheaper than using a taxi. We also made regular use of the hourly shuttle service offered by the hotel to Kowloon (which takes 15-20 mins - dropping you off outside the Peninsula hotel) for only 15HKD. If you want to be more flexible try using the very good train service, which is only 3-5 mins walk from the hotel.The park situated behind the river is also very clean and peaceful, and we used it regularly for peaceful walks in the morning and evenings. The heritage museum is also 10 mins walk and is a good way to spend a few hours. We also decided to see the 10,000 Buddhas temple, which again is 10 mins walk, and although it is on a steep hill, there are a number of escalators which take you right to the top for good views of the area.All in all, we would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to have a nice peaceful stay, away from the hustle bustle of central HK, but at the same time see the city in an effective and efficient way.
