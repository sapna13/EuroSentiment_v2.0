{"text":"Fantastic location! My husband and I recently stayed here for 5 nights in mid-April for a great rate of 60 euros per night. The hotel is very centrally located near Puerta del Sol and a few minutes√à√\u2020\u2022?walk from the Sol Metro station. Another reviewer√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ directions were perfect for locating the hotel from that point. The hotel faces Plaza de Santa Cruz and is located on the third floor. There is a tiny lift that will take you up to the hotel.The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. We spoke primarily in Spanish, which was easier than conversing in English. There is a vending machine and free internet access in the lobby. The first night we were put into a triple when we booked a double room. The next day we were told we had to move to a double, Room 317. The room had a safe, a hairdryer, a phone, a flat screen TV that received only Spanish stations, an armoire, and a small desk and chair. This room was smaller than the triple, as expected, but had a great view overlooking the plaza. The trouble was the nightly noise from the people, musicians, buses and taxis circling the plaza made it almost impossible for me to sleep, even with the doors closed and the shutters drawn. So if you are light sleeper, ask for another room. The bathroom was standard for European hotel rooms, had great water pressure, and an abundance of hot water.If you plan to leave early on check out day, the management would prefer you settle the bill the evening before since the lobby desk isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ manned until 9am each morning.If you are looking for a great location and a great price, I would recommend this hotel.
