{"text":"Well worth it We returned on 1\/28 from a week at Grand Paradise and had a very nice week all in all. If you lower your standards a bit and remember this is the Caribbean, and have some good weather, you'll have a good vacation. Here are some comments pro and con.ROOM: Spacious,clean,bare floors,clean,poorly lit for night time reading, good TV selection, fridge stocked with Cokes,Sprite and water at no charge, adequate closet space, inadequate drawer space, enough toweling. TIP: ask for 2 keys. The power is kept on in the room with a key in a slot. Take the key when you leave the room and the room is hot when you return.BEACH: Beautiful,clean,water is rough on occassion since this is the Atlantic, few pesty vendors now located in an area just off the grounds,good water sports, plenty of chairs,lots of shade. Music always playing but we've heard worse. Plent y of towels and chaises. The pool area is pretty with some shade. There is a bar close to the pool and beach. TIP: before breakfast go to the beach or pool,pick out your spot, put books,towels, etc on the chairs then go to breakfast. Do it every morning, so you won't have to hunt around. every day.FOOD: Not gourmet but better than passable. Breakfast is just fine with a very fast egg station. The buffet has some good food at every meal. The pastries were very good. I'm picky and I was more than satisfied. There are five specialty restaurants. Chinese was the best. Italian,disappointing...fair food poor service. The La Cana Grill was good. We didn't go to the Seascape or the Dominican. TIP: The sign up for specialty restaurant reservations is a pain. 10:30 to 3. Do it right away if you check in before three to insure your choices. You are entitled to 3 specialties for each week.Entertainment: Every night but awful depending on your level of experience. We are admittedly spoiled. Some talent but repeticious. There is the usual audience participation stuff before every show. The 9:45PM start in too late for our taste.They have a small room with slot machines,pool tables.hockey and snacks. There is a small casino in the hotel next door with slots,black jack,roulette, and poker. A 6 dollar cab fare which the will reimburse for coming but not returning to your hotel. The day time activities are the usual...volley ball etcStaff: very friendly and helpful. The ladies in the gift shop are a little sour. Too busy talking to one another. TIP: bring some room snacks if you enjoy them. I will not pay $2.00 for a Milky Way.Shopping: There is a small shopping area within walking distance for local arts and crafts. TIP: wait until you get back to the airport for cigarettes ($22) and liquor.Tours: forget it. The roads are terrible. We took the tour to the island beginning with an SA,(I forget the name), it was not worth the $85 p.p. to travel a total of 4 hours for a beach no nicer than the one at the hotel.To sum up, the Paradise is better than ok for what you pay. We would go back but not in a hurry.
