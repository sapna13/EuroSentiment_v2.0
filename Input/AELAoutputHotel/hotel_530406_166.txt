{"text":"my dream vacation!!!!!!!!! first i want o mention that all those people who complain about this resort are too high matiance!!!! when me and my family visited the D.R. last spring we stayed in villa number 8 and had no problems with leaks ,stolden valuables,and or such other problems mentioned in other reviews!we were very inmpressed with the service, food ,and over all clean appearance of the place.the food was always great and fresh,and if you get to the resturant a little early then you should have no problems getting a table quickly. For your referance tho ,men do have to wear pants to dinner places ,were as the dress regulations for women sre basical just not to show up in your swim suit.The pools were very clean and we enjoyed the swim up bar wich was great to have on a hot day,the water activetys were highly enjoyable for the whole family and i recomend the parasailing for a slightly extra charge(very worth your while).we also took a shuttle to manatee park which was again a great family outing as we went swiming with the dolphins and had fun watching other events going on in the park!SOME TIPS I GIVE FOR FUTER VISITERS TO THE HOTEL:we tiped the maid a dollar a day and she stuffed our mini fridge to the brim with beverages and did cute little flower arrangements on our beds etc.2) if you wan tbech towels or pool chairs WAKE UP EARLY TO GET SOME3) wear lots of sun screen ,i slathered it on and i stil got a burn4)say no to time share sharks there just ther to steal your money5)our docter recomended that we recieve hep. AB shots befor going and to take maleria pills while there (maleron works good and is child friendly pills)6)we were advised not to drink tap water or eat and dairy ,veggie ,or seafood iteams to leasen the risk of contracting disease.over all it was a great place and i love every minute we spent there.
