{"text":"An Okay Stay Hi...During high season, this hotel went for $199 a night. We booked it for $89 a night on Priceline for a three night stay.The hotel provides a breakfast from 7am to 9am every day; buffet style. Cranberry juice, orange juice, coffee, tea, eggs, sausage, muffins, danish, toast, bagels, waffles, yogurt, milk, etc. Since it is mainly a business hotel, I imagine that is why breakfast ends at 9am. I found that to be annoying though, since you can't sleep in and go to breakfast a little later. The room was spacious with two double beds and a sleeper sofa, microwave, fridge, sink and table with two chairs. The bathroom was a bit small, but the sink and mirror thankfully were outside the cramped bathroom. Our room overlooked the Blue Lagoon. The hotel is in a business park near 836, but in a not-so-nice area of town. I much preferred Doral on NW87th St to this area, but hey...at least this is close to the airport. Housekeeping could have been a bit more thorough. I observed hair in the bathroom corner that sat there for our whole three day stay, and it wasn't our hair because none of us have black hair. Also, the front desk was a bit confused. Our second morning began with a bang from housekeeping asking us why we were still there; their records indicate that we should have checked out. I had to explain that I had confirmation number\/reservations for a THREE night stay. The woman said she would look into it and let us know. Then, the front desk calls us and states that we were paid for one night. Impossible. Priceline makes you pay at the time of your reservation, so I had to march down there and show her my printed out confirmation and VISA payment. Good thing I always keep records!!!!!!!!!!!For things to do, we took a day trip ( out to 41 west aka Tamiami Trail) to the Everglades National Park. Did their two hour tram tour to Shark Valley Visitor Center @ $14.50 per adult. Very cool. Then we went to Everglades Swamp Safari Park and did an airboat ride $17 pp w\/discount. This includes your airboat ride, wildlife show, self guided walking tour, and you can hold Snappy their 3 yr old alligator for a picture too. Another thing to do is to go to Parrot Jungle Island ( 836 East to 395 follow signs for Miami Beach and Parrot Jungle Trail)....Had a blast there too ....It's about 25 minutes from the hotel and you could spend all day there too. The hotel has shuttle to Miami Intl Airport, but we rented a car. All in all...an okay stay.
