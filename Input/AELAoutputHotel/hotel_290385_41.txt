{"text":"Hassle-free Honeymoon A little gem in the 7th quarter, we could not have been more pleased in the 4 days we had in Paris to kickstart our honeymoon. Arrival and departure all went smoothly with the friendliest of staff. In fact, they let us choose between two rooms (we chose the bigger one obviously). The rooms are small, but what do you expect in Paris! The cleaniless was impeccable and decor very warm and inviting. The bathrooms were modern and always clean. The cable TV had a variety of channels and they even had a good selection of DVDs available. The accessiblity to all attractions in Paris was great as well. A mere 10 minute walk to the Eiffel tower, around the corner from Rue Cler which had the most charming outdoor markets, bars and cafes, and a post office right across the streeet (we redeemed our travelers cheques here and bought a calling card). Whats more is the Ecole Militaire subway station is right next to the hotel, so we just jumped on and off as desired. This came in especially handy when the World Cup final brought parades and riots around the Champs Elysees....we were there in minutes. It was an unforgettable memory.The only read drawback is the expense of the meals and drinks. We never ate there, but I'm sure the food was excellent. But when you have a market across the street and Eiffel Tower around the corner, why not have a nice picnic at its base? Some complained of the rumble of the subway below but we were barely aware of this. Could have been because we were on the 4th floor. As well, past reviews state it is probably too pricey. This is arguable, but in the end worth it seeing as how smoothly things went for us.Our time in Paris was fantastic and Hotel Le Walt was a big part of this. A great start to our honeymoon as we headed to the glorious south, which I will write a review on next!
