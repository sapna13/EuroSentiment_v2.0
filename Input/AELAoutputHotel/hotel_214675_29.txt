{"text":"Wouldnt do it again. My family and I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Maile sky court. Initial check in was ok with the front desk staff seemed aloof and we were not even offered bell hop service. We inquired into a roll-a-way bed and were told it would be $30 a day which seemed excessive. The room was extremely small, I'm talking european small and honestly, there was no place to put a roll-a-way if we had one. The bed was in poor shape, the furnishing sparse and well used. The bathroom was also small and the tub filled with water while showering and took a long time to drain. The swimming pool is freezing cold, the hot tub is nice. However, on our visit each time we went to the pool, we dealt with drunk locals who told other guests to try and report them as they are regulars at the bar and would not be asked to leave. On a good note, the elevators worked great for us and never waited more then a few minutes. The maid service is excellent and very friendly. They did a good job of working in such a well used facility. The beach is not far away, perhaps 10 minute walk at most and Vit's Hawaaian steakhouse down stairs has decent priced breakfast and lunch meals. In summary, I will not stay there again. Though the place was decently clean, it was very uncomfortable for my family. I also found charging to use your in room safe rather tacky. ","annotations":[]}
