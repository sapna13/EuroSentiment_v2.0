{"text":"Not a Conga line by the pool person.... My basic review of this hotel is that if you are on a budget, or if you are traveling with a group of children this is probably a good choice for you. Personally I would not return. We did have a great time - no point in getting upset when you are on vacation - and my complaints are not that bad. Its just not the upscale resort that they profess it to be.I read what felt like hundreds of reviews before leaving for our vacation so nothing we experienced really felt like a surprise. We were traveling with 5 adults and one 2.5 year old child. The hotel itself is fairly nice. It needs a facelift - mostly in the rooms. On the first night we stayed in a deluxe suite and decided to upgrade to their honeymoon suite. The rooms are clean - but just average. The Honeymoon suite had nicer linens and was larger, but the tiles in the bathroom are very old and the caulking on the floor kept coming up. I personally found the pool to be quite disappointing. The entire pool is maybe 3 - 4 feet deep and the activities are non-stop. If you are a conga line by the pool kind of person you will love it here. Loud music, contests, dancing, water games ect. Its non-stop. The entertainment staff seem like nice people but they don't read social cues very well. If I don't respond to your constant high five or handshake when I see you - perhaps you can just smile and let me read my book. It is true there is a fair amount of trash on the beach. I also felt like a lot of the other guests were not very respectful of keeping the area clean. Empty bottles here and there, cigarettes, plates, water bottles ect. The beach is nice, not great, but average. If you enter the water to the left of the floating trampoline its sandy and fairly clear. The best money we spent was joining the club room. For 50 dollars a day you are given access to a private section of the beach. The club room is in building 6 -- it comes with an excellent concierge staff, food, and very nice bar. This made the trip feel more intimate. I think because we live in a large city, it felt hard to get away from people at this resort.The food is really mediocre. Keep in mind there were people raving about it, so to each their own. Every person on our trip did get a little sick - nothing more than what you might expect from being in Mexico.All in all the basics were there -- the weather was great --they keep the rooms very clean -- it just didn't have a luxurious feel at all.
