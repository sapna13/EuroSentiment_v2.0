{"text":"Cant be better than that. This place is legendary.Starting from the location;it couldnt be more central,5 mins walk from the Central Station.But if you dont know the exact address,you wont find the place as the owners prefer to keep it discreet. You are trusted %100 and treated as a family member from the minute you get it.As a result,there is no 24 hour receptionist,so guests are given the keys of the front door and their room during check in.It also means that you can bring guests to your room but you are responsible from them,and you have to obey simple rules like making sure you close the entrance door properly as there is no security guard waiting there.We are a HETEROsexual couple,stayed here for 4 nights and all i can say to you is that Black Tulip is NOT a men only hotel at all. The only thing you can feel that the guests look surprised when they see a girl at the breakfast table.Speaking of which,breakfast was the freshest and the healthiest one i have ever had at a hotel.Bread rolls are warmed, you can have fresh orange juice,tea and coffie as much as you want,as well as cereals,cheese and cold meats.On our 3rd day i was supposed to participate the entrance examination of an art academy in Amsterdam,and my boyfriend mentioned it to one of the guys shortly while he was hanging at the reception.I was still managing my portfolio in the room that afternoon,and the cleaning guy didnt even knock the door not to bother.That day everyone at the hotel wished me good luck and when we were back,again everyone asked how it went.It was pretty amazing to see that they remembered. Luckily, their wishes were accepted and i am admitted to academy.We will be coming back to Black Tulip.Very soon. ","annotations":[]}
