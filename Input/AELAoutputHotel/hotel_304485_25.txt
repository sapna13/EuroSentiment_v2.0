{"text":"Great Hotel! We stayed at the Park Lane for 5 nights in the middle of August this year before heading onto Dubai.We arrived at the hotel at around 1am and were told that due to our late arrival (our flight was on time, but it was late in the day) the room category we had booked was no longer available and therefore they would upgrade us to a Premium Club room.The room was beautiful with lovely views over the harbour. They did advise us that there was some renovations going on in the hotel, but to be honest, we never once heard anything and were never disturbed. The hotel breakfasts were lovely and and catered for all tastes. We also had a buffet lunch there once and that too was fantastic.The hotel is located within a few mins walk of the metro station, but there is also so much shopping to be done in and around the Causeway Bay area. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpfull. When we checked-out we must have somehow forgotten our passports and tickets on the table in the room. As we were leaving the reception the receptionist called out to us and informed us that housekeeping had just been into the room to clean it and had seen it. My husband was about to go back up when the lady who was responsible for fininding it came downstairs and personally handed it to us. She insisted that we check everything was as it should be and said the minute she went in the room she realised we were leaving and called straight down to reception. We were so grateful, we would have had all sorts of nightmares if we hadn't realised till we got to the airport! This hotel has a great location and so many places are easily accessible from here (either by foot or via the metro) and if returning to HK, we would definately stay here again.
