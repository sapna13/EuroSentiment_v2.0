{"text":"Great property.... I spent a lot of time researching the right hotel for us in Bali. We were travelling with a 2yr old daughter and pregnant wife so it needed to be just right. IC was perfect. We booked the Duplex Suite in the Club level. They have the best club lounge and services I have ever experienced. They airport arrival service is well worth the extra money. We were in our car, heading to the hotel in less than 10mins. They greeted us upon exiting the plane and took care of everything - visa, currency exchange, baggage etc while we sipped some nice tea in their small, but comfortable lounge. The room was very nice and spacious. Their staff impeccable. Nothing is too much trouble. We used their Club J babysitting services and that too comes up with top marks. For a family I think this hotel has everything - great spa, pool, beach, food, grounds, children's facitilies. They only 2 points to make - no men are allowed in the children's club and no kids (under 12) after 5pm in tthe lounge - which is both good and bad!!! But was a bit of a pain for our family. Their club amenities is worth paying the extra money. We had breakfast in the regular place the first couple of days but after eating it in the lounge - smaller menu but better service - we were hooked. They have an area they call the Inspiration Lounge too which is great place to just chill out. One night we were too tired to go out for dinner so we asked if we could get food from their restaurant delivered to our room or come by and pick it up.... it was delivered pipping hot - all off the menu items!!!Great hotel!!! Did not leave the pool side - my daughter was paddling around for upto 5 hours a day and the evenings she would dance to the live music at their pool side restaurant. If you have kids - book the club level as the children's club is included in the price.
