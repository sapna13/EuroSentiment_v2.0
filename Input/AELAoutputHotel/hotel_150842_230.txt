{"text":"An excellent family hotel with one or two flaws My husband and I (60+) stayed twice at the Dominicana and found the resort excellent: rooms, staff, food, animation, beach! As Iberostar is an international hotel chain, I am surprised that Amercian guests are complaing that there are only 20% US guests or that hamburgers do not taste like hamburgers at all!! Although suffering from weak stomachs, we never had any stomach problems there. We avoid drinks with ice, leaf salads, mayonnaise sauces on anything, sweets with milk or cream filling. And moreover as hard as it sounds: go slow on fruits! At home, we do not eat that many fruits and our stomachs are therefore not used to it. (That was the advise our rep gave us and we followed it) One complaint after our second stay is not the hotel itself but the the quality of guests which has has deteriorated somewhat. There are many mainly young boys and girls who find their greatest holiday pleasure in drinking too much alcohol. You see them hanging at the bar from after breakfast until the early morning hours coming back to the room totally drunk, continuing the partying in their room, waking up the other guests. And if this happens on 4 nights out of 7, it is not funny. You can call the reception to do something about it , but by that time your sleep is already gone! And the next night it is somebody else. This kind of clientele seems to be attracted by the hotel's regular special offers - last minute. This year, we have just been at another all inclusive resort. Their politics was: FREE DRINKS UNTIL 10:00 p.m. AFTER THAT: PAY FOR IT√Å√ò√¨!Another very bad thing s the regular reserving of chairs and umbrellas at the beach. As early risers, we usually are at the beach by 9 o'clock in the morning and find 90% of the chairs already reserved - and nobody in sight until midday! The hotel forbids reservation of chairs, but nobody follows the rule. The hotel should really do something about it! Next time, we shalll try the next door Iberostar Bavaro. Pay a little more money but have a restful vacation!
