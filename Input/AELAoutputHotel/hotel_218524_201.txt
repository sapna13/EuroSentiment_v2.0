{"text":"Wonderful Honeymoon My new wife and I spent a wonderful week at the excellence. The beach is lovely, and was never too busy. First impressions were good, its a lovely building while still managing to look relaxed. We were presented with a drink on arrival and help with our bags by staff, who throughout the trip were very helpful and friendly .Our Room was lovely. Very clean, good size, very nice bathtub. Minibar was stocked daily and tv had plenty entertainment. Air conditioning was good (too good for my wifes liking!), so if you like it freezing like me you will be happy. Our room (garden view) also had a hammock outside the door in the sunshine.First night we were a bit dissappointed with our meal, in a buffet restraunt. However we were satisifed with the food. With 8 restraunts there was plenty to try, and if you were not too keen on one your could always try another the next night.At night their was alway entertainment provided. However if you werent in the mood for it, its a big enough resort you can still have a quiet drink with the show getting in your way.We had a meal on the beach one night, and it was a beautiful night all round. There is plenty to try and this is one activity i would definatly recommend, although admittely it was not cheap (but who cares?) :)We also went horse riding one day.......which isnt really my cup of tea, but if its your sort of thing it was good. My wife clearly enjoyed it!There also a lovely pool, good temperture and clean, complete with bar. Again it was rarely too busy, although my scottish skin couldn't take that much sun!In all, we had a wonderful honeymoon. Best things about the hotel was the friendly staff, the relaxed feel and the choice of activites if you want them as well. Choice of food was so large that unless your really, REALLY fussy you find plenty you will like.
