{"text":"A few days at the Grand Marina This is my second stay at the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel. I have stayed in two other hotels in Barcelona, but I still prefer the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel, because the rooms are very clean and comfortable. Modern decor.At first the hotel appears very grand and impressive, but I have to say that for a 5 star hotel, it was not entirely what I expected. Overall, I enjoyed my stay, but certain things could have been better.LOCATIONThe hotel is right by the Mediterranean Sea. Not many rooms get a full view of the sea. However, it is ideally located near the Barcelonetta restaurant area as well as the famous Las Ramblas street. Definitely convenient for visiting the tourist destinations as well as restaurants. In fact, the Bus Turistic stop is just right outside the hotel entrance.FOODBarcelona has so many great restaurants that I never ate at the hotel. As such, I have no comment on this subject.SERVICEThe service is not bad at all. But to be honest, for a 5 star establishment, the service could be pushed to an even higher standard. Many times I would ask the concierge to help with my dinner reservations. And many times they were not able to help me because they could not find the phone number on the internet or because they could not get through to the restaurant. I would expect a 5 star hotel to get my reservation taken care of, no matter what. CLEANLINESSThe hotel is VERY clean and comfortable.ROOM  AMENITIESThe room is very spacious and the amenities are complete. It is exactly what you would expect of a 5 star hotel.PARKING  INTERNETThere is free wireless internet by the concierge desk. Parking is available for a fee in the communal parking lot (shared with the World Trade Center). ","annotations":[]}
