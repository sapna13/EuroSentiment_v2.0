{"text":"Great location, clean room w\/small bathroom, terrific breakfast... My husband and I stayed here for two nights at the beginning of our Germany trip. We made the reservation from a european travel website where we were able to pay after our stay. We were not sure about the hotel for there were mixed reviews from other customers yet we were quite pleased apon arrival. The location could not have been more perfect. Right across the street from the main train station, Hauptbahnhof. Yes, at night, there are a few sketchy folks hanging around yet if you keep to yourself and use your common sense, you shouldn't run into a bad situation. The hotel staff was very professional and we were able to get all of our tourist questions answered. Free computer usage available to customers and there were snacks available in the lobby throughout the day. The breakfast, included in the price, was excellent. What a way to start the day! Seems like several patrons mentioned the main elevator and how slow it is. This is true. Just use the second, smaller elevator, by the entrance to the breakfast eating area. The room was nice and clean. We had a room on the third floor facing the backside of the property. The bathroom was small yet it suited us just fine. Only complaint about the bathroom, the shower drain was slow. The room did not have air conditioning yet a floor fan was in the room and we utilized it at night. Yes, free mini bar. We drank pretty much all of the contents in the frig and the next day, when the room was cleaned, the mini bar was refilled. We would stay here again for you cannot beat the price, location and all of the amenities. We walked everywhere and the hotel is only a five minute walk to the river or to the center of town.
