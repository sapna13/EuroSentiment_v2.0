{"text":"Great location but some rooms are awful I booked this hotel purely for its location - on the bottom part of La Rambla and only five minutes' walk from the sea to the south and Placa de Catalunya in the north. The staff are generally very friendly although on occasion one in particular would ignore us completely (this may be more of a Barcelona thing that just this hotel as it also happened in a shop and a restaurant too). Our room (220) was pretty unsatisfactory - as another traveller observed some rooms face inwards to a tiny courtyard that is four storeys high, which affords the room no natural light at all. My friend and I had trouble telling whether or not it was daylight when we woke up, even on the sunniest of days. I'm not a big fan of artificial lights but they had to be on all the time we were in the room. Other than that it was perfectly clean and habitable though, and a free safe in the room isn't something you find everywhere.A big warning to all those travelling to Barcelona - pickpockets are rife and damn they're good! I lost my wallet from an inside pocket literally between paying in a cafe and carrying the tray to a table. No idea how it was taken but please take every care yourselves. I knew of the problem before I left and felt I was being extremely vigilant throughout but still someone saw an opportunity. As I say it is rife - when I informed the hotel they sympathised and told me that three thieves had a few minutes earlier been arrested by police outside the hotel (not mine though unfortunately!).I didn't let it spoil the stay though and am looking forward to returing to see the bits I missed this time round. If I do stay in the hotel again - I'm not entirely discounting it but the price would have to be right - I will ensure that I have a room that faces outwards! ","annotations":[]}
