{"text":"Small nice hotel with excellent service The Hof is an excellent recommendation for business travelers and others that are looking for 5 star services for a great price. Although I didn't go to Frankfurt for business, it is still very accessible to visit all of Frankfurt from this location. The train, which is interestingly difficult compared to Paris, Barcelona and others, is located across the street and can take you anywhere.Some of the best features that were written about, I have to mention as well, which is one of the reasons why we decided upon the Hof and not the Radisson or others was the extras that they give you. By no means am I cheap, but being an American in Europe and the Euro issue, we should take advantage of the few things that ARE offered. The staff gives you free fruit in your room: banana, red  green apple and an orange with one still and sparkling water. These are replenished 2x\/day. The mini bar has 2 oj's, 2 German beers, and lemon  lime mixers. All for free. Restocked 2x\/day as well.One of the best services are the complimentary drinks 6-8 pm in the lounge. You have your choice of anything! Also, you are giving marinated black  green olives, nuts, and BBQ chips. Nice touch, but they should rotate the items daily for variety. If you haven't been to Europe in a while, this drink bill out would be about $75. This is a great precursor to dinner.One of the biggest surprises is the lack of breakfast options. Personally, I think they should add, maybe even for pay, some croissants, muffins, and coffee. To get this, you have to walk down to the Marriott and get it. About 1\/8 mile~not far, but not convenient. A turn down service is offered which is excellent and you have yourself waiting with slippers and robe. You will love it.All in all, the HOF is an excellent option from the larger and swankier hotels, but the service here is what makes it different.
