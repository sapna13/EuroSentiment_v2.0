{"text":"Absolutely perfect in every way! MY husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Madeleine for a long weekend and truly could not have had a more perfect experience. The hotel is absolutely lovely. It only has 86 rooms so you get the best of both worlds- the boutique charm and size size coupled with the professionalism and care of a major worlwide chain . The decor is great -- a modern yet comfortable Parisian look. Our room was just fabulous with a large king size bed with crisp white linens, feather pillows, and a feather duvet. The drapes were plush and oversized giving the modern room a very warm feel. There was a huge flat screen TV and movies on demand along with your basic international channels like BBC and CNN etc. The room has high speed internet access if you need to bring work with you or their business center has free internet as well. The bathroom was amazing with mirrored walls and marble flooring. There was a huge jacuzzi tub and a seperate shower with great water pressure. We had a view of the Eiffel Tower which was so incredible to see at night when we were getting ready for the evening. The staff is just so helpful and FRIENDLY (don't listen to the rumors about mean Parisians) and go out of there way to make your stay great. Ask for the concierge, Aurore Dinis, if you go. She sat down with us for a glass of champagne when we arrived to help us figure out where we should eat each night etc. She made all the bookings for us and her suggestions could not have been better. She even helped us with a personal errand on her day off after we left because my husband bought something in the wrong size --so she exchanged it for us and had it sent to us the next day! Now that is service. We have been alot of places and have never been treated so well.They convert their sitting area in to a restaurant for meal times which is so great because you feel like you are eating in your living room. We had breakfast at the hotel every morning and it was just fabulous. We also had lunch on our last day and it was delicious as well. The location is great. My husband and I walked everywhere on our trip because the weather was nice (It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the Louvre) and felt like that was a sight in its own. Just walking through the streets of Paris is a joy so it makes the effort worth the while. Plus, then you can eat all the french food you want. However, apparently their metro is great.We could not recommend this hotel more highly. Finding the perfect hotel in a huge city can be hard, but trust me, this is it! Look no further.
