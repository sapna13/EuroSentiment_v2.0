{"text":"Found nothing wrong here Am always interested in how hotels get such high rankings on tripadvisor. After staying here, i think the answer is: you walk away with nothing to complain about and you realize how rare that is. This hotel was great - not the best hotel of course - but for the price, it's great. I guess it is the absence of bad reviews that puts this hotel in such a high position. There wasn't any one thing that was great - but everything was above average. And if you're spending your own money, you won't feel like you overspent here. This hotel charges you for nothing extra (the internet wi-fi for free was a big plus) except late-afternoon beverages or drinks and mini-bar items. It's refreshing to walk away from a hotel and not have a bunch of extra charges on your bill.I've read all the reviews and everyone seems to be in agreement - staff is fabulous, location is excellent. The only things I'd add: yes, the floors\/ceilings are thin. Hearing the water running (loudly) through the walls\/ceiling was surprisingly loud. Not worth a bad review, but worth a mention. And yes, beds are extra firm - could have asked for another room probably, but wasn't worth the energy. Also, on the plus side: there's a laundromat right behind the hotel and right near the residences (where we stayed). It's great to have access to a washer\/dryer even if you don't think you'll use it. And when you check out, they actually ask you if you have suggestions for them - and sound like they really want to know, which is great! Arrivaderci ","annotations":[]}
