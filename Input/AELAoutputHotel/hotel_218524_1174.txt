{"text":"Setting a precedent Wow, what can we say. My husband and I chose to go to Excellence Punta Cana to make up for a very disappointing honeymoon on Grand Turk at the Manta House 1.5 years ago.The Excellence Punta Cana was remarkable, from the first minute we set foot on the marble entry floors we were treated graciously and with big smiles when learning we were Canadian. We had room 10206 which was nice and quiet with a fabulous view of the Excellence Club pool area and the ocean. What a fabulous view to wake to morning after morning. It was on the thrid floor and I think the vaulted ceilings made a huge difference to keeping the rom cool at night.Our holiday was one week and we felt a few more days would have been great. The resort was nice and quiet when we first arrived April 12th and when we left it was 100% full.The only disappointment I had was the Excellence Club, it just did not seem to be what I thought it would. Yes there was food but it could have been changed out more often and perhaps the host staff could have followed through a bit better including being flexible for check out times as it was indicated late check out was included in the club. However it certainly did not hamper the trip. Would I pay again to have the Excellence Club? Probably not.My husband joined in rousing games of volleyball on the beach with Luis and Julio Cesar. They were both great and made a point of sayinghello whenever they saw us. Crissina(?) for the shows and Disco alongwith Jose Luis in Toscana and Chez Isabelle were fabulous and attentive. Julissa(on the pool deck) was ever smiling. Pierre, my friend, worked as hard as he could to drum up horse riding business. And was great in accepting we just were not interested. Best of luck.Promotions for all!!!Gosh that is a ton of info and rambling. Nancy in hut #6 is great andyes you can bargain. She even donated stamps for a letter. Have a fabulous time when you choose this resort. I do believe they work very hard to meet some demanding standards of travellers.
