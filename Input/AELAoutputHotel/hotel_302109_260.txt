{"text":"Amazing Hotel I stayed at Shangri La this August with my husband. The hotel is really beautiful. We stayed in the Garden Wing which has a tropical theme, all the rooms come with a balcony, ours was over looking immaculate gardens and the pool, we were given a corner suite which had an extended balcony which was worth it as it was big enough for the sun loungers and had small dining area which would be ideal for a in room service meal. We were celebrating our first wedding anniversary and the friendly reception staff noticed from my passport that it was also my birthday, the following morning the hotel sent up a birthday card, a box of complimentary chocolates and wine, in addition to the complimentary fruit basket we already had, I thought that was a really nice touch. Our breakfast was included which was served at The Line Restaurant in a buffet style, which is truly amazing. Their lunch and dinner choices were fantastic too. They had every type of cuisine imaginable.The main shopping area of Orchard Road is about a 15mins walk away, however if it is too hot to walk the Hotel offers a complimentary bus shuttle service every hour which takes you straight to one of the main shopping malls on Orchard Road.There is a really nice piano bar serving drinks to the sound of a live mellow singer and there is a Blu Restaurant on the 25th floor which has an amazing panoramic view of the Singapore skyline- both well worth a visit.The only criticism was that that Hotel did not appear to have an ATM, the nearest ones were on orchard Road. Overall we had a fantastic stay, the hotel staff are really friendly and cannot do enough, the hotel is very luxurious and well worth a visit.
