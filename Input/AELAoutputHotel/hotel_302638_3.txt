{"text":"Melia Benow, will definitely come back My husband and I stayed at Melia Benoa for 12 nights in September\/October. The staff were really welcoming upon arrival, greeting us with a refreshing drink.The room was spacious, spotless and had a nice balcony. We booked a sea view room but didn't get one as the majority of the rooms are inward facing over the gardens which are fantastic so we didn't mind too much.The staff are fantastic and always happy to see you and take the time to learn your names. The evening entertainment was good, a live band most nights and balinese dancing 3 times a week when the evening meal was at the beach restaurant and was usually a bbq of some sort.The hotel were great at organising a taxi that would stay with you for the day and take you where ever you wanted to go around the island. We also did a reef island tour which took in 3 different neighbouring islands, included lunch and stopped of to snorkel twice. The snorkelling is fantastic, and the crew were very helpful and made the day extremely enjoyable.Back to the hotel, there is a lovely bar with waiter service and they remember your drink order. The pool bar is good and is a good excuse to get out of the sun, unless you're in the swim up part.The beach is ok. When we were there the tide was out for most of the day so we couldn't swim. We sometimes struggled to get a sun bed as the usual reserving them with a towel or book goes on even out here.Definitely recommend staying here and as people that like to try new places, this is one place that we will come back to.
