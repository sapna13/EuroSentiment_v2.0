{"text":"Choose another hotel, this is not worth the money Room was tiny, they advertised large beds, but the bed in the double room was hardly queen size. If you didn't leave the room empty early enough (by 2pm or so), usually no cleaning was to be expected. Breakfast was disgusting, 9,50 euros for two pieces of dried out cheese, rotten (honestly, it was) garlic butter, pieces of white airy toast or rolls, bad coffee and bad orange juice. Breakfast buffet was 17,50, wasn't too tempted to try after the first breakfast experience. There was complimentary coffee, but many times only decaf, for some weird reason... Also more than one creamer a week seemed to be too much to hope for.Also they were proud about the view, well, our view was to some interior part, where no sky was to be seen, only the opposite wall. Also many small things that wouldn't require too much money were unsatisfactory, like no place where to hang your wet towel in the bathroom. No mirror, except the small one in the bathroom. Only positive surprise was free fixed line internet, provided you have your laptop with you, which I did.The staff was not very nice, when we came, the guy told us that we are lucky getting the last room as they are over booked. I had booked and paid the room 5 months before, so I damn well expect to have a room when I arrive! I don't mind staying in cheap dormitories with limited comfortability, but when I pay almost 1000 euros a week, I would expect a bit - no, a lot - more!!!! Please choose another hotel!
