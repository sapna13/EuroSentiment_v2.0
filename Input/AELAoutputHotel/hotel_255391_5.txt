{"text":"Not bad for a one night layover I had a one night layover in Sydney and wanted something close to the airport after coming off of a 14 hour flightSome good and bad things i noticed and experienced at the hotel are listed below:Good Points - has free airport to hotel shuttle that runs at regular 30 minute intervals (but there is a problem going from the hotel to the airport...read on below) - great service, staff are friendly and helpful - no complaints at all - nice lobby, classy - bar and restaurant easily accessible - room was clean (i got the king bed room on ninth floor), modern furnishings, spacious bathroom, bed was comfy (lots of pillows), free high speed internetBad Points - airport shuttle from hotel to the airport is billed at $5.00 - kinda funny considering the airport to the hotel shuttle is free - i thought that was cheap - smelly hallway (at least on the ninth floor) - as soon as you get off the elevator it hits you - a musty smell, made me wonder what kind of smell was waiting for me in my room (thank goodness my room didn't smell!) - carpets are well worn out in the hallway - it really stands out! the carpet is worn in front of all the doors - the food was ok - i would have said it was good but i had the unpleasant experience of the hot breakfast at the in-hotel restaurant Amelias - to be fair, there was a great spread of food, lots of fresh fruit with a wide variety, fresh baked pastries, lots of different juices - that part is good - but the hot breakfast was terrible - just thinking about it makes me wanna puke - the scrambled eggs were cold and watery, sausages were cold - there is no excuse for this, especially since i showed up at 5:30 am, when they open the restaurant, the food should be hot (or warm at least!)Verdict: I would stay there again for a layover only but icksnay on the hot breakfast ","annotations":[{"endOffset":470,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":466},{"endOffset":1427,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":1419}]}
