{"text":"Loved it! A great place to stay. We visited the hotel for a three night stay in Amsterdam as a mini break after getting a really good deal on the price of the room on a hotel website. There were three hotels that we were looking at, and after reading the reviews for them on Trip Advisor, we settled on this one.On our arrival the staff were warm and friendly, taking time to show where the location of the hotel was in relation to the rest of the city and where the nearest tram stops were etc. so we wouldn't get lost. They also asked how much we paid for the taxi to make sure we hadn't been ripped off - offering advice on how much fares should be to certain places.We realised a certain amount of this was stalling as when we got to our room we found a freshly chilled bottle of champagne on ice waiting for us - I had mentioned the fact that we were recently married and there was a card congratulating us with the bubbly, so that was a nice surprise!Considering we had got a 'deal' on the room it was a good size with a lovely comfortable large bed, and very quiet considering the room was off the hallway near the lift.Both the room and the bathroom were impeccably clean and well maintained throughout the stay, with simple chic design, as was the rest of the hotel: it's a lovely traditional Dutch building that used to be townhouses, so there are quite a few old architectural features, but has been well designed with modern fittings that make the whole place feel very comfortable and well-heeled, but not austere as some chic hotels can. We felt very relaxed throughout our stay, and the staff were always friendly and efficient, providing us with bathrobes and an adaptor upon request (we weren't charged for the adaptor, contrary to someone else's review), and even booking us a table at a fantastic Chinese restaurant that they recommended to us (for some reason we both had a hankering for Chinese that night - go figure).I would definitely go back to this hotel, aside from having a lovely stay there and being made to feel pampered and relaxed, it's in a great location, on a quiet leafy street in a smart district, but also about a minute's walk away from the Rijkmuseum, and within easy walking distance of most parts of the city.
