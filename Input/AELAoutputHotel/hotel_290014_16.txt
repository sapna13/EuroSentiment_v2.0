{"text":"An Amazing hotel in lovely florence I stayed at the hotel for 3 days in july. We arrived late as we missed are flight (thanks to london underground!). The staff were still awake and very helpful they spoke very good english for anyone who struggles with italian! We stayed in room 205\/206 I can't remember it was the room right at the end of the corridor. The room was lovely, tidy, clean and spacious. The bathroom was marble and had a nice big bathtub and and shower. The room was so much more than i was expecting it had a tv, a minifridge, a little dressing room\/wardbrobe area lots of nice soft lighting and Aa large table with a mirror and chair. There was also room serivce if you wanted it and breakfast in bed! The aircon worked very well the water was always hot and there was always clean towels. The breakfast wasn't to bad either they had a selection of breads, jams, fruit, yougurts, crossiants, and scramble eggs, sausages and bacon. The tea and coffee was lovely and bought to you fresh by staff when you sat down and they had a selection of fruit juices. The bar had a large selection of drinks and a friendly bar staff we drank there one night and I couldn't believe how much alcohol they gave us in each shot in comparison to at home! The hotel staff were helpful and printed of train and bus times for us, gave us leaflets about bike hire and drew on a little map how to find the supermarket! The hotel is around 15-20 minutes from the town centre so those who dont like walking I wouldn't suggest it! On the first day we walked the long way which took us 20 mintues, but by the same evening we found a much faster way I would suggest gettin a map from the hotel if you dont like walking down little side streets and exploring! The hotel is very easy to find and is actually well located, I was happy to get away from the noise of the centre at night, and we cycled back there for dinner in the evening which was lovely a night cycle through a beautiful city! Overall I loved the hotel great staff and an amazing room I would stay again and again. I would suggest this hotel for everyone I'm only 20 and stayed with my boyfriend and we had an amazing time, we saw older couples their and families this hotel is for everyone!
