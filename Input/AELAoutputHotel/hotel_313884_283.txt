{"text":"Great Value Just got back from 2 weeks at the Punta Cana Princess ( Dec. 5 to 19) and thought I would share my findings with anyone looking for reviews. We had a great holiday. Along with the fact the resort is a little smaller (at 270+ rooms) than some and is adult only (according to staff this may change back in Feb.) it is a very quiet and relaxing setting. On the other hand, if you want more action  activity, you have the option to go next door to 2 large sister resorts and use the amenities and restaurants there. The rooms, resort, pool and beach are kept very clean.The food is fairly typical what you find in most D.R. resorts but plentiful and lots of variety. One would be hard pressed to not find something they like. The D.R. often gets a bad rap for people getting sick on the food or whatever but my own observation is that it is generally over consumption of sun, alcohol,  food, in that order. As is the case with traveling to any strange country, you might get thrown off a bit (and yes, I do) but this can be minimized if you √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√úase into it√à√\u2020\u2022?slowly and don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go at it too hard at the start.The staff is great. While predominantly Spanish, they always seem to be able to communicate or will get someone that can. One has to empathize that they are dealing with English, French, German, and a host of other languages. Most important, they are a friendly (if you are) courteous, congenial people who seem happy to do for you what ever they can. I tip the occasional dollar out of appreciation (and also because they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ receive gratuities as most operators suggest in their brochures) but it is not necessary in order to receive good service. A smile and simple √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√\u2020racias√à√\u2020\u2022?will go along way.The beach is rated by some travel magazines in the top 10 beaches in the world for a good reason. It is white, wide and long.To summarize, the 5 star rating by some operators might be a bit of a stretch but it is definitely 4+. Good bang for the buck. Go and enjoy your holiday. ","annotations":[]}
