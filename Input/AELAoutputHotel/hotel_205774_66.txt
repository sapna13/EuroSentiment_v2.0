{"text":"Friendly Hotel in Florence This was my first trip to Florence. My niece stayed at Hotel Kursaal and recommended it to me. After researching a lot of hotels, I decided to stay there also. I checked in on October 1 and left on Oct. 6. My room was very clean, spacious, and cozy. Had planned to leave earlier but was so comfortable that I stayed longer. Location is near the train depot, and I could walk to museums and the other interesting sights in Florence...didn't need a taxi. The breakfast was delicious and there was a variety of items for anyone's taste. The breakfast room was most charming and enjoyed starting my day there. Everyone at Kursaal was friendly and helpful, and believe me I asked a lot of questions! Monika answered many questions via Email before I even arrived, which was very helpful for me during the planning stages of my trip! The staff also helped me find restaurants and my way around the city. I want to especially thank Monika, Paola, Giovanpaolo, and Alessandra for all their assistance and friendly smiles. Everyone works very hard to run the hotel and keep it neat and functioning smoothly. Also, the night staff was sweet as can be although I don't know all their names. Kursaal made me feel at home in a foreign city. It was a perfect introduction to Florence and Italy which helped to make my stay there most memorable. Thanks Hotel Kursaal Ausonia for Everything!
