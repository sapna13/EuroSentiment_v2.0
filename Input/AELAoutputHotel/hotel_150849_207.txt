{"text":"We have been robbed WE HAVE BEEN ROBBEDWe just return from Riu Bambu, Punta Cana, after 10 days, July 2nd to 11th it was the 4th Apple vacation experience in the Caraibe and I have to admit the worst one. The problems start after we got home.As soon as we got home we started unpacking we realized that we HAVE BEEN ROBBED, my diver watch, my perfume, my son√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ perfume were missing.It is the last day in Riu Bambu, my son went to the beach, and my wife and I star preparing the luggage for returning home. We packed everything and hung the DND (do not disturb) sign on the door and went to have breakfast. After breakfast, pick up my son from the beach, return to the room, make sure we have everything, took our suitcases and went to the airport. In the short period of time that we had breakfast, the house keeping lady got into our room despite the DND sign on the door, she took the time to open ad least one of our suitcases and look inside the cosmetic bag and than my diver watch was in his case wrapped in a towel for protection against unnecessary socks. There is no other way my watch and the perfumes could have been stolen any other place. During the vacations we tipped the house kipping lady every day $ 2 but looks it was not enough. In hindsight I noticed every day some liquor was missing from room mini bar, not a big deal I said to myself and I did not make any complain. I realized they are poor people so her husband can enjoy a free drink every night. Now I see clearly that it was not just that liquor that was being stolen.Our lost in this vacation was $ 500.About the resort√à√\u2020\u2022?25 to 30 years old, 3 stars with a huge 5 stars price.Beside the beaches some of the bars and the dinner time at the buffet everything else sucks big time. Lunchtime it was like in a sauna, no air conditioning. Same with the other restaurants open only for dinner with reservations only NO A\/C.Food was good.Please be aware of the first timer√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ reviews.
