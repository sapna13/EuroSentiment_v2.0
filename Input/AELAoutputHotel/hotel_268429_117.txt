{"text":"Beautiful Little Inn We stayed at the Coral Princess Inn last weekend, after reading several reviews on this site. The location is great, extremely central in the Condado area, just 1,5 block away from the Marriott Hotel, and two blocks from the beach. Walgreens is right around the corner, for any little groceries. Being a manager in a 4-Star Renaissance hotel in the Caribbean, I can say that I know where I'm talking about: The hotel has a small reception, with staff that is helpful, and are willing to do an extra step for you. The 25 rooms are among 3 floors, of which the topfloor is the nicest, with the biggest rooms(suites), some sort of living room(nicely maintained), a pooltable, and a outside area with loungchairs and a jacuzzi. On the ground floor, where our room was located, the place is full of plants, (maybe even too full), which gives a very comfortable cozy atmosphere. Breakfast happens there, on nicely maintained furniture.The room we were in was Nr.10, which is actually a room for disabled, so we had no jacuzzi but a shower, which worked out OK. The hotel was full, so there was no choice as to stay in that room. The rooms have a fridge, microwave, a TV, a good airco-unit, but no cutlery in the drawers under the microwave... The fridge was filled with some beverages , which were very cheap ($1,- for Soda, $2,- for beer). The turndown service was up to 4\/5 star standard, with daily refreshment of towels, etc... Moreover, which is in my opinion the most important, the place was clean and well maintained, both inside as outside the rooms!The breakfast, which is included, consists daily(!) of: OJ, Coffee, Milk, Flakes, Croissants, 3 kinds of pastries, ham\/cheese, yoghurts, marmelade, bananas. Good enough to start your day with. But for a week stay it would be a little boring.The one little difficulty is parking, with only four spots in front of the hotel. My Puerto Rican friend had to park her car everytime on parking lot Magdalena, which is one block away, and is $10,65 for 24 hours. That's the best deal you can get closeby, or you might wanna choose to go and find yourself a spot in the nearby streets.If you are used to big hotels and robotic service, go to those places, and pay double of what you pay here; a nice, cozy and clean(!) place, on a great location and TOP value for money. Have fun!!
