{"text":"Very disappointed - not up to the Westin's usual standard I have to say that our experience at the Westin over New Year was very different to some of the reviews on this site. We were extremely disappointed with the overall level of service in the hotel and whilst we took the time to meet with the Assistant Manager to raise our concerns whilst we were there, he never followed up with us. We stayed in the family rooms which were great - good size and accommodated our two kids and my mother perfectly. Little touches like Play Station and kids board games in the room was also a nice touch.At check-in, which took ages, someone forgot to give us our kids packs which included cups where the children can get free drink refills throughout their stay. We only realised we were missing out on this when we noticed other kids with these cups but by that stage we had been there 5 days and had been paying! This oversight was just one of the many issues we had during our week-long stay.The service in the restaurant for breakfast every morning was appalling, The maitre'd had no control over assigning tables, so people were waiting for ages for tables to be cleared and just grabbing free tables when people got up to leave, as they were tired of waiting. The queue for waffles and pancakes meant at least a 20 minute wait each morning.Service in the beach restaurant (The 'Ikan') at dinner was also slow. The waiters did not have a clue about wine and we were frequently served white wine when we had ordered red! On two occasions, we waited up to 45 minutes to get a drink.The straw that broke the camel's back though, was the debacle over their New Years Eve Celebration. If you stay at the hotel over New Year, it is complulsory to attend (or at least pay for) their celebration dinner. The cost was US$200 plus 21% tax per adult and US$100 plus 21% tax per child. We would never choose to pay US$600 for a dinner with our two young kids, but we were not able to opt out, which really annoyed us. What annoyed us even more though, was that this was a buffet dinner and when we arrived, we were told that wine and drinks were extra!There were some good points in the hotel - kids area in the restaurant at breakfast, the well-equipped gym (although they don't provide bottles of water for some reason?) and the great covered sun domes on the sun beds. Overall though we were very disappointed. We felt the hotel was too big, too impersonal and lacked the intimacy and warmth of many other Bali hotels we have stayed in over the years.Needless to say, we won't be going back to the Westin in Bali again, even though we have enjoyed staying at many of their other properties. It was a very disappointing experience!
