{"text":"Perfert and Excellent! This wonderfully updated boutique hotel is in an ideal location. It is tucked between the Puerta del Sol and Grand Via and walking distance to the museum distric and the Royal Palace. It's location gives you easy access to all important Madrid sights without having to deal with the unbearable noise and congestion of the Grand Via and Puerta del Sol.The hotel itself is extremely clean and updated with great room amenities. We had a Junior Suite which gave us plenty of room for four and a good view onto a Plaza. The service was impeccable. We are well traveled and recognize the difference between good and excellent service. Any and all requests were immediately responded to. Extra pillows arrived within five minutes, a request for cups and saucers in our room was met without hesitation, a call was made to our room the night before check out to ask if we needed a taxi for transport to the airport, and on and on. We had the hotel breakfast each morning and it was worth the cost and kept us going for the hours before a late lunch. It is more like a brunch than a breakfast. Fresh baked goods, fresh fruit, ham, salmon, ham and salmon mini sandwhiches with fresh baguetts, scrambled eggs, bacon, eggs sunnyside up, yogurt, cereal, and granola. I am sure that I am missing some of the items but it was great. Once again, the service at brunch was impeccable. The reception staff can appear to be stoic but they are extremely helpfull. They made dinner reservationss and printed out Renfe time tables and weather forecasts when requested, and again, within minutes. I saw an earlier post regarding the sleepness nights from bottles being unloaded outside their window. We heard a little of this from our second floor room but were able to muffle it by closing the double windows. However, I could imagine it being a problem if your room was in close proximity to this noise. We did conclude after our trip that our perception of a hotel was influenced by our rooms as well as the over all quality. We were in a fabulous hotel in Granada but the room was less than desirable. We were in a good hotel in Seville but it was made better by having the best room in the hotel. So, be certain to discuss room location and view when booking anywhere.The Preciados was perfect for our family of four which included two adult children. We all had a great experience at this hotel.
