{"text":"Stayed here 5 times in 3 years and will be back This is a five star hotel - make no mistake about it. They look after you here and make you feel welcome. The pool is outside and is great to swim in at night and check out the buildings as they light up. The gym is a little small but well equipped. The rooms have a nice flatscreen tv and the best bit (as I get bored on business trips) is that they also have a dvd player in each room. HK is great , you can pick up a vcd or dvd and off you go. Rooms are of a good size and well equipped - desk, armchair, large bed. Bathroom has a separate shower\/bath and again good size. What makes this so easy is the location. As other reviewers have said, it is part of the Pacific Place complex and therefore really easy to get out and about. Drop down into the mall and walk over to the MTR. THe MTR is very cheap and easy to use. If you want to take a cab down to the star ferry or the airport express - its only going to cost you (max) HK$30. Its SO CHEAP.Breakfast is a good spread with everything you'd expect. The price is high - but you get this comp'd if you are a high tier Hilton HHonors card holder. The exec lounge is a little sterile but the views are great and not a bad place to go up and have a coffee and look down over the skyline.I've never been tempted to go next door to either the marriot or the Shang.
