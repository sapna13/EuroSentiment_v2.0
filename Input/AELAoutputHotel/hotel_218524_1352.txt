{"text":"Cancel your trip ASAP My husband and I, aged 54 and 59, travel frequently during the winter, one week each month to a warmer climate for six months out of the year. Our agent found this all-inclusive, air included for $3000 per week so, even though we usually frequent the Ritz or the Four Seasons, Secrets rated iself highly, so we took a gamble on a bargain price. We lost.Room: Garishly painted bright colors, improperly cleaned nasty Jacuzzi, claustrophobicly small shower\/toilet room. The ceiling leaked each time the fellow above us showered....disgustingly annoying, and apparantly un-fixable as the repair person came every day with his caulking gun to no avail.Food: No excuses here! The German head chef was apologetic but unbending. The head waiters were helpful, and for $20 each night allowed us to order whatever we wanted, (complete with our explicit cooking instructions) and so after a few days they were preparing large fresh shrimp sauted in garlic and butter and really excellently grilled fish and chicken. We soon discovered that with a little tipping, anythng was possible, including properly prepared alcoholic drinks.General hotel environment: Typical mish mash, no real theme, but the groundskeeper's worked very hard, as did all the workers. The staff seemed to sense most guest's disapointment, which seemed palpable to us, and tried very hard to remedy unpleasantries. However, this country is very poor and really lacks the physical resources to maintain a resort of this size, and apparantly does not attract good management personnel either.Beach: Amazing palm growth, and extremely deep and wide sand area, well maintained. Choppy, on the north island side, not your bathtub Caribbean water experience as in other areas.For us, there will always be another resort or warm beach to visit. For a first timer to the Caribbean, or someone who only vacations infrequently...I would suggest you save your money, do a bit more research, skip the DR.
