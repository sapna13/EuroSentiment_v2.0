{"text":"Impressively charming and classy Made month-long reservations for a business trip and had no idea how great my stay would be. I actually had a chance to move to the Hilton after 2 weeks but decided to stay at CIS. This is the BEST hotel when looking for elegance, comfort and affordability. EXTERIOR: Designed to blend with historic surroundings of old warehouse style neighborhood - TOTALLY adds to the charm. ATRIUM: Amazing 5 story area of brick and exposed beams. STAFF: Helpful and courteous, from front desk personnel to the maintenance guys. VALETS: Friendly, fun, and professional even during crunch time a.k.a. check out. LOBBY: Offers free internet\/printing, and small but respectful library of reading material. SITTING\/LOUNGE AREAS: Plentiful and cozy. COURTYARD: CHARMING! Allows hotel to claim New Orleans roots without screaming √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ªecently renovated√à√\u2020\u2022? POOL: Small √à√\u2020\u2022?more like a large spa sans the jets. 4ft depth may be found boring for swimmers but great for a refreshing dip or evening hang out. POOLSIDE BATHROOM\/CHANGING ROOM: Nice, roomy and private. WORKOUT ROOM: Good variety of machines with fresh towels available in both pool and workout areas. D√ã√ë¬∞COR: Elegant mix of traditional, classic and serene throughout hotel and guest rooms. Be sure to grab a home baked cookie at the front desk on your way to the lobby bar and have a drink and a chat with John the bartender.I found all the room amenities listed on the website accurate. 2 room suites along Natchez (bedroom and living room) seemed more like a small apartment than hotel room. The King beds are high, soft and sleep inducing. Housekeeping was GREAT, consistent, thorough, patient and friendly. The dining room was always clean and neat. Breakfast offers an incredible variety, even for continental. If you walk away hungry then its your fault. Take the other comments seriously about CIS being conveniently located. You can see Canal Street from the front door but don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to suffer hearing the late night nightlife on most nights (after all, this is New Orleans). Less than 20 minute walk to the river, mall, aquarium, Drago√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ at the Hilton and into the French Quarter.Negatives (sorry!): Room air conditioning units work almost too good, noisy garbage trucks collects between 3-5am - request an inside room if this will affect your stay, though there are plenty of sitting areas, the hotel isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ huge and when large groups stay it seems like they are √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢aking over√à√\u2020\u2022?the entire hotel.I almost forgot I wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ staying in a place that Zagat√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ classify as a luxury hotel. CIS offers the same services but with a personable staff, cozy atmosphere and affordable rates. Forget the fact you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ afford a room somewhere else or there wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ any availability. CIS√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ sophisticated charm will make you forget you wanted to stay elsewhere. This is truly New Orleans best kept hotel secret, which is why I hesitate to write a good review, though well deserved. I have no idea how they stay in business, being such a great hotel of extremely high quality and service, at such a low price. Other luxury hotels may be high class but this hotel has more class and charm than any of them!
