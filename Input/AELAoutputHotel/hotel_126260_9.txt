{"text":"The Palace is still a Palace The New York Palace is indeed one of New York√à?√¨s top hotels. I stayed there last June for a few nights and from the moment we walked through the front door we were treated like rayalties. Although we walked in wearing Jeans and cardigan we were treated with dignety and rescept and one never got the feeling that that the staff look down on you whatever you were wearind, something that does happen at some grand luxury hotels. We stayed in a deluxe king corner room and the room was pleasing and it spacious decour made it fell lager than it√à?√¨s 350 something square feet. Both the common areas of the hotel and the room combined opulence from a bygone era with modern amenities like in-room climate control and a 40 inch plasma.We ate at the Istana restaurant twice and although there was nothing special about the food, the swift and very polite service made up for it.The New York Palce in not generally considered to be one of New York√à?√¨s top hotels. People have told me that it√à?√¨s nothing compared to the likes of the Peninsula, The Plaza or Ritz-Carlton central park but I beg to differ! The location of the Palace is excellent much better in fact than the upper east siders (pierre and peninsula). The Palace manages to be a great luxury hotel without an attitude snobbery or selectiveness. Sure, it√à?√¨s not as glamorous or flamboyant as the Plaza or Peninsula but with glamour comes excruciatingly tight security and the occasional snobbery so for me the New York Palce is one my top choices for New York accomodation.
