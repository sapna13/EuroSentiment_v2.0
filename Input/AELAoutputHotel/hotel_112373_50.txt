{"text":"Very nice stay. I booked the White Swan based on the TA reviews and was not disappointed. We are not bed  breakfast people at all, so I was a little nervous. I was in San Fran for business at Moscone and brought along my husband and 2 year old. So, I was nervous about how a 2 year old would be accepted. The staff was so wonderful to him, they all made such a fuss, nothing but friendly, getting him juice, had a crib ready without me asking, just very nice. The other guests probably weren't as enthused, but he was well behaved and they dealt with it. But, the main reason I chose the White Swan was because I had a 2 year old . I needed something more than a standard Hyatt room, and for the same price, I got a King Deluxe Romance Suite. So, this gave us some more room plus drinks and breakfast. They were smart, knowing a toddler was coming, we were given the room right above the patio\/breakfast room, so his little footsteps wouldn't wake anybody up below us. And our room was on the end, so we probably didn't interupt to many people with his 6am cartoon time. So, we loved it, our son felt like he was at Gammy's house and I was able to walk to\/from Moscone, China town, nearby restaurants. They have a great dive bar (not really a dive) up the street called Summer Place and they have an awesome juke box.
