{"text":"We would not hesitate to book at the Royal Plaza for our next visit. My husband and I and our adult daughter spent four days at the Royal Plaza Hotel in January. Through Qantas we booked two rooms for which we had paid A$1000 in total for the four nights. We thought that was a very good price. We arrived at the hotel about three hours before check-in time and were unable to access our room until sometime after the official check-in time. This was because we were keen to have adjoining rooms with a connecting door on a non-smoking floor. There is a large shopping centre attached to the hotel so we used the break to rest, read or window shop.But it was well worth the wait. We had rather more luggage than usual but the rooms were large and well set out. One room had a king sized bed with a sitting area, the other had a queen and a double bed. Both rooms had a kitchenette but no cooking utensils. The hotel as well as being located next to a large shopping centre is also above the Mongkok East railway station on the KCR line to Lo Wu (Luo Hu) in Shenzhen. One can also change lines at Kowloon Tong to the Kwun Tong line or from the new East Tsim Sha Tsui station one can walk to Tsim Sha Tsui on the Tsuen Wan line and continue to Hong Kong Island.We have stayed at a number of Hong Kong hotels and would not hesitate to book at the Royal Plaza for our next visit.
