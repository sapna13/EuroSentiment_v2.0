{"text":"Loved the Conrad! I may be biased because we were upgraded to a suite when we arrived, but I really fell in love with this hotel. The suite was enormous and had a spectacular view of the ocean, and a private plunge pool on one of the 3 terraces. The hotel grounds were beautiful and the staff were friendly and talkative, without being intrusive. There were so many small touches that made this place special - the cool spray they provide at the sun loungers, the fact that the pool is open 24 hours, which meant we could go for a late night dip after dinner under the stars. There was a turtle conservation programme, and the hotel staff left notes in every room inviting guests to see the baby turtles off before they were released back to sea.The ocean is right in front of the grounds, and so you can fall asleep to the sound of the waves. There is a public pathway that runs up and down the beach, which enables you to stroll along from one end to the other, and also to see the other hotels in the area. I thought this gave the area a really nice atmosphere, much better than staying in a secluded gated resort. (At the same time I found the security at the hotel and in Bali to be very impressive compared to other places we've been - or even to London!)The crowd was a mix of romantic couples and some families, but very subdued. I won't necessarily recommend it for young singletons who are looking for a party, or anyone looking for more of a bohemian vibe. But in terms of a mainstream hotels, this is probably the best I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world.My only - very minor - complaints were that I found the bed a bit too soft, and the grounds are quite big, so if you have to get to the other end of the hotel it is a long walk, also the watersports were loud in the mornings - very small issues considering how beautiful the Conrad is.
