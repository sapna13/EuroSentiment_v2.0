{"text":"Great resort for families This was our first visit to Punta Cana and the Iberostar Bavaro. The resort is beautiful. The lanscaping is impressive and they are constantly working to keep the place clean. We emailed our room requests and most of them were meant. Here is our take;Check in: Quick and painless. The front desk staff was very polite and spoke english.Rooms: We requested a renovated second floor room with a king bed, close to the pool\/beach with ocean view if possible. We got everything but the ocean view and renovated room. This place is huge and it helped we were only 100 feet from the pool!Beach\/pool: Both were great. We liked how the pool was set up with gradual entry. The kids pool was great! My 2.5 yr old son loved it. The beach was beautiful. My son preferred the pool so we didn't spend as much time on the beach as we would have liked. I think this is their off season so lounge chairs were not a problem, but you will need to save your chair early in the morning if you want a prime location.Food: Ok to Good. The alacarte restaruant's were very good. The buffet was good and there was variety but the menu definitely had a European slant. Even items like hamburgs and hot dogs didn't taste the same as home. No problems for my wife and I but my son didn't eat well. His best meal was at Wendy's in the PC airport.Activities\/Excurisons: There was always something going on, target shooting, water polo, bocce, darts, you name it. We didn't go on any excursions because of our 2.5 yr old son but we here the outback safari is a big hit. We have stayed at the Riu Playacar and Riu Palace in Playa Del Carmen in the past and IB Barvaro falls in between those properties. I would recommend this resort. We hope to get back in a few years.
