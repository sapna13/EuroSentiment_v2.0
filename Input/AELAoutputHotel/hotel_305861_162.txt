{"text":"Very nice √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬£ong stay√à√\u2020\u2022?package The Metropark hotel is a very nice hotel, situated in the North of Hongkong Island. With harbour view rooms you can see sport grounds in front and of course the harbour with all the daily excitements and Kowloon (mainland). It is a 5-minute walk to the metro or to several bus stops. My husband and I stayed here for one week in May 2006 and booked in advance a so called √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬£ong stay package√à√\u2020\u2022?direct with the hotel. We had a beautiful spacious suite with magnificent view, comfortable bed, sitting area and a huge bathroom with separate shower and bad. There is a coffeemaker and fridge, plenty of space for personal items and a desk with chair. The service is unbelievable; sometimes we even felt a little embarrassed, two till up to three times a day, clean towels!!!! With this executive suite deal there are much more benefits, express check-in and out, access to the executive floor √à√\u2020\u2022?Panorama Lounge - with complementary breakfast (you can also have your free breakfast in the restaurant, which we did, much more items to choose from), computers with free Internet, the whole day free coffee and tea and in the evening free cocktails. Especially this was very nice, from 5:00 till 7:30 p.m free drinks and snacks. They offer all kinds of alcoholic drinks, the quality of the red wine we had was very good. You will also have 20% discount on Food and Beverage in the bar and restaurant (we can recommend the diner buffet) All the employees were very friendly. We had a lovely stay and can surely recommend this hotel.
