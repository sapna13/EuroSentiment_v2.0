{"text":"A Quintiessential Small European Hotel Like others, when travelling to Europe, I have a picture of a hotel in my head. You know the type; often described as 'romantic' or 'quaint' . Four to six stories high. Small, but not too small. Not on a big thoroughfare, but not impossible to find either. Near the sites in a neighbourhood oozing the local culture. Full of old world charm but not lacking in the modern amenity category. A room that when you wake-up you know immediately you are in Europe. Well, this hotel fufilled my fantasy on every level! Start with the location, overlooking the Plaza Santa Cruz and only 150 meters from the Plaza Mayor, perhaps Madrid's classiest destination. The building is mature, but the hotel is only 10 years old. It is tastefully decorated throughout and well engineered. Let me focus on the wonderfull windows, over two meters high that allow plenty of light and fresh air in. Close the shutters and it becomes as dark as you need and the glass window is well constructed so that it is remarkable how much outside noise it mutes. I even liked the breakfast (maligned by other reviewers). At 7 euros it comes hassle-free and is fresh and varied so that you are bound to find something you like. At night, the desk clerk will often let you use the internet for free. Here are some local tips. The city's best tourist information office is in the Plaza Mayor. From it, you can catch some real cheap, English speaking, walking tours (Madrid must be the most easily walkable great city). The Calle de la Bolsa is a small, pedestrian friendly street that starts just outside of the hotel and easily links with the Plaza Santa Ana and eventually the Paseo del Prado. ","annotations":[]}
