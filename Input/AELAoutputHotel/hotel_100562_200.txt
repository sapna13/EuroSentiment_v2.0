{"text":"Wait until the remodel is done It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ probably unfair to even review this hotel given that it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ undergoing a massive remodel that includes a new lobby and a second tower. Nevertheless, after staying here twice in the last three months there are some things that deserve comment. First, the good news. The staff is great and does an excellent job coping with the remodeling project that has gone on longer than eventhey are willing to admit. Also, you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ beat the location for shopping and sightseeing, although it could be some better restaurants around because you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to eat at the makeshift one in the hotel. Also, the new conference area on the second floor is first rate even if the rest of the hotel isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ, at least not yet.The bad news is that the place needs a major update, which I assume will be done once the remodel is completed. The furniture in the suites is threadbare and the electronics are, well, nostalgic with a cassette tape player, VCR, and projection TV. If I dug around a little I probably could have turned up an 8-track or a turntable. An HDTV would be nice, but why bother since there are no HD channels on the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ television system. The only thing more nostalgic than the electronics is the health spa. The view is nice, but it doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ make up for the outdated equipment crammed into a too-small space. They could also take a second look at their prices. $7 for a Corona at a no-host reception and $25 for an eight-minute phone call to a city 175 miles away is laughable and insulting. Thank God for cell phones and near-by bars. You√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° think that even a hotel manager would figure out that you could make more money selling three times as many drinks at half the price rather than pricing people right out the door.So, if you really need to stay at the Sheraton Seattle, best wait until the remodel is done. If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e booking ahead and they tell it will be done by the time you arrive don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ believe them. Wait until it is really done. In the meantime, there are other hotels nearby including some that will make you feel right at home with $7 Corornas. ","annotations":[]}
