{"text":"Great location, clean hotel, comfortable beds The hotel is definitely not anything fancy with only the most basic of amenities. Having said that, the location was great to everywhere we needed to go. It was also close enough to the train station that it wasn't a problem when we had to drag our heavy suitcases a couple of blocks. The breakfast was good - cold cuts, bread, cereals, fruit, and cappuccino made to order. If you're expecting a hot breakfast with fluffy scrambled eggs, thick bacon, this is not it (they had these odd egg squares, soggy bacon, and tiny sausages...not so tasty so I stayed away from it). If you have in mind that it's a light continental breakfast you won't be disappointed. The bedroom that we had was on the 3rd floor facing the street. It was a fairly large room (for Italy) and we had 2 twin beds (upon our request). Beds were comfortable, bathrooms were large and clean, there was a safe in the room, along with a nice closet space enough for 2 women. Sadly, I forgot to bring my cable for the free internet use but I was able to purchase one for 3 Euro. I couldn't dial out to make a phone call the first time I tried and the staff thought I was a complete idiot...that is, until I asked them if they had unlocked the phones for use from their main switchboard. Then after correcting the lock down (without apologies) they told me that I was ok to go. The service was only lukewarm but if you only need a clean and convenient place to rest your head and don't need too much help around the city, this is a great place to stay. I would definitely return to this hotel in the future, given the opportunity.
