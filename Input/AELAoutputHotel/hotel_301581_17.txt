It is conveniently located next to City Hall MRT station and the Raffles City shopping centre. It is within walking distance (through the airconditioned malls) to the Singapore Flyer. Check-in time is 2pm, but we were given a room straight away even though we arrived at 9am. Check-out time is 12 noon, but we were also allowed a late check-out of 3pm at no additional cost.We stayed in a Raffles Inc Club Room, which we found was excellent value for money. The room was large and included a balcony and impressive electronic day and night curtains. It was immaculately clean, comfortably and stylishly appointed. There was a very impressive Lavazza coffee machine in the room to make your own in-room espresso √à√\u2020\u2022?perfect after a long flight. Our bags were sent to our room very quickly and there was a complimentary fruit platter and bottled water on arrival. Staying in a Club room allows you plus an invited guest entry to the Raffles Inc Lounge. This lounge offers breakfast from 6-10am (you can have breakfast at 2 other restaurant choices in the hotel if you want, but it is quieter in the lounge), from 10-5 tea\/coffee\/water\/softdrinks and biscuits are available.

There is also a live cooking station with 2 hot dishes prepared to order, and a delicious selection of desserts. There is a free broadband internet terminal in the lounge, plus some magazines and other reading material. There is also a private gym on this level (23rd) for guests staying on the club floors.There are 2 swimming pools with sunlounges on the 8th floor. There is also the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√©lligator Pear√à√\u2020\u2022?alfresco restaurant that overlooks the pool area √à√\u2020\u2022?nice for breakfast.All of the staff that we encountered were very friendly and helpful. This is my second stay at this hotel and I will definitely stay here again next time I visit Singapore.
