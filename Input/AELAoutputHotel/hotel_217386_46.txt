{"text":"could have been better no Ohh dear. What can i say. I arrived at this hotel about 10.00am as i had just finished a cruise. The staff were less than helpful and informed me that my room was not ready and i was to early. i explained that i had just come from a cruise and i did not expect my room to be ready but i had no choice but to come to the hotel.Most of the time the staff spoke in spanish and did not see to care about me. Other guests were favoured much more than me. someone took my bags and i was left to wander around. About 3.00pm i went back to reception to see if i could check in. The service was a little better but not much. I was offered the 8th floor as she said they only had one lift working.When i got to the floor (lift very slow) i had no idea where i was going. I found my room after a few minutes however it had a very funny smell (like a damp smell) The bed was ok as was my bathroom. Breakfast was intresting. I had no idea what to do or where i was going. The food was ok but i stuck to the fresh fruit and yoghurt. Trying to make a pot of tea was nearly impossible the teapot lid did not fit and nothing seemed to be in the same place. The house keeping was fair but i am sure not everything was checked. The ice bucket was not emptied and the radio station had been changed on several occasions.(only minor but anoying)The pool area was nice and i had some nice snacks lunchtime in the alligator bar. The staff here were very fine but i did have to wait some time to be served. The location was fine and whilst it was not on the doorstep of lincon road and ocean drive the buses were good and cheap. On the way back they stopped right outside the hotel.All in all the best ting about the hotel was the two gentlemen in the shop. They really looked after me and went out of their way to help especially when booking trips.All in all i have stayed in a lot better. I know the hotel is at the cheaper end of the market but manners do no cost anthing no matter what country you come from. This should of been the second week of my honeymoon but we had to postpone out weding and i travelled on my own. I am glad my boyfried missed out on this part of the trip. Whilst i wll return to Miami i will not be staying here again unless things change!!! sorry ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1072,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1069},{"endOffset":1072,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1069},{"endOffset":1072,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1069},{"endOffset":1392,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1388}]}
