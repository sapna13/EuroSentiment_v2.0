{"text":"Great Location, Quiet, and Comfortable I read many of the reviews of this hotel and they are spot on. We were even more impressed with the overall quality of this hotel when we arrived. The only surprise was that our Double Standard  room was very small indeed. I suppose this is expected in Japan, but it was still hard for us Westerners to get used to. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the amenities in the room including the refrigerator, toilet, excellent shower, and complementary toiletries. You have Tokyo's most beautiful parks within easy walking distance. Shinjuku Chuo Park near the goverment buildings is beautiful, the blossoms in Shinjuku Gyoen were spectacular, and if you like to jog, I reccommend making a right turn out of the hotel and heading south toward Yoyogi park. Absolutely beautiful.We ate breakfast every morning at the hotel where the price was very reasonable, and they had both a traditional Japanese breakfast, and western breakfast complete with eggs, cereal, potatoes, bacon, and fruit and granola.We also had one dinner at the restaurant, and it was quite good.There is also a really nice lounge room with comfortable couches, wide screen tv, two computers with printer, and a free coffee\/tea\/hot chocolate machine that made decent coffee.Not much of a view from our room, but we didn't really care since what little time we spent there we slept. Great rate for such a fine hotel right the heart of Tokyo. I would highly recommend this hotel.Follow the directions in another review about how to find the hotel. Out the south exit, across the sidewalk, turn right, go to light and look left, and you can see the hotel.Enjoy your stay!
