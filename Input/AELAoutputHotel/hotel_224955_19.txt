{"text":"more like 'crackocolis' This hotel was such a disappointment to say the least. I do not recommend this hotel unless you are looking for hard core urban decay in your vacation... yup... you'll get hookers, aggressive bums, crack heads unlimited, drunks galore... overall weirdos. This hotel is situated on the corner of Turk and Mason Street. Mason you can walk somewhat safely during the day... that being you are a in group, and you'll still come across weirdos. Turk street is a complete red flag the minute you arrive. Not only is it infested with crack heads but they are aggressive and mean. You can not walk into the hotel unnoticed. Funny that the hotel does not mention that on their website. It was not only unnerving coming and going from the hotel but it was a real nuisance at night because our window faced Turk street therefore we could hear their rants all night as well as the police sirens. The second night we were there about 6 police cars lined up the street at around 3am. It made for an unrestful night. The hotel ended being about 147.00 a night which is not much, but I've stayed for less in safer areas. It is interesting the night before we were supposed to check out, I walked into the elevator with a couple that had just arrived. He turned to his wife and said, I think I might have made a huge mistake. I turned to them and asked him if he was refering to the hotel and he responded with a dreadful nod. I reassured him that he did. Another negative to this hotel... the room was small and the sheets were not changed everyday. This would have really pist me off but I considering the location it is in... I could have not expected more. it is one of the scummiest areas. o_O I'll never ever ever ever stay here again. Never. ever. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":9,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":5}]}
