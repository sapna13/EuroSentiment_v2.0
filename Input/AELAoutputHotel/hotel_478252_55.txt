{"text":"Gran Bahia Principe Bavaro.. the best holiday for me ever Vacation Bahia Principe October 4 2008 First let me say I had a wonderful vacation here and enjoyed my stay immensely, but there were trials and tribulations to get through. Arrived in the dark of night around 10:00 pm and was escorted to our room in block 37, they all look the same, and was immediately pleasantly surprised when entering as I had a gigantic junior suite (they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e all junior suites) with a huge king bed, sofa, sitting area etc. Went to the buffet (still open) and was again pleasantly surprised at the extent of selection of dishes. Trials and tribulations:Didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ sleep too good as the air conditioner was pumping warm air and the room was not comfortable even with the ceiling fan blowing down on us. Went to reception before breakfast and explained my problem and was assured the problem would be taken care of. Went back after lunch and room was the same. Went to reception again and was told someone would take care of it. After the beach went back to the room and found it the same. Complained again and after dinner a serviceman arrived to check it out. He told us it would be cool in 2 hours. Wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ. Went to Reception again next morning and spoke to Josue who promised me it would be fixed immediately and sure enough in the afternoon it was working. Terrific√à√\u2020\u2022?but, woke up next morning to a warm room again. Went to reception again and spoke with Josue who found us a new room in the same complex and assisted in moving us personally.The good things:All the staff are friendly and well mannered professionals, but these are some that I will personally remember from this vacation.The GroundsNever have I been to such a clean resort, so well maintained, everything in place, lovely gardens and flowers everywhere.The Entertainment.Superb, the best I have encountered on any vacation ever√à√\u2020\u2022?the house band is fantastic, the disco is great, the theatre and the performances of your dancers and the shows, the best. The Dining experience.The buffet is incredible, always have good selection of great food, the A La Carte restaurants are great too, but somehow I preferred the Buffet selections.The Last DayI thought this would be a tough day, seeing as we had to vacate our room by noon, however, as usual Bahia Principe provides for your comfort to the very end. At checkout I was fortunate to see Josue again who allowed me to keep my towel cards so I could enjoy a day at the pool and have a nice relaxing day. Shower facilities are also provided near the main lobby for those who feel the need to freshen up before departure. Still had time for breakfast, lunch and snacks and all the drinks I would want, except by now all I want is soda and lime. Went to the pool, had lunch, relaxed in the lobby writing this critique. Had a great day. Said my goodbye√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ to all the friends we had made and waited for the bus.Dennis Sparkes53 Port Union RdToronto, OntarioCanadaM1C 5J2 ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2365,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":2358},{"endOffset":2518,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2514},{"endOffset":2761,"mention":"soda","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saltine_cracker"],"startOffset":2757}]}
