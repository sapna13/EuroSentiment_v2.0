{"text":"A quieter Times Square Hotel I travel quite frequently to New York on business and have never really found a hotel that offers exactly what I want. .To be fair I don't think I ever will. This time I thought I would try the Muse as its rates were pretty good.When I travel I look for quiet rooms, business facilities, a good location and helpful staff. This rather cute boutique hotel offers good value for money in an excellent location ( if you are looking to be right in the middle of a tourist area), In all seriousness it is a good hotel but be warned there are NO quiet rooms. I know many have said that you can request quiet facing rooms but they don't exist. Building work is on going nearby and this is noisy. There is also a constant background generator noise in this hotel which is distracting but you get used to it after a while. The rooms are pretty good, especially if you get one on a higher floor which I did. In terms of food, I ordered breakfast in my room which was the worst room service breakfast I have ever had in New York and it cost me $38.00. I found the doormen very helpful but the staff on reception were terrible, with the exception of one lovely lady who was on duty in the afternoon when I checked in. Having said all this, if you are visiting New York for the first time and want to be in a good location this hotel beats the competition in the area. Oh and for anyone travelling on business, this hotel has no business centre. There is an internet cafe nearby. ","annotations":[]}
