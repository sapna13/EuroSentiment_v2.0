{"text":"Absolutely perfect We spent 4 days at the GBP-Punta Cana and here's what we thought:Airport Arrival: We booked our trip through Travelocity so we took a cab. $33 bucks right to the hotel. 30 minutes. Zero Stress. Check-in- Quick and easy. Give you a fruit punch welcome drink. We paid for the safe $5 bucks a day or something small like that and had NO problems with anythnig at all. We made our reservations asap and booked the bbq restaurant (pls see below)Room: Perfectly clean (and ready when we chkd in at 230 pm). The bathroom is beautiful (all marble) great shower, good water pressure, large vanity. The bed was very comfortable and the room was spacious. No complaints whatsoever. Maid service- was great. We left her a few bucks a day and left a note to stack the fridge w diet soda and water and it was done no problem. Restaurants- Now I read ALL the reviews for the past yr so I was a bit nervous. Food was great. I grew up in the Dom Rep so I am a bit biased but the Dominican food was excellent. Even my picky eater bf found something to eat at ALL meals. There was a variety. We ate in the main lobby restaurant the most (just becuase it had the most selection). We ate snacks by the pool bar (mainly salad and french fries!) and we ate at the BBQ place which was quite good. Drinks- couldnt be easier. We tipped and got a few at a time. In terms of the lobby bar it was the best. Tip Ramon and you'll get great service. We had a blast. Casino- kinda cheesey but we won on blackjack so we were happy. Drinks are not included here. (we're not sure why). Pool- I read countless reviews about how people couldnt get chairs etc. Well I don't get it. We didnt upgrade to the Diamond club or any other for that matter and had NO problems at all. I didn't think the upgrade was worth it AT ALL.Beach- absolutely gorgeous. was a bit windy when we went but it was stormy (still sunny and nice- rains a bit but its 15 min so don't get down about it). the chairs were reserved early. i wake up early so by 9 i had ours and there were plenty more. the premium chairs (meaning the ones w umbrellas etc) would be taken by say 10 but there are ALWAYS chairs from what i could tell. Entertainment- My bf and i entertained ourselves with walks, talks, casino etc. we weren't lokoing for nightlife so we didnt have a problem. There is a disco (we didnt even walk in), shows (which we didnt see) and pueblo principe which has shops etc (not too much variety). outside the resort- since we were there for such a short pd we didnt venture. I know there is a town and suggest buying rum and presents BEFORE the airport (whcih is a complete tourist trap (pls see below). Chk-out- Completely uneventful in a good way. Took 3 minutes. Airport (at Punta Cana)- CRAP. Spent $17 on two pieces of pizza and 2 bottled waters. I live in NYC and wouldnt pay this at JFK. Rum is overpriced- duty free is a crock, BUY BUY BUY BEFORE you get here. Also double chk your flights. ours was 4 hrs delays (weather\/snow in NYC\/Chicago). I would 100% recommend this to others and 100% would come here again.
