{"text":"Clean Room, Great Location Stayed for business August '07. The location is excellent, as you can easily walk to just about all of Boston's major attractions in 20 minutes or less. We found the front desk staff to be very cheerful and efficient when we checked in at 18:00 - they made a point to upgrade me to the Executive (12th) floor due to my Gold status with Priority Club. Not sure what makes this floor different from any other, as the only thing I could see was a room near the elevator that had been turned into a lounge, but really didn't have much in it. Never saw anyone there. The room was clean, but not really too big. As noted in other reviews of this hotel, the bathroom door did indeed scrape against the toilet, as he bathroom isn't too big. I've seen many older hotels with this same problem. I found the bed to be very comfortable. There is niose from the ambulances headed into the hospital around the corner, and from the Fire Station right across the street. Didn't gget a chance to try the complimentary breakfast buffet that came with my upgrade, as it didn't open until 6:30am, and we needed to be up and out the door headed to The Job by 6:00. Starbucks conveniently located right across the street, and they opened at 6:00. Also a CVS pharmacy and Whole Foods market directly behind the hotel - very convenient. 10-15 minute walk to the North End for great Italian food and of course Mike's Pastry!Parking was $4 per night cheaper if you parked yourself - which was in the same garage as the Valet used, as far as I can tell. Overall, no real complaints. The location is great, staff wee efficient, courteous and helpful, and we enjoyed our stay. Will be back.
