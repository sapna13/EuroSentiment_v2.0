{"text":"Comfortable Neighborhood Hotel Situated adjacent to Japan Town and easy walking distance to the Filmore District, this Upper Pacific Heights Victorian is a great alternative to bustling (and noisy) Union Square and corporate hotels. Great Bus access to all of SF outside hotel on Sutter. We stayed three nights: our double queen room was adequately furnished and included mini fridge and coffee maker, although with coffee readily available in salon, not necessary. Furnishings and decor are Victorian\/eclectic, which may not be my preference, but do create a charm that is consistent with architecture. Every time I stepped out of my room I felt like I was in one of the older European hotels that I find charmingly acceptable in our travels -- ie, this isn't a Four Seasons or Omni -- if that's what you need! (those are good too..., but this is a more intimate\/casual alternative)What counts: room was clean, beds comfortable enough and bathroom a modern, clean remodel, although water pressure in shower could have used a good boost. Windows that open (quiet at night... noise picks up in A.M. with buses, etc. ) Staff: helpful -- especially concierge staff who assisted us with transportation needs. Best: convenient access to all that SF has to offer without staying in the center of the tourist districts (union square or wharf) -- add in a continental breakfast and reasonable charge for parking if you need it and the Queen Anne is a winner. (we did need to skip the continental breakfast one morning to indulge in La Boulangerie in the Fillmore district...) There are decent dining options close by and easy bus transport to others. If you want the feel of living in SF, stay at the Queen Anne, hop on a bus and walk. SF was just voted the most walkable city in the US by walkable.com and we couldn't agree more!
