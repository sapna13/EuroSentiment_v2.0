{"text":"Don't Waste your Money - Listen to These Reviews I tried to be optomistic and not listen to the crummy reviews. I had a cheap rate ($155 per night) through the Hotel directly and thought it could not be all that bad. Well, it was awful. The rooms are certainly dumpy. I could have lived with that, if the hotel had not been in such a transition.The lobby and pool are still maintained well. The Palomino Island was nice but again, deserted and a little bazaar. Only about 20 people were there. I saw fire alarms not functioning and smashed and broken. The Furnicular had the engine cover propped open throughout our stay. Yes, I wondered if everything was really mechanically sound. It is obvious that they are running on half staff at the moment as they have no clientele and are running with a skeleton crew. I went 1 week prior to Xmas with 7 family members. The hotel is undergoing an entire multi-million dollar face lift. In 2008 I will not be able to afford it. It will be the most outstanding property on the island. However, at the moment, the hotel is just trying to get by with a few bookings and running on minimal capacity. It is a ghost town. The stores are closed most of the time, the resturants are spookily empty. Many things are just not up  running at the moment as they go through this transition. Yes, the staff are pleasant, but the hotel lacks spirit or a fun environment. It is completely DEAD! It was the holiday season and I expected a little holiday music, Island festivities etc... Zip, nada , zero. Pretty depressing. Long story short - after 2 odd nights, we shipped out to the San Juan Caribe Hilton for the same price. Whoa, we were greeted with salsa music in the lobby and steel drums by the pool. I realized, I had stayed at the El Con too long and should have left immediately.
