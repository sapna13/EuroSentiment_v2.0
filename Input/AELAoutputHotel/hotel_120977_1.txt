{"text":"What a Dump!!! I was booked into this place by my company's travel agent, and I wish that she had checked into it first...but it was probably the last room downtown available, and THE WORST I have ever experinced.. I'll try to be brief and just give a list of the strikes against...but there are many:*It's not a hotel. It's a series of row house properties that have been shoddily renovated into apartments at some point in time, then not taken care of AT ALL since.*Tiny dingy shabby Kitchenette, I wouldn't eat anything prepared in it.*Tiny dingy shabby bathroom.*Tub would not drain, so you get to stand in dirty water when showering.*Dingy shabby carpet.*Horribly uncomfortable mattress...seemingly picked up out of a nearby alley.*Supposed wireless internet did not work.*Walls so thin you can hear conversations in the next unit like they are sitting next to you...literally.*NO HEAT!!! Only until the middle of the night, then they shut it off to save $. This was not a one-time temporary thing. I called to complain and was told they'd have someone look into whether the heat was broken. I asked why there are no controls for the heat, and was told that the renters don't pay the utility bills, so why should they control them? I went ballistic, then was offered $50 cash for the inconvenience. Then they called back to lie and said that it had been fixed...but the same thing happened every night after I went to bed...about 55 degrees in the AM. Then I realized they knew there was nothing wrong with the heat, and never sent anyone to fix it...they just didn't have it on!If there was anything else available I would have went running away. I don't understand how anyone could have such low standards as to give this place a positive review as a few have, unless you have been homeless in the past...perhaps it's from the management.SAVE YOURSELF!!!
