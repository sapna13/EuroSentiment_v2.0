{"text":"Extremely Disappointed My husband and I have been waiting all year to go on a tropical vacation-- which was very disappointing. Our stay was 7days\/6nts of full frustration and no relaxation. Our original reservation being booked by a website availabe to airline employees only was at the Bavaro side of the hotel. The hotel has 2 sides which mirror one another with the same amenites and we were told they were both accessible reguardless which side you were in. We checked in at Bavaro and they did not have a reservation at that side and wheeled us in a tram over to the Punta Cana side. They put us in a room at the Bavaro side, but only were allowed to use Punta Cana amenties, bar,buffet,etc. Once in the room, housekeeping had to be called the first night because of hairballs on the floor, which had to be mopped and sanitized. Our sheets had to be replaced because of sour linens, our toilet overflowed, and at least twice we had no washcloths. There are 3 pools, but you can only use 2 if you did not upgrade to the Royal Club--which simply means you have a cabana boy and an extra night to make a reservation at the restaurant of your choice---which fill up very quicky. This is a huge property and very loud. It is filled with all ages. The only thing that made this trip was that the people of Dominica are beautiful and very respectable. I researced this property several months before travelling thru TripAdvisor and it is listed #4 out of 56 hotels. I am not the type of person who listens to what other people say, but maybe next time I should.The food was definitely not to our liking and sometimes couldn't even tell what it was. My husband and I travel every year to the carribean and this was definitely our first letdown in 5 years.Sincerely,TimMelindaSan Antonio TxP.S. As a manager of a major airline, we speak to many people in the business that are always looking of new places to travel--this hotel beware!!!!!!!! ","annotations":[]}
