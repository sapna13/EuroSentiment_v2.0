{"text":"I won't be returning This place was OK, but as I said in my review title, I will not be returing and I cannot say I'd recommend it. Usually each year my husband and I go on vacation to Couples Negril in Jamaica (where we will be returning for sure, I like it there a thousand times better) but this year wanted to try something new.Here's what I thought of Punta Cana Princess:1) the grounds were very well kept.2) the rooms themselves were nice, better than I expected3) english is sort of a problem for many of the staff members4) the Tex Mex restaurant was decent, the only decent place. But, it is not open each night.5) the buffets were HORRIBLE. Seriously, unedible food. Especially the beach buffet....gag me. Especially the meat. Yuck. Really, really bad.6) the drinks were SUPER weak. I drank three rum drinks in a row and felt zero effect. We watched them pour the drinks, and they were adding plenty of whatever was in the rum bottle. My guess is, when they buy a bottle of booze, they dump half of it into a different bottle, and fill it up with water. Finally, my husband and I went to the gift shop and bought a bottle of rum. We asked the bartenders only for pineapple juice and then we took out our own bottle of rum to add to the juice.7) the beach was pretty nice8) the pool was pretty nice too. Except, at about 3pm, just when everyone wants to relax, they start some horrible music and beging screaming into microphones for people to play water polo, play bingo (this is an all-adults resort, right?) or to do water aerobics. Very annoying. Maybe some people enjoy that. Aerobics, in my opinion, would be an activity better for the morning. In any case, the shouting and screaming into microphones was too much.9) skip the fondue restaurant at all costs.10) they serve wine, or what they call wine, with lunch and dinner. I'm no wine expert or anything, but this wine they serve was extremely bad. I've never tasted anything like it. Both the red and white, awful awful awful.11) internet access in the lobby was very spotty. You can bring your own laptop and pay $15\/day for wireless access. I'll give you a hint. You pay the $15 and they give you a user name and password to log on to the network. It's user name mili and password 123456. It did not change the whole time we were there, so don't bother paying $15 each day.12) the weather was great and I got a nice tan :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":841,"mention":"zero","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola_Zero"],"startOffset":837},{"endOffset":1976,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1971},{"endOffset":2387,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2383},{"endOffset":2387,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2383}]}
