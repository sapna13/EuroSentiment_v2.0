{"text":"highly rated!!!! We stayed in this hotel from the 15\/11\/8 to the 17\/11\/8 and would definitely go back! on arrival @ midday, our room wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ready, so they took our bags and we went exploring. We came back at 3 but the room still wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ready - they sent us up to the roof with a glass of champagne each  we eventually were allowed to check in at 4.30pm. Very late but they gave us a voucher for 2 lots of strawberrys and a bottle of cava to use at some point during our stay. The delay hadnt really stopped us from doing anything so we were pleased! we paid √ä√£¬¢95 a night with 25% off all spa massages  including breakfast - which was great, I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think It was missing anything! hot food consisted of; toast baconegg (fried  scrambled) mushrooms beans churros  chocolate cold food consisted of; cold meats  cheeses salmoncereals (at least 6 to chose from)lots of cut  uncut fruit crossants\/breadscakes  pastries choc fountain with fruit sticksyogartdrinks - at least 6 juices to choose from, tea  coffee, cava the room was small, but sufficient with a safty deposit box and plenty of storage space. a flat screen tv was mounted on the wall and the bed was not as hard as id read! pillows were a little flat but not so bad that we had to ask for more. there was a mini bar which was abit pricey (a 0.33ml bottle of water was 2 euros!) the same water from the supermarket (which is literally the next 2 doors down) is 0.21euros!!! bathroom was a good size, shower was excellent - but right next to a really large window. it was frosted so you couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see it but it could be opened right out (and easily) so I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ leave kids alone in there! Plenty of toiletries were in there; shower gel shampoomoisturisershower capsewing kitshoe shine tissues toothbrushs and paste (enough for one clean)razer with creamsoapI was really impressed by all the little extras which are handy when doing weekends away to keep luggage to a minimum! the hotel was very modern, the staff very helpful, the roof was stunning and had a lovely view..... the only thing that id have liked would have been tea  coffee facilities in the room.location was excellent - I was so glad that we wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ along Las Rumblas (I found it quite tacky\/seedy  a massive rip off - one caf√ã√\u2022√ñ\/bar wanted 16 euros for a brandy and coke - we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hang around) but we were still only a 10 min walk from it. we were also only 2 mins to the port and 5 mins from the catalunya plaza. judging from what we saw and doing the bus tours - our location was purfect. sorry if this is a little long winded but I wanted to add all the things that id like to know from a review!!!
