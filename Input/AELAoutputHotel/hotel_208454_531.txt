{"text":"Superb stay - read on... In summary - wonderful staff, great location, clean attractive hotel with sumptuous rooms at a very good price. Couldn't have hoped for more.My girlfriend and I stayed at the Sofitel for a long weekend at the end of March. We are both professionals in our late twenties if that helps.The trip was a surprise for her, and I wanted to pick a hotel with exceptional and friendly service, and a good quality room at an acceptable price. I chose the Sofitel purely based on the reviews here on tripadvisor. Of course I considered all sorts of other hotels (Mandarin Oriental, Michelangelo, Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons....). I am sure all of these are splendid hotels, but either the reviews here didn't match their 5-star status or the price was just too high.Prior to my arrival I requested the best suite available, preferably with a good view of the city. Upon arrival, the staff were fantastic - they had pre-booked a fabulous room with a huge balcony overlooking the east-side of Manhattan which was a great surprise to both of us. We had superb views of the Empire State Building, the Chrysler building and many others. We were also treated to a complimentary bottle of Champagne, kindly delivered at a suitable moment chosen by me. The photos do not do the view justice. I appreciate the best views of the city come from place such as the Mandarin Oriental and Ritz-Carlton, but you'll expect that when you see the price!Our room was spacious enough for two, and well decorated. The bathroom was excellent - (I probably wouldn't have noticed, but my girlfriend tells me it was first-rate, and she's very particular about that sort of thing).Throughout the weekend the staff were friendly, helpful, courteous and professional. I am extremely grateful to them for making our weekend so special. Whilst this is not a five-star hotel, the overall attention to detail and quality of service is first-class. Certainly I found this to be the best priced hotel of this class, particularly by booking in advance.Finally, the hotel is superbly located for visitors and sightseers alike, situated just a couple of blocks from Times Square and only a few minutes from Fifth Avenue and Grand Central Station.I would certainly stay here again, and can thoroughly recommend it to others whatever the occasion.
