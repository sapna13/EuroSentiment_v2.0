{"text":"Perfect Paradise My husband and I enjoyed our relaxing stay at Natura. We were a litte nervous due to the past reviews we read. The weather was perfect. We thought the buffet could of been better . It seemed to be the same food every night. The steak restaurant was our favorite. We had a ribeye that tasted wonderful. The italian restaurant was ok. We did not experience the seafood restaurant..  The staff was very friendly, always willing to help. We did have to leave notes for housekeeping to leave more than 1 water bottle each day.  We took the Saona Island excursion. A must do! It is worth the money. We took a 1 1\/2 hour bus ride to a fisherman village to get on the catamaran. The bus trip was interesting, because it took you through the towns. We got to see the culture and how the island people live and work.. The catamaran ride was fun with dancing and rum. Once we reached the island we ate lunch and swam. You could also get a massage on the beach. The palm trees were gorgeous. The palms were huge and touched the ground. The water was very clear and blue. The bottom of the ocean was a little rocky. We took our snorkeling gear, not much sea life in that part. The natural swimming pool, where we took the speed boats to was amazing. The water was like a pool and the bottom was pure white sand and very smooth. GORGEOUS! Have to see to believe. We wished we could of stayed there longer. When we got back to the fisherman village,there were island boys ages 6-12 filling water bottles up from the ocean to rinse of the tourists feet to get the sand of. My husband took some money out to pay the boy and in no time our feet were being drenched with water by many young boys all wanting money. Needless to say, we felt sorry for them and had no more money to pay the tour guide a tip.  The beach at the resort had alot of seaweed that we did not expect. Down the way to the left of the beach the grounds were very trashy. Girls also layed out with not tops on. My husband didn't mind. Ha!  The resort is a layed back kind of place. There needed to be more things to do at night. The shows got old after the first 2 nights. The gift shop was pricy on sunscreen, pack your own.  The landscaping of the resort was kept up and very beautiful. There were always gardners working.  We recommend this resort for anyone who just wants to lay back and relax! Kids would of been bored.
