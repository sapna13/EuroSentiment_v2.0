{"text":"Impressive in all ways We stayed at the Oberoi in Bali for 5 nights before heading up to UmaUbud for 6 nights. Excited as we were to head up to Ubud after our stay here we were truly sad to leave this oasis of calm and luxury. We chose this hotel because it was right on the beach, was not a large US type hotel and because all rooms where in villas and cottages. All this we got, and more. Some criticise the hotel for being an old hotel, but the result of its age was that the cottages and villas really blend in perfectly with the gardens. Our Garden Lanai was perfectly located and the ever so friendly staffwere overly accomodating in bringing extra coffee and fruit to our room and were just generally very happy to help. Everything in the oberoi is done with a smile and this makes for a really pleasant time. We pretty much did everything the hotel had to offer. The spa treatment rooms where calming and the treatments just great. Food wasreally high quality, although cocktails were on the expensive side. For a birthday, the Oberoi provided a 'romantic dinner' on the beach that was just perfect. If there were any complaints, perhaps I would say that the shower\/bath water was never that hot and the shower pressure a little weak. But these things are livable when everthing else is so perfect and luxurious. We would heartily recommend the Oberoi - I cannot imagine any beach resort on the island comparable to the hotel.
