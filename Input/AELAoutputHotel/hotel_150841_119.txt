{"text":"Great Vacation! My husband  I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from 4\/27 to 5\/4. The trip from the airport to the resort took approx. 30 minutes. We had an early flight and arrived at the resort prior to the check-in time so our room was not quite ready. We were given our wrist bracelets and relaxed with cold drinks and were soon able to check-in. Although our room wasn't fancy it was spacious, clean and comfortable. We did not have a large flat screen T.V. as some reviewers have mentioned but that was okay as we didn't plan to spend much time in the room anyway. I thought it would have been nice if the bathroom could have been larger. I also would have preferred a bit more privacy on the balcony but all in all it was a very satisfactory room, located not too far from the beach, yet a decent walking distance to the main dining areas.The grounds are absolutely beautiful and we always enjoyed our walk to and from dinner in the evening. Lots of peacocks, flamingos and various other birds. Of course, as every one has mentioned, the beach is beautiful and you can walk either way for miles, which we did. We enjoyed walking past the other resorts and thought the Iberostar properties had the nicest palapas and loungers - with plenty to go around. We never had a problem finding a spot to relax on the beach or around the pool.I enjoyed getting fresh fruit drinks from the little health bar by the pool. They had fresh papaya, apples, watermelon, pineapple, carrots, cucumbers, etc, ready to be blended into any combination you chose - it was great! The drinks at the pool bar were just okay, in my opinion. We really preferred the lobby bar for the best drinks, and it was a nice place to relax before and after dinner, sitting at one of the little tables or up at the bar. The evening entertainment was a little of a disappointment, not as good as what we enjoyed in Mexico but it was okay.The food was good, especially the breakfast buffet. Lots to choose from. We ate at 3 of the speciality restaurants; the Gourmet, the Asian, and the Cajun - the Cajun was our favorite.And finally, but probably most importantly, all of the staff were wonderful. I wish I could remember all of their names but these two really stood out and they were fabulous: Manual and Gregory - they made us feel special because they made a point of remembering us by name and what we liked. Keep in mind that this is at a resort with close to 600 rooms and literally hundreds of guests that usually change on a weekly basis! That's what customer service is all about and these employees do an exemplorary job! If we had to rate this resort based on employees alone we would give it a 5!
