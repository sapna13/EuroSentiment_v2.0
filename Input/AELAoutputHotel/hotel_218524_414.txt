{"text":"Loved It...Loved It!!! I visited the Excellence Punta Cana resort May 4-May 10, and loved every minute of my trip. Everything was so organized from the minute we stepped foot into the Punta Cana airport. There was the transport to the hotel, which was easy to locate and very comfortable!When we arrived at our resort, it looked amazing and even more amazing was we were presented with wet towels and champagne after getting off of the bus. The check in was easy and quick!The beach was absolute paradise, with lounge chairs and waiters at your finger tips. The beach even had hammocks and beds on it! It was truly unbelievable! The pool was the same, just perfect! There were more then enough lounge chairs and beds, and the pool was large enough that you can have a whole private area just to yourself. The entertainment staff was the best! They kept you going if you chose from morning until night. Thank you so much FRANKLIN, JOEL, and JULIO; You guys were the best! The staff had many different activities for all people and all interests, but was not pushy in making you do anything. Thats what I loved best! However, they made everything a lot of fun! WE MISS YOU FRANKLIN! Thank you for not being too busy to talk with us and teach us about your culture, as well as learn about ours! We are definitely coming back to see you three and we also told our parents about the entertainment staff and encouraged them to go! Hope to see you soon!The rooms were beautiful; A large jacuzzi in the center. Our room had the swim out pool, which was a nice added feature to get because that pool is very private with no more than ten guests at one time. We loved it. The rooms and the property was always kept clean: spotless! Another added benefit to this resort is that it had more than one boutique. It actually had several stores connected to the resort so that you did not have to go into town. It was really nice not having to leave your resort!This resort is definitely much better than I had imagined and is rated a 10. I was surprisingly shocked, because it is an all inclusive and many people assume the food wouldn't be good and the service would not be as great! This resort proves that bias untrue. I don't visit many places twice, but would definitely go back to this resort several times in the future!
