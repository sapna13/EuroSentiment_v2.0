{"text":"Paradise Well where do i start, like most people i read the reviews before i left and was really worried, but i need not it was the best holiday i have ever been on me and my family have had the time of our lives. The people are soo friendly and the entertainment staff are fab, they put so much effort into their dancing. My kids loved the kids club Luz and Ana are the best they have the patience of a saint. Nothing is too much. We met so my different nationalities and got on with everyone we met, it didn't matter if you had kids, were in couples or on your own, everyone was so friendly.The food is nice it doesn't matter how picky you are there is something for everyone. We ate in every restaurant the Italian is slow service but other than that it was a lovely meal, worth waiting for. If you're in a rush the Caribeen is not the place to go.The pools were spotless and the rooms were cleaned daily with fresh towels if you wanted, our room was basic but you don't go on holiday to sit in your room,and it needed more storage space especially if you are a family of 4 like we are but we coped it was no hardship. All in all I would definately go back to this hotel, if just to see the entertainment staff, Luz  Ana. There are nicer hotels further down but the staff at this hotel make it the best.All in all well worth the money and we will be back next year.
