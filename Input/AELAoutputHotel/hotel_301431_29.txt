{"text":"Very nice 70s style opulence Stayed here for a conference. Despite this being a Four Seasons property, it is certainly not of the usual 5 stars Four Seasons standard. Got a standard room on the 7th floor and it has a very Westin feel to it. The hotel is very obviously somewhat dated, but the staff do a good job with upkeep and maintaing the luxury feeling somewhat.Bathroom was quite sufficient, but mostly spartan in terms of the bath products provided. The room is basic 90s style with old style hotel phone, but at least the room came with high speed internet and an ethernet plug for the laptop. TV channels weren't bad, but the TV was quite small.The free breakfast provided downstairs at Capers was great. Very international breakfast with typical eggs, pastries, and continental choices, but also dim sum\/dumplings and other Asian and Indian selections. It was a huge feast.,The conference facilities were actually top notch with plenty of high class and roomy meeting spaces on numerous floors. Although the hotel layout is quite awkward, the terraced layout makes for a very large feeling hotel and it seems there's lots of explore. The hotel also abounds with choices for restaurants and you can see the nice pool from the Capers restaurant dining area (maybe a little weird for swimmers).The level of service here is just okay. I was constantly interrupted by house keeping throughout the day and wish their service was a little more discreet in timing\/presence. They had over 8 check-in staff at the counter, but none of them offered to show me to m room. The check-in lady also did not point out where the elevators were and assumed I had known. The bell boy was very efficient however and my suitcases came up to my room in less than 10 minutes. The conference sevice staff were very efficient and friendly. Although at times some of them seem very young and new to the job.Finally, location is quite good. At the very end off the Orchard Road area. The new St. Regis is finishing up right across the street. I think you should stay at other hotels further down. Regent is about a 10 minute walk to the main bustling shoppping area of Orchard Road and there is certainly where Hilton, Marriott, and Hyatt beat them out. So, this isn't exactly a real Four Seasons, but it is still quite nice and a classic luxury hotel.
