{"text":"A dream come true Ok well i am goin to start off by saying that dont believe any of the bad reviews people are writting. My girlfriend and I stayed at the dreams with another couple from monday to friday. Yes the roads are bumpy, but not completly dirt roads they are paved roads with pot holes, but you are in a third world countrty so what do you expect. Once we got to the hotel which tool an hour, we were greated with cold towels and champagne. Went to check in with no problems, we had the junior suite with the jacuzi on the balcony. Room was clean minor scratches on the walls, maid always did a good job cleaning up, refreshing our towels, and the turn down service at night was good. Pool was warm everyday, and dont believe people about not being able to get a lounge chair they are available. The drinks didn't have much alchohol in them, but if you tipped them a few bucks they took care of you. Food was average nothing to write home about, but that didnt bother me. I wasnt there to expect food like i have back in New Jersey. Lastly the ocean. Water was warm everyday, becarefull for the coral reef which is directly infront of the resort. So if you go to the left of the resort by the turtle trampoline, the water is gorgeous. There is seaweed in the front, but once your in the ocean its ok. Overall i think its a beautifull resort well taking care of, the staff is friendly, grounds are gorgeous just a all around great place!!!!!!! Don't listen to the other reviews people want to have ritz carlton treatment and not pay for it . Than complain on trip advisor. Have fun at the Dreams Resort it truly is a DREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
