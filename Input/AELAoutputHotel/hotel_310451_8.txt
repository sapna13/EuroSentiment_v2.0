{"text":"Beautiful property, AMAZING staff!!! I stayed at this hotel August 7-11. It was my first time to Puerto Rico. I was so impressed by the friendliness of the staff. They truly understand the spirit of service. I was there with a friend to help her spread the ashes of her late husband. The hotel manager, Jessica, went out of her way to drive my friend and I to a local church and then to the marina. The concierge, Hector, was awesome! He helped us to rent a car and book a kayaking excursion in the bioluminescent bay, which was fabulous! He also set up our transportation back to San Juan Airport. He even gave us a ride to a local restaurant! Everyone at the Front Desk was beyond accomodating. I went up there one night at 1AM because I was hungry and wanted to know if there was a vending machine with snacks. The front desk lady called the security guard who walked me to the employee breakroom and let me use their vending machine. My friend lost her glasses in the water and Christopher at the front desk checked lost and found and ended up finding a comprable pair to get her through her trip home! Everyone at the property was smiling! The gift shop was out of bug spray and Jessica lent me hers to use while I was there! I would recommend this property to anyone! It was clean and comfortable, the beach is beautiful, and the staff was top notch! Thank you thank you for helping making my first trip to Puerto Rico so wonderful! It is the people that make a place and you all certainly understand that concept! I'll be back someday! ps. I also won $400 in the casino on a penny slot! :) Woo Hoo! ","annotations":[]}
