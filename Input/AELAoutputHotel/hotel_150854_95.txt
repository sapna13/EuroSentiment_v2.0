{"text":"Nice...but wouldn't go back We have just returned from a stay at the Macao (Feb 10-16\/08). We did not arrive until the 11th due to a missed connecting flight at JFK thanks to Delta airlines. Funny though, although we arrived a day late, we still had to wait almost 15 minutes for our rooms to be ready. We travelled with a group of five couples. We found this resort to be geared mostly toward quiet, older guests or families. We found many of the guests to be quite unfriendly and even rude...for example...bumping into you accidentally poolside but never saying excuse me or I'm sorry. One older fellow even raced my girlfriend to the buffet to get to the omelette bar first!! Anyway, the pool was very pretty but very quiet. They do have a few aerobic classes and other activities periodically at both the pool and at the beach, the same as any other resort we've been to. There was no music playing other than when one of the activities were taking place. The piano bar was okay, with only a few songs played nightly. We found the staff to be quite friendly and willing to help out with whatever you needed, but many of them had difficulty speaking English. The rooms were standard, nothing special and I found the bed to be quite uncomfortable. The food was okay, again nothing too extraordinaire ...compared to our stay last year at a Bahai Principe. The beach is beautiful but all of the resorts share the same beach of course. There are lots of chairs available for use and there is plenty of room for sitting in both the shade and the sun. We found more fun going over to the Riu Tainao and the Riu Bambu! The disco does not open until 11 p.m... too late, but it seems it is geared mostly toward the staff anyway. Overall it is always wonderful to get away on a trip, but none of us will consider returning to this resort again.
