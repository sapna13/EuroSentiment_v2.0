{"text":"Great Inn, Great Location, Great Service... My husband and I stay here for our anniversary. We booked the Luxury King room for our anniversary. We decided on the White Swan after reading the great reviews on this site. When we arrived we were greeted warmly by a genlteman at the front desk. Check in was quick and efficient. We were presented with a list of local restaurants at check in which we found very useful as all of them were within a short walk of the hotel. The front desk was a great source of suggestions for any type of place you wanted to eat. What a nice surprise when we open our door and found a bottle of champagne, chocolates, and balloons with a note welcoming us.We really enjoyed the buffet breakfast each morning, it was such a pleasure to wake in the morning and be able to just go downstairs and have breakfast waiting for you. Not the normal continental breakfast that most B  B's have but a wonderful full breakfast with an assortment of baked goods, hot cereal and quiche, fruit salad, scrambled eggs,sausage, ect.. coffee and tea was available all time anytime.The evening wine hour was also a treat, many of the guest gathered around the fireplace and chatted about their day in the city. We met some very nice people that were visiting from all over the world.The room was clean and cozy and the fireplace was so nice to sit in front of after a long day of sightseeing. From what I understand all the room have them. The best thing about the White Swan In though is the staff, they were always willing to answer all of our questions and are so good at making us feel as if they couldn't do enough for us. We would definately stay here again.
