{"text":"Nice rooms but could be better. I stayed in the Silken Diagonal for 2 nights in July. The hotel was easy enough to get to from the airport (about 25 euros). The hotel itself does not look great from the outside and the area seems a bit run-down but inside it is quite contemporary with a nice bar.Check-in was relatively painless though a bit slow as there were only 2 people on the small reception desk. As one of them was dealing with a customer it took a while to get to me.My room was in the first floor overlooking a building site but was quiet and spacious. The bed was a decent size and the glass bathroom was a nice touch as well the bo phone in the room. There was a LCD tv but strangely enough no pay for view. Also- as I found out later there is only WI-FI on the 8th and 9th floor unless you happen to bring a cat 5 cable with you (i didn't). As the hotel had run out (!) I had no choice but to sit on the floor on the 8th floor to connect to the internet. Pins and needles and a numb bum ensued.Aside from that the hotel was fine. The surrounding area is not great (although there is a massive shopping mall across the road) and the subway station (Glories) is 3 mins away. You can be on La Rambla within 10 minutes which is very handy.Overall an above average stay. I paid √ä√£¬¢230 for 2 nights including breakfast (buffet style whith lots of choice) which struck me as a good deal considering the strength of the euro. On a separate note try to avoid Iberia airlines- they are useless. Be warned there is no online check in or fast check in if you only have hand luggage. I waited for 30 mins in a queue and there were only 4 people ahead of me.
