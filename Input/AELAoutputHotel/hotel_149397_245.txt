{"text":"Bittersweet resort Just got back from a week spent at the Bavaro Princess. Alot of people may seem to post only negative things about this resort. I agree with most of them, but this resort did have some good points as well. Let me just say, however, that I would not recommend this resort. I have stayed in Punta Cana twice before, once at the Grand Palladium, and once at Iberostar Punta Cana, both of which were much, much nicer that the Bavaro Princess. Here goes:Check-in:Not bad. As usual, we got there about 11 a.m., and no rooms until 3 p.m. I've just gotten used to this I guess.Rooms:First of all, I must mention that we did have a traveler with us that needed handicapped assistance, such as a handicapped room. This resort did not offer handicapped rooms, though, when we booked, Apple Vacations did say that they had handicapped rooms. Not the case! One step into room, two steps up to bed, two steps down to bathroom, and no handicapped shower. Rooms were musty, but, hey, you are in the jungle. The air-conditioning does not work well. Maid service was decent and the room was always clean.Bugs:Take Off or Cutter or some sort of insect repellant. I won't say any more!Beach\/Pools:Gorgeous!Food:Out of the 3 resorts I've stayed at in Punta Cana, Bavaro Princess had the best food! Lots of selection. Beverages:All domestic liquor. Beer OK. Just a side note... Iberostar offers imported liquor...Tanqueray, Beefeater, Canadian Club, Bacardi, Absolut, etc. Alcoholic beverages weren't bad at Princess, but I've had better at other resorts.Resort in general:Very, very large, though the tram does make frequent stops at all destinations, and is easy to pick up.Casino:Not Las Vegas, but fun. Play the Big Ben machines.So, I hope this helps... If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.
