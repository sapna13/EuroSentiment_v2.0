{"text":"Forget it........... (The only one good department,which is owned private,is the diving and water-sports base)I had 14 days √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≥olidays√à√\u2020\u2022?booked over BOOKIT in Caribe Club Princess, and I would like to place this complain about the Hotel, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ simply awful...I am working since 11 years in tourism and in resorts, and I never saw a so bad serviced hotel...I works by myself as a Entertainment Manager in a lot of Resorts,4 Star, 5 Star, 5+ stars, but this Hotel deserves not any 4 Stars, even 2 stars have to be decided really carefully......!!!! A call to the reception for a Dr. for a friend of me was ending up in 40 min. calling numbers they gave without answers and a Dr. who showed up in 1hr 45min....!!! 1. The Room: The Hotel Rooms (Room 1335) are divided by a wooden door to the neighbour room which has at the bottom 2-3 cm free place so You can even look into the neighbour room and You can hear the smallest noise which is made by neighbours, complaining 4 times over 2 sleepless nights to the reception couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ make the 4 young guys in my neighbour room quiet, 3rd day a personal visit to Guest Relation Services which is very arrogant, unfriendly and not ready and able to help, could say just that if I want I can change MY room, why should I live the discomfort of change all my stuff to another room when it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not me who is disturbing anyone during all the night until the morning 06.00???In the 3rd night of my stay in morning 05.00 I called the reception and said to them if they are not able to get quiet 4 partying guys I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l do it myself in any way!!!Than just they sent a security guy to make them quiet... And when it was raining 2 nights during my stay there it was raining into my room from the roof!!!2. The Restaurant, Bars, Service: The Main Restaurant is in questions of cleanness very bad and unhygienic, cooks preparing the food are wearing very dirty shirts and the quality of food is very bad, I spend simply 14 days by eating Pasta, Pizza and Omelette cause the food variety was very poor and every day the same food...The Bars are very very dirty and the service in restaurant and the Bars are very slow cause they haven√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ enough personal to serve, a order made in the beginning of lunch or dinner arrived after lunch or dinner was finished already or simply never arrived...And the service personal is very unfriendly like Your not welcome...The Staff is not speaking English at all, just the reception, and some Animators, but the service staff speaks no one word English and simple orders like a bottle of water or a coke was trying to be explained few minutes or simply came wrong drinks...3. Transfers was excellent, no problem with that...
