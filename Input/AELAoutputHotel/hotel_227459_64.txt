{"text":"Wonderful Hotel in a Central Location My wife and I were in Madrid April 18 - 26, visiting our daughter during her semester in Spain. We chose the hotel based on other parents' recommendations and the reviews on TripAdvisor.com . The hotel is very clean, well-decorated, and surprisingly quiet for its location on Gran Via, near the Callao metro stop. The staff is very accommodating in any language. We had Room 801, which had been renovated within the past few months. A new HD television; two firm double beds, walk-in closet, built-in dresser shelves, service refrigerator and safe. Neat gadget that conserves electricity - insert your room card in the slot next to door and leave it there until you exit.A beautiful new bathroom, with double sink, shower\/bath with two shower heads, one fixed on the side and the other hand-held, radio, and bidet. Each day the bath was fully stocked with toiletries, including razor and toothbrush.Our room was on an interior air shaft, very quiet and full of light. The windows, when closed blocked all sound and the window treatments were modern and adjustable.We tried the buffet breakfast, which was more bountiful than we wanted. We found numerous local and American chain restaurants within a couple blocks that are open for breakfast and other meals.The front desk and cleaning staff were great. Very patient. They will print airline tickets, provide directions, restaurant suggestions, change, look up information on the Internet. Daughter and grandmother stayed a few weeks later. They had the same room and similar experience.Reasonably priced considering the dollar's fall in value. A wonderful place to stay. ","annotations":[]}
