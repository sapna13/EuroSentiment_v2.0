{"text":"Better than the Ritz? Just returned from a quick 3 day stay at the Ritz Carlton Central Park, Celebrating my wife's 40th birthday and her first visit to NYC.Check in was quick and extremely efficient. We were greeted by name and offered a cold bottle of water, which was appreciated after a long cab ride. We arrived on the red eye from L.A. at around 9:45 and were immediately allowed to check in. Now that may not seem like much to some, but to us, it meant everything and got our trip started off right.The room was very clean and pretty much what one would expect from a Ritz property. This is NYC and one should not expect huge rooms, but it was large enough, spotless and well appointed. Having stayed at 5 star properties\/resorts around the U.S. and abroad, they did a very nice job living up to the hype.The location is superb. Across the street from Central Park and in walking distance to just about everywhere as long as you are a walker. We walked to St. Patricks, Rockefeller Plaza and the theater district. Subway stations are within 2 blocks in every direction. There is a really nice Whole Foods Market 2-3 blocks to the west at Colombus Circle where you can pick up the fixings for a nice Central Park picnic lunch.For tour seekers, there is a Grayline bus stop (double decker)right across the street at Central Park So. as well as the Hansom Carriages. The concierge desk was very helpful with tour\/admission tickets as well as some great dinner suggestions. We dined at Scalinatellas, a great Italian restaurant with impeccable service and food in a quaint location. We took a 5 minute cab ride and strolled back in about 15 minutes. Great call Abraham. We also dined at Del Frisco's Double Eaglr Steak House, again at the request of the Concierge and were not disappointed. Great atmosphere and a very friendly bar\/server staff. Great steak, and very large portions. Definitely a wonderful experience. Again kudos the the RC Concierge staff. Again, at the advice of the concierge, we had a very nice breakfast at the BLT Market, located in the hotel. Great Service and delicious pancakes. I read these reviews and try to extract the pertinent information about the property in question, so as to make an informed decision when I travel and or stay at new locations. In turn, I try to write reviews which are also on point. Don't go to the Ritz if you are worried about spending a few extra dollars. We spent $75 on last minute dry cleaning and the service was fast, the clothes were well handled, pressed and cleaned. This is to be expected and I was appreciative of the service. Don't complain about the use of the Business Center, just ask questions first. It aint free, there is a fee. If you choose not to use it, DON'T.Lastly, we were extended a late check out until 2:00 PM and the Bell Desk held our luggage whicle we went to the most venerable of all locations in NYC, Yankee Stadium. Upon our return, we were offered the use of the roomy bathroom facilities tochange. I would have preferred the use of the shower facilities at the Spa, as most Four Seasons allow, but all in all, this was a great stay and my wife and I offer you much thanks and gratitude.Howard, L.A.
