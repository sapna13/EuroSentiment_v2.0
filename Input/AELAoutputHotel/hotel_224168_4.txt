{"text":"Good location for sightseeing Just got back from six nights at this hotel. This was a sightseeing trip with my family; I chose this hotel because I wanted something that was in a good location for touring around, and where we could sleep comfortably. I booked the hotel a couple of months ago, on the hotel website. At that time I requested the club level. I was willing to pay a bit extra for the convenience of the continental breakfast; I could not find a rate that included breakfast otherwise. When I got to the hotel, I learned that the lounge would not be open for 3 of the 6 days we'd be there. At my request, we were moved to a non-club level room, at a lower rate. They did not reduce the rate for our last night, however. (The rate was going to go up because of the New Year).Thankfully, however, the hotel is connected to the Hollywood and Highland Mall, and we did not need to have breakfast in the hotel. My husband brought up coffee from the Starbucks each morning, and we did not pay the outrageous prices for the hotel breakfast buffet.There was no minibar, but we did not miss that. I did notice that there was no in-room safe. We did not use room service, and housekeeping was adequate. The hotel was in a great location for sightseeing- we went all over L.A. and had a great time. There is an on-site car rental (Hertz) which was convenient. We parked in the mall for $10 a night rather than pay the $29 for the hotel's valet parking.The hotel was functional and served its purpose as a base for sightseeing, and a place to sleep and shower. It was in no way luxurious, but it met our needs. I would recommend it to a friend who was going on a similar kind of trip.
