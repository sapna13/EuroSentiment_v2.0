{"text":"The Fairmont Singapore CHECK IN\/OUTWas swift and efficient nothing to complain about. Staff were very friendly and helpfulSERVICES:I could not fault a single member of staff they were all very friendly and enthusiastic. They were all very knowledgeable and nothing was too much bother. SPA: The spa is a Willow stream spa, which I believe is the signature spa of Fairmont, and its defiantly does not disappoint. It was a very relaxing experience, a little costly but you pay for what you get! My group all had the de stress massage and all commented on how much they enjoyed the experience and how professionally it was conducted.There are outdoor pools, they were busy bust still enjoyable.LOCATION:Very good, right in the heart of Singapore with all the amenities that you could possibly want right on your doorstep. The hotel is also located virtually in a transport hub with busses and trains and major roads all located very close by.ROOM:Was modern and well maintained, with all the mod cons that you would expect from a newer hotel in Asia. Plasma screen tv√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ electric curtains etc. Bathroom was very nice with an amazing √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬®ainfall shower√à√\u2020\u2022? Room had high quality toiletries as you would expect.Always had a very good night√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ sleep linen was of high quality as were the selection of pillows that were provided (Feather and synthetic) All rooms have small balconies that allow you to enjoy the atmosphere of the city.More than ample working space.No problems with noise.HOUSEKEEPING:This was an area that I felt needed some improvement. The room was in need of a good hovering under the bed etc and the windows did need washed. For the 3 nights that we were in the hotel our toiletries were never replenished which was disappointing .The room was always cleaned before 12 which was good. All in all the problems that we encountered were nothing too serious and when brought to the hotels attention was dealt with promptly. RESTAURANTS  BARS:Where to start there are so many outlets to choose from! The hotel is actually part of a large complex that also includes the Swissotel which is a staggering 70 floors high. Right at the top you have a selection of fantastic bars which have impressive views of the city. However the fine dinning restaurant equinox was a disappointment. The food was good but the service was poor. It took over 30 minutes for our drinks to arrive which is completely unacceptable in an outlet of this calibre. Here√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ hoping that this was a one of event. It is worth having dinner in equinox if not for the views alone. Reservations are a must. We did have room service in the mornings because of the nature of our trip. The selection is good however we did have a few problems getting the right drinks on two mornings√à√\u2020\u2022?possible language problems√à√\u2020\u2022?they did however amend the problems very swiftly. Tried out some of the other bars located throughout the complex and there is something for every age group including a nightclub (Ink)We had dinner in Prego one night and the staff again were very attentive and professional. They had all the Italian classics that you would expect and they were all of a very high quality. I would recommend this outlet for any occasion lunch, dinner or just a light snack. OVERALL:I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Fairmont Singapore. It has all the facilities that you would expect from a city hotel and an outstanding team of staff that will endeavour to make your stay as relaxing as possible. It is on the more expensive side but as always you do get what you pay for and I would highly recommend this hotel. ","annotations":[]}
