{"text":"Top Class For sheer class, this hotel takes some beating. From the moment you are welcomed by one of the Guest Relations Officers you are made to feel you are in a special hotel. I didnt take my business cards with me (after all I was on holiday !), so I was surprised when I was asked for one to assist with the check in. My wife had one of her business cards, which saved the day.We stayed in the Tower Wing overlooking Orchard Road, and had inter-connecting rooms so that our two children (13  10)were always near.We ate at the Line for breakfast on the first day, which although expensive, was excellent in terms of quality and quantity available. My wife and I also went to the Blu Bar on our last night, which is on the top floor overlooking Singapore, and had a Singapore Sling.The pool area was clean, spacious and relaxing although there was trouble obtaining sun beds if you wanted them in the sunny aspect. Service was very good, and taxis so cheap to the Night Zoo, and to Sentosa, where we swam with the doplhins in a pre-arranged training session, and also went on the Luge.We also used one of their four tennis courts for a game, and our son played on the minature golf course. The only down side was we were told we could use the Health Club to shower and change before our evening pick-up at 8 p.m on the way to the airport. Unfortunately when we got there, we were shown to one of the small individual spa rooms, which had limited facilities, and our children had to go out of the Health Club to use the toilets as they were not allowed inside the Club, even if accompanied by one of us. This seemed all a little pointless and gained a small black mark.The hotel is a comfortable ten minute walk to Orchard Road, and the wealth of shopping opportunities take your breath away. Also went on the bumboat ride for free as we were on the Singapore Stopover with SIA. All in all, a hotel with an experience not to miss.
