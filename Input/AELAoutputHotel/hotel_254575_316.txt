{"text":"Wonderful and then some My husband and I stayed at the Luna and Simone from Sept. 5-Sept 13. I booked the hotel based on the other reviews at Trip Advisor. Let me just say that they were so right! This place was wonderful; the staff was very friendly and kind. The room was nice and comfortable. The location was safe and close to the things you need for a good vacation. We were in room 4 on the Simone side. It was fairly big (for UK standards) and while our window faced the street, the noise from the cars and such never really bothered us. There is no A\/C but a nice big window and a fan over the bed was all we needed to stay cool. The room also comes with a vault, which you set the code for... a nice touch and a good place to keep your valuables. The closet had enough room for our clothes and we could even hide away one of our suitcases.The shower in the room was amazing. Heck I wanted to pack it up and bring it home. It was nice sized, with GREAT water pressure. The bathroom was always clean and fresh towels were left every day. (though bring your own wash cloth... they don't provide those)The breakfast in the morning was a wonderful way to start the day, the menu is set, but it's very good. and if you find you don't like the beans (I didn't, my husband did) just ask them to leave them off (I didn't though, I just let the hubby eat them :) ) It really helped save money; we ate breakfast and then dinner...The neighborhood was wonderful and posh. It's very safe and comfortable to walk around in. You are surrounded by restaurants (curry, Italian, pubs, pastry shops). We HIGHLY recommend Marquis of Westminster... two blocks up (toward Victoria station) on the corner. The owner, Chris, just redid the place. The food was great, I mean great (try the burger or the chicken and leek pie... i tried to get the recipie from him to bring home...), and the mood was relaxed and comfortable, even for a non local. Plus it's so close to the hotel, that if you have a long night at the pub, it's not a far stumble home.The tube stops close by are Victoria (much larger and in the middle of basically a mall) and Pimlico. Pimlico is closer by a block or two but only has the Victoria line running through it. Victoria Station has the Victoria line as well as District and Circle lines. This was very helpful because just about every good tourist stop is on the district or circle line.To sum up: this hotel is amazing for the very low price, especially when you see how much a flat in the area rents for. It was always clean, the breakfast was very good and the location was dang near perfect. We will never stay at any other hotel in London again.
