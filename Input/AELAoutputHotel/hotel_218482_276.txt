{"text":"March 14 - 28th, 2007 - Wonderful Relaxing Vacation After having stayed at the Catalonia from March 14 - 28, 2007 we feltwe should share our thoughts as we appreciated everyone else who shared his or hers. Our age range is from 43 - 55 yrs and we thoroughly enjoyed this property. The service was wonderful, the grounds were very pretty, accommodations were very comfortable, food was delicious, the drinks were good and the Bailey√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ was a nice added touch √à√\u2020\u2022?but you did have to let them know that you wanted the real Bailey√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ and not their homemade concoction! It's amazing how fara √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≥ola√à√\u2020\u2022?and a smile can take you despite the language barrier! The purpose of trip was to relax and just sit on the beach. We never even went into the beautiful pool. We aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ into excursions but we did hire Juan next door (standing and looking out into the water √à√\u2020\u2022?tothe left) to take us out to Bavaro Beach so friends of ours could see that beach and the differences and also to go snorkeling out on the reef as they had never gone snorkeling before √à√\u2020\u2022?he was kind, informative and you could work out a great deal with him. Most people would think two weeks would be too long but we wanted to stay even longer despite the fact that we ate and drank too much and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ do much of anything other than relax. The beach was beautiful despite past reviews; the ocean was fine - seagrass and all - as it made for great snorkeling. We even saw whales jumping in the water on two occasions - absolutely amazing to see and a first for us! Of course there was seaweed as that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ nature, but the beach crew was out every morning cleaning up the seaweed that washed up during the night. If you wanted an umbrella close to the water you did have to get up between 6:30 √à√\u2020\u2022?7 a.m. to put your towels out. The weather was perfect (13 out of the15 days) with only two half days of rain √à√\u2020\u2022?I guess we were very lucky! We would definitely recommend this hotel if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e looking for a 4 star property, if you want a 5 star property and service this is not the resort for you. A holiday is what you make of it and it doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ matter where you go there is always room for improvement even at the most expensive! Any request we had they accommodated - it can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get much better than that! Thanks to all of the staff at the Catalonia we had a wonderful vacation!
