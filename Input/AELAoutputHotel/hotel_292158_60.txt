{"text":"Brilliant Resort, would definately return Absolutely brilliant hotel. Have been to many hotels in the Carribbean and this was by far the best. I want to keep this concise so here we go...Facilities:The sporting facilities were far better than any other hotel, mini golf was a great laugh, paddle tennis was really fun. They also have tennis, volleyball, water sports, table tennis and its all included.Gym and Spa area are also very good.Food: Fantastic. The best variety and quality I have had in the Caribbean. The A la Carte restaurants were superb, especially the dominican one. After 2 weeks there was still so much variety we never got bored. My partner is one of the fussiest people I know and ate absolutely loads every day! You have a choice of 12 pizzas every meal and there is always something for everyone. The mexican buffet and oriental evening were outstanding.Weather:Brilliant as usual, 30-35 every day with clouds which made it bearable, came back with a brilliant tan.Beach:Gorgeous, can walk along it for hours. We walked for 2 hours to the Iberostar hotel we stayed at last year!Rooms: Gorgeous, you get a jacuzzi bath in the standard room! Very nice!Resort:Gorgeous grounds, dont listen to all these people moaning about getting around, its very easy! And if you dont want to walk just wait for the train, it takes you everywhere and we waited no longer than 10 mins for a train at any time-there is no rush on holiday!!I am a very, very fussy person and I'm not often impressed but I would 100% return to this hotel again. The staff are brilliant, there was loads to do, loads to eat. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone without a moments hesitation.If your thinking of booking you wont be dissappointed.Feel free to ask me any questions. ","annotations":[]}
