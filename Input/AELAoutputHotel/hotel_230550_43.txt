{"text":"Park InnTastic We booked the Park Inn Berlin via a no frils UK airline, we checked the hotel's web-site pre -travel  liked what we saw but the reviews were mixed so we traveled with some trepidation. What a contrast to what we expected, it is so easy to get to, being on the main line from the airport with the station being 200 meters from the hotels doors. The locationn of the hotel could not be better for getting around the main sights of Berlin. The hotel is an impressive 37 floors being the largest hotel in berlin but is nestled under the massive TV Tower which is one of the main Berlin sights  only 500 meters away. We were told that there was a computer convention on the day we arrived  had been allocated the last room of the the day at 10pm (our hearts sank) but we had been allocated a suite,  what a suite it was. Recently re-furbished  fantastic quality, with a state of the art open plan bathroom with plate glass windows between the bath  the living room, a bit strange but quirky  great fun. We had a well stocked mini bar, LCD TV, bath robes, slippers, clean towels every day, spotlessly clean, quiet when it needed to be  enhanced by friendly helpful staff. The whole area is surrounded by restaurants, bars  shops so eating in  out of the hotel was not a problem. The hotel boast its own sauna  fitness center, casino, bars, roof terrace (with amazing views)  ajoining restaurant cafe. Booking out was 12 mid day  they have a secure baggage store to leave your suitcases all day if you still have time to roam before flying. If you are visiting Berlin  looking for a suitable hotel or have already booked this hotel, pleae rest assured that going to the Park Inn hotel Alexanderplatz is a top choice  I will amazed if you don't love it.
