{"text":"Great Vacation My husband and I along with another couple had a great time at the Paradisus Punta Cana from June 2nd to June 7th. I am certainly looking forward to returning for a longer stay.If you are looking for a truly relaxing vacation this is the place. The ambiance of the hotel is laid back and peaceful. The grounds are beautiful and nicely kept. The hotel is surrounded by mangroves so if you decide to walk from place to place you are on a constant nature walk. Staff was very friendly and helpful hour host Luis was very nice. We had a small suite with a balcony by the pool. The room was spacious, the furniture is beginning to show its age, but it is not in bad shape. We had dinner in the Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and French restaurants. They were all nice. We liked the Chinese place the best. We had reservations for the Japanese restaurant but I did not like the feel of it so we left. Breakfast was plentiful with a good combination of local food such as mangu (mashed plantains) and American fare.Lunch buffet was very nice with a good selection of varied food.Beach was good. More waves than I expected but still nice. Make sure you get to the beach early otherwise you miss out on the big beds under the huge umbrellas. My suggestion to the managers ( I hope they read these) is more beach umbrellas, the sun gets very hot in the afternoon and you need the protection. Night life is quiet, the hotel staff does nightly shows that are quite entertaining if somewhat cheesy ... but all in all again, you are there to have a good time not as a Broadway critic.So again, I am very much looking forward to another stay at this hotel. The area is full of beautiful looking places, but why mess with success ?The one negative in my opinion was the hotel's pitch to sell you a time share. It is hard to say no and I felt forced to listen to a sales presentation even though we had been very honest about the fact that we had absolutely no interest in their product. So make sure that you say NO from the get go when your host starts offering you gifts, etc. Unless you are interested in time sharing and many people are ... dont waste your time.
