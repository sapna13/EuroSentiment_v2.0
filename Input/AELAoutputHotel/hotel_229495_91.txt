{"text":"Good Hotel, great location We stayed for the second time at the amsterdam Marriott for the weekend April 29\/May 1.The rooms renovation program was finished by now and the rooms really met all of our expectations. Beds are very comfortable, air condition working properly and bathrooms are small but very elegant.We asked for a non-smoking room and two beds on a high floor ans all wished became fulfilled.Rooms to the front of the hotel have huge windows but traffic noise can be heard, even when windows are closed. Since we love the view, this does not affect us, but if you want to have a silent room, ask for courtyard or side street view.We did not have breakfast in the hotel, since its quite expensive and there are plenty of charming Cafes around. we also did not use internet this time since we thought it was overpaid.There is a Grill restaurant and a Pizza Hut in the Hotel, but we only had coffee there.The staff is helpful and friendly, there is even a small souvenir shop in the Lobby for those not wanting to look around for souvenirs.Our personal Hotel recommendations:Ask for two beds since those rooms are bigger the ones with one double bed, if you like a nice view, ask for front side but high floor (but be aware, that street can be heard).Avoid breakfast if its not included in the rate and avoid internet, look for internet cafes around, there are plenty !!Recommendations for Amsterdam:You have to make a Canal tour, there is a company right across the square, if you leave the hotel to your right, opposite the Casino.Go to see the red light district, but take care, no photos of the girls in the windows. There are guys around to avoid this.Just take good shoes and walk along the little canals early morning, such charming views.The hotel is renting bikes for 10 Euro per day, reserve the day before because they only have a limited number. Drive around early moning and go to Vodel Park next to the hotel, very peaceful dont worry the traffic, they take care on bikers, since biking is very common in Holland.We will for sure stay again at the Marriott.
