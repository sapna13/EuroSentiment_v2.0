{"text":"Disappoints in Every Aspect Sheraton Towers Singapore (hereafter STS) is an aging property whose only chance of competing with its younger rivals is its level of service. Rooms are clean and serve their purpose but lacks in style and taste (a given for most hotels these days) with old TVs and plain furniture. The newly designed lobby is grandeur with marbles and smart lighting used to good effect, but still is unable to compete with the likes of the stylish Oriental or the magnificent Shangri-la (just to name two). The pool and the gym is also quite average and bland. The exterior of the hotel is the worst drawback, displaying a desperate need of a make-over. In all, the hotel is functional and will serve the basic needs but seriously lacks in tasteful touches. I once found a large, bulky and ugly looking air freshener placed right in front of the elevators in the hallway of my floor. Perhaps the ugliest sight I had ever seen from a (so-called) 5 star property.So what about service? I stayed here a few times and regret to say that the level of service has been poor every single time. The biggest flop was when I wanted to catch a taxi out at around 10:45PM and asked the doorman for help. To my shock, he showed resentment and told us that he was getting ready to go home as he finishes work at 11PM! Never before did I experience such nonsense. His tone of voice was also that of an uncle telling his nephew. In the end, I had to find my own cab √à√\u2020\u2022?A revolting experience that I will never forget.Another mishap I experienced was when the check-in staff had no idea about the package I had booked. I once booked a romance-package that allows you a late checkout at 4 PM. When I was told that the check-out time was 12 PM, I enquired about my package but the staff had NO IDEA what I was talking about. After what felt like forever for her to search around her computer, I was told that the best she could do for me was a 2 PM check-out. Not wanting to spoil my romantic weekend, I forced myself to agree and went to my room. It was later that day when the front-desk called me to apologize and extended the check-out to 4 PM, which should have been the case from the very beginning.STS has to wake up and smell the coffee as Singapore is spoiled for good hotels with more in the pipeline. With no taste, poor service, only adequate amenities and doormen that scold guests for asking him to do his job, I would advise all to stay well clear. My only reason for having patronized Sheraton Towers Singapore was for it being one of the few Starwood properties in Singapore, but not even that will bring me back to this ugly building of disappointment ever again.
