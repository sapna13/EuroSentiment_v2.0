{"text":"Service problems at Tripadvisor's No. 1 We booked Sofitel Washington because of the no. 1 rating at Tripadvisor. We stayed during christmas from Dec 25, 2006 for three nights in a standard room (174 USD\/night tax incl.) and a suite (325 USD\/night tax incl.).The location is perfect the hotel in a good shape. The rooms are spacious, the marble bathroom has a separate shower stall and everything is very clean. The first suite on the fifth floor was spacious but equipped with one small single cupboard (about 15 inches) with integrated ironing board and space for 3 (!) hangers. So we got another suite with more storage possibilities.Unfortunately the service is contrary to the quality of the rooms. The Sofitel - luxury division of french Accor Hotels - is on the service side truely laissez-faire that means not unfriendly but inefficient. Some aspects:- No doorman available at arrival, no help with the luggage, we had to carry the luggage during strong rain on our own (no staff with umbrella),- all three days friendly but very relaxed service at the restaurant-bar (ordered drinks forgotten, pasta with chicken served without chicken, ketchup served minutes after serving the french fries, serving other guests dishes...),- housekeeping cleaned the room in the later afternoon twice (good: seperate turndown with a complimentary bottle of Evian),- there are a few breakfast menues available only, no buffet breakfast and no choice for a nicer breakfast (there wasn't even a selection of cheese available),- quite bad the concierge service: I requested a shuttle service to Dulles airport. The concierge offerd an overpriced service because they just work with one company they have a contract with. I had to search the internet on my own (the offers were generally 30-40 USD cheaper) and the concierge didn't even call the company I wanted to book because he wasn't allowed to from the management (so he said)!In total Sofitel has nice rooms in best location with mediocre service and is nothing special for a luxury hotel. So take it if the rates are O.K. but don't expect to much.P.S. As a Sofitel privelege card holder I didn't get a voucher for a welcome drink or sweets in the room (and I am still waiting for the points).
