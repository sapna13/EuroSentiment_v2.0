{"text":"You will not be disappointed! Reasonably priced, top class hotel in a very dynamic city of Berlin. I stayed there for a weekend in August, city was full of tourists yet this hotel offered much better deals than other hotels of similar class. It is located right next to the museum island close to the opera and unter der linden street. It is within 15-20 min walking distance from the Brandenburg Gate. Reading this review you probably already know that it has this huge aquarium right above the lobby and high up to the roof which could be seen from many of the rooms. It is quite fascinating and definitely a great idea! Rooms are clean and modern with some nice amenities. Try the pool which although small allows you to relax after a busy day. Breakfast although really good is expensive and I myself preferred to explore some nearby local eateries to get some good food to start off the day. In fact there are quite a few interesting places close to the hotel which are not always full with tourists. Try especially Barcomi's Deli at Sophienstrasse which is definitely one of the best places to get a good bagel in Berlin! Also, check pubs, restaurants and clubs at the Hackescher Markt. Both places are 5 minutes walking distance from the hotel. Those are places for young, easy-going people who look to have fun in Berlin. I also had a dinner in one of the city's fancy restaurants - Bocca di bacco, and it is really a fine place (very romantic with great ambience) which I have reviewed in a separate review. In short, Radisson SAS Berlin is a top class hotel, with nice, modern design, good facilities and friendly staff, located in the center of a great city. I cannot really write anything bad about it. Definitely recommended!
