{"text":"Pleasantly Surprised, Would Definitely Reccomend! After reading several mixed reviews of the Bahia Principe, we were a little unsure about what to expect, but would whole-heartedly recommend this resort to others. My husband and I stayed at the Bahia Principe with our 3 year old daughter from Dec. 16 - Dec. 23, 2006. Much has been said, here is my 2 cents:Food - is fine. There are no gourmet dining experiences here, but the buffets offer a wide selection and there is certainly something for everyone. We found all of the restaurants, with the exception of the Beach Grill, disappointing. For those of you who enjoy wine with dinner (as we do), prepare to pay between $25 and $35 USD for a decent bottle of table wine, as the wine that is served with dinner is truly un-drinkable.Room - Very large and very clean. Great bathrooms, no problem with AC, nice balcony. We had a king size bed and a smaller sofa-bed in our room, and all were very comfortable. There were bathrobes and slippers in the room, and our maid even brought us extra robes when we asked. The bar fridge was stocked with water and soda daily, and we had turn-down service nightly. We did NOT have any problems with security, and of course had rented the in-room safe for our valuables. We had specifically asked for a second floor room near the beach, and that is what we got.Beach - is beautiful! While some mentioned the water was too rough, we found it depended upon the time of day. The water is warm and beautiful blue, and we never had any difficulty finding lounge chairs either near the water or under shade. The beach bar was great too.Pools - Excellent. They were clean and not too crowded, and again we never had any problem finding chairs. The pools are perfect for kids, since there are specific areas for kids as well as loads of shallow areas. A member of the resort staff brings out monkeys, lizards and parrots for photo opportunities, which our 3 year old thought was great--and we figured it was a compulsory family vacation photo!Shows - One of the highlights of our daughter's day was the nightly kid mini-disco, where they danced and played games. The adult shows that followed, however, were of no interest to any of us. However, the main lobby is lovely and the bar and lounge area there is enormous, and lots of people took advantage of the warm evening air to enjoy an after-dinner drink or coffee with and without kids.Families - This is a great resort for people with kids. There are lots and lots of families, lots and lots of kids. I am not sure that this is a resort for a Honeymoon or a quiet, romantic couple holiday, but for those with children, it is really nice. The staff LOVE children and often chatted with our daughter at dinner or just strolling through the grounds. Service - Many reviewers have commented on the lack of English spoken--I figure if you visit a Spanish speaking country, you expect that most people will only speak Spanish, no? Despite the language barrier, we found everyone that we dealt with from bar staff to maids to bellboys were all very friendly and helpful. We tipped our maid daily and tipped bars for all drinks, which was definitely appreciated and did not seem expected. While we are not the type to stay at the same resort twice, we would definitely recommend this resort to friends with children. While not necessarily a 5 Star resort by North American standards, it is a beautiful, clean and lovely resort, worthy of at least 4 stars in any book.
