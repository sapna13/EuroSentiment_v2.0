{"text":"Not as bad as they say, but not as good I was booked into Hotel Air for a conference. They put me in a single room. The single rooms are VERY SMALL (mine was #205). Now, in their defense, I'll say that I got used to the room within a day or so, all I did there was sleep, clean myself and call my spouse back home, and that the bed was comfortable enough. But still, if you are an American used to having some room in your room, the singles will be a bit of a shock.The location is outstanding for getting to the U-bahn and seeing town and there are some good restaurants within walking distance (at least east, south, west). There is an internet cafe one block over but the staff don't appear to know about it.Don't consume the overpriced goodies in the room. There is a kaiser's within a block where you can get what you need. I even took the liberty of emptying the silly stuff they put in the fridge and replacing it with my own water. The maid didn't seem to mind.Breakfast isn't elaborate but it also isn't terrible. I'd call it functional. I certainly thought it was good enough not to go looking somewhere else.For the most part the staff speaks a little English (don't expect too much though) and is polite, but on the night shift they clearly had someone on her first night, who knew no English and couldn't manage the phone to forward calls. It took several tries for my spouse to get through to my room.If I were traveling to Berlin for a vacation, the first thing I'd do is check the reviews here and then I'd probably try another place. If you don't mind small spaces and can get a good rate, then this place is probably worth a look.One last thing. Unless there are ground floor rooms (which I didn't see) this hotel IS NOT handicapped accessible. I took the elevator when I arrived thinking it would save me lugging my bags. It stops inbetween floors and then you have to walk stairs. ","annotations":[]}
