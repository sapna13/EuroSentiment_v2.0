{"text":"Fantastic faultless Hotel Can't praise this hotel highly enough. It was extremely clean, we had 2 superb large rooms with dizzying views towards the Ginza and lots of windows. Didn't hear any noise at all. Bathrooms were fab and the toilet was fun! There is a button on the TV remote to remove the Japanese voice-over on BBC and CNN. Breakfasts offered a wide choice including lots of fruit which you don't see much of elsewhere in Tokyo. Croissants, toast, hot choices ,cereals etc. Or you can choose a Japanese breakfast if you prefer. The staff were great and lots of English was spoken.There is a room off the lobby where you can use the computer for free if you haven't brought a laptop. This was useful for checking out restaurants and opening hours of places we wanted to visit. The hotel is superbly connected via an underground maze to at least 2 subway stations and is 10 mins walk to the Ginza, much of which you can do underground if it's raining. We would highly recommend 3 visits from this hotel:1. Walk to the local Hamarikyu Gardens and experience the tea ceremony there.2.Take the Yurikamome Line from Shiodome station to Fune-no-Kagakukan and visit the Museum of Emerging Science (aka Miraikan) to see the robots in action! Watching the humanoid ASIMO run across the room in front of us was quite extraordinary. And brilliant for our teenage kids who were enthralled.3. Walk to the Tsujiku Fish market - it's very wet and fishy underfoot so wear the right shoes!Can't wait to go back to Tokyo and will definitely stay in this hotel.
