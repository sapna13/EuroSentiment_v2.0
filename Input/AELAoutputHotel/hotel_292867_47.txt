{"text":"Fabulous resort ! Like everyone else, I was nervous about the review of mosquitos and getting sick and musty hotel rooms and so on..... but I was pleasantly suprised to find that the Caribe Princess was even BETTER then any pictures I saw or reviews I read.Ok.... there are some small things that a few people allow to ruin their vacation like a cold shower here and there or too many Europeans. That is why the price is so reasonable.... if you want the Plaza in NYC then you have to pay PLAZA prices. We walked the entire hotel strip on the beach and there was not one resort that could hold a candle to the CP beach. And.... only the CP has rooms on the beach. Or on the pool. If you happen to get a bottom floor (and yes it will smell musty since you are in the Caribbean) then simply ask to be moved. The turnover is daily so another room will open up. The staff work 14 hours a day and for 12 days on - 2 days off.Their weekly pay equals two hours of minimum wage in the US and yet they never look tired or cranky. The only crank people I saw were guests wanting more and more and more ..........Bottom line -- this resort blew away any other place we have stayed. We relaxed, ate, swam, watched the activities, met a few people (they are as nice to you as you are to them) andall for a price that would not get you a weekend in NYC ! As far as mosquitos -- I think I saw two. Two. The Caribe Club Princess is what you make it. You can pay double somewhere else but you will get the same thing.So - trust the good reviews and ignore the bad ones. I will be going back next year !
