{"text":"wonderful experience We went to Sydney to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary. I did lots of research to fine the best rate and hotel.We settled on the Pier One since it was right on the water. After a grueling 16 hour flight, we arrived at the hotel. The first room we were given (because it was ready for occupancy) was not the one we ordered and paid for. It was on the 3rd floor and only a tiny high window which did not open. We asked for the room we paid for and were changed to a wonderful ground floor suite with two sliding doors. It had a nice table and chairs on the lanai and we had our evening wine and cheese time there nearly every night. We were able to watch the boats on the very busy harbor. It was right on the water with a promenade for public use. We found this to be great, since we got to talk to some of the various folks as they were passing by,and they were all very nice and interesting. Since we were to be staying for two weeks, this room was very comfortable and all was well.The staff in the hotel were very nice, polite, friendly, and most accommodating. The hotel was within a good walking distance to everything and we walked at least five miles a day.The ferry system is great and a good way to venture around and not expensive at all.We loved our time at the Sebel and would certainly stay again and would not hesitate to recommend this fine property to anyone needing peace and quiet as well as the hustle and bustle of people watching.
