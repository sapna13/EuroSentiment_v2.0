{"text":"Great hotel, excellent service Stayed in a King Duplex room for 4 nights and couldn't have wished for a better start to our holiday in Australia. Check in was efficient with staff very helpful. The room was great: large living area with a spectacular view towards the city, and a mezzanine bedroom with a very comfortable bed. Both the bedroom and the living areas had flat panel TV screens. The bathroom was next to the bedroom with an extra WC on the lower floor.Walking off the jetlag was easy given the BLUE's location in Wolloomooloo: it's a short walk to the botanical gardens and the Opera House and very quick to trot up to the Art Gallery of New South Wales (well worth a visit). The wharf location of the hotel is replete with Sydney's best (if rather expensive) restaurants (Aki's Indian was some of the best Indian food we've ever had) and there are plenty of other choices in the immediate area.The bar in the BLUE opens from 4pm and is more focused on cocktails and wine than beer, which suited us fine. Clientele were a mix of those staying at the hotel and business types, and prices were high but the cocktails (I recommend the Emburey Martini) great. The bar also has a tapas-style menu -- again, prices are not cheap but the quality and quantity is worth it. Room service was also worth trying: this was the best in-room dining we'd ever had.Other elements of the service were fine: valet parking was efficient and the front desk dealt with my queries quickly. A missing bathrobe was replaced in a couple of minutes, for example. Check out was fast and efficient.Overall, the BLUE is probably one of the best hotels we've stayed at, combining high quality service with a great location if you don't mind stretching your legs for the walk into the CBD.
