{"text":"Just wow! Arriving in torrential rain is not the best way to start your trip to Venice, but I have to say this hotel is the best I have ever stayed in! We were lucky enough to ask for and get two ngihts in the Moor's room and two nights in the Doge's room. Both were amazing-the decor is so opulent but also so relaxing! The little touches like the range of toiletries, the complemtary mini bar, the prosecco and biscuits on arrival, the rose petals on the pillow at night-it is just amazing!We stayed during Carnevale, whihc anyone who has been at this time will know is a but mad in most parts of Venise-this hotel is like an oasis of calm-the beautiful music playing, the unbelievably helpful staff and the fact the only tourists you will find around here will probaly be ones who are lost! Not to say that this hotel is far away from the main sights-we were a 10 minute walk to th Accademia Bridge and also found a handy traghetto over to St marks about 2 mins from the hotel-this saves you about 20 mins walking and costs 1 euro for 2!There is no restaurant, but breakfast, which is included, is fantastic-prosecco, fresh juice, yoghurt, palma ham, eggs, ceral etc, etc! Beautiful-the dining room is gorgeous, although you can have breakfast anywhere.I really can't say enough good things about this hotel-it is so beautiful and yet so intimate and relaxing-there are only 12 bedrooms and we only saw 2 other people once in 5 days!
