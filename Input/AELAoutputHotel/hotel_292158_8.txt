{"text":"Grand Palladium can be better. Food -Nothing special. Seafood was horrible but meats were good. Drinks -Too sugary and by 3-4pm, you'd feel like you couldn't have anymore. After 5-6 cocktails, we didn't even feel a slight buzz. I'd recommend the exclusive wine list available at the a la carte restaurants even though you have to pay additional money and this contradicts the idea of an all inclusive but they are totally worth it. The wines that were included under the all inclusive were truly nasty and I'm not a wine snob.Cleanliness -2 thumbs up. Service - Okay. People were friendly and courteous. My bf and I really liked some of the waiters there from the a la carte restaurants because they were more attentive. I've seen more enthusiastic and friently service in other all inclusive resorts.Beach - 2 thumbs up. Beach was gorgeous.Most Frustrating #1-Place was stingy with their towels. On the first day, we only had someone's USED towel. We requested additional clean towels from front desk and it took 1.5 hours along with an additional reminder call to front desk within that time. The rest of our stay, they never gave us face or hand towels - only 2 body towels.Most Frustrating #2-Sunbathing chairs. On the hotel information sheet, provided in your rooms, it's stated Do not reserve sunbathing chairs with your towels. However, the place doesn't even regulate their own rules and ppl there wake up at the crack of dawn to reserve chairs. Around 10am, practically all the chairs have already been taken. People just leave their towels there for the whole day so they can have access whenever they want. The hotel does nothing about it.Summary -We still had a good time on the beach. Resort food and service can be better but the place served its purpose - we were still relaxed and got some sun in a clean and sunny environment. There should be better resorts out there.
