{"text":"great hotel! Booked this with a great discount via lastminute, the deal where you dont know which hotel you are staying in until after you've booked it (which could be pretty dodgy, but so far has worked out fine..!)Anyway, the apex is in a great location, round the corner from the Tower of London (this has got to be my favourite landmark in London) and handy for 3 different tubes. Staff were great, very helpful and friendly. Hotel nicely decorated, contemporary, cool, lots of glass, wooden floors, big vases of exotic flowers etc etc. Lovely!The room we had was fine. Well decorated again, very smart bathroom with quality bath\/shower products (which were replaced every day...nice touch)The only but....and its a small one....is the placing of the plug sockets....Now i dont know if this just applied to our room but the only available plug sockets were a) behind the large TV and not easy to reach...and b) down under one of the bedside lamps which involved crawling on the floor on hands and knees to reach...slightly odd arrangement that....Neither of these plug sockets were near the dressing table either, which meant lying on the bed and stretching the hairdryer to try and see the mirror.....perhaps may need a rethink in room design that one....I have to say our room tho (number 130) had the most gorgeous view of the church next door (if you dont like church bells ringing on a sunday right next to your head then avoid this room..) and was actually a very nice room indeed.The local area tends to shut down at weekends, being somewhat of a business district, there are one or two bars and restaurants open but not many, but if you dont mind jumping on the tube (5 mins away) into central London, then this wont be a problem.This is a great hotel, brilliant location, and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyone ","annotations":[{"endOffset":340,"mention":"landmark","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Landmark_London"],"startOffset":332},{"endOffset":1478,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1474}]}
