{"text":"Superb in all ways This is an excellent hotel, situated close to the Ponte Vecchio (bridge) and next to the famous Uffizi museum. From the airport there is regular bus service that brings you to the Central Station. From there it is 10-15 minute walk or an 8-10 euro taxi drive to the hotel. From the hotel I could easily walk to all the important spots in Florence.The people at the reception are very friendly and gave me a warm welcome. I was traveling alone and had a single room for a weekend break in January 2007. I had given a room preference for a quiet room and without further asking they corresponded to that and gave me a room on the 4th floor at the back. The room is small and had just a single bed. (I booked my room at the hotel website and is was not nearly half full that weekend in January. It would have been kind if they had upgraded me to a double room, because with such a reservation they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to pay commission.) The style is luxurious and the furniture is of very good quality. All the ornaments in the bathroom are also top-class, there is only a shower, but it has a bidet and there is a soft and thick bathrobe available. There is a minibar and two bottles or mineral water are complimentary daily.It is a real nice gesture of the management to have already a voucher with your name on it in the room when you arrive. It is for a drink in the bar on the 5th floor. When I went there in the evening I was the only person. (Maybe it is so because the drinks are rather expensive, just a small soft drink costs 4 euro = app. 5.50 US.) The barman is a nice man and he speaks good English.The breakfast is included in the rate and is just superb! A good variety in food and every item is of the highest standards. The breakfast room itself is just stunning! Large beautiful painted plafond (you can see a picture on their website, in real the colors are much brighter), fine looking tiles on the floor and the same colors are used for the walls.For me this was really one of the nicest small hotels in the world where I have stayed. Location couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have been better, service was excellent, the room, although small, good and the breakfast tasted very delicious. I enjoyed a great weekend!
