{"text":"not as good as i was expecting I was really looking forward to finding a new hotel in Amsterdam and the reviews for Hotel Zandbergen looked so good. I have stayed in Amsterdam a few dozen times and have experienced a range of hotels from one star to four stars, so I have a pretty good reference point for this city.I think this property has many different rooms and your experience would be directly proportionate to the nature of your room. Unfortunately, my experience is not reflective of the other reviews and like drslamb I really question the methodology that puts this hotel in the top ten in Amsterdam. The first mistake was mine -- I should have noticed how far the hotel is from the center. While the hotel is just on the #2 tram line, the trams stop at 00.30 (12.30am) so if you stay out late plan to take a taxi or a long walk (I'd say 30 minutes from the Leidseplein). In addition, there is something nice about staying in the canal rings in Amsterdam and this is far from the canal rings.Second, I got an unbelievably small room (and I am used to small rooms) that was facing onto the main road (Willemsparkweg) so I could hear all the traffic and trams. The bathroom was such that the shower was integrated into the bathroom itself so that once you showered the entire floor was covered in water. The toiletries were basically nonexistent except for some shower gel in the wall dispenser. The towels and linens were fine and the bed was comfortable. I had no trouble sleeping -- I kept the window closed to keep out the noise. There was sufficient closet space so I got my luggage out of the way to make more room. The TV was set uncomfortably above the bed and I did not watch much TV. And the wireless internet service worked intermittently and could not be relied upon for business purposes. Now on the positive side, the staff are incredibly helpful and the manager Henk is as charming and courteous as the earlier reviewers have said. The breakfast was typical Dutch breakfast -- meats, cheeses, hard-boiled eggs, breads, rolls + croissant, cereals, coffee, tea, milk, juices -- and Henk made sure the newspaper was sitting on your table. The service was very good.But unfortunately, the location away from the center and the small room could not be corrected by Henk's genuine service. As indicated earlier, it looks like there was some very nice larger rooms (including ones with terraces or gardens that faced away from the road) that are probably worth the extra cost. I'll probably try somewhere else next time.
