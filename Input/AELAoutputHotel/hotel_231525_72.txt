{"text":"Excellent hotel in superb location We stayed two nights at this hotel in early February. The location is superb - a minute's walk from La Rambla and about 5-10 mins from the Aerobus stop. The staff were very friendly and we were offered a glass of (very delicious!) cava on arrival. The room was modern and spotless. The bathroom had two washhand basins and a huge array of toiletries including a shaving kit and combs! From reading previous reviews we decided to skip breakfast in the hotel as it was too expensive, however we were offered breakfast on the first morning at a special 50% rate. That was worth it as there is a good selection to choose from. This hotel is situated in the old part of the city and is surrounded by lots of interesting little shops and cafes. If any girls reading this are into jewellery making (as I am) there is an excellent bead shop right beside the hotel. There are several more in the vicinity but some of them are trade only and in some you have to buy a set minimum number of beads. On a practical note the Aerobus is the cheapest way to get from the airport, and very straightforward. Also, as with all cities, stopping for a coffee or snack on La Rambla will be much more expensive than heading off the main street. The food market just off La Rambla is worth going to even if you are just looking! It also has lots of little tapas establishments (counters\/stalls) which are packed with locals.
