{"text":"Faultless, good value, v. central location Immaculately kept, modern hotel in great location right in the heart of Ginza. We stayed in a double room with 2 queen sized beds and though not large, the room was perfectly adequate and cleaned everyday to perfection. Trendy loo and excellent power shower over the bath, freebies in room and mini-bar with enough room for your own water and food. Very cheap local calls from the room phone was re-assuring when I got the bill. Very varied Eastern and Western buffet breakfast from 6.30- at least 10am is good for the jet-lag and was included in our room-rate. Didn't eat in the hotel otherwise - just so many other places to choose from. All the staff are bi-lingual and very friendly. This was our first trip to Japan and I will stay at the hotel again.Ginza is rather like the Bond Street area - smart shops and boutiques but not very cutting edge. Hotel within 15 min walk of Tokyo Station or short taxi ride. Ask hotel to give you directions back to hotel in Japanese ( even print a map to the hotel before you leave) and print out maps in Japanese as taxi drivers rarely speak any English and certainly don't read it and they don't map-read very well - even with Japanese maps but v. friendly. We took JR Line train from Narita Airport which was superb, v.efficient -just under 1 hr from Airport terminal. Hope you enjoy your trip as much as us. ","annotations":[]}
