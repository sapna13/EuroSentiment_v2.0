{"text":"First impressions don't always count My husband gave me a wonderful Mother's Day gift, a trip to Hong Kong, without the kids!! (Our first time away together in a long time!)When we first walked into our room we were a little dismayed at how small it was, our suitcase would not even fit in the room, we had to put it on the bottom of the wardrobe! However, what the room lacked in size, was made up by comfort and cleanliness. We found we were in our room so little of our time, just to sleep....(!) on a very comfortable bed. We found we were too busy exploring Hong Kong, by day and night, to spend too much time in the hotel! (Gotta love that freedom with no kids!)We loved the location, in that we could escape the hustle and bustle, yet it was so easy to catch the shuttle bus downtown. We also found being so close to Hung Hom train station was a bonus as we mainly travelled by train, and it was the right train line to head to Shenzhen, China, for more shopping!Having the shopping centre right there was great as well. We tried a few of the restaurants there and can recommend Cafe le Must for a cheap, but huge meal, served by lovely staff.Whenever we would walk back into the hotel I noticed a lovely aroma, something like fresh flowers. I did ask the staff, but they didn't notice it, maybe they are used to smelling the lovely smell all day!Speaking of the staff, they were very helpful and friendly.I did use the pool twice for a morning swim, which was great.'We also had a drink at the bar and breakfast in the hotel (ground floor) which were both great.We found the internet access easy and useful for keeping in touch with the kids and our business at home.Overall a great stay, and don't be put off by the tiny rooms, get out and explore this amazing city!!
