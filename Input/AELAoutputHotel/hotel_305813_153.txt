{"text":"excellent hotel, but small rooms - even smaller bathrooms This was one of two hotels we stayed at in HK, the other being the Novatel Citygates on Lantau Island, near the airport. In many ways, this is an excellent hotel, but it has one major drawback: the rooms are small, and the bathroom is even smaller. For this reason alone, the Novatel was better.Transport to the hotel from the airport is a breeze: go straight to the shuttle bus booths to the right after you come out of arrivals. Langham has a booth (There are two Langham hotels in HK.) The excellent shuttle bus to the airport is 130 HK$ and the service is excellent. (By Mercedes limo, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ 550 HK$). The sky-blue coated staff give you a sticker. When the bus is ready, they whisk you and your luggage downstairs to the bus. The trip takes about an hour depending on traffic and crosses the famous Tsing Ma Bridge (the world√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ longest road and rail suspension bridge!). You arrive at what looks like a mall in downtown Kowloon, in the Mong Tok district (excellent for shopping and local markets.)The foyer is plush. Check-in was efficient and the staff friendly and welcoming. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ when you get to your room that you are disappointed. We reserved a de luxe room on the net, which we thought would be OK. It was not. We were offered a larger room at check-in (First clue) for an additional 700+ HK$, including internet and executive club access. The room is cramped, the bed a tad hard, and the bathroom small. The bathroom is actually a glass box. (The bellman helpfully shows you the blind between the bathroom and the bedroom that you pull down if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to watch your partner showering or whatever!) The washbasin and surround is glass, so you need to keep your wits about placing items in the bathroom. The closet is also small but there is a usefully large safe.The hotel has a superb restaurant with excellent Chinese menus and excellent service, and good wine list (Take a coat or sweater to counter HK√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Arctic AC). Breakfast, which is excellent, comes at 385 HK$ for two. As elsewhere in Asia, except Japan, internet is not free √à√\u2020\u2022?although there is a computer suite, with free access, on the third floor. The hotel staff is friendly, helpful, and numerous. The concierge staff will provide you with helpful advice on places to visit and how to get there. As with other hotels in HK, the hotel is connected to a huge mall and MTR (rapid transit) station. Even so, we will probably use the Peninsula or the Shangri-la (on Hong Island Island), if we return to Hong Kong.One really great deal at the hotel is their 1-hour free evening tour of the Mong Tok markets and shopping areas (wet market, ladies√à√\u2020\u2022?market, flower market, electronics.) Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ miss it. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a bargain. Mong Tok is VERY crowded √à√\u2020\u2022?always. So, keep the map provided by the hotel handy.Apart from shopping in the Mong Tok area, during the two days we stayed in HK, we took the Star Ferry√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ (Victoria) Harbour tour (Hopping Pass). Check out the Clock Tower at the terminal. If you are lucky, you will see some junks on the harbour. Also cross the harbour from Kowloon and take the tram up from Central MTR station on Hong Kong Island up to Victoria peak for a great view of the harbour. Travelling round HK is easy. Despite the warnings about taxis, we had no problems: they are cheap, efficient, and in abundance. But the MTR is really the way to go. Also cheap, clean, efficient - and faster than taxi. If you need change for the ticket machines, the customer services staff provides it. Take the MTR to Tung Chung on Lantau Island, near the airport, where you can take the memorable cable car ride up to the Giant Buddha, Po Lin Monastery and Chinese√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√™√≠tyle village at Ngong Ping (one of the best attractions in HK).
