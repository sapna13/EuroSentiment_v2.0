{"text":"Location, Location and Comfort!! Loved the Muse I stayed with my parents at the Muse Hotel in NYC from Dec. 31-Jan. 3rd. We arrived around 10:00 A.M. and the room was not ready. They tried to give us a room at that time but didn't have anything available, so we left our luggage and left to the Metropolitan Museum. We got back around 2:00 P.M. and the room was ready (check in is at 3:00 P.M.). The Closing of the streets was affecting the access to the hotel after 4:00 P.M. on Dec. 31st but it was very well organized by the hotel. We had no problem moving through Times Square with the room key and a letter from the hotel. We stayed in a remodeled room with 2 beds (they are full size) and the room was fairly ample. Flat screen tv, mini bar, daily newspaper, robes, cordless phone, i-pod port...everything we needed for a great stay in the city. Check in was smooth and the hotel people were very friendly at all times. As other reviews mentioned, there's a wine reception in the afternoon at the hotel lobby, which was very nice. Didn't get to eat at The District restaurant so cannot comment on it. We were charged for some items from the mini bar that we did not consume but I addressed the situation to the front desk and they didn't ask any questions and removed the charges. The location is one of the best things about The Muse! It is closed to everything but on a street that is not noisy at all. Also, you get the personalized attention from a boutique hotel that is not found on a bigger chain hotel. I will definitely stay at The Muse again and again!!
