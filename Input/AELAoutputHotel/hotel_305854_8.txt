{"text":"Would stay again, but not the best We stayed in Hong Kong in February 08 for a week. This was our first time in Hong Kong  1 week might be perhaps too long. Receptionists were not friendly on our arrival, we have booked our holiday with Virgin  had requested smoking room with balcony. First that room wasn't available, then no smoking room was available, so they put us in a room  head receptionist said we should have a cigarette in the bathroom if we want to. Room was quite small as everybody says, but big enough for people who don't spend much time there. Windows can't be opened so even though we came back after a day out to a clean room even with the air con it smelled of cigarettes. Room service was good, as we were disapointed with Hong Kong chinese food (every meat had a chewy skin on) so we had dinners at the room. The breakfast was good choice of european, chinese  british breakfast, so we made most of it. We only had 1 dinner at the hotel restaurant as it wasn't the best food  quite over priced. There is another chinese restaurant in the hotel complex behind the shops, which was ok, but not to our taste again. While you are in Hong Kong I would definitely recommend to go  see Big Budha - cable car ride to the mountains with a massive budha on a hill. Also Victoria Peak has good views if you are lucky not to have pulluted day. Ocean world is a good day out for everyone.
