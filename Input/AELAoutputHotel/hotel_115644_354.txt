{"text":"A Great Place on Union Square Our recent stay at the Chancellor turned out to be a very pleasant experience and a great value for the money. The reservation clerk at the hotel built a custom package that met our needs perfectly. The room was on a upper floor and faced Powell St., as requested. The rooms here are small (as expected, but it doesn't rain in S. F. in the summer, so who stays in their room!) However, there were multiple amenities, even the promised rubber ducky, the beds were comfy with upgraded linens, the bath was also small, but well-equipped with multiple mirrors, hair dryer, extra towels, etc. and there was a huge closet ! We had a food credit, which we used at the on-site restaurant for breakfast, delicious food and a great server at 7AM in the morning! The desk clerks were exceptionally helpful, always cheerful, and the cookies, tea and coffee were always out. This hotel has free internet service for guests, so we we were able to print out boarding passes very easily and check email too. This hotel is also a short walk\/bus\/BART to just about anywhere you want to get to and the desk clerks will help you figure it out! We also had a car for part of the stay, the in-and-out was very convenient and the parking garage attendants always pleasant and helpful. I have stayed in several other hotels around Union Square and this one beat them out by a mile!
