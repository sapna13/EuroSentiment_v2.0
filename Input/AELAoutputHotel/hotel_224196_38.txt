{"text":"Lots of fun! My family of 4, myself, husband and DD 12 and DS 8 had a great time at Vila Montana and Isabela last April! We had a room by the pool and the tennis courts and it was a short walk to the beach and the restaurant. We did not eat at the restaurant except for a bruchetta appetizer, partly because 2 of our traveling companions became ill after eating at the restaurant, so it made me a bit nervous. There is a hammock by the pool, which is nice. The rooms were kept very clean, but don't keep your windows open, I did to let steam out of the bathroom, and when we returned there was an iguana on the ceiling! There is a small area of swimmable beach, if you go to the beach and walk to the right, past the rocks, you'll see that there's an area that is relatively flat. We went here almost every day. Snorkling is good here as well. The gym on the property was good, w\/ a treadmill and hand weights. My kids and I did horseback riding on the beach using Tropical Trail Rides and it was really good and definately worth the $$$. It may rain a bit every day, but remember that it is a rain forest, and it normally doesn't last long. The area itself is not very touristy, and a knowledge of a bit of Spanish can go a long way! There are very good places to eat close by, I can't remember their names, but one place was on the beach and had a man walking around w\/ a little guitar serenading, it was a lot of fun and a bit comical; he would sing spanish songs to the locals, then come to our table of 14 and sing I did it my way in English. I smile remembering it! My husband, son and a few others chartered a boat in La Paguera where they went deep sea fishing, where my brother in law caught a blue Marlin and others caught Mahi Mahi. We also drove down to La Paguera a day earier and went on a private snorkling trip through the mangroves for I think $200 for the 4 of us including sandwiches. There is a grocery store close to the hotel, but beware: it has very short hours on Sunday. Also, there's a donut shop in a strip mall by the grocery store, and we went in there and had sandwiches that they toast, very yummy! We had a great trip to Isabela, and the Villa Montana was a very nice hotel and we would stay there again.
