{"text":"Good vacation.... My review is late by ha lol. We enjoyed our vacation, but we have stayed at several Gran Bahia hotels befor and found it allitle blaw as we knew what to expect.Flight was long, and there was not much direction as to how to get to the bus.Food was great.Room was excellent, we requested to be close to the beach so we were abit far away from everything else.Service was excellent. Only neg was no one served drinks at the pool.Our friends book at the priemer and had a private pool and resturant. We did not so I would book priemer next time.Beach - We enjoyed it but we like diving and this is not a good beach for this.We went to a shop ran by someone from Montreal, it is free to go.. not a good place to get presents very costly, but nice.The tents at the end of the beach has nice gifts at good prices.We gave the guys at the water taxies pop and water and they gave us free rides......just a tip...Don't go on Jrassic Buggie tour, take the other one, it was a great tour but you will never get your video u pay for...... several people had the same problem......Bar\/Disco way to many people at a small space, drinks are free but good luck with this.....Overall this was a great place to stay but we found it to be expensive for gifts ect. I like to buy friends and family gifts and at 20 us dollars a mug, 25 for a t shirt it adds up.Overall I enjoyed it but would not return.have a great trip.
