{"text":"Stay somewhere else next time My husband and I went to the Ritz for a wedding. We were really looking forward to staying at the Ritz again, because we got married at the Ritz in Laguna Beach\/Dana Point in California. We arrived at the Ritz 8 days into our trip to Bali, after staying at the Nusa Dua Hotel and Spa and a beautiful local hotel in Ubud. In both places we were upgraded to suites and or villas, full of Balinese culture, charm and elegance and lots of amenities. Upon arriving at the Ritz we were very disappointed with our ocean view room, that looked like any other room in any other Ritz hotel around the world. In other words it lacked much Balinese culture and style. The amenities that were included with our other hotels that we stayed at before the Ritz, far outweighed what was included at the Ritz and at a more affordable price. Paying $10 an hour for internet service is ridiculous, when we got it for free at all other hotels, drinks super expensive with little alcohol, food ok, and the grounds lacked the true Balinese culture and feel. Additionally the room didn't have any drawer space which I thought was odd at a 5 star hotel. The ocean front infinity pool was the highlight of the trip along with a great spa treatment. But overall I thought the value was not there for the money. When we return to Bali we won't be going to the Ritz. The competition is too good with other hotels that offer more value for your money.
