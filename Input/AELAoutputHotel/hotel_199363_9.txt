{"text":"A real disappointment Having stayed in the Budapest version of an Art'Otel a few years ago, I was looking forward to my stay in this hotel- and given that it was close to where I was working I thought that I had stumbled upon a gem.However, I'm disappointed to say that the reality did not match my expectations. First big shock is the lack of 'art' around the place... but then I am willing to admit that I'm not an art expert, so maybe I missed these treasures.The reception area is clean and tidy and the bar area certainly looks like it belongs in a design hotel. There is a decent wifi connection on the ground floor, but nothing once you venture to your room. A shame, as I was travelling on business and this was a major irritation.I booked a standard room. It was a nice size room, a jazzy \/ artsy carpet and a comfortable bed. The 70s lingered in the bathroom and the poor quality of the towels was another annoyance. Little touches such as toiletries (shampoo, soap etc) were replaced with tubs of generic soap attached to the wall... functional, but lacks that little sense of luxury that you want from a hotel.The biggest problem for me was the noise at night. A room on the front of the hotel is unbearable because of the noise from the nightclub opposite. I had to move rooms (and pay √à√\u2020√ü?0 for the 'upgrade') to the back of the building.I'm not an early riser, so perhaps this is a lesson to me, but the breakfast was atrocious. There were plenty of sausages floating in tepid water, but little else by way of hot food. When they did finally notice that the scrambled eggs had run out and refilled it, the hungry hoards descended, leaving a few scraps. I gave up all hope of having any eggs for breakfast at all. That said, the cheese selection was good and the bread rolls were still warm, which is a nice treat.I certainly won't be staying here again, and I would only recommend this hotel for those who need to be near KaDeWe, but can't afford the Swissotel on the corner. Given the multitude of other design hotels in Berlin (and plenty near the ku'damm already!) this is a truly mediocre hotel.
