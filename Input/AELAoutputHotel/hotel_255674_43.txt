{"text":"Lovely hotel Had a lovely stay for 4 nights in a king room. The 2 nights Fri and Sat included stunning buffet breakfast for $345 a night and then the rate increased for the Sunday and Monday but no breakfast included ?! Great view on 18th floor of Opera House and the best thing really is the location. Just a short walk to the restaurants and life of the harbour. Hint if you want a cheap breakfast and healthy lunch right next door is a great cafe !The hotel pool says heated but it feels cold ! Ask room service for your robes as they are free for your stay and so is a shoe shine ! The desk staff are very helpful and prompt. We were able to fax information for business for free, the concierges were great and very quick to look anything up they didn't know and the taxis prompt from out the front. About $30 to the airport. Requested a late check out the night before and we were able to stay until 2pm @ no extra charge due to late flight. Lovely gesture. Handy map at the desk, short walk to the centre of town for shopping and make sure you do the Walking tour of the Rocks. The tour guides are brilliant ! Comfy bed, excellent black out facility (best in hotel ever )and rooms were clean. I would say this is a 4.5 star establishment. The atmosphere is elegant but welcoming. Looking forward to trying the Marriott in Liverpool UK later in the year ! ","annotations":[]}
