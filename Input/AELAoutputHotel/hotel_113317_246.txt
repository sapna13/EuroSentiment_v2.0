{"text":"Absolutely the Best Hotel in New York City We chose this hotel based on the high ranking in trip advisor.We now know why it is rated #1 in New York City. This hotel is the best hotel we have stayed at whether it be in the United States or Canada. This was our first time to New York and John and his staff made us feel as if we were at our own home. The rooms were great, the complimentary breakfast -great and the wine cheese and snacks daily made this a great experience. The hotel is in a great location because you are literally right in the heart of times square.The service in this hotel is the absolute best. The front desk representatives are the most friendly helpful people that you could wish for. They go out of their way to help you in any way they can. They greet you with a smile before you leave and when you come back ask about your day and then again ask if there is anything they can do for you . The housekeeping staff, the cafe staff, and the front desk staff are terrific. We would especially like to thank Peter and Jeffery of the front desk staff for absolutely going far and above the call of duty to make our stay the greatest experience. We will never forget you. We will always stay at the Casablanca Hotel and will recommend this hotel to all our friends and travel agents as well. Look forward to seeing all of you again in the future.Mike, Sharon, Maurice and Bev. ","annotations":[]}
