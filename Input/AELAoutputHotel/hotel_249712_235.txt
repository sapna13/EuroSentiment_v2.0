{"text":"A Great Hotel in Times Square We stayed in a corner room on the Executive Club level. The room was *huge* - it would've been a junior suite at most other NYC properties.Much bigger than I'd expected. The bonus of breakfast, appetizers, andespresso in the Club Lounge was great. We were traveling with our 1.5 year old daughter and the added space of the large room and the comfortable retreat in the club lounge were very welcome.We ordered a Heavenly Crib (free of charge), but it is smaller than a normal crib and our daughter ended up sleeping in the king size Heavenly Bed with us (there was plenty of room). For an infant, the crib would've been fine. It was great having a bathroom that was big enough to help the baby take her bath without feeling crowded. The room was clean, but showed clear signs of wear and tear. Some touch up on the trim and wallpaper could resolve this. The TV and computer were great, but even though we had a slick iMac in the room there is an additional charge for Internet access. The iMac worked great as a video player for the Teletubbies DVD when we needed a little quiet time.As a corner room, we had three 7'x7' windows looking down on the city.We loved the natural light and being able to look down on all the activity, but the windows had a downside as well. We were on the 12th floor, and the street noise still was quite intrusive. The hotel should consider replacing the double pane glass with laminated windowsto reduce street noise (especially sirens) or submit to less chic window coverings and install heavy curtains to muffle the sound. Curtains also would help with climate control, as it was cool outside and the heat in the room could barely keep the temperature up unless the fan was turned up from low to the louder medium setting regardless of how high you set the thermostat. Otherwise, the room wasalmost silent -- we never heard a door or footstep or any other sound from within the hotel.In the past we'd usually stayed at the Rihga Royal or Essex House. Both of those hotels have changed owners (and market positions) so we went with the Westin. We like the chain because we know we will like the beds and it is rather casual (although I love Ritz, etc., I don't typically shave or wear a tie on weekends, and parents don't always feel welcome with kids in some of the more upscale hotels).We'd be happy to stay here again, but it truly is in the center of themayhem of Times Square, so we may look for a quieter part of town nexttime.
