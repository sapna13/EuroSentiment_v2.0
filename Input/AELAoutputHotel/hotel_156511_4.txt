{"text":"A Wonderful Place I was part of a large group that spent about 10 days in M√ã√\u2022√ñxico City in June of 2006. My stay was great, in part because of this wonderful hotel. The rooms were good; a little crowded with lots of furniture. Working safes in the closet. Cable TV selection is decent with subtitles on everything. Room service was prompt and very good. Beds were super comfortable but that's personal preference. Always spotless. There is a fairly large store inside the hotel for things you might have forgotten at home like pharmacy\/drug-store type things, and bottled water.The location of the hotel is excellent. I love the energy and vibrancy of Mexico City, and there is plenty of that here. You are just a few blocks or miles from all the important Mexico City places (Plaza de Bellas Artes, the Z√ã¬\u2022?calo, shopping, etc.). Plenty of great restaurants nearby. There's a computer caf√ã√\u2022√ñ right next door that was only about 10 to 20 pesos an hour (about $2 USD). The little mall across the street is lame, but I especially liked the 2 story bookstore on the corner; they have an eclectic collection of CDs and DVDs and they play live music in the afternoons from the 2nd floor stage. Also a huge music store across the street. For shopping, don't freak out and go all the way to Wal-Mart; behind the hotel near the subway station is a little street mercado and you can get everything you need there and also spend time among locals. Another mercado is a few blocks in the other direction and is very extensive. Bargaining is encouraged. The 7-11 is also around the corner. Around the hotel is noisy, but my room was nice and relatively quiet. The location is also very gay-friendly if that interests you. The staff was GREAT. I forgot my iron and they lent it to me for the entire week. It broke and another one arrived within 10 minutes. Then, they didn't even mind when I mistakenly left it in my friend's room at the end of my stay. I was surprised by how often they came to the room; once to clean it, once to change sheets, once to pick up the dry cleaning. Always at exactly the same time. Also, once I stayed behind from the group and remained in the hotel because I was sick (not from this hotel--picked it up elsewhere in Mexico). I met the limpieza (housekeeper) while she cleaned and she told me what to do to get better, and she told me about her family  her life there and we taught each other a few words of objects in the room.The food is just so-so. After 10 days, we couldn't stand the breakfast at Sanborn's anymore and we just were eating it for sustenance. The service in the front restaurant and at the front desk was just okay--they were polite and met our needs but seemed a little overwhelmed. They got especially annoyed if we tried to get change for smaller bills. The servers in the rear restaurant were really helpful and nice.Do hold on to your purse  wallet--if you walk purposefully and as if you know where you're going (even if you don't--just pretend) you will be okay. The police can actually be nice to you; you can ask them for directions. I felt about as safe here as I do walking around in any large city--and this even as a woman occasionally walking alone.Go see all the typical Mexico stuff, it's worth it, but also, check out the post office nearby--very beautiful for photos. Have a great time and enjoy Hotel Gen√Å√\u2022¬¥ve. :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2867,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2863},{"endOffset":2867,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2863}]}
