{"text":"Just loved it I stayed at the Hyatt in Oct 07 for 7 nights. Now admittedly I may have been caught up in the whole Hawaii thing, but I just loved it. The hotel was elegant but not pretensious and the location was fabulous. I priced the Outrigger  Sheraton etc and I could not believe how much more they wanted for beachfront. Don't get conned this hotel may be across the road but it looks straight at the beach and Waikiki surf, and I think is towards the better end of the beach anway.We had Ocean View rooms and the outlook was incredible. Overall the rooms were great, large  comfortable with very comfy bed. Yes they were a tad dated but you could live with it because the position was second to none,. We ate at a couple of the restaurants and found them to be very good especially the italian\/chinese place. The bar around the pool was very pleasant.Its proximity to the main shopping ares is ideal only being 200m to the international marketplace and across thr road frm the main beach area with all of the hire gear. It has a realatively large shopping area underneath it as well including 2 of those great ABC stores where you can literally get everything. I think this is the pick of the Waikiki hotels and would come back here without hesitation. Don't get sucked into the saving money argument and stay a street or two back. If you are in Hawaii you want to see the ocean, and trust me the Hyatt delivers!
