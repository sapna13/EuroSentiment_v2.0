{"text":"Great value We are an adult couple who takes at least two vacations a year in all inclusive hotels in the Caribbean. We have been to more than 10 different hotels in the last few years; therefore we can compare them with ease.My wife and I spent a week at the Natura Park Hotel between January 12 and 19. It is our third visit to this Hotel. We had been there the year it opened (1997) and again in 2002 . Of all three visits, in our opinion this was the best. Food quality has improved at the main buffet, there is diet food available for those who need it, although the hotel was full we never had to wait to eat at the main buffet, the food at the Italian restaurant was excellent, the quality of alcoholic beverages and wine is above average to other hotels of the same price range in the Punta Cana Area (Baileys at the main bar, bottled Spanish and Italian wines with all meals). General maintenance of the hotel is good, pool is clean, room was always made up early in the morning, never a towel missing in the bathroom, free safe in the room, beautiful but simple and natural setting all around.The characteristics we like best about Natura Park are:Marvelous gardensVery low buildings well blended with natureBeautiful quiet beach with lots of shade The atmosphere at the main bar and lobby is very relaxed.Because it is not to large a hotel, everything is close by.Low noise almost everywhereNo pressure to participate in activitiesVery restful vacationSuperb leisurely walks on the beach to the left of the hotel because there is a very long stretch of virgin beach without any other hotel for at lest 2 to 3 km.Located far away from the crowded stretch of beach near Cortecito which starts at the Barcelo hotels complex and ends at Breezes with more than thirty hotels one besides the other.Comparing this hotel to several others within the same price range, we consider the Natura Park one of best values for your money in the Punta Cana Area and we highly recommend it to people who are looking for a relaxed and restful vacation at a very reasonable price.
