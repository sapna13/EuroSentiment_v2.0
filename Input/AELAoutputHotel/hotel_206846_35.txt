{"text":"Nice location, comfortable hotel We had a very enjoyable 2 night stay here - slightly marred by the slow check in process and the way they nickle  dime you for every service. We arrived too early to check in, but they very obligingly stored our luggage and gave us a map with some helpful advice and a loaner umbrella. I completed (I thought) the check in paperwork and we went exploring. When we returned to offically check in the deck clerk was overwhelmed - it took 30 minutes for her to finish processing our check in, and still one of the room keys did not work. Seriously, she answered the phone 7 times while waiting on me. I almost went Russel Crowe and ripped it out of her hands.That done, the room was very nice; quiet and very comfortable. The air conditioning was adequate, but a little warm even on the coldest setting. Bathroom was good size and the toiletries were Crabtree  Evelyn, generously replenished each day. I had pre ordered the fruit plate for us - BIG MISTAKE. It amounted to 2 apples and a dull knife. They have apples at all the elevater landings and lobby for free. Then there is a charge for connecting to the internet daily or hourly - if you use their business center there is a charge by the minute and charge per page for printing. I've not run into that before, and since it is handy to print boarding passes, I was peeved.We loved the location, pretty boulevard and easy walk to beautiful Vondell park. The museums were an easy walk, as was the buss.We did not use the hotel dining room, the menu did not appeal to us, but we had an excellant although expensive dinner at the Hilton next door.I would recommend this hotel and the lovely location, just be forewarned if you need internet access, and don't buy their extras.
