{"text":"Enjoyed the Westin New York Westin hotel was overall a good experience. The location was convenient, walking distance of Times Square, the beds were very comfortable, and the view was nice. The room was clean and I also liked the double showerheads. Only key negative things were the room was unavailable when we arrived at around 1:00, since checkin is 3 pm, we left and came back and around 3:00 still had some trouble getting into the room. The front desk had to keep checking with housecleaning to see if hte room was ready but they couldn't even find them. The toilet is also very loud, so at night if you wake up and don't want to wake up who you are staying with, I suggest you don't flush it. However, my experience with the business center was very nice. I had some packages delivered there and one didn't make it on time, so they are holding it until my friend goes down to pick it up for me. Overall I liked the hotel and would stay there again if just for the Westin beds and convenient location.Overall suggestions for New york - try not to eat anything chain store-like for food. In my experience, food has been more expensive and a lot worse. In the past I have been to TGIF on 5th Ave, and it's really bad here and this time we went to Appleby's which was also awful. Food was cold. Normally I wouldn't eat these if you are in New York, but sometimes you are just hungry and pick something familiar if you haven't planned anything else. However, food on the good side - Le Gigot in Soho on Cornelia street has great brunch. Yummy french toast and crab cakes. Have also been to Tao and Spice Market - both are okay, nice decor Asian fusion food. Somewhat trendy restaurants.
