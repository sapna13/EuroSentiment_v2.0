{"text":"Great place for a second stay!!! Okay, let's give this boutique hotel an exhaustive review because the property has earned a fair shake. If this is your first trip to Hong Kong and likely to be your one and only visit, start looking elsewhere and be prepared to pay for your stay! Most importantly, don't complain - you will get that for which you will pay! The great thing about Hong Kong, as opposed to Shanghai, is that your money has value. Despite paying for service found wanting (e.g. Westin -Shanghai) or paying for rooms which should have a view and don't (e.g. Westin - Shanghai), Hong Kong has great hotels in great places like the Admiralty and Central areas. Be prepared to pay for the Harbor View, bite your lip and shell out the dough. You will get your money's worth and everyone will be pleased.However, if this is your second, third or fourth trip to Hong Kong, then the Rosedale on the Park (much like the Royal Park in Sha Tin) is a real treat. The property is clean as a whistle, situated close to the Trams for endless tramming for pennies and close to the bus stop for cheap rides around town, as well as up to the peak (#15) and over to the Star Ferry (#8). The elderly should be cognizant that staying at this little wonder will require a fair amount of walking unless the local cabs (ready and waiting) are used for quick trips to the shopping areas in reasonable proximity (Times Square and the Island Area). Don't be discouraged - all the hotels require a little hoofing. Between Rosedale on the Park and the Park Lane, the junior suite at the Rosedale is a much better deal than a standard room at the Park Lane. They are more than likely priced comparably and the junior suite is a far superior deal. The Park Lane appears, deceivingly, to be a better deal, but the Rosedale on the Park simply shines. A great fish venue is right across the street and a more than reliable steakhouse is right around the corner. A 7-11 is close, too. The junior suite at the Rosedale is a great deal and perfect for stays of three days or more. Also, the local grocery store is 5 minutes away where water, coffee, bananas, oranges and simple staples (cookies) can be purchased to defray otherwise unnecessary expenditures. The junior suite is superbly well equipped with a microwave, ironing board, electric coffee\/tea pot, safe, bar sink, internet access and two tee-vees. The bathroom is kind of small (not enough room to swing a cat around), but immaculately clean and the towels are fresh everyday, friendly and plump. The Rosedale, like the Royal Park Hotel, is a great value. The staff at the front desk is great - the Concierge and guys at the front door should invest in an Aloha shirt and learn from the Hawaiians (you only get one chance to make a first impression). Overall, a great find and a wonderful place to stay in Hong Kong, especially if you know your way around. If you don't, ride the Trams, take the Buses, learn the layout and head back to the Rosedale - a little home away from home. The Rosedale gets a good grade. Very nicely done and very, very comfortable. Hint: Ask for the southwest or northwest views and try to get over the 25th floor. Priceline Europe provided a great rate. Rating the dough for the deal - the Rosedale is a big winner.
