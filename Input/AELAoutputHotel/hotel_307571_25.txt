{"text":"Not bad but not at the top We stayed there with our 2.5Y kid for 10 days. We chose to go again for 4-seasons since we had an excellent experience in Langkawi the year before, and that the kids club seemed very good.The place overall is nice and homey, with a very similar architecture to the villas in 4-seasons Langkawi. We did not have any privacy problem since the hotel had 50 villas booked for a 400 villa capacity. The only big reserve concerns the planes from the airport, which are right accross the bay in front of the hotel...It is not a great concern as long as you can not hear them, but you actually can, although this is usually limited to a few times during the day... Not something you expect for this kind of price.The staff is amazingly friendly, from the buggy driver to the restaurant waitress\/waiters to the baby-sitters, no exception there. The cuisine is very good overall, but we were disappointed to find one of the 3 restaurants closed for renovation. There was no information about that in the hotel. Given that we took all our meals in the hotel, this was definitely a minus... Breakfast is ok, but after a few days, you feel like you don't have that much choice. There is no buffet, and you end up having to choose from a 2 pages menu every morning. I don't really understand why there is no breakfast buffet since there is one, which is amazing, in Langkawi....However, we strongly recommend the events organised by 4 seasons : 6 on the beach on Tuesdays eve is a great vlaus, with an amazing buffet, and Bed on the Beach is amazingly romantic with a jazz band live on Thursdays and Sat. So, if you don't need a baby sitter and a kids club, I think you can rent a villa nearby, enjoy a personal driver instead of a local taxi, and book some of the events at the 4 seasons. Since we could not move that easily, 4-seasons brings you the entertainment, with programs every day from Balinese music\/dancers, to live music etc. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":197,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":193},{"endOffset":1669,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1665}]}
