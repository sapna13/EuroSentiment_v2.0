{"text":"Good Budget Hotel; Can Work on Customer Service My husband and I stayed here one night based on a friend's recommendation for a budget hotel in a good location. The hotel is situated in a very accessible location from the airport (subway and quick taxi ride) and to all the shopping\/food\/nightlife. However, I thought this hotel could use a little better customer service, especially at the front desk. I know it may be a budget hotel, but it doesn't excuse poor service (see below for specifics).PROS1. Great location2. Good price, relative to other hotels in Hong Kong3. CleanCONS1. Front desk customer service - The front desk folks in the evening hardly looked up from their computers when we checked in and asked questions. The front desk folks in the daytime actually cared to look up at us, but were quite rude and gave us an unnecessarily hard time when we tried to confirm our previously requested late check-out. In the end, the front desk people from the evening and day shifts miscommunicated our request. However, we received no apology. Just a reluctant agreement to let us check out an hour later. Kind of left a sour taste in our mouth. 2. Construction - Don't know how long they're working on the hotel, but they didn't seem to care that they had guests in the rooms adjacent to the construction site. We heard drilling all day, starting bright and early in the morn. 3. Tiny rooms - But it's Hong Kong and you get what you pay for right? At least it's clean. Aside from these 3 cons, 2 of which might be isolated incidents, the hotel is a good bang for your buck. I may look into coming here again if I want to stay around this location. ","annotations":[]}
