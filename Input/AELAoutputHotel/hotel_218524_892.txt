{"text":"We loved it People - We loved the smiling, friendly, courteous and mostly bilingual (Spanish  English speaking) staff. They were very helpful, accommodating, and honest. In the restaurants they were exteremly attentive and professional. The bar tenders remembered how we liked out drink after a while and even knew our names.Place - Exteremely clean, Beautifully lanscaped and it was equipped with various birds, fishes and turtles which were exteremly entertaining, especially the 2 parrots that would run up to you to try and take something. We spent many nights watching the birds us the bread we fed to fish to catch their own fish.Pool - was neat because you could actually swim up to you room if you had a pool front suit. The pool was far reaching and you could actually swim from one end of the complex to the other with a stop at a few bars inbetween. Beach - There were tonnes of beach chairs and a few beds on the beach to relax in which was nice. Since it was off high season we always had a place to relax. The waters were a bit rough but it was fantastic to wade in the waves. If you wanted calmer water just walk to the right toward the other resort about 5 minutes and there is a very calm area surrounded by rock \/ coral which brakes the waves before it comes ashore. Food - there 2 theme nights outside ( beach party  pool party) which served typical dominican food and we loved it. Breakfast was fantastic, there were fresh fruit shakes, tropical fruit platters and fresh pancakes, fresh toast and omelets. Which were inaddition to the buffet items. There was a pianist there every morning. Lunch was exellent at the stakehouse and the buffet at the Italian restaurant was good too. Dinner was execellent, we like the filet minon at the stakehouse, the ambiance and the food at the mexican restaurant and the roasted lamb at the french restaurant. We never got around to the other restaurants for dinner because we booked excursions and attended the 2 theme nights.Excursion # 1: - We love eco tourism and so we signed up for the FunFunCave excusion. It was fantastic but there was 6 hours of driving to and from the place but it was totally worth it. There was horseback riding, hiking, rappelling and cave swim (optional) inaddition to actually walking in the cave. The cave it's self was spectacular. It was huge, the under ground rivers that we walked in was actually refreshing because it cooled us down and the formations on the ceiling, walls and floors were spectacular. Excursion # 2: The horse back ridding that was offered by the same people who gave the free horse back riding was fun!!! It was just my husband and I and the guide so we got to galop and race along the beach with our horses as the sun was setting. Our guide was very cautious and always kept a close watch of the horses and our comfort level. He even offered to take my camera and he tooked pictures of the 2 of us during the 1hour long ride. It was fantastic.Overall: We loved our experience at this resort. Tipping was not expected by the staff but we did and you can tell a dollar two meant a lot to them even though it wasn't to us.
