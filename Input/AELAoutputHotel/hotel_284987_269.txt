{"text":"Total Rip Off - Not as All-Inclusive as You Would think. Service - The service was actually quite good the staff was always very friendly and helpful and I do think that they were overall quite attentive.Reception - We arrived at 6:00pm and there was one woman at the reception who was not terribly nice. There was only one family ahead of us but it took us 45 minutes to get checked in. Food - Atrocious. at $1240 a night per room, (and i would say that our room was worth at the very very most $300 a night (actually, i am being very generous), which leaves about $940 for the rest of the amenities per day, $470 per person, the food should be beyond amazing. However, most of the restaurants offer buffet-style appetizer dining and in my book, no classy restaurant makes you run around and serve yourself. in addition to which the different cuisines that they offer (french, italian, carribean, etc) offer largely the same array of dishes for the appetizers, which is very disappointing. The presentation and quality of the food also very disappointing. A japanese restaurant with no chopsticks, for example, is just weird. The all-day dining room service menu stinks too. They offer sandwiches, BLT's, hamburgers, for the most part. The fanciest offerings are a shrimp ceviche and beef carpaccio, but they are mediocre at best. And you are restricted to 2 beers per room per night. What the hell is that?Spa - They tell you it is included, and that the massage\/facial treatments are not included, but in fact the use of the spa is only included if you have a facial\/massage appointment that day. Those treaments cost between $80-$165 and the spa itself (we had a look) is pretty meager. The spa in my gym at home is set up better than what they have there. In order to even use the spa by itself, you have to pay $28, which makes it in fact NOT inclusive at all as part of the package. We were so annoyed by this that we canceled our appointment at the spa since we just had a feeling that it would not be a very good experience in the end. Beach - The nice part of the beach is that it is never overcrowded since it only serves those staying in this hotel. The problem is that it is completely rocky and you cannot really walk on it without shoes on. there really is no sand to speak of, more like gravelly pebbles, which smart quite a bit on the feet. Not surfable for sure, at least not while i have been here.The Hotel Building - Really beautiful, very photogenic, it really is a sprawling complex that is great and not over crowded and well-decorated. Conclusions - I just think that this is the very problem with this hotel which is that it looks good but tastes like crap. The fact that the food is so mediocre is a really big problem because the least that they can do is offer excellent food and it is just too disappointing in the end and there is no excuse for it given how much money people have to spend here. And honestly, if you just want to relax and have a beautiful time and eat good food and not feel ripped off, then don't go here.
