{"text":"Great location. good value for Boston The location of this hotel is unbeatable. The metro (or T) brings you to the doorstep from the airport. It is located opposite the Public Library and is within walking distance to most sights including Boston Common and the start of the Freedom Trail. There are also good dining options around the hotel. I booked a single room and although on the slightly small side, it was very compactly appointed and extrememly stylish. The bed was comfortable and the sheets etc were spotlesssly clean. There was a large full length mirror on one of the walls which helped to give an impression of having a larger room. The TV had an amazing selection of channels and the CD player\/radio was connected to a cery high quality sound system which included speakers in the bathroom too. Speaking of which the bathroom was comparatively large and the power shower excellent. What I particularly enjoyed was to take a long luxurious shower with the music of Mozart piped into the bathroom!My room did not have a view to speak of but that didn't bother me. With respect to the staff, I woujld say that the standard was more variable. upon arrival I was met by a really charming and enthusiastic receptionist who asked about my flight, and proceeded to give me helpful brochures and maps of Boston and tips on where to dine and visit etc. On the subsequent days I noticed that the receptionist was occasionally distant and somewhat aloof, but never rude. The breakfast was OK. Orange juice, muffins and bagels from Dunkin' Doughnuts, fairly good coffee, Philadelphia cream cheese, jam and fruit, instant oatmeal. On same days the breakfast started a little late as they still hadn't gotten the fresh supply of bagels, but its a small point. Bottled water was complimentary.For the price I think it was good value for Boston given its outstanding location and quality of the rooms, considering tat breakfast is included. I would stay again if ever I were to return to Boston.
