{"text":"Bavaro Princess - Beautiful Resort!!! My husband and I stayed at the Bavaro Princess from 26 April to 3 May. The Resort was breathtakingly beautiful and we had a wonderful vacation. We booked through Sunwing who book you into what they call 'junior suites.' We were leary of these rooms after reading other reviews and tried to upgrade prior to departure. Our travel agent advised us to wait and see what the rooms were like before doing an upgrade. We took the advice but ended up upgrading once we saw them. The junior suites are located as far from the beach as you can get and the room they gave us did not have a terrace or a balcony. We upgraded immediately and got a beautiful suite close to the beach. Yes, they are a little on the older side and there is a musty smell but they are very spacious, quite pretty, and are kept very clean by the extremely hard working staff. We had a nice balcony where we sat to have our morning coffee and relaxed in the late afternoons and in the evenings after dinner. The grounds, restaurants, and beach are all beautiful. The staff are friendly and helpful. We did find the language a bit of a barrier...but we managed! We saw no bugs... not even mosquitos! I didn't need to use bug spray at all! It was extremely hot and humid while we were there. We had a lot of sunshine and a couple of overcast days which were rather welcome after getting sunburned! We used SPF 30 and had to switch to 45 when 30 didn't even seem to cut it! It poured rain a couple of times but the rain didn't last and it came either in the evening or early in the morning. I recommend carrying an umbrella when you head out to dinner as the rain can roll in rather quickly! The food was pretty good. It was always easy to find something to eat with the large selection of restaurants and food choices available. We walked the beach and thought that our resort had the nicest one we saw. We took the 'Caribbean Festival' excursion which was awesome! It is a half day excursion where you get to snorkel at a coral reef and swim with sharks and stingrays. There is entertainment, snacks, and drinks provided on the boat. It was an amazing time and I highly recommend the experience. It also allows you to get a glimpse of the real Dominican Republic. It was an eye-opener to see the poverty, slums, and garbage that was just outside the gates. There are alot of beach venders trying to sell their wares 'cheapy! cheapy!' We bought a couple of things but if you just shake your head 'no' they pretty much leave you alone. We left a tip for our maid every day and tipped at restaurants and bars. These people work very hard and deserve to be rewarded for their efforts. I also left gifts for the maid each day but next time I will just leave money. We never reserved chairs on the beach and didn't have any problem finding available ones when we looked. The house band provided good entertainment up at the lobby in the evenings and the drinks were always tasty (I liked the coco locos, pina coladas, and merengues!). You do have to request alcohol in some varieties of drinks as they'll give you 'virgin' ones if you don't. We both got the infamous runs but we took our meds and carried on! The resort is huge but there is a trolley available if you don't feel like walking. My husband and I walked everywhere. It only took a few minutes to walk from the beach to the lobby and the grounds are so beautiful to walk through both during the day and at night. I highly recommend this resort. You just have to keep in mind that it is a foreign, tropical country where the lifestyle and climate is very different from ours. We thoroughly enjoyed our Dominican vacation. Just embrace the whole experience and you're in for a great time!!
