{"text":"Overall good, but some issues Overall the Marriott is a very nice, clean hotel. It's in a great location, and the beach and pool areas are very nice. In addition, the Tuscany Restaurant is very good. The room was average, but had a nice ocean view. There were some problems with our stay, though. The bathroom door wouldn't stay closed, but they did come and fix this soon after it was reported. Information wasn't communicated as well as possible, though. On New Year's Eve, people staying at the hotel needed to obtain bracelets to allow them back into the hotel at night without paying a door fee. We only found out about this by overhearing people in the elevator, as there was no information posted anywhere in the hotel about it. In addition, we heard that an inauguration in Old San Juan was closing streets there. When we asked the concierges about it, they had no idea. We went into the city that day and had to leave by 2 because the streets were closing. The concierges should have known about this. Finally, the night before we were checking out we requested a late check out. They said it would be no problem, but to call whenever we woke up to confirm. When we called the next morning, they said a late check out was not available. If they had told us this was a possibility, we would have woken up earlier to get some more beach time in. These aren't major issues, but were disappointing nonetheless.
