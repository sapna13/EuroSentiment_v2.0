{"text":"EXcellent Resort Dreams Punta Cana Resort and Spa ......Feb.25,2008An amazing resortThis is the best resort that I have stayed at so far... The resort is very well kept and the rooms cleaned to perfection....I have never come across such a WONDERFUL staff....It started with the desk clerks, the restaurant staff, the cleaning staff and best of all the entertainment staff.....The entertainment staff was amazing...There were many activities from early morning until late at night when the Disco closed....They are so friendly and always so kind to all the guests.... They all have many different talents and Dreams gives them the opportunity to shine in many different ways.... They are all very out going and at all times keep the guests laughing and having a great time.... Joseph with his amazing voice, 50 Cents and Julio with there humor, I feel bad I don't have everyones names because they were all amazing....I could go on and on..... Everyone on the Entertainment group where GREAT!!! The restaurant staff were over the edge friendly and always very helpful....The bartenders were great, making all the kids those special drinks and keep the adults very happy...The cleaning personal took so much pride in there work it was always a pleasure to see them in the morning.... All I can say is that at this Resort the staff are definatly always there for you 100%.....If you decide to check it out, the key is to participate... like I said the entertainment personal are there for you everyday of your stay..... The shows in the evening are worth planning your night around..... and don't forget the many day time activities.....Would love to go back again!!! Thats it from Canada!!! ","annotations":[]}
