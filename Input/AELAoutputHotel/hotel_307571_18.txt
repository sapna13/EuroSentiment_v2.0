{"text":"Fantastic! Bali can be anything you want it to be - dreamy and exotic, cheap and cheerful and it caters well to it all. Over the years I've been to Bali many times and loved it on almost every trip.Having just gotten married, I wanted an exotic honeymoon for my wife. She's new to Asia and I wanted her to see the charm and seductive nature of Bali. The Four Seasons at Jimbaran was simply fantastic.If you're looking for traditional yet simple (elegant) architecture, nice landscapes, lush greenery, your own private villa and plunge pool overlooking jimbaran bay, privacy and a resort that caters to your every need - sports facilities, resturants and very good service - then this is it.October was a good month to go, after October its the rainy season till about March, so beware. The Four Seasons is not cheap but its worth it. We stayed there 3 nights before heading off on other adventures into Flores and Komodo. We returned to Bali and stayed at the Oberoi - which was good (different but good).Overall, I would highly recco the Four Seasons if you're looking for privacy, a taste of the old Bali - quite, relaxed, traditional. The villa's are lovely. The view from your villa over the bay are amazing. Serive was great, beds nice and large, outside shower was fun and the plunge pool was ideal in the mid-day heat. The resort has fine resturants - PJ's on the beach was great. They also planned events such as dinner on the beach. The beach (on the bay) is very nice. Its South of Kuta (the main shopping area and surfing beach) so its quite. You can get to Kuta easily if you want to. Jimbaran is sheltered so its no good for surfing (if thats what you're looking for) but its still got good swells for body boarding, sailing etc. Running or walking on the beach in the morning or evening is nice.We could have stayed longer but we also wanted to see more of the nearby islands. Anyway, we look forward to returning there in the near future.PS - The Photos on the Four Seasons site are accurate.
