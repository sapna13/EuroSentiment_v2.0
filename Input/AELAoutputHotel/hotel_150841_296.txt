{"text":"Fun, Fun, Fun!!! My large family (ten adults total) stayed at iberostar bavaro from june 3rd to june 10th. We had a great time and i felt the need to share my experiences with you since i learned so much from the sight. Airport: the airport is a really neat looking hut. check in was fairly smooth. The only downside is the VERY aggressive baggage handlers. They see people coming a grab you luggage! We literally had to pry their hands off so we could carry our own luggage. Transportation: we traveled out of chicago with apple vacations. they provided us with transportation to and from the airport. the bus was big with a\/c and a nice ride. The roads seemed nicer than people had previously said. Arrival to hotel: when we arrived our rooms were not quite ready. We didn't mind though. We enjoyed our arrival bahama mamma and looked around the resort. The resort: the resort is beautiful! There are flowers everywhere and they are always cleaning, watering, or painting to keep up the looks. Our room was suffiicient. it was not the hilton by any means, but was nice. it had all the important things: a king sized bed, mini frigde, nice balcony, safe, and more. The pool\/ ocean: both are nice but we liked the pool because of its activities, closeness to the food, and of course the nice cool pool bar! The bartenders are so much fun. if you get to know them they will make you anything you want. if you are willng, they will try out new drink ideas on you. my husbands favorite bartender was Sala. he gave him a drink that he called the orgasm! most of us survived on a nice cold beer or miami beaches yumm! the pool is nice and cool and clean in the mornings. as the day goes on it gets a lot warmer and dirtier, especially by the pool bar. food: we ate at all the specialty restaurants. we did this by making our initial allowed three and then checking back each day for cancelllations. there was always something available. the breakfast buffet was good, but we did not like the dinner one. it was very repeatitive and so we went to the a ala cartes instead. our favorite was the gormet. The tenderloin and lobster salad are amazing. the lobster salad is really no salad at all. it is pure lobster with chicken and grilled to perfection. you have also got to try the pineaple mango dessert. yummmm! we also liked the japanese, although not cooked in front of you like the menu says, the flavors are still pretty good. cons: those darn peacocks. although beautiful to look at, they are the roosters of the carribean! we were on the second floor and they woke us up EVERY morning at five am! slippery!!! it is very slippery around the pool and at the pool buffet. since people walk around barefoot from getting out of the pool, the tiles are always wet. i myself fell in the buffet and by the pool ( i'm a bit of a clutz sometimes though :) ) overall, it was great. there were ten of us. aged from 27 to 65. all of us found things to do and had an excellent vacation for a good price.
