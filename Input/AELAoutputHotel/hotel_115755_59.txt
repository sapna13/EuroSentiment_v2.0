{"text":"If only they had better linens We just returned from a two-night stay at the University Tower hotel. We were dropping our daughter off to UW, so the location was perfect. It was within walking distance to everything related to the university. For the price we paid, it was very comparable to other like hotels. The price also included free parking and a continental breakfast. The breakfast was mainly breads, cereals, some fruits, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, juices, coffee, etc. Just the basics, but presented in a very nice room that had both small tables and sofa areas. Attached to the lobby is a Tullys coffee shop. In the lobby are two computers that you can use to get on the internet for free. You can print five pages for free and additional pages for fifteen cents each. They were a bit slow, but, hey... it was free. Overall, the service was very very good. The front desk workers were all nice and competent. Even the people in Tullys were very good. When we arrived, our toilet was clogged. They immediately sent up someone with a plunger. He fixed the problem quickly, but left the floor totally wet. We had to call him back to dry it. Our room was very tiny with a queen bed. The bathroom was tiny, also, but clean. Because the room is so small, the bed is pushed up against one wall. Some people don't like to sleep up against a wall. The climate control seemed fine, but better yet, there were two small windows that you could open for fresh air. The only real complaint that we had was the low quality linens. The sheets were thin and felt like a blend. If you like the luxury of nice cotton sheets and towels, then these won't do. The thin blanket seemed rather cheap, too. At least the mattress was comfortable. It looked as if either the management or, at least, the name of the hotel is about to change soon. Hopefully, they improve the linens at that time, too.
