{"text":"If your Looking for a great time in San Juan, Don't stay at NORMANDIE! First of all I'd just like to state that the hotel's employees are rude and not for helping customers and assist them with their stay! After coming back from a tour within in San Juan with the 4 persons whom i checked in with in the morning, while having to wait for my room till 3:00 pm from coming in from 10 am, we ask customer service for 3 extra towels after finding that there were NO WASHCLOTHS AT ALL! Okay, figure I wouldn't make a big deal about there being no washcloths and also having to wait to get my room till 3 pm, come to find out that they decide to tell us that the hotel's fire code doesn't allow more than 3 people to sleep in the room after WE ALL CHECKED IN TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE SAME ROOM! They gave us the option to pay extra to obtain another room or we will be kicked out! NO ONE EVVVERRR TOLD US upon making reservations OR calling three times prior to check on our reservation to secure it that there CANNOT BE more than 3 people in the room THEN try to act as if we were in the wrong when your Hotel reservation agents FAILED TO INFORM US OF THAT BULLcrap code! Not only were they trying to act as if it were our fault and should pay for the extra room, but if your employees made a mistake for such an important code to be followed then the hotel should compensate and make sure that we follow the restrictions. NOT INCONVENIENCE US WHILE WE WERE ALL SETTLED AND THEN TRY TO threaten us by saying that if more than 3 stay in the room then we have to pay 30 dollars per person extra each nite! BUT WAIT DIDNT YOU SAW that according to the department of protection says that more than 3 people cannot stay this is ILLEGAL! Your trying to get over by making us pay and be slick about it! Please......I advise STRONGLY THAT YOU DO NOT EVEN THINK OR DOUBT THESE REVIEWS FOR THERE POOR INDECENT AND DISRESPECTFUL SERVICE! Thank you... ","annotations":[]}
