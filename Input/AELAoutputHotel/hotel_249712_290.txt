{"text":"Not what I'd expected. It was an interesting contrast spending the night in London near Kings Cross at a business meeting and walking around at 10.30pm, we felt slightly uneasy, there was a simmering atmosphere in London that night and I was happy to get back to the hotel. The next day I took an early flight on my own to New York. I flew Virgin Upper in the top part of a new 747 and that was worth the extra money - fantastic service as always from Virgin. As I said the contrast on arrival in New York was amazing, I'll talk about the hotel in a moment but walking around Time Square at close to midnight was an experience everyone should have, the people were friendly and the atmosphere electric. Ok the hotel, not cheap so you'd expect it to be good and to be fair it was. The room was sharp and modern and the legendary beds every bit as good as the publicity material would have you believe. But for me the Hotel was just stark and cold. The service was first class but if you want a drink or something to eat you're better off going the 200 yards to Time Square where theres loads of choice. There is a famous Steak House in the Westin, it has an American Football theme and some of the best Steaks you'll ever see although how the guy opposite me ate half a cow beats me !! My room at a view of sorts but nothing to shout home about.Would I stay there again ?? Probably not but as a comfortable and convenient Hotel for all of NY's attractions it fits the bill.
