{"text":"Not worth the money, Noisy room, hard bed I just got back from my stay and I must say I was quite disappointed.As others have mentioned before, this hotel has two towers. If you bid on HotWire like I did, you will end up in the City Tower. While the room is still nice, it is incredibly noisy. Is stayed on the 12th floor, and it sounded like the cars were lining up right outside my window. I complained and tried to move to another room, but they were full, or unwilling to move me.The room was a bit small by US standards, but decent sized by European standards. It was equipped with 2 twin beds which seems pretty typical. The beds were very firm to the point of being a bit uncomfortable. I had a terrible sleep my last night.Also note that some room rates include breakfast. If you purchase on HW, your rate will not include breakfast. The breakfast buffet is 27eur which is quite steep, although it is a nice spread. There are many walk up restaurants within a few blocks, but nothing else immediately surrounding the hotel.Some sites list this hotel as 5* but I don't believe it is. It is fairly equivalent to many US 4* hotels, with the addition of a bathrobe and slippers, and some above average soaps, etc.The hotel charges you for everything, as you would expect from a business hotel. I racked up nearly $20 in phone charges, and that was after I used a pre-paid calling card!The room has wireless internet access, available for a fee. The lobby in the main hotel has a 1-hour free wireless zone where many hotel guests brought their laptops and checked e-mail. Overall, I don't think I would stay here again due to the high price and the fact that I had a terribly noisy room.
