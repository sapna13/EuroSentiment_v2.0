{"text":"Not Bad at all We were very apprehensive about this hotel after reading the reviews. But were positively influenced after reaching there. First the negatives. They put us on 4th floor at the far end of the hotel. there is only one elevator up. so it was a long walk each time ... or one has to take stairs to go from pool to the room. The staff was not well informed at to what our entitlement in our booking was , what were the current specials at the hotel etc. conflicting info. So please make sure you have your travel agent \/ reception write down your free extras like breakfast, internet usage, discounts. Good points.. If you book a club room , there is a free happy hour from 5 to 6 p.m with unlimited alcoholic drinks. the snacks not so great. They also have a camp splash for kids and free scuba diving lesson if you book in advance. Room although small was very clean and well maintained. Totally renovated I think. They give all amenities of a four star hotel. The food in Cafe Komodo is quite good and so is Room service. The Sanur Harum chinese for Dinner a la carte is a complete NO NO. Very bad , tasteless food, apparently they have good dim sum , but I did not try. The hotel has a shuttle but it does a 5 min. ride to the beach in like 30 mins so if you have the time to spare use it. Else it costs about 10,000 - 12000 RP to the Sanur restaurant area. Make sure u take Bluebird taxi cause the other one took us for a long ride and the bill was 27,000 Rp for the same distance. CAFE Batur Jimbara is a good option for food and coffee, we went there twice.. always busy.. Bonsai beach was also okay. For HOTEL to airport , I would recomm. using hotel , as with bluebird we also paid about 79,000 RP and hotel rate is 80,000. I dont know if hotel tags on tax and service on top of this. Taxi to KUTA from Hotel is about 60,000. Taxi to Jimbaran is about 70,000 Rp. Taxi to Nusa Dua is about 103,000. all Bluebird that we took. Hotel also has shuttle to kuta at Rp 10,000 per person. Dont miss sthe Dinner at JIMbaran very good view and restaurants..most of them offer free transport plus disc on food , we did not know so took a taxi back and forth.
