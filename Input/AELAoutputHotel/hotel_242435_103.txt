{"text":"Not bad, but not perfect This is hard to write. I stayed here for 6 nights for business this past Fall. There are some pluses and minuses to the hotel. Overall it's not bad and I would recommend it depending upon the price or deal you get.The room I had was a good size, clean, comfortable bed, decorated nicely, had a chair and ottoman, desk, big dresser, two end tables...armoire with TV. The closet nice sized, there was a large vanity w\/sink outside the room with the shower and toliet. So, for a couple of people it's convenient and large.There were nice tolietries, hair dryer, iron, etc. You have to pay for the in-room coffee, which is unreal, but that's hyatt for you. The balcony was small, but ok. You can control your own room's temperature. I didn't hear the neighbors much other than when they slammed their doors, so it was comfortable for business traveling.The hotel itself has many restaurants, a coffee shop, is big, and requires a lot of walking getting around to the various places (front desk, ground floor, etc). The pool is very small, but we loved the pool bar and the night bartender is a GREAT guy!It is in a GREAT location in Waikiki. Not on the ocean side, but across kalekekua where there are no other hotels on the beach side, so if you get an ocean view room, it's across the street, but a decent view. There are enough ABC stores to go around and plenty of shopping in the hotel shopping area and on the street nearby.We ate at the hotel's italian-chinese (yes, that's what i said) restaurant one night and we found it to be way over priced (pay xtra for rice?!) and poor service, as well as marginal food. But, the ambience and decor was nice. The regular restaurant for breakfast is pretty good, and you can sit iin the open indoors or out on the deck (but it's up on the 3rd floor so you cannot see the beach from here -- like the pool deck).the parking location if you're in the ewa tower is a long walk to get to -- we chose to valet since the parking gararge was actual across the street from the diamond head tower .All in all, i would return here if paying on my own dime, however, not if it's more than the waikiki marriott down the street. this time was at least $350\/night and i didn't even get the ocean view room. i was dispointed by that b\/c the rooms themselves were just not worth $350\/night to me, since i've stayed in waikiki and all over hawaii a lot and have had better rooms for a much better price. Try Duke's down the street for dinner and for the brunch. If you want local food, try the I Love Country Cafe, which is in a strip mall near the Ala Moana (bus or drive distance). Also, Ryan's in the mall is a favorite for the locals, decent dinners and food.
