{"text":"Affordable no-frills hotel I booked a single ensuite room at this hotel for 5 nights. I got a double room which was cozy and outdated in terms of decor, but clean and functional. There was a full bath, kettle, a\/c, cable tv, closet. Most of the people on my floor appeared to be businessmen -- this seems like an ideal hotel for people who don't plan to spend much time hanging around the hotel, who just want a clean place to sleep and a good base for touring around HK. It's definitely not a high-luxury place but it doesn't pretend to be--and for the price, I found it to be extremely good value and unlike other places I've stayed in HK, I had no problems. The hotel reception was very helpful and efficient. I arrived at 1pm and was shown my room immediately (check in is at 2pm) and I was able to leave my luggage there for several hours on the day I checked out. The location is great--just off Nathan Road about 2 minutes' walking distance from the Jordan MTR station. It's a very busy area popular with tourists because of the night markets. Hong Kong is quite small so you could taxis (quite cheap) but the MTR is clean, quick and convenient and the Jordan station is just a few stops from Central. I took the Airport Express train from the airport to Kowloon station, and then a quick taxi ride to the hotel.There are several computers for high-speed internet access (although only one was working when I visited), laundry facilities, and a small breakfast room -- breakfast is fine for a few pieces of toast or congee, but don't expect too much. There is a 7-11 right next door for water, snacks, instant noodles...(You can Google this hotel before booking to get a better price than may be offered by the hotel directly--I paid around $70\/night including breakfast, booking just a few days in advance.)
