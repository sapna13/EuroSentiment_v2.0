{"text":"Romantic little hotel Romantic getaway for me and my girlfriend. Stayed four nights at the hotel, booked through the hotels own website after reading the reviews on tripadvisor - saved around 100 Euros compared to the cheepest booking agent (hotels.com). How was the hotel: Great loction located 50 meters from the Pantheon in the Latin quarters. We came from Orly, and the railroadstop was just 5 minutes walk from the hotel.Check in was smooth, ok english, greated with a smile. Lobby is small, but nice and clean. Room was small, the bed a little bit hard, but ok size. Minibar and safe, window to the backyard. Bathroom was clean and nice, spaceous compared to the bedroom, bathtub. Quiet, and slept well. Had breakfast the last day, was ok, coffee\/tea, toast, a few cheeses and salami\/ham (Euro 12 per person). We usually got up around 10 and ate great breakfast on different corner cafe's (usually around 8 euro for french breakfast).What to do in Paris:We bought the Paris card for 5 days (buy it at the airport) and you have cheap transportation for the rest of your holiday, and it was nice to not have to pay everytime you took the metro, which you do a lot to save your legs :). We went to Louvre (closed on tuesdays), Eiffel tower, Sacre cur, Triumph Arch, champse E., versailles, Montmartre (was a big disappointment - looked like a getto with a lot of gangs going a round, felt unsafe compred to the latin quarters) and took an evening dinner criuse at the river seine - expensive but definetively worth it,Beateux Parisiene, booked at the office close to the eiffel tower - 125 E per person,(95,125,180 E dependent on service) great dinner, had snails for starter, wasn't bad, 745 pm - 11 pm), versailles (went there with local train covered by Paris card, located just 5-10 minutes walk) and just walked around. We found the Latin Quarters were the hotel is located to be the niceste part of town, a lot of cafe's, bars, restaurant and it seemed very safe!Have a nice stay in Paris and i would definetively recommend the above mentioned hotel and the Lain quarters.
