{"text":"Location super We booked directly through the hotel website and luckily we got a corporate rate which was fantastic so that is also mainly what my review is based on the price. Having looked extensively for a relatively resonable rate on a good standard\/any hotels (they dont exsist in New york at Christmas period) we were happily surprised by the good rate we got. It was appox half the price of the standard rate, possibly my review would not be as good if we had paid the full price.The hotel room was nice, big and bed comfortable, pillows very comfy, nice big TV (not that you have time to watch anything) bathroom nice with crabtree evelyn products etc. We had fantastic view empire state building 32nd floor. The check in was easy, every one we met at reception was pleasant and helpful. We didnt eat in hotel but the applebees restaurant next door (connecting door from hotel) was nice for breakfast. I would not consider the hotel plush but having been our first time in new york the location was just fantastic, walking distance of everything which is what we wanted. They had scaffolding up right outside timesquare entrace but we entered on arrival through 42nd back entrance. The hotel was very quite we slept really well and had no problems what so ever with noise. I have stayed in nicer hotels but as this was our first time in New york, so Im told the room etc are new and big and exceptionally clean in comparison to some others! If you are looking for plush luxury I would try somewhere else, New york palace hotel was stunning we popped in to have a look and the standard rate was the same as the high rate on hilton so possibly for luxury a better option.Whatever you decide have a nice stay.....
