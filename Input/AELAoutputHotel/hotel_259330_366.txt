{"text":"Definitely 2.5 Star I made the mistake of checking tripadvisor AFTER I booked, I won't do that again. The beaches in Punta Cana are the finest everywhere, that's the good news. The hotel is mismanaged and you don't need a degree in Hospitality to figure it out. The staff is great but over-worked and understandably annoyed with beligerent and obnoxious guest most of whom are not from North America. The food is pretty crappy so show up at opening hours or be aware that kids (and adults)have dragged their hands through your food, sneezed on it or placed it back on the tray after falling on the floor. The principle dining area is a very noisy cafeteria complete with a wandering band. The house wines are virtually undrinkable (Chillean swill from a bag-in-box) and they charge you extra for a la carte wines. BTW, they don't have six restaurants, its more like three that get a menu make-over every other day. The premises are generally poorly maintained and the availability of drinks 24\/7 means you can look forward to some fine singing echoing in your halls around 3am. The hotel charges 20$ for a safe lock which is non-refundable that seems cheap and insulting to a guest. Why would I pay you to protect my stuff from your staff? The carrier we used was Sunwing which is a small and disappointing upstart. They took several hours to check us in for departure, served 2.5 ounces of free wine with an average meal and charged 5 bucks for the next small glass of average wine. In-flight drinks or snacks were not provided so pack your own. This resort is one noisy party joint that attracts families, young adults and older folks. If you're cheap this is the place for you or for a few hundred more you can find real 4 and 5 star resorts in the same area. I will not be back.
