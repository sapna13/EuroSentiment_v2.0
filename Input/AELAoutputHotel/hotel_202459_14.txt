{"text":"Nearly perfect Just had a fabulous weekend in Berlin and loved the Radisson. We had a business class room which overlooked the river and the cathereral. The room was very clean with all the usual amenities..iron, board, lovely toiletries and unusually for Germany an esspresso coffee machine. The fish tank is amazing and we enjoyed a lovely breakfast in the atrium watching the beautiful fish and laughed when the divers enter the tank to clean the glass. The HEat restaurant is a little basic, but then not too expensive either, there is a strange Indian fusion theme to the restaurant. The service from the reception to the bar and restaurant staff was very attentive and extremely friendly.If there were any negatives they would be-As business class you get free pay movies, however none of these were in English so there is little point in this.We were offered free newspapers each day, we actually only got one on Saturday and this was an American paper not an English one. Only one thing annoyed me over the weekend. Coming in on Saturday night after a night out we decided to go down to the cocktail lounge for cofffee and brandies. I suppose its partly our fault for just ordering and not checking the price but we were charged √à√\u2020√ü?5 each for the brandies, in anyones book this is taking the mick....... I dont mind paying extra for a special room or extras but I hate being ripped off and this was stopped me awarding this hotel a 5, the cocktail lounge was quiet...no wonder ","annotations":[{"endOffset":283,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":277}]}
