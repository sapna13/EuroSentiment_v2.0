{"text":"Great location with excellent harbour views We stayed five night at the Grand Stanford on two visits as stopovers on the way to and from the USA in June\/July 2008. We took an airport shuttle bus from the airport direct to the hotel, which was relatively cheap, but so very easy early in the morning in a strange country. This is well advised. On arrival we were checked in within 10 minutes, on both visits, and straight to our room, even though check-in was advised as 2-00pm. This was excellent as we had travelled all night on the red-eye with our 5 year old daughter. After a really great shower, we headed off to the Rendezvous Restaurant for the buffet breakfast. What a feast. And service from waiting staff is so good. The cost was HK$180 each for adults, and HK$135 for kids. There is a huge food selection, cereals of all kinds, milk of all kinds, many fruit juices, a large cooked selection including sausages, eggs, tomatoes, fish, rice, noodles etc. There is also a great choce of cold meats, fish and cheeses, and selection of breads and rolls\/bagels for toasting, and fresh fruit and yoghurts. Great value as you can really have a feast and set yourself up for a good day of sightseeing.We had a cheapo room with 2 double beds and a city view first time, but were upgraded to harbour view second trip. Both were very nicely furnished with comfortable beds, excellent marble tiled bathrooms and plasma TVs. The Movies were quite expensive at $98 per film. Mini bar also not cheap as you would expect, but we bought beer, chocolate and water at the 7\/11 shop down the road and put it in the fridge, and put the hotel's stuff back in as we left!!! The room was cleaned and the beds made each day. We opted not to have clean sheets every day to save unnecessary costs, a good option offered by the hotel we thought. My daughter and I adored the gorgeous roof top pool and sundeck. It is very nicely maintained and clean, and there is a waiter service bar for a freezing cold Heineken or two!! The pool is quite large and the water was warm enough to not freeze you, but cool enough to be refreshing in the heat and humidity. And the sunbeds are excellent quality timber with big thick cushions on..... a great way to spend a couple of hours.The hotel is in a great spot on the harbour, with a 5 minute walk to TST MTR station, and another 5 minutes along the harbour front Walk of the stars to the ferry terminal, shops and a great light show viewing area.This area of Kowloon offers a brilliant view of Honk Kong Island, the skyscrapers, harbour boats and cruise ships, and the mountains etc. Quite spectacular. All around the TST area is very clean with an army of cleaners out at all hours cleaning up the small amount of litter dropped (big fines for littering\/smoking in Hong Kong!!! Excellent!!!) Also here there are many museums and other attractions. Taxis are also very cheap and easy as there are billions of them.Altogether an excellent hotel, nicely presented with a great foyer area, bar and restaurants. And not excessively expensive compared to the facilities offered by other hotels. We will definitely stay again on our next trip to HK.
