{"text":"Lived up to our expectations Hotel 41 delivered excellent service. We were met at the front door by the manager who helped us check in and offered us a free drink and snacks while we were waiting to get into our room (we were early) . The staff were very attentive, they offered advice on places to go and things to see, we had our every need catered for. The 'romantic turndown' service we ordered as an optional extra was fab - rose petals and candles were left in the room, along with a chilled bottle of verve clique champagne (this service came free if you ordered via the 'our offers' section of the hotel's website - there were lots of other things to choose from too, I'd recommend you have a look).The room was lovely - tastefully decorated in black and white. The room felt a tad small but we did go for the cheapeast option which was the executive double. If you have long legs you may have trouble using the loo in a room of this type as there's hardly any room between the loo and the bath - we're not tall so it wasn't a problem for us.The hotel was in a really good location, just a few minutes walk to Victoria tube station, there was no need to use taxi's at all. The park next to Buckingham Palace was really close by - we had a nice walk around the park on the Sunday just before checking out.I would recommend this hotel if you fancy a bit of luxury. We booked this one as it was our anniversary - we normally don't splash out so much but the free extras (i.e. the champagne and the breakfasts which would have cost √ä√£¬¢25 pp per day if we'd booked through the regular section of the website) meant it turned out to be really good value.
