{"text":"Disappointment  First of all, we need to discuss the disappointments. We were not impressed with the quality\/selection of the food at this resort. The same foods were offered every day, and they were often left out in the heat for who-knows how long. The food sanitation was poor, as things were often not refrigerated enough for the weather conditions. (ie milk, cheese, lunch meat, salad dressings, etc.) Three out of the four people in our group came down with some form of food-poisoning. Bring Immodium or Pepto Bismol with you as it is not readily available and super expensive. Also, only one of the ala carte restaurants that we visited was air-conditioned. We also found the language barrier to be a problem. If you do not know any Spanish, you will have trouble communicating with many of the staff. The night entertainment was repetitive and could be seen as inappropriate for children. Don't even bother going to the shows unless you understand some Spanish!Now for the redeeming qualities of this resort. We really enjoyed the beach and the pools, and the grounds were maintained beautifully. The rooms were clean and the air conditioning was sufficient though a bit musty. We enjoyed the Marinarium snorkeling trip, and dive shop staff met every need. After diving in Curacao it was a little disappointing here due to the small variety of marine life. The weather was great if you enjoy the sun and heat. Our vacation was o.k., but we will probably not be visiting this resort again. We also think that a 5-Golden Apple rating was very generous for this resort--a 3 or 4 would have been more appropriate.
