{"text":"A Catalogue of Errors I stayed at the Ramada for 5 days and encountered problem after problem. After checking in, we could not get into our room. Neither of the entry cards worked and the maintenance guy had to change the batteries. This happened again the next morning and a third time in the afternoon and resulted in us having to change rooms because the fault with the lock was too complicated to fix immediately. Its a shame we had unpacked everything the night before! The shower did not work because the handle was about to fall off. We had to ask the maintenance guy to come up a second time and screw the handle back on. In the new room, the safe was locked so we had to get him up again to open it before we could use it. On our first morning at breakfast in the hotel, there was no orange juice - a basic staple breakfast item! The hotel is also incredibly noisy. The windows are single-paned and even though we were on the top floor, we could hear conversations going on in the car-park outside. Make sure you're not at the front looking at the monorail track otherwise that would be even noiser. Bring your ear-plugs. On the positive side, great location, large pleasant rooms (if you don't mind wood-chip on the walls), comfy clean beds and free internet in reception. Amazing doughnuts in Top Pot Doughnuts a block away - try the 'Maple Bar' one.
