{"text":"Not staying there again and Here's why Would I stay there again? No. Would I recommend this hotel? No. Would I say there was anything exceptional? No. Why, you may ask? First, I am used to all types of lodging in hotels, inns, you-name-it, throughout the world. I'm particular but not a fanatic. This hotel would rate maybe 2 stars. The front desk people are nice, but a bit confused. (They initially gave us the wrong reservation printout for another guest without checking, had to be reminded about sending wine to our room, did not give us the proper number of checked-bag receipts, did not call us back about restaurant reservations until asked two times, etc.). They provided bottled water but it was warm and pretty much huddled behind their small desk area while guests had to wait in line. Not a very friendly place to discuss one's needs. The front lobby: Okay, but a bit worn and tired. You sit on the sofa or in the chair and you immediately sink in, not in a good way. Even the front doors of the hotel need refurbishing. The free coffee is a nice touch, but the hot water container was bone dry. Just a little lack of attention here. The room was clean, but not really clean. Towels were scratchy and not new or felt good. Shower head was good, but the shower curtain was old fashioned. Toilet seat had a stain on it. Bottom sheet was lumpy at the end of the bed. Sofa bed was not made up and when it was there was no blanket. No turn-down service. TV had fits when it ran different hues of color. All bar extras were overpriced (Snickers bar for $2.17). Restaurant downstairs Cortez needs a make-over. Curtains stained. Smells stale. Food service spotty. Food is so-so, nothing Wow about it. Mushy crab cake, chintzy glass of wine overpriced, no real theme that made sense. Hostess kept us waiting 15 minutes for our reservation without asking us if we wanted a drink or letting us know what's up. Server forgot wine with meal. Entry door needs refinishing. Parking is $33 overnight. Bellman are helpful, but didn't offer ice or anything for our suite. Loud fans in room. Light comes through bottom of door so it lights up room in the dark. Windows not clean. You might wonder why an older hotel like this is being touted as being so wonderful in this forum? Beats me! I've stayed in Holiday Inns that were more together. Not that the staff wasn't nice, it's just that the attention to detail is lacking. Don't pay more than $200 for a room here if you really want to stay. And if you bring your laptop, you will pay for WiFi as well.
