{"text":"OK, but poor sound isolation Booked two double the Acro for two nights as a late choice, the Bellevue being fully booked and other central hotels just being so much more expensive given the decline of the pound against the Euro. As usual for this price range in Amsterdam the double rooms were tiny, only one person being able to move around at a time, but clean and comfortable. Shower room was OK, but so cramped use of the WC was difficult and a non-mixer style shower meant that constant adjustment was required. Overall the hotel is a tad on the shabby side, particularly the lift and stairs, but there is a clean spacious breakfast room that could cope with the nine o√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√úlock rush! Breakfast is included in the room price, and is a an very adequate selection of cold meats, cheeses, breads, breakfast cereals and excellent coffee. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay.We were concerned at large stag party booking in ahead of us, particularly as the hotel boasts a 24-hour bar, but the management were very quick to resolve noise issues (hip-hop music in the adjacent room on a stag party return at 05:30 on Sunday morning). This highlighted the worst aspect of this hotel, the almost total lack of sound insulation between rooms. Location is not ideal for the central area, being a tram stop from Leidseplein, but trams are very regular so not really a problem up to around 00:30 √à√\u2020\u2022?and the Rijksmuseum is literally a minutes walk away.Overall reasonable value for money, and would certainly stay again, but given a choice I would plump for the Bellevue which is a similar price but more central, more recently refurbished and has better inter-room acoustic isolation.
