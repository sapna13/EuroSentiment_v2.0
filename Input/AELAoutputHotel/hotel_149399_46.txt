{"text":"The Good...The Bad...but there was no Ugly My husband, 7 year old son and I stayed at the hotel from 8\/23-8\/29. Based on previous reviews, we upgraded to the Royal Service before our arrival. As a follow up to all of the other reviews that you've read, I will add...* The grounds are amazing!* Our room was fantastic. The only complaint would be that the bed was not as luxurious as one would expect in the RS. Other families that we met that were not as impressed with their rooms. * The staff members were friendly and helpful and were extremely appreciative of tips. Many members of the staff helped me with my Spanish vocabulary which was limited to that from Dora the Explorer and Sesame Street. * This was our first all-inclusive and we did not expect fine dining but were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. We liked the Dominican restaurant the best, followed second in a tie by the Gabi and the Thai. * Very few waves with crystal clear waters...I recommend a morning trip to the beach and the afternoon at the pool since the seaweed seemed to churn up around noon daily. (at least while we were there) * The arcade and casino are only open in the evening Was the RS worth it? Yes and NoYes because of the room type (1 bedroom suite), the lounge, the Gabi, the proximity to the restaurants\/casino\/shows and the access to the golf carts for rides to the beach and other poolsNo (during low season) because it did not allow us to get restaurant reservations in advance (non-RS people that we met booked 3 days ahead and we were only allowed to book 1 day ahead) and because the RS pool was not child friendly (there were few spots where my son could stand) Overall, we were very impressed with the hotel and I would be happy to answer any questions. Hello to the England and NYC crews! ","annotations":[]}
