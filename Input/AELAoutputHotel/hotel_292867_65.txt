{"text":"Great Vacation My wife and I got back last night after a wonderful trip. This was our first time to Punta Cana. All of our other trips have always been to Mexico. The best thing about the trip are the beaches. Soft and wonderful. We are beach people and spent 90% of our time there. We went on long walks each morning and afternoon. The food was normal for an all-inclusive, not great, but we could always find something to eat. Breakfast was definitely the best. We ate at La Cava, Italian and Brazilian. The Italian had the best food, but the experience at the Brazillian was great. We felt that the VIP was well worth it. The room was much nicer and in a better location. The maids kept our refrigerator well stocked at all times and gave us fresh towels every morning and night. Not having to wait in lines to sign up for reservations. It was also nice to have a Budweiser or Heineken now and then without having to pay extra. We tipped regularly and usually got better service because of it. We brought insulated mugs so that our drinks lasted longer on the beach. They did not have a problem filling them up with the tip. We thought that the people at the resort were good, except for guest services. They did not know anything. The front desk personnel were the best. The bartenders were always fun and entertaining. All and all a great trip and a place that we would recommend and visit again.
