{"text":"Warning - Dont book here if you want privacy, sea views or good service! I pay to stay at Four Seasons hotels for one reason only - that i wont be disappointed. Sadly thats exactly what i was with Jimbaran Bay Four Seasons - bitterly disappointed. Much of this i put down to the Four Seasons website which states each villa has a private garden with infinity views of the ocean, well villa 150 possessed neither of those qualities. Our pool and garden was so open that when ever we were sitting in it trying to do a discreet spot of topless bathing every member of staff that went past beneath waved and attempted to strike up a conversation - a long way from being private. As for those ocean views, well they were non existent , the only view we had was of the bungalow in front - not quite the image the website would have you conjure up. In all the villa was ok but certainly nothing special that you expect of the Four Seasons. In fact the layout hadn't really been thought through properly, a couple of gripes : 1)There was no separate door on the toilet, so you had to shut the whole bathroom and dressing area off if you wanted to go to the loo in private.2)The mini bar was located in the outside living area, so every morning i had to traipse across in my nightie to get a drink, invariably to the calls of good morning from the staff below who i was on full view to.Plus in the evening having to go in and out gave the mosquito's more of an opportunity to get in, which was probably why there was a filthy, musty smelling mosquito net placed over my bed every night. It was so disgusting that every night my husband and i had to tie it back up as it made us cringe.However what really upset myself and my husband was the treatment we received from the security staff every time we went through front gate. Granted as we had hired a motorbike (one of our little pleasures when we are on holiday, as despite wanting to stay in luxury we also like to immerse ourselves in the local sights and life) we are not a typical Four Seasons guest and for the first couple days we let it ride each time we were abruptly stopped each time we tried to go through the front gate and interrogated with the screams of You guest here? We even joked about it to begin with. However it quickly got wearing, being screamed at and stopped like a common criminal two or three times a day. In fact throughout the whole of our ten day stay, there was only the one occasion that we actually got through the font gate without being stopped and interrogated. I have never received this treatment at any other FS. At the end of our stay we flew to Singapore and stayed in the Ritz Carlton where amazingly we were greeted by our name within minutes of staying there. Now that is the sort of service i expect!Would i stay here again? Don't get me wrong, it was alright, my holiday wasn't ruined, but it wasn't what i booked or what i was under the impression i was paying for. It's a shame because until now i could always bank on a FS hotel. I will definitely be going back to Bali, as it was stunning - but i just wont be returning here.
