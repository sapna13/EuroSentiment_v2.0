{"text":"European charm in San Francisco This is the second time we stayed at the White Swan so we knew what to expect. This time we booked a top floor king room. The room was huge by city standards, with a separate dressing area and extra sink area, large walk-in closet, and bar area with additional sink . The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. In addition to complementary soft drinks and water, the refrig. had plenty of room to store anything else one might want to keep chilled.We found the overall service to be very good, the maids did a good job of keeping the room clean and the front desk called cabs and provided directions to where ever we were going. There was no valet to help with bags when we were there, but for us, that was not an issue.The breakfast is definitely not gourmet, but was more than adequate and plentiful. We liked the fact that there was always coffee and tea available and a nice wine hour.No, the hotel is not spanking new, but then it does not claim to be. In fact, that's part of the charm. It reminded us of a higher end, older European hotel.The bathrooms are not huge, but clean and the extra sink in the dressing area makes up for the smallish bathroom. There is no air conditioning, but then it's not really needed. The windows are easy to open and provide a nice breeze, just be sure to shut them before you go to sleep as there is a bar behind the hotel that gets noisy at closing.Overall, we had a very nice experience thanks to a good staff and pleasant, even romantic surroundings.
