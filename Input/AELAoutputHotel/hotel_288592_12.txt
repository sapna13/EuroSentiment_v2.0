{"text":"Absolutely Love the Conrad! This was our post-cruise stay (May 23-25). It was our second time staying at the Conrad and have loved both visits. Super hotel and excellent service. We checked in at 9 am from the cruise and they had a room ready for us which was amazing. Got upgraded to a suite and enjoyed the spacious living room\/kitchen and separate bedroom. I loved the pillow selection you can order specifically a different pillow - nice touch.We use the free internet in the lobby. There are √à√¥√ú price cocktails from 5-8 pm on Friday nights (I think) which is a deal and a great view from the bar on the 25th floor. They say you cannot bring in your own alcohol due to their liquor license - first time I had seen that. Rented movies from the blockbuster a short walk away and enjoyed watching dvds in the suite one night. Fitness room is pretty well set up and water\/headsets\/newspapers for your use. Love using the tennis court on the roof (they have rackets and balls at the fitness centre) and location is by the pool. Pool\/hot tub is great with very helpful staff to find unused chairs, and fresh towels. Concierge can be quite helpful for dinner reservations and recommendations. They could beef up their repetoire though as so much to choose from in the area. We found renting a car was cheaper by calling Hertz than booking through the conceirge. Note that taking a taxi from the Conrad to Hertz, Hertz will cover the taxi ride. Would stay again at the Conrad for a downtown Miami location. Super quality stay - nothing can beat it.
