{"text":"Beautiful but, not quite there. The 2nd of our experiences with all inclusive vacations but, didn't measure up to our stay in the Mayan Riviera. While the hotel grounds are quite beautiful and the food offering was exceptional ( prior to some contrary reports ), even room accomodations were great, there are some nuances which were bothersome. All business transactions are conducted in American Dollars. No need to carry any R.D. Pesos. Yet, very few hotel employees spoke any english. Even front desk workers were unable to communicate with. The pools are beautiful and immaculately kept but, close at 6:00pm? Therefore, there's not much to do after that time except, eat then plan to watch the nightly 'show' which were sub-par. Daily activity information was also not readily available and not communicated. Room clean up times were also odd for after spending entire day at beach, in most cases room service didn't arrive till after 4:00pm. Lastly, there is no out of resort area to visit worth speaking of at this time. There is a new mall in Punta Cana but at time of visit was but 40% occupied and is \/ will be catered to an upscale crowd not, a local market type environment. Overall, if all one expects from a stay here is to lay on the beautiful beach or by a pool during the day hours then eat after hours it's great. But, frankly there's nothing else left. Especially when traveling with our 15 year old who expressed extreme boredom. ","annotations":[]}
