{"text":"A Very Awsome Resort!!!!!!!!! We are hosting a group function in the Dominican Republic in Punta Cana in October of 2008, and we went to visit the Bahia Principe Punta Cana on June 26th. Lets start:1. Upon arrival the lobby of the resort is awsome... We were warmly greeted by one of the staff, and even though there english is slight you were able to understand them, and know they were glad you were there.2. The property is so well maintained, groomed, and beautiful. The swimming pools were all clear, clean , and just allowing the sun to shine bright on top. The beach was even beautiful. 3. The rooms were nice, and clean. When i arrived in the room the first thing i looked for was bugs, and i didnt see not one as long as i stayed (hooray). Please tip housekeeping because its true if you tip them they continue to bring you new towles, lotion, etc.4. The food; Now some foods were much better than other, but people have different taste buds. My favorite foods were the seafood, japanennese, and the grilled burgers by the beach. The drinks should be another time that you tip the bartender and the drinks were the bomb..I was getting my drink on 4real ...5. The staff; Again you just have to understand they speak total spanish there, and there english is slight, but everyone was we talk to was friendly, they were always trying to make to fill at home ... I just would like them to be able to slow down when there speaking so others can understand. The safe in the rooms is expensive (lower that price is outragious) lol lol 6. nightlife\/entertainment; I think they need to get new things to impress the guest, because I wasnt. I didnt let that spoil my visit.overall.. I enjoyed myself, and cant wait to my 50 friends come down to the resort so they can have a awsome time and this awsome resort.
