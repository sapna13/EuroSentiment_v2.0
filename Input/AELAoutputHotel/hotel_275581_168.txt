{"text":"impressed Had a two night stay at this hotel recently and had a very enjoyable stay.The lobby is very spacious with a seating area with free newspapers directly opposite the check in desks. Check in itself was very quick - the staff were very friendly and chatty (and, as is the norm in the UK these days, all were Eastern European).The room itself was a spacious double room. All the usual stuff there - tea\/coffee making facilities, toiletries and sky tv. The view from the bedroom window was typical of London - straight out onto surrounding office blocks. The 4th floor houses the hotel's fitness room, which consisted of three treadmills, two rowing machines and six other cardio machines. If you're into your weights then you'd be dissapointed as there were only two machines and no free weights. But it was quite a well stocked gym - no swimming pool though. Further down the hall (next to the elevators) is a computer with free internet access (I would also add that the room contained WI FI access too).The breakfasts were quite impressive - a choice of continental or cooked. The usual continental choice was laid out for you to choose whereas the staff would take your order for your cooked. The only negative I found was the wait to be seated - when we turned up at 0730 - 0800 the queues were long. I can't comment on evening meals, but the bar was ok - bit pricey but relaxed enough.Location wise it's about two blocks from Westminster away from the city centre - it's situated in a business area with only 1 pub nearby. Having said that, a short cab ride away you will find all the usual London attractions.A great hotel I would stay in again if I was in London for business (and I wasn't paying!). It was primarily occupied by business types and the prices reflected that. If I was to come back to London on pleasure I would probably look for alternative accommodation. Having said that I was impressed. ","annotations":[]}
