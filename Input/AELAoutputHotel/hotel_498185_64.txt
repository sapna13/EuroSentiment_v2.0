{"text":"Stylish but inconsistant service This hotel is located on the Gran Via, a very busy street in the centre of Madrid, bordering on the lively district of Chueca and a few minutes walk away from Sol.The hotel itself was furnished tastefully in a minimal style. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ facilities included a bar, restaurant, library with two computers with internet access, a spa and rooftop terrace. The whole hotel was air conditioned, making it a pleasant place to spend time in the summer.The people on reception were very welcoming and friendly and a porter was available to take our bags. Unfortunately, we weren't able to say the same of the people at the spa, where we received a telling off for not reserving, due to the space restrictions, despite it being empty and being told by reception to just pop down when we wanted. It seemed like the spa and the hotel were at odds with eachother. After our bad start, it seemed as if our lack of advance notice was being punished by the cold shoulder. We weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ shown what each of the spa facilities were for, how they should be used, that water and herbal tea was available, the sauna was switched off and despite being told by the reception that bathrobes were available, we received none, although there were towels in the lockers. The spa area itself consisted of a small pool with spa, shower, mist shower, plunge pool, Turkish bath and sauna. There where also loungers, which could be sectioned off using curtain screens. The curtains were also used to section off an area for beauty treatments\/massages but unfortunately this also screens off one of the showers, rendering it out of use.The roof terrace was pleasant, although suffered from another bad tempered bar person and we left after one drink.Although we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat there for a main meal, we did have breakfast on one day, at a cost of 14Euros. The breakfast was buffet style with a wide variety of options, including, cooked food, cured and cooked hams and cheeses, cereals, sweet food. We booked a superior room, which was pleasant with a huge and comfortable double bed, sofa, foot stool, desk, CD player, plasma TV, very efficient air con, minibar and snacks. There was a pillow menu but no sign of the CD library that had been advertised. The TV had a few american channels and a number of pay per view channels. The room was very quiet and I could not hear any other guests or traffic noise inside. The balcony was very large but strangely only had one deckchair and a table and due to its location was quite noisy - although a quiet balcony would be difficult to find in Madrid!. Overall, this is a good hotel although it sometimes tries too hard to be stylish but forgets some practicalities and has the odd staff member with some customer service issues.
