{"text":"Won't Go Back This resort (Barcelo Hotel Group) is large (5 Hotels) and has many amenities, but this does not make up for the drawbacks. Let me first say that I vacationed at the Palladium in 2007 and loved it so much wanted to go back to Punta Cana. The group I went with wanted to try a different resort for a different experience. One of the largest drawbacks were the rooms. The rooms were run down and in need of some major repairs. The mattresses were worn out and had a mattress pillow covering them to compensate (which didn't help). The rooms were smelly and got worse when the air conditioner was running. We choose to turn it off and open the doors. The mini frig was barely working and was always filled with water from condensation. The bathroom toilet ran constantly and we had to keep giggling the handle to get the tank to refill. On our 3rd day, the hot water tank died and we had to forego showers until later that night when they finally fixed it. The in room coffee maker did not work and I asked the front desk for a replacement with no response. I finally had to chase down the maid and request a replacement. Our friends did the same with their in room iron - I finally gave them ours. Next was the food. The buffet was about 1\/3 of the size of the Pallaidum's and was the same everyday. The menu seemed to be island cuisine. Two out of group were sick (stomach problems) by the second day. Since their buffet is an open air style room - we were visited each meal by the local birds flying above and landing on the buffet tables and eating what they wanted. The staff seemed okay with this and didn't bother to get rid of them. At one meal - a bird landed on a lady's plate that she had set downt on the table so she could go get her juice. This totaly turned us off the food buffet. We tried a couple of the other resturants (Italian\/Mexican\/Seafood) and the food was tolerable. I didn't find the entertainment staff to be as active or inviting as the Pallaidum either. The scheduled events never seemed to be happening as the schedule stated. We also questioned the large amounts of security roaming the buidlings at night. Our building had 2 to 4 guards roaming all night long, constantly talking and keeping you awake (if you leave the sliders open for air). The redeeming qualities were the beach and casino. We will go back to Punta Cana, but not this resort chain.
