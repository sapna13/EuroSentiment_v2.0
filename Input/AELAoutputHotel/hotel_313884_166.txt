{"text":"Wonderful...AGAIN.. We stayed at the punta cana for 2 weeks again this year. Still a wonderful place. After contacting the hotel direct, i asked if we could have the same room as last year, we got next door !! thats not bad is it. we stayed in block 5000. this year it was a little on the noisy side, there was a beach party going on from around 10pm till midnight over at the mare nostrum restaurant that wasnt active last year, its not to noisy, but they have also built another hotel next to the punta that has discos till around 1am. so if your a light sleeper, try to get rooms in blocks 2000 or 3000. again the staff were fab, nothing was to little or to much for them. i firmly believe in the chuck a buck approach. if they do something out of their way for you, a dollar tip will make your stay special. Food was again excellent, ricardos coco locos are out of this world, and a big hand for the pool guy who works is socks of to keep the place tidy. Also a special thanks go,es to the lady doctor on site who looked after my g\/f when she got an ear infection. Would i go there again ?? prehaps not for a 3rd time. maybe we would move down to the bavaro princess if we went back, just for that extra bit of luxury. But if its your first time on that coast,and like things not TOO quite, you,ll love it.steve and sarahwales ","annotations":[]}
