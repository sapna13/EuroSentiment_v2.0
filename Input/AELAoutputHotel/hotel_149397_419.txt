{"text":"mixedfeelings Me (34) and my husband stayed from 14 untill 25th of December at the Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort.Room was fine and clean, not even 1 minute walk from the pool and beach. Mainly stayed at the beach which was lovely and not to busy, pool area was nice but every afternoon too much loud dance music, a bit of music is nice but this was just too much (even for a girl who so now and then likes to party).They also come on the beach or hotel lobby with a little monkey, parrots etc to make pictures which you can buy later, PLS do NOT do this, these animals should not be used for silly things like this! Also ignore the men in the lobby who tell you you can book your holiday cheaper and they just want 5 minutes of your time.It costed us 2 hours and all they want is to sell you a holidayplan for the next 30 years! Gardens are gorgeous so nice to walk around, the little trains come very regular and you do not feel you are in such a big resort.Buffet was fine but not special, a lot of the food was lukewarm. We went once to the Italian and once to the Asian restaurant were on both occasions we had our starter, maincourse and dessert within 25 minutes! Food in the Italian restuarant was very tasteless and stay away from the red and white wines.Only the seafood restaurant was a safe option.We booked twice for Cafe Del Mar (you have to pay extra) and this was very nice, a gorgeous ambiance (on the beach) , good food and the nicest staff ever.If you like the nightlife do not go to this hotel, the lobby\/bar area is very boring and there is no fun to find in the evenings.If you want sun, a nice beach, do not expect to much from the food and like to go to bed early than this is your place to be!For all the others go somewere else.
