{"text":"A wonderful stay in a true gem! Just spent a fantastic 3 nights at Hotel Roemer. We know Amsterdam quite well and chose the hotel because the location is central (2 minutes from Leidseplein, and the upmarket shops in Pieter C Hooftstraat) yet really quiet, on a virtually traffic free sidestreet. Although it cost slightly more than we usually spend on a long weekend away, the hotel was well worth the money and didn't disappoint in any way. Our room was not huge, but as others have mentioned the big comfy bed, deep jacuzzi bath and rainfall shower really make this a 5 star experience, and I could easily become addicted to having a flat screen TV by the bath as well as 2 in the bedroom! The bar manages to be both 'designer' stylish and totally relaxing, with its fire and sofas to sink into, and there is a beautiful courtyard garden (rare in Amsterdam!) with the sort of seating which is perfect for lounging in with a drink and catching the early evening sun. Being just around the corner from the Vondelspark and its beergarten is a bonus too, if you have nice weather. The staff were very welcoming and happy to recommend restaurants etc, tho in the end we used the internet terminals in the lobby to research some excellent local eateries. We didn't choose to have breakfast in the hotel - preferring to wander up to the Spui for the Cafe-Luxembourg-and-weekend-paper option. Also, 20 euro for breakfast seems quite pricy, given that a cafe breakfast can be had for around 10. But, all in all, Hotel Roemer was a little haven of peace and luxury whenever we needed a break from all that sightseeing, shopping and cafe-visiting.
