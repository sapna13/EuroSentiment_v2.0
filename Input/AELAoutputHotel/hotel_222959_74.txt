{"text":"Good stay but Overpriced for what you get I attended a small conference that my company has at this hotel in February. There were aspects of the hotel that I liked a lot, but other that I though were disappointing, especially at such a high end hotel.The hotel had great food- some of the best food that I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe had at a hotel. If you like Mojitos, try them, even if, as to be expected , they are very pricey. The breakfast items at the Nine West restaurant were great, if pretty pricey. Though delicious hash browns and bacon are a bargain at $8, their delicious orange juice was $6 a glass!Service, as to be expected, was very good at the Ritz CarltonThe hotel was very cheerful and the rooms were quite large, especially for New York City.. I prefer a sleek model design, when it comes to d√ã√\u2022√ñcor, and the furnishings at this Ritz Carlton, reminded me of staying with a wealthy older relative with slightly old fashioned tastes.The gym was adequate (it had nice views on the 14th floor). But is did not compare to the gyms I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe used at the Four Seasons and Park Hyatt hotels. Even some Westins and Hyatts I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe stayed in have had better hotels. There is also no pool, which is surprising at a high-end hotel such as this.The location of the hotel, way downtown as far as you can go can be seen as a plus or a minus. It is somewhat isolated and is probably quite inconvenient if you want to spend most of you time in midtown. However, we were holding a conference and the isolation worked to our advantage since there were fewer outside distractions. On the plus side, there is also a subway stop, two streets away, and the hotel is next to a beautiful waterfront promenade that is great for strolling and running.One of the things that bothered me most about the hotel is that I was put in a handicapped room (the bathroom did not have a seeperate shower stall like most of the rooms in the hotel). I wish they had told me that and given me the opportunity to wait for another room.I might stay here again for a business event, but overall I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think it is great value for the money.
