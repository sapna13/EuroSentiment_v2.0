{"text":"Prince in name but certainly not fit for one! All I can say is the Tripadvisor does a great public service in providing a voice for people to advise others on hotels like these. And as regards listing the flaws with the Shinjuku Prince, where do I start? Basically, I chose this hotel because I thought we were getting some sort of an upgrade which we paid more for, the 'renewer room B' I believe it was called. But the room was so small it was incredible; there was hardly enough space for the tiny bathroom and double bed within it. I know rooms are small in Tokyo but I should mention that we also stayed at another hotel in Roppongi for the same price and the room was literally twice the size. The pillows had this foul odour akin to dirty laundry, and there was dust everywhere. Furthermore, unlike most hotels, we were unable to adjust the temperature in the room. It was either too hot or too cold. And the ventilation was appalling.To top it all off they charged us into the hotel bar despite the fact that we were residents!! We decided we'd go for one drink at 6pm on a Sunday evening to the empty Fuga Bar on top and we paid 500 yen (about √à√\u2020√ü?.50 or $5) admission. I showed my resident card to the barman but he politely explained that the charge still applied.There were some positives such as a good location, friendly staff and a good view, but apart from this stay miles away from the overpriced and undersized Shinjuku Prince.
