{"text":"Nice Vacation, Great Value, Had a Good Time My husband, 14 yr old daughter and I stayed at the LTI the last week in June. We got a really good last minute deal and the price was right. The weather was great the entire week we were there. It rained only at night so it didn't bother us. One night there was a terrific thunder and lightning storm which we heard was very unusual. Arrival: We were able to check in quickly and smoothly. Our luggage arrived in our room about 10 minutes after we did. I too had read the previous travelers' reviews and was a little bit worried about certain experiences they had. I followed someone's advice and sent a fax a few weeks before our arrival requesting either Building #4 or #5. We got building # 5, third floor with an ocean view! Another surprise was the plate of fresh fruit and place setting for two along with a small complimentary bottle of Rum waiting in our room when we got there! (Maybe they thought I was a travel agent?) The room was nice and they had also set up an additional bed for us for my daughter! So our welcome was first rate and we were impressed. The AC was also on when we got there. Restaurants: Once you got used to the various dishes being served at the buffet, we could find something we liked. The Oriental Stir Fry station at dinner was very good and the Omelet station for breakfast was also very good. There were plenty of pastries and fruit to pick from. Their cold cuts are different and so are their hot dogs. At lunch we ate at the poolside restaurant\/grill. The chicken is great! It is like a rotisserie chicken seasoned really well. They serve hamburgers and French fries there all day long too. There is no problem booking a reservation at the two specialty restaurants each morning at breakfast. We liked both the Italian one where they had a nice lasagna and good pizza and the Seafood restaurant which was air-conditioned and offered a really good seafood soup or French onion soup as an appetizer! Activities: We did a little bit of snorkeling on the beach and saw some neat fish. The animation team is very energetic and do their best at trying to get people involved in activities and games. They work long and hard hours. We played BINGO at the pool and won a bottle of rum! The nightly entertainment is ok. A few of the shows were really good including the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢ichael Jackson√à√\u2020\u2022?show and the magic show. If you tip the waiters at the Theater they will come back and take care of you all night. After the show they serve some pretty good sandwich snacks at the Calypso Bar right next door.My daughter and I took the Tropical Storm catamaran trip off the beach which I HIGHLY recommend to anyone. It was awesome. You can book it at the Dive Shop on the beach it costs about $84 if you pay cash, more if by credit card. It was well worth it. They feed you on the boat and provide you with drinks after you are done snorkeling. The fish we saw were amazing, all colors and we were able to feed them right out of our hands!Other: The pillows are flat, lumpy etc. and we asked our maid the 2nd day for 3 extra pillows which helped.The grounds are beautiful, vegetation is mature, the pools are nice and the beach is great too. Very soft sand, no shells. Bring bug spray! I was bitten every night at the theater by something which left painful itchy welts which lasted a few days. You can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hear, see or feel the insects\/bugs but you see the bites the next day. They might even be spider bites!?Apparently on the weekends many local natives come and stay at the LTI √à√\u2020\u2022?usually beginning on Friday √à√\u2020\u2022?leaving on Sunday. They arrive en-masse and take over the place. The pool\/Jacuzzi become packed. This we found to be very annoying as they are loud and have tons of little kids. I think they get a really good special weekend rate or something. Other than this, we would have given this place a 4.5 point rating for the value but we were so annoyed that we will give it a 4 point rating.
