{"text":"Time to knock the Macao down and start again Let me start off by saying that I am a Riu fan. Have been for years, and quite frankly, I am loathe to stay at other hotel chains. My view is, better the devil you know,...So, from December 10th to December 18th, we booked to go to the Macao.But let's face it. The Macao is not a palace. It is in need of a significant facelift and an upgrade. Other people have detailed problems with elevators and so on. All things said are true. They were happening in early December, and I've read that they carried on into the New Year. We've stayed in many Riu's, from Mexico to the DR etc, and even the Classic or Club hotels are better than the Macao. It just doesn't seem to fit the current Riu business model. Don't get me wrong, there's really nothing wrong with the food, or the service. But the hotel building itself? Well, it sucks.You will see reviews on here that will leave you totally confused. Some people hate it, others love it. So I will explain.If you are looking for a quiet relaxing holiday, with no party people around, go to the Macao. If on the other hand, you want to have some fun, stay away. Or better yet, go to the Riu Punta Cana Palace next door. We moved there after a few days and had the real Riu experience that we were looking for, and have come to expect from Riu.Would I go back to the Macao? No way. Would I go back to the Punta Cana Palace? In a heartbeat!
