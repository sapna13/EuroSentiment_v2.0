{"text":"Designer chic with a heart The Bale; what can you write about a hotel that goes out of their way to give you the most personalized holiday you could dream of. Nothing was too much trouble. We arrived with high expectations and were not disappointed. The minimalist architecture felt a little to minimalist but the staff really seamed happy to be working there and this provided the warmth that the buildings lacked. The professionalism was first class and the Villas are designed to provide a small private piece of paradise. The food really is as good as all the guide books say but without all the pretension of a 5 star restaurant. The Bale also has a beach area. There is a courtesy car that will take you whenever you want, walk (15 mins) or just borrow a mountain bike. The team at the Bale arranged a mountain bike trip for us that was exactly to our requests and also provided information about their favorites beaches that were on the route. Many of these were not on the tourist maps.This is a place of relaxation and peace, if you want a night life then make use of the car service and take a trip to Kuta. The major hotels are all located down the road and have a restaurant area. This is not 5 star eating but mass production restaurants that serve nice food at expensive prices. It is however packed with all the shops you could want so is an alternative way to spend an evening there.Having been to both Nusa Dua and the Kuta area I would return to the Bale without hesitation and travel to Kuta in the evenings. The service of the hotel truly deserves it's reputation as one of the small leading hotels in the world!
