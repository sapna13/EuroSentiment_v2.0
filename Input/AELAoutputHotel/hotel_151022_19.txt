{"text":"Paradise Found! Paradise Found!! For many years we had been going to an European Resort near Tulum, Mexico which was sold a few years ago and closed a couple of years ago. We especially liked that resort because of its √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬®ustic√à√\u2020\u2022?feel and the blend of nationalities and cultures. We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been looking for a replacement and finally found it at Natura Park in Punta Cana.It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ been a few months since we visited and we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been looking at some of the comments since we got back and wanted to give you our comments. We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been to numerous all inclusive resorts all over the Caribbean, Mexico and as far away as Bora Bora.We had a fantastic vacation at Natura Park. Along with some Americans and Canadians, we met guests from South America, Spain, Tenerife, Italy, France, England and a whole bunch from Russia √à√\u2020\u2022?yes, they have a jumbo jet that comes from Moscow each week.Prior to our visit we had read many reviews and we were not sure what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised. The resort is somewhat typical in layout where there is plenty of space. The main building with reception, main restaurant, lobby bar, shops and entertainment is located someway from the beach. At the beach is another restaurant that serves lunch and becomes the seafood specialty restaurant in the evening. There is also a snack bar, beach bar, swim up pool bar and all the sports activities. The rooms are located on each side of the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âorridor√à√\u2020\u2022?between the main building and the beach in 2 and 3-story buildings. However, what√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ really unique and charming are the gardens and ponds in this central corridor. The vegetation is truly tropical and there are bridges over the streams and ponds. There is fish and lots of wildlife √à√\u2020\u2022?flamingos, geese, ducks, peacocks, etc. They stock the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°eed boxes√à√\u2020\u2022?daily with stale bread and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ fun to get them eating out of your hands!!We found the food to be excellent and plentiful. The main restaurant is buffet style and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. There were plenty of meat dishes, fish, vegetarian and a wellness station. And of course, plenty of deserts, fruit and my favorite √à√\u2020\u2022?cheese. Their blue cheese was unbelievable. The beach restaurant has a varied selection for lunch and from time to time they have cookouts on the pool patio. Their paella is unbelievable!! There is plenty of selection and you can √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Øix and match√à√\u2020\u2022?if you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ find something you like √à√\u2020\u2022?pick something you like from the hot plates and have the pasta chef mix it with marinara sauce over a selection of noodles. Or, have the omelet chef fix you an egg white omelet for breakfast (Andreana is an awesome omelet cook!). We read some of the food critics and wonder why they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ask someone to fix something they like!! All you need is a little creativity. They have 3 specialty restaurants √à√\u2020\u2022?steak, seafood and Italian. We ate at all 3 and the service and food was great. Helped in no small part by plenty of vino!!All the staff was wonderful and most helpful. Bring a handful of dollar bills. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ amazing what a couple of dollars here and there will do. We had one waiter, his name was Daris, and we seemed to end up on one of his tables a number of times √à√\u2020\u2022?he was unbelievable in his level of service.Our room was nice and the air conditioning was good. The shower was fine with plenty of hot water. Again, a couple of dollars to the room maid and we never wanted for bottles of water and the refrigerator always had plenty of beer!!Now we should not forget the best part √à√\u2020\u2022?the beach. Imagine as you look at the ocean, there are a few hotels to your right but they do not spend much time √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬Æalking the beach√à√\u2020\u2022? To your left is nothing √à√\u2020\u2022?just miles of beach with no buildings because it is an eco park. We love walking the beach morning and afternoon so we could walk for a couple of hours and meet just a handful of people. Yes, there is some seaweed but what can you expect when you are by the ocean. However, their team of beach guys does a great job of clearing it early in the day and they keep it that way throughout the day.All in all a great vacation. We will be back √à√\u2020\u2022?that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a promise!! Paradise found!!
