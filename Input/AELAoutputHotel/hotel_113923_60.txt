{"text":"excellent-- If you can sleep through intermittent thunderous traffic My room was pleasant, extremely clean, and I really liked the comfortable bed and the selection of pillows. The Japanese touches in the room, especially the bathroom, were fun. The staff was efficient and friendly and the location was good. The room rates were reasonable and the free Internet was a nice perk. BUT-- my room, for five nights, faced Post street. Every few minutes, I could hear loud thunderous roar caused by trucks straining their way uphill. The noise was especially bothersome after 5 in the morning. I don't understand why they haven't installed soundproof windows. The loud noises marred an otherwise wonderful stay.There is a restaurant inside that seemed to be good but I didn't have a chance to eat there. There is also an exercise room. If you can handle public transportation (why not, this is San Francisco), buses costing $1.50 run up and down Geary very frequently (right behind the hotel). So you can avoid taking taxis for many simple trips, especially during working hours.A variety of fine and not-so-fine Japanese and Asian restaurants are nearby. But no Starbucks or similar cafe was visible within walking distance. It was amusing to see a Denny's in Japantown, two blocks from the hotel. On the last day, I noticed a Peet's Coffee sign in themovie theater window a couple of blocks away.Aside from the disturbing intermittent traffic noise, Hotel Kabuki seemed to be a fine place. I would definitely stay there again if they renovate their windows (or if I can get some efficient earplugs).
