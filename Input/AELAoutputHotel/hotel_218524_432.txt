{"text":"Relaxing Vacation! The only bad thing about Excellence Punta Cana was leaving. Other reviews that may seem negative are way off base and going with a positive attitude makes all the difference in the world. The people employed at the resort are friendly, hard-working and always willing to please. The food was great, in my opinion (and my husband's), and the pizza by the pool was awesome. For those of you who love beef, I would recommend the Chateau Briande (sp?) at Chez Isabelle. I recommend going to dinner between 6:00 and 6:30 in order to get in right away. Drinks are also top notch and flow freely (thanks Juan and Felix!). The drink of the day is always interesting to try. Some people have complained about the beds, but from two people who have back issues, we found them a bit firm, but fine. It's not like you have to live there and sleep on them forever. Our room was beautiful (3rd floor with an ocean view and vaulted ceilings) and always cleaned within a reasonable amount of time. If there is something you need, just write a note and they will get it for you. The resort grounds are downright gorgeous and not so huge that walking was a pain. We only had rain showers twice during the week and they only lasted 10 minutes each. In the end, I would definitely go to Excellence Punta Cana again and May seemed to be the perfect time because the resort was not full and we didn't really have to wait in line for anything. Just some advice: when you pack, take a good look at your suitcase and then take half of your clothes out because you will likely be on the beach or in the pool all week. Also, put your sunscreen in your bag and then take twice as much (it cost us $23.00 for a medium sized bottle on the resort. Yikes!). Take lots of one dollar bills for tips that are most certainly deserved. This trip was definitley a do-over!
