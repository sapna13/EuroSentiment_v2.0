{"text":"Horrible, incorrigible, the worst experience ever! Me and my colleagues were holding a event at Swissotel over the weekend and stayed in their club rooms.The experience has been so terrible I don't know where to start.First from the check-in. We were told early check-in at 8am was available a day before we arrived and when we arrived, we were told that there are no rooms available after lunch. The worst thing was I saw them checking in another couple to the club room and when asked, they said they had no king rooms, only twin rooms. But my colleague had booked a twin room! Next, we had boxes of collaterals that we had left with the hotel. On Monday morning, they told us they couldn't find it. This meant that we had to go for our meetings without the collaterals. On the same day, DHL delivered 3 more boxes to us. The hotel staff could only find box 1 and could not find the other 3 boxes. Concierge and reception just kept pushing us to the other section and the boxes were only found the next morning!Now to the rooms, our keys had to be changed so many times because they were not working. My key had to be changed a total of 5 times! And when I went into the room in the evening, the carpet was soaked wet at the area inside the door. And the best part of it all was that when we complained to their operations manager on duty, all he could say was we apologise and we'll look into it in a most nonchalent manner without offering to make any form of compensation. We totally can't believe the attitude of this hotel especially when we're giving them business in the form of a conference and guests who booked the hotel due to the conference.We're not unreasonable people and we can understand that sometimes there are slip-ups. But the bad attitude of the staff and manager is completely inexcusable.This is absolutely the worst experience I've ever had with a hotel and they can be sure we're never going back. For the price you pay, I suggest you go over to other hotels within the vacinity that would most probably be tons better than this!
