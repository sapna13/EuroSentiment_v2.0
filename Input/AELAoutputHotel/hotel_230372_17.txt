{"text":"Dishonest hotel There are much better hotels for better deals out there. Don't stay here.Biggest problems: hidden charges, combined with a very rude front desk. You think you get a good deal, but then you find that they will charge you for things which they never disclosed upfront. And no air conditioning.For example, I know some hotels charge for local calls, many don't, so before placing a call, I went through the which their in-room hotel information which tells you all about how to dial an outside line and place calls, and it does not list any charges or fees for such calls. I was shocked upon checkout, when I found a huge bill for the local phone calls I made. I wouldn't have dialed them had I known they would charge me such ghastly amounts! When I asked for an explanation, or to see the hotel fees in writing, the rude retort I recieved was We are in Germany, Not America. We don't have to disclose our fees. Now pay or I will call the police.Anyhow, it felt very underhanded, luring people into services and then charging them fees that were undisclosed beforehand, and then their attitude about about what they did was OK. They brag about being 4 star, but are far from it. NO AIRCONDITIONING. I had to choose between stifing heat or opening my windows for everyone to peer in and for mosquitos to fly in and have a feast. The rooms are small and cramped, the showers don't even have a full shower curtain- the bathroom was soaked after my shower. ","annotations":[]}
