{"text":"Perfect Location! I'd really put some hours into looking for a great place to stay....and found it! Personally we wanted somewhere which was not too far away from the vibey areas, easy to get to, safe and relatively quiet (we appreciate good sleep!). After being warned about taxis charging dearly we opted for the cheaper option of getting the train from Schiphol airport to the central train station. We then bought tickets for the tram (really cheap and easy!) and arrived at our destination stress free. It was a couple of minutes walk to the hotel from our tram stop. Yes the steps are steep to the hotel and the rooms are tiny but we'd expected that judging by other comments. What we loved was the friendliness of the hotel staff, the cleanliness of the rooms, the INCREDIBLE shower, the great breakfast (lots of it...and very nice coffee!!) the quietness of the rooms (we were at the back of the hotel on the top floor which probably helped) and the generally nice and peaceful situation. It was a 5 minute walk to the very cool Leidseplein. Enjoyed many a great cocktail at the Cafe Americain (beautiful art deco). Lots of great restaurants and bars on your doorstep. We didn't always take the tram as it was so easy to walk around Amsterdam. You could be in the red light district within 20-30 mins. Although we loved walking around the rest of Amsterdam we were glad of the location of our hotel. A very welcome place to stay. Well done!
