{"text":"Totally lived up to our expectations What an excellent hotel! - from the moment we arrived, the staff couldn't do enough for you. We were lucky enough to get a room with a balcony (ask for a high floor so you can get the best view of La Rambla and beyond) and it was luxuriously appointed with a Jacuzzi bath, adjustable beds, mini bar and a sound system. Towelling robes and slippers are also provided for guests comfort, and the bathrooms have hairdryers and a good range of complimentary toiletries.The sheets and towels are changed daily, and although the rate I got did not include breakfast my friend and I decided to treat ourselves;at 9 euros each it was plentiful, delicious and well worth the money.I was sceptical before arriving about the hotel's claim that the rooms were virtually soundproof - being that the hotel is situated on the busiest thoroughfare in Barcelona, but this is certainly the case.I would recommend that even if your room is not on the top floor you should take the lift to the 5th floor and walk up the short flight of stairs to the roof terrace - the views in all directions are stunning.I'm going back to the hotel next year with a larger group of friends,and although you can find cheaper accommodation in the city I feel its certainly worth the extra to stay at the Montecarlo.If you only have a short time to spend in City, I would thoroughly recommend you visit the Sagrada Familia - it's quite simply breathtaking. Also, on the far side of the Plaza de Catalunia is a street called the Passieg de Gracia - the shops are fabulous, and you can see two of Gaudi's famous landmark buildings ( La Pedrera and Casa Batllo). Enjoy!!
