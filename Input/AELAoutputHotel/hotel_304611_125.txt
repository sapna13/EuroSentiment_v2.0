{"text":"Location Location Location Royal Plaza on Scotts in centrally located to everything you need in Singapore. Orchard Road is about a 2 minute walk, and most shopping centres are within walking distance. When we arrived the receptionist asked us if we wanted to upgrade our room for an extra S$30 per night, which included a bigger suite, free mini bar, and breakfast. We went for the upgrade and weren't disappointed. The suite was a good size, the breakfast was excellent, and the free mini bar was well utilized!The concierge were really helpful. They responded to our every request, no matter how obscure. Nothing was a problem for these guys. We saw an advertisement for a theatre production of The King  I, and asked concierge if they could give us some information about it. No problem at all, they downloaded all the info from the internet, then gave me exact instructions on where the nearest booking agent was located. One day we even asked them where a pet shop was so we could buy a goldfish for our friends fish pond, and they gave us a number of pet shop locations.One word of warning for smokers though - the Royal Plaza is a 100% non-smoking hotel. If you light up inside the hotel they will give you a S$300 cleaning bill. This was not an issue for us as we are non-smokers, however this was not pointed out to us when we made the booking.I would highly recommend the Royal Plaza on Scotts, and would definitely stay there again.
