{"text":"Great Location, Great Hotel My partner and I stayed at the Sofitel in December of 2007 for 3 nights. This was our first time to New York and the first time staying in a Sofitel and it was a really great experience.The hotel is in a fantastic location; just a very short walk away from the bright lights, shops and restaurants of Times Square. We also found Macy's and The Rock a very short walk away. 5th Avenue was a little bit more of a hike but we managed it without having to break out into too much of a sweat and sometimes treated ourselves to a very cheap taxi back to the hotel after a day of non-stop shopping! The hotel although right in the middle of everything, was down a very quiet street. We loved coming back to the hotel and being greated by the cheerful and welcoming staff at the front door.We went for one of the cheaper rooms (although still quite expensive). These rooms were only mean't to be on the very low floors of the hotel but we emailed the hotel ahead of our journey and asked if we could have our room as high up as possible for a nice view, and they definately delivered! The room itself was a lovely size with and the bed that was so comfortable we wanted to take home with us. There was also a really huge LCD TV in the room and I found it very difficult to get my partner away from the TV and out onto the streets of NY. The bathrooms were gorgeous as well and the whole room was extremely clean. We had room service on our first night at the hotel and really enjoyed the food - although because of the location of the hotel we found it very easy to venture out for a delicious dinner.All in all we thought the Sofitel was a great hotel and we loved how convenient it was to get to all the location attractions. When we go back to New York we will probably be staying at this hotel again.
