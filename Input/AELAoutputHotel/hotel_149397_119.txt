{"text":"Awesome Resort!!! We stayed at Bavaro Princess in Punta Cana March 8-15. There is not one bad thing i could even think of to say about this resort. My husband and i loved it. The staff is amazing! Service with a smile. Everyone is so friendly and they do whatever they can to make you happy. The grounds are beautiful..breathtaking.. It is huge and lush. peacocks, flamingoes, geese, mallards, roosters just walking around, it was great. i was a little worried because i did read some bad reviews, but i do believe that those people who complain, really would complain about anything. ignore the bad reviews. My husband and i went for our honeymoon, we are both 30 and from Minneapolis. The beach is great, the beach boys are hilarious, the drinks are awesome, and strong. i do tip tho. not for everysingle drink, but a dollar here and there so my drinks were strong and great! the Banana Mama is YUM! we drank those and rum and diet all week. The food was good. some things we stayed away from but everything we thought was good. once you learn what to stay away from its easy. we ate all the restaurants except the pasta one. At El Goucho get the sirloin, its great, my husband got the lamb, and it was not good. At the seafood restaurant we both got the surf and turf and that was really good. we ate at Chopin twice once for our honeymoon dinner and they had a great filet with mushroom sauce and another time, it was for AppleVacations and they had a buffet, and that too was great. The breakfasts at both buffets are great. El Goucho is a buffet for breakfast and lunch. The omelettes are great, ate them everyday and the fresh fruit is excellent. We did tip the omelette guy and he stuffed our omelettes full!! Our room was my the beach, building 34, room 343. Never once saw a cock roach and i was expecting too. Saw a little spot of mold but not a big deal.. our room was not musty smelling at all. we loved it. it was so clean. Our view was beautiful. Not an ocean view,but the grounds are just so spectacular. very tropical. I did come home with bug bites, Misquitos are in Punta Cana and you know what? they are in Minneapolis too!! I always get bit alot by misquitoes for some reason no matter where i am, my husband never once got bit!Never had a problem communicating with anyone in the staff. everyone spoke english. Just know how to say some things in spanish, like hi, please, thank you. One thing, no clocks anywhere in the resort, so if you like to know what time it is, bring a watch. We didn't bring a watch and never knew what time it was, always had to ask someone or call the front desk. I did notice that the staff likes to joke around, so have a sence of humor, dont be so uptight and please do not be rude to these people. they work their butts off. Did i mention how clean it was there?? i am a clean freak and i could not complain. Never saw dirt. Like people have said before, some people just like to complain, for those people maybe they should perhaps just stay home because no one would even want to be around them. I HATE people who complain, complain complain... Stay home!!!!We did the zipline excursion as well, what a blast.!! You go into the mountains and you see alot of things you would on the Safari Tour. so if you do the zipline, you dont need to do the Safari Tour. You take the same route, and your tour guide shows you alot. On the way home, we stopped by where Maria makes her coffee and you can buy it for $5. i bought some and its great!Enjoy your stay here. I would recommend this resort to everyone and when we go back to Punta Cana, we will stay at Bavaro Princess!
