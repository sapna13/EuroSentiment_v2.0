{"text":"will recommend Our stay at this resort is a result of an exchange via RCI. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Lobby had a computer which we could use to check email or surf the internet. Coffee is served every morning. Pool is small but during our stay there we never seem to see more than a couple of people swimming. Chairs and recliners around the pool make a good relaxing place to relax and read a book. You can even borrow some chairs and floats to take to the beach.Parking is the worst part. Be ready to pay $18\/day. Tiny spaces so if you have a big car or truck...good luck trying to make it fit! Only a few spaces available on site but you can park at the covered garage across the street for the same price. We parked across the street and it may be a better deal if you don't mind the walk. Parking is plentyful and covered. We had a one bedroom and a living room that faces the pool. The rooms were clean. The bed was quite comfortable although it may need to be changed soon as it is starting to sag towards the middle. The bathrooms are small but clean and shower area tiny. A\/C had no problem cooling the rooms, 1 in the bedroom and 1 in the kitchen\/dining\/living room area. The freezer in our ref had a big gash\/hole on it but didn't have a problem freezing the water in our water bottles.Location I believe is the best part. Walking distance to the beach, International Market, Starbucks, Jack in the Box, Mc Donald's, IHOP, Denny's and other local restaurants.
