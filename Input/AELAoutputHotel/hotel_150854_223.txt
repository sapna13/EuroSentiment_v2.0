{"text":"Thank You! We are a couple that are 49 y.o. , we have travelled through the caribean for the past decade and find that punta cana is our favourite destination, we are average working people who look forward to our travel vacation at least once a year, sometimes twice, finances allowing..lol....we love the beach and a good all inclusive,enough about us . The RIU Palace Macao is a top notch resort, they cater too the client.,period. First, the check-in was the best . What they did was take us of the bus , sit us in the lobby bar , order us a drink (i had a Barcelo Imperial on the rocks my wife had a mojito) nice touch ,we signed our guest cards ,they gave us a quick rundown on the resort,. They asked who has been to Punta Cana , How many times ? If you raised your hand after 2 times you had a bottle of champagne sent to your room, we answered after 5 times ,we also got a bottle of rum.we are looking at each other ,and saying we like this place... they give us our keys .We go to our room , it was nice , 2 double beds joined together under 1 headboard made it look like a supersized king bed .Clean ! the fridge was well stocked and well kept during our stay. The Bar was well stocked, but we never used it ,drank enough away from the room ...lol..The beach...what can i say ...the best! The Bars Fantastic! we like to test the bartenmders to make a specialty drink and they passed with flying colours ...kudos!the Restuarants ,we did only one a la carte, the steakhouse , it was great . cooked to perfection medium rare , we had dinner with friends .all were happy!, The rest of the dinners were at the buffet(ps to the men long pants required everywhere for dinner ...no problem) the food was fantastic ,i read complaints here about the food (21 yr olds ..kids this is not taco bell or kfc...lol) if you have a problem with caviar and filet mignon and fine food ,DONT COME HERE!...lol!Overall we loved it! IT WAS FANTASTIC! and if RIU mgmt is reading this A HEARTFELT THANK YOU! KUDOS!
