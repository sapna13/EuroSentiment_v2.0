{"text":"perfect in all ways This was my forth trip to Paris and my first with my grown-up Son. I am a confirmed 2 star traveller when it comes to hotel choices. My preference is to stay in neighborhoods where I can experience the day-to-day life with locals more than tourists. I chose this hotel based primarily on Trip Advisor reviews, photos at the web site and its location and I was not disappointed. The hotel itself is on a Boulevard which means a wide street with lots of trees and benches to sit on. It was busy with traffic, of course, but not overwhelmingly so and nighttime was quiet. There are lot of restaurants both in the neighborhood and within walking distance. The Metro stop is 500 feet away and Place d'Italie is right down the street and is a major Metro interchange. The immediate neighborhood is safe and peaceful at night. We walked home at 11:30 from a late night at a cafe and there were couples walking down the street with babies in strollers - very safe! There are lots of different kinds of food shops, and drugstores, and a Monoprix (CVS with clothes) across the street - very convenient, bookstores, newspaper shops, etc., etc. Just down the street are the Rue Monge and Rue Moufftard which are market streets - quite colorful. We watched some local musicians and dancers perform on the way to the Arab Institute - worthy of a visit. Because the hotel is on the edge of the 5th Arr. you can walk to all of the Latin Quarter, along the Seine and even to the Jardins Luxembourg - very pleasant way to spend an afternoon. There are nice walks in other directions as well although we did not have the time to enjoy them.The hotel experience was excellant. The room we had was on the street and reasonably quiet at night even with the double-glazed windows open. We were on the 3rd floor ( there is an elevator) with a nice overview of the street scene. The room was large by european standards, the beds were comfortable and well tended, the bath was clean with newer fixtures, continuous hot water and a real tub - if your so inclined. We enjoy the convenience of breakfast at the hotel and were not disappointed in the quality. Management was friendly and helpful especially with some issues with the WiFi that my son had. And finally the price was reasonable especially given the exchange rate. I will stay at this hotel next time in Paris and I seriously doubt that one could find a better 2 star hotel in the city.
