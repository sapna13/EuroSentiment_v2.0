{"text":"Decent But Nothing Special We stayed at this hotel for 3 days during Dec 2007. The hotel is located across the parking lot from the Estacio Sants, which is a major train station. Getting from the airport to the hotel was simple and inexpensive. Actually, it was free; the 20 minute train ride from the airport to the Sants station was free in both directions when we were there Christmas week.This hotel has about 20 floor and felt more like a business travelers hotel than one for vacationers. The checkin staff was very nice and always willing to help with suggestions or directions. All staffers we met spoke English sufficiently well. We were told we got a courtesy upgrade to a premium room. The room was large and had a desk, a couple of chairs and a spacious bathroom. We wanted a queen or king size bed. What we got was two, not particularly comfortable, single beds pushed together. Nobody like sleeping in the crack between the beds. We had just come from Madrid, where we stayed at the ME Madrid, which had a very comfortable mattress. By comparison, these beds felt like a big step down.The bathroom was clean and large, sporting terrazzo marble. It contained a deep tub, huge walk-in shower, toilet, and bidet. There was an in-room safe which supposedly cost 3 euros a day but we never got charged for using it.The hotel offers wired Internet in the room which can be rented by the hour or day. They also have a business center where they'll let you check email for 5 minute for free. The hotel location was decent. It's not in the center of town but its easy to get around by metro, and there's a stop within a block or so of the hotel. Given the trade offs between quality, price, and location, this felt like a good pick.
