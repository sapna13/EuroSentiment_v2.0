{"text":"Not Bad, not great, nice location The stay at this hotel was only over night for a flight connection the next day. It is a short $10.50US taxi ride from the airport. Check in was easy, staff is helpful. The room was a pool view suit on the ground floor. In general very old and tired looking, warn and stained carpets, but clean otherwise. Entry is into an office\/living area with TV, desk, sofa etc. cable internet hookup worked easily. Sink, coffee maker area. Then the bathroom and closet area in a hallway towards the bedroom. Bathroom supplied with plenty of towels, shampoo, conditioner etc. blow dryer, the usual. Closet had extra pillows, an iron and I don't think it had a safe. Bedroom had a TV and comfy beds with down comforters. Walk to the beach is barely 5 minutes. The beach was mostly deserted in late afternoon, very pretty beach but the small waves looked muddy, maybe recent rains? It looked like you could rent chairs and umbrellas and jet skis at kiosks.Meals at Lupi's, a short walk up the street from the hotel, were wonderful for lunch and dinner and the karaoke was fun to watch.Poolside at the hotel, folks were having fun at the bar, I only tried the Jacuzzi which was barely warm and I was let down by that since I love a good warm Jacuzzi. Air traffic noise was VERY loud pool side, but not to be heard from the rooms.Breakfast buffet was standard fare of decent coffee, rolls, cereals, juices, toast, fruit. This is where you see all the flight crew.Check out easy, no hidden charges, taxi's right outside and ready.On my return trip, I got a MUCH less expensive and MUCH better room at the Radisson using priceline.com ","annotations":[{"endOffset":450,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":444},{"endOffset":1399,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1393},{"endOffset":1430,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1425}]}
