{"text":"Fantastic Adults-Only, All-Inclusive for the money My wife and I were looking for a reasonably priced, all-inclusive get-away for an extended Memorial Day weekend. The Excellence in Punta Cana was just what we needed.The resort itself was beautiful and a real welcome site after the hour long journey from the airport. We were greeted with a warm welcome by the staff and escorted to the hotel club. This was a slight upgrade from basic accomodations and I think it was worth it. Carlos, took our bags to the club consierge and helped the visit off to a great start.Though I only saw Carlos in the mornings, heading to breakfast or the pool, he always greated me by name with a big smile. Everyone on staff greeted us in the halls with Hola, but only Carlos knew us by name every day.The restaurants (7 in all) were wonderful. We really liked Spice, the Asian restaurant, where we had 2 excellent meals and received excellent service from Vincent. The Lobster House disappointed us by burning the grilled lobster. Then again, being from New England, even a perfect Carribean lobster may not have impressed us much.Finally, we can't say enough about the wonderful energy and dedication of Franklin. He seemed to be involved in just about every activity around the resort. Excersize in the morning, language lessons by the pool, volleyball all day long (it seemed) and performances and the dance club at night. We even had a chance to just sit and get to know him a little. He works many hours, for many days and still kept up the energy and enthusiasm to make our stay more enjoyable.We look forward to our next visit to this fantastic resort.
