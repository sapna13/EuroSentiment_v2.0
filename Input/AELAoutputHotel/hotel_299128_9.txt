{"text":"18\/20 for this outstanding resort I always stay in InterContinental or Four Seasons Hotels and this time I decided to give the InterContinental Bali a try since it is known to be one of the most beautiful resorts in Bali. And believe me, it is!I booked directly with the hotel through HotelRooms and I chose a Resort Classic Suite. The hotel offers a welcome and assistance at the airport (free for Club guests). A lady was waiting for me as soon as I got off the plane. I gave her my passport and she stamped it for me. She then escorted me outside the airport where the hotel driver was waiting for me.The resort is 15 minutes from the airport and there was at least 5 people greeting me on my arrival. I was escorted to the Instant Check-in counter and they informed me that I was upgraded to a Duplex suite in the newly renovated area. I arrived at the hotel at 9 am and the staff informed me that my suite would be ready within 30 minutes and I was invited to wait in the Club Lounge even though I didn't book a Club room. Club Lounge:Having visited more than 80 InterContinental properties around the world, this is definitely the triendiest, most beautiful and well equipped Club lounge I know! Nice dark wood and beige colours with indoor and outdoor seating area. Fresh drinks are served all day long (The lounge is open 24hrs\/24) and nice snacks\/canapes. The service is just wonderful.Duplex Suite Singaraja style:80 sqm suite with the bedroom mezzanine style. View on the hotel gardens with partial ocean view. Beautiful beige and dark wood colours with typical balinese furniture. High speed internet access (cabled) and 2 huge plasma screen Tv's in both the living room and the bedroom. Bathroom with bathtub and walk-in shower. Good water pressure and Aveda amenities. Bathroom is fully equipped and each Tv has a dvd player. The resort is huge so consider walking at least 5 minutes from the lobby to the suite!There was a lot of renovation works going on in front of my room and I had difficulties sleeping. I asked the second day to change my room and since the hotel was full I was upgraded to a lovely suite bigger than the one I had; The suite wasn't renovated the Balinese style but was in an excellent condition and ocean front on the ground floor with direct access to the Club pool. Huge private terrasse and jacuzzi in the bathroom.What I loved most in the resort is the private butler service with friendly people that are ready to do anything to get a smile on my face! And believe me, Balinese people are friendly, generous and they make you feel really important....Food  Beverage:Many food outlets in the resort: Japanese gastronomic food (Excellent), Jimabaran Gardens (snacks and pool restaurant that is lovely at night), Italian restaurant (not my favourite) and room service. I usually rarely like the food room service serves but I have tasted the best chicken burger ever at the InterContinental Bali.The resort hosts several events during the week to get adults and children busy everyday (sushi night, Bali dancing night, Fish market visit, etc.)The resort is 20 minutes from the nightlife area of Bali called Kuta and Seminyak. The hotel driver can take you anywhere for 10 USD per hour which is much convenient. Good English spoken throughout the resort and I would definitely recommand anyone who can afford it to book a Club room and take advantage of all the facilities offered: Private Club pool, Inspiration lounge with free dvd, books and computer rentals, club lounge and free airport transfer in a Jaguar, etc.Service a bit slow around the main swimming pool. Outstanding Spa services at the Villa retreat with great therapists and affordable prices compared to Europe (120 USD a 2 hours treatment).I will definitely come back very soon to Bali. The island has a lot to show and staying at the InterContinental Bali was a pleasure.
