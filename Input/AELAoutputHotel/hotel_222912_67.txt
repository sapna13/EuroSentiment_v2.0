{"text":"Great little hotel Just returned from Agora Saint Germain. It is a lovely little hotel in a fantastic location. The rooms and lobby are very clean. I stayed for 4 nights. On my first night, I had a room on the first floor that faced a courtyard. There was no light. I asked to be moved and the next day, a room on the 4th floor with a picturesque view of a church was made available. The room was a bit smaller (hard to imagine since all the rooms are small), but the light and air made all the difference. Waking up to a view outside your window really makes the trip special, notwithstanding the church bells ringing every hour or so.The breakfast does not come with the room. I didn't know that until after the fact. At 11 euros, it is not cheap. There are croissants, bread, cheese, yoghurt, hard-boiled eggs, cereal, juice, coffee. Everything was very good and very fresh. If you don't want to think about breakfast, and money is not an issue, the breakfast is the way to go. Around the corner and in the neighborhood are plenty of places to go for breakfast if you want to venture out.The hotel recommended several good places nearby to dine for dinner. I especially liked the husband\/wife team at La Maree Verte. They don't speak English, but, are lovely hosts. The hotel is undergoing renovation. The hallways are being painted and are a mess. Each weekday morning, plastic is laid down on the carpeted floors and each evening, the plastic is lifted and the floors vacuumed. Even still, there is plaster dust in the halls. The renovations did not interfere with my use of the room. When in Paris, who spends time in their room? If you are someone who hangs around the hotel during the day, you may want to wait a few weeks (until the end of January 2008) to stay in the hotel. Otherwise, I whole-heartedly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a quaint small hotel in a great neighborhood.
