{"text":"Cheesy and a disappointment, not for honeymooners. My husband and I married in Puerto Rico because he is from there and so we elected to honeymoon on the island as well. The first three nights we stayed at a sister hotel to the El Con called the El San Juan Hotel in Isla Verde for the touristy, busy part of our honeymoon...loved it, and will go back. Then we spent 4 nights at the El Conquistador with the Romance Package including airport shuttle, daily breakfast for two, two 50 minute massages, and tax and tariff. good price offered for what we thought would be the luxurious and romantic part of our honeymoon...hated it, will NOT go back.First of all, everyone hit the nail on the head with expensive food costs. The cheapest meal was $45, for a cesear wrap and tuna pita, and water to drink. I agree the food was not anything to remember, not fantastic, nor worth the price. Half the restuarants were closed majority of the time, only one tram worked to get you up and down the resort which made us miss the catamaran multiple times to the beach (supposed to run every half hour but ran every hour). Biggest problem, screaming kids everywhere. The 7 luxurious pools were full of them. This hotel did not bend backwards, forwards or even shuffle a step for guests. It felt like a rip off. Large Dasani bottles of water-$10. No microwave in your room, so if you did have leftovers from your $100 dinner, you couldn't even eat it. The Dance club is only open 3 days of the week, for a place that traps you there, they sure limit your amenity options. The power kepts tripping off for seconds at a time multiple nights the week we were there. The Spa wasn't as clean as it should've been and the massage was not relaxing, very rigid and tacky. Luckily the view from our room was amazing, go for the Ocean View rooms, its breathtaking. Loved the walk in closet, to actually unpack was nice. The safe didn't work and staff never came to assist. Palomino Island, the private beach, was overcrowded with chairs everywhere, the beach and water was SO rocky and filled with coral, so painful on your feet. Plus tons of jellyfish in the water, be careful. If you are hungry, the hamburger was good, but $15. We had a 5 pack of cerveza for $30 and to rent a floatie for the water was $22 a day, and they kick you off the island at 5:30pm. But there were awesome Iquanas wandering around everywhere there.If you wanted to escape with a tour, the kayaking was $88 per person, which was by far the best activity we have ever done in Puerto Rico all the years we have visited, but the dock was a 3 minute bus ride from the hotel. Our friends stayed in San Juan and paid $60 per person for the same tour that drove them the hour drive to the same dock we were already at AND fed them. The El Yunque Rainforest tour for $55 per person was nice, very informative and worth the price. If you want to experience Puerto Rico, don't stay here, go to Isla Verde or San Juan. You will never taste Puerto Rican food at this hotel, nor experience the friendly, vibrant, artistic culture of Puerto Rico. If you are rich, have loud children and want to take them somewhere to dump them at the pool and pay $12 for macaroni and cheese they won't eat, then this is the place for you! Enjoy!
