{"text":"Great deal I stayed at Porta Faenza while attending a conference at the Fortezza da Basso. The choice worked out great.1) Location. It was the closest hotel to the conference site. It was very close to the train and bus station (easy to walk). It was very close to all the major attractions. The restaurant Enzo e Piero on the same block is a good choice for meals. I also found a supermarket about four blocks away.2) Price. Better than the deals the conference had worked out with other hotels and very reasonable even considering I am coming from the US.3) Quiet. The room was very quiet. I heard very little from other rooms (although I may have been lucky with the other guests). I slept very well.4) Clean. Spotless room and they cleaned it very well every day.5) Staff. Very pleasant, helpful, smiling, and all spoke English. 6) Internet access. Wireless access. Just go to the front desk and tell them for how long you need access. They give you a temporary username and password and off you go. No extra charges for this.7) Good breakfast. While there weren't any hot food choices, there were croissants, other breads, four choices of cereal, yogurt, cake (excellent), deli meats, cheese, juice, milk, and a couple of other things I can't remember. And you can get tea or a capuccino, and the lady that services the tables remembers what you like.If you haven't been to Europe much, the room is very small by US standards, the bathroom doesn't have a bath tub (only a shower), there were no drawers, and the closet was very small. But this is not unlike what I have found elsewhere in Europe, especially in a location with older buildings. The bed was actually large.
