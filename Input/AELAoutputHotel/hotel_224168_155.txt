{"text":"Great Stay at the Renaissance. This is definetly one of the nicer, cleaner, and more happening hotels\/areas in Hollywood. To begin, the Renaissance is definetly a great place to stay as it is situated within walking distance to all the Hollywood sites such as the Kodak Theater, Grauman's Chinese Theater, Walk-of-Fame, etc. The hotel is connected to the these sites as it is a part of the Hollywood  Highland Complex. Shopping and Dining are also available within the complex. Compared to other areas of Hollywood (very close to the Renaissance) it is one of the nicer and cleaner areas. The neighbouring streets can be a little scary to walk through at night, I was with a group of guys and it was still a little intimidating. The complex itself was very safe, and had security on duty 24\/7. The hotel room was a good size and came with 2 queen beds, which were amazing to sleep on. Ask for a room on a high floor for a view of the city and the Hollywood Sign. The staff were very friendly and courteous as well. The Renaissance is pretty centrally loacted within L.A. and is within a 20 mintue drive to all of the sites. The Beverly Shopping center, a major mall, is about a 15 drive from the hotel, and Rodeo Drive, which I highly recomend a visit to, is about 20 minutes from the Renaissance. If you decide to do a holiday in L.A. definetly visit Santa Monica Beach\/Mailbu\/Laguna\/and Beverley Hills. I would also highly recomend a car rental to take you to these areas as the taxis are expensive. You can do self-underground parking for $10 a day. Before I end the review, I would HIGHLY recomend a drive up the coast of California. Our group decided to fly into LAX and fly out of San Fransisco (about 10 hours driving distance from each other) but the drive was WORTH IT!!! Amazing views of the mountains and ocean. Absolutley beautiful. IT IS A MUST! Overall, if I ever returned to L.A., I would be happy to stay at the Renaissance again. The location, quality, and staff are unbeatable.
