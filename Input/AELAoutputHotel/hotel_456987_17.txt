{"text":"excellent location my wife and i stayed at the b roppongi for 6 nights in may. i was a little apprehensive at first going to tokyo but i needent have worried. getting to the hotel from the airport was my biggest concern but turned out to be a doddle. just catch the narita express train (NEX) to tokyo station and then get a taxi. it is worthwhile having the hotels website printed in japanese as we found the taxi drivers did not know where to go without it. the hotel is a 2 minute walk from roppongi hills and if you are not into japanese food, just around the corner is mcdonalds, tgi fridays and the hard rock cafe. roppongi is very lively at night but we never had any trouble at all and the japenese people are always very courteous. the hotel itself is excellent. the room was very clean, and a lot more spacious than i expected with aircon and free internet connection. i found it worthwhile taking the laptop and using the internet in the room to plan days out. the reception staff knew very little english but we got by ok. one nice touch was when we went out of the hotel in the rain, the receptionist ran after us to give us both umberellas. trips worth doing are to go to the shrine at senso-ji, go by metro, so easy to use. also joypolis was well worth it if you like theme parks. overall i would highly recommend this hotel and the whole tokyo experience. if this hotel were in england i would expect at least a 4 star rating. any questions feel free to contact me and i will try my best to answer them.
