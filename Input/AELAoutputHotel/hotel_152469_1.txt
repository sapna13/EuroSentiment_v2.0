{"text":"Nikko - Great Location  This hotel has a lot going for it. The location is outstanding. It's located in the Polanco neighborhood which is full of high end auto dealers, large Spanish homes, upscale shopping and many restaurants. It's near the W hotel as well as the JW Marriott. Honestly, if I were staying on my own I'd probably pick one of the these hotels just because they seemed a bit more modern. The Nikko is huge and there are several restaurants and bars within the hotel. There is even an English Pub that serves sushi and tacos. (It's an English Pub in a Japanese hotel in Mexico City - It's very international! ) The hotel is very clean and my room, which was a standard king, was spacious and well appointed and spotless. It was not brand new or incredibly modern, but it had been remodeled in the last 3-5 years. (I believe the deluxe rooms have been remodeled this year). Overall the hotel's public spaces have an 80's or 90's vibe to them. Nothing is worn out or old, it's just a bit dated. The staff was helpful when needed and the breakfast buffet was excellent. I was staying as a solo woman traveling with a business group and felt 100% safe the entire week. I did not use the indoor pool or exercise facilities, but stopped in for a peek and they seemed very nice. There are also several shops within the hotel and an American Express office as well. I would stay at the Nikko again and I would be comfortable recommending it to friends. However if the price is the same I'd rather stay at more modern hotel like the W. But if the price were less, I'd stay at the Nikko again and be perfectly happy. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":538,"mention":"tacos","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Taco"],"startOffset":533}]}
