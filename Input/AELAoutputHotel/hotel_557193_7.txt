{"text":"Not luxurious, but okay - My daughter loves Seattle and was going to spend a weekend there (alone). She did this before and spent a lot of $$ downtown - so this time she decided on a package that included airfare and was near SeaTac. Her dad and I decided that maybe we should go with her and booked this same hotel that her package included.At first glance (esp when we arrived at noon and was told that we couldn't check until 3 PM) the experience didn't look promising. As others have said - the surrounding area is definitely on the downside. (our daughter is a recent college grad and her new job doesn't pay all that much - so she wanted a bargain). I was really glad we (parents) barged in because the area isn't really a place that I'd like a young person to travel back and forth from, alone. We had discussed just cancelling and just paying for the one-night penalty (getting a nicer place in the City) - but decided that it was just a weekend and give it a go.However, when we finally got back from the City proper to check in (early in the evening) we were pleasantly surprised. The amenities are good - wireless access; hairdryer, fridge, microwave, coffeemaker service. The rooms were very clean (we travel in Europe quite a bit - and have experienced quite a bit of variety in terms of cleanliness). I have high standards and had no complaint about our rooms here. The staff was very cordial and accomodating and I have no reservations recommending the place if you are on a budget and want a quick get-away from the airport. We rented a car, so the pick-up wasn't necessary for us.All in all - it was an okay experience. ","annotations":[]}
