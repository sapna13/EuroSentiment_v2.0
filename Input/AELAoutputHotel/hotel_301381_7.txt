{"text":"This is Tokyo... I don't know what western folk expect, Shinjuku Prince is avg. size rooms for a business grade hotel in Japan. The new rooms are nice, very very clean, I like the contemporary look. Bed was comfortable and the loo had the obligatory seat warmer. As for prices, well I paid 129 USD per night incl breakfast (sgl). Anyone can get that rate right now on Prince's site - and believe me that is reasonable for what I got. The railway lines nearby didn't make any discernible noise and the earthquake (rated 2 on Japan's scale) was a teeny tremor too when I was there.The staff were lovely! The bellhops frequently went to their PC and got me maps, translated Japanese info into English... They, like most hotels here ship bags to Narita and other locations for 20 bucks or so, I love that feature in Japan. It's about 6 bucks to cab from the hotel to JR Shinjuku station's 'New South Exit' which makes it easy to get to Narita Express train (NEX) if you don't have them deliver your bags. This hotel is built above the Seibu Shinjuku rail station, it's prob 10 mins walk max from JR's East exit - look for the Kabuki-cho exit by Studio Alta and then walk straight toward the giant neon EPSON sign, you will see the hotel.It's worth the money, no rooms aren't as big as a Sleep Inn in Texas, but hey, you're in the tightest place in Tokyo!
