{"text":"Do not book this hotel for at least 5-6 months!! We arrived to what can only be decribed as a building site!! After we picked our jaws up from the ground we asked a builder what was going on....he directed us through the reception (without hard hats that should have been supplied, as the place was so dangerously derelict) downstairs to the hotel manager whose seat was a bag of cement!! The manager explained that as we could see, there were some refurbisments going on to which we reminded him that he said no such thing in a phone call to him on previous day to see if everything was in order. He went on to tell us that there was an apartment available for us two streets away, we voiced our utter dissappointment as we were travelling with a seven month old baby (4 adults) but as we were so tired we took the keys. Apartment described as follows:1. Two flights of stairs to the elevator.2. Baby's buggy did not fit in tiny lift, so one person had to walk up the FIVE flights with buggy.3. Padlocked kitchen door, the electrics were faulty so kitchen was out of bounds!! There was no way to feed the baby.4. Management became quite aggressive with us during a few instances when we went to complain. 5. We were given breakfast vouchers for a little cafe beneath the hotel where we had to STAND for breakfast as to sit down at a table would incurr a charge to us!!We managed to muddle through the five nights having purchased our own kettle to make bottles. The reason we booked this hotel was because of the roof top terrece where we had invisenged ourselves over 5 wonderful evenings sipping wine  taking in the breath taking views that this beautiful city has to offer. instead we were stuck in a rather ramshackle apartment with what can only be described as mediocre on a good day. We did however receieve ONE night free by way of apology, which again is highly dissatisfactory. ","annotations":[]}
