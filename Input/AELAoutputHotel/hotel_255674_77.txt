{"text":"Marriott Sydney Harbour meets all expectations We recently stayed at the Sydney Harbour Marriott with my husband and two small children. We chose the hotel for it's location and star rating and were not disappointed. From past reviews I have to say there were absolutely NO PROBLEMS with the lifts, they came within a couple of seconds each time. We also payed extra for an Opera House view. It was nice, but there are still a lot of other tall buildings semi-obstructing the view, so agree with a past reviewer and not sure if that was worth it. Our package rate also included a full buffet breakfast for two adults (although we did not have to pay for the kids) and valet parking which was excellent. The breakfast was wonderful and plentiful with the usual expectations from a 5 star hotel; hot and cold selections, pastries, cereals, juices, bacon  eggs with various sides as well as eggs and pancakes made fresh on demand. We also had the Saturday night buffet dinner which was not cheap @ $80.00 per adult, but we made good use of it as there was seafood included which we very much enjoyed. What stood out for us was the staff service and attention. They were very friendly and down to earth, not at all snooty as you expect from some 5 star hotels. Everyone we came across was excellent, especially the restaurant where we were given extra special attention and service due to the kids. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone, especially those travelling with familes.
