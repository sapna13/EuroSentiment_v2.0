{"text":"Decent Hotel at Reasonable Prices Stayed at the Columbus Motor Inn for 3 nights. We stayed in the 2 bedroom room. In the bedroom there was 1 double bed, dresser, and TV and closet. In the othe room (there was no door to this room so there is no privacy) there was 2 double beds. There is a TV, dresser, and a small table with chairs to sit at in this room. There is also a coffee maker located in the room. The bathroom is decent sized. The sink is separated from the toilet\/shower. The room is OK in general. It was clean and there was daily maid service. We got facing Columbus and at night it was pretty loud --- between buses, cars, trucks it was noisy. The room could definitely use some upgrading and modernizing. But, given the price we paid it is a good value and decent place to stay. The best thing about this hotel is the free parking! It would be nice if they offered a continental breakfast, but that isn't a big deal. Free internet access is also very nice.The hotel is located about a 5 minute walk to the Powell Mason Cable Car turntable. I recommed buying a 3 day pass if you will be using the SF Muni trasit as it only costs $18. A one day pass costs $11. A one way ticket on the cable car is $5!!! So, a definite savings is to get one of the passes. Also, the number 30 bus stops right in front of the hotel and that goes up to China Town and Union Square. Also very convenient and the passes are good for the buses too.Fisherman's Wharf is about a 10 minute walk away. There is also a Safeway and Walgreens within 10 minutes walk.
