{"text":"Would return in a heartbeat Our first family vacation to Asia was fabulous. Two adults and 3 girls (ages 8, and 6 yr. old twins). We were in Bali for 6 days and enjoyed every minute of it. We stayed at Four Seasons in Jimbaran Bay and I'll mention right from the start--if you complain about it being too overpriced or expensive, you shouldn't be staying at a Four Seasons. From the time we were picked up at the airport (with exactly 5 cold towels and bottles of water waiting in the car), I felt the luxuriousness of the resort. Upon our arrival, check-in was prompt and welcoming. We took a short buggy (which are golf carts that they have readily available to take you anywhere on the resort grounds) ride to our 2-bedroom villa. The children's bedroom had a plate of cookies ready with each of the girls' names iced on the cookie and an enormous basket of games, toys (local handicrafts), coloring books, crayons--all in sets of 3. Talk about being VERY kid-friendly and making our girls feel like princessses.The villa itself was beautiful (beware of wandering snails at night however, since the living areas are not enclosed)--private plunge pool is nice but didn't use it much because the big pools are much more fun! Bedrooms and bathrooms on both sides of the living area are enclosed however and nicely airconditioned. Bathrooms are amazing--would love to mimic the design and feel in my own home.Now we get to the service--exceptional!! We were always greeted everywhere we went. Just about everyone knows you are Mr. and Mrs. so-and-so. Daily breakfast was included for us and usually could take us until about dinner. You order anything you want, and as much as you want. My oldest daughter's favorite fruit became the rambutan (beautiful red fruit with very soft spikes on outside, and delicious fruit like a lychee on the inside), as well as mine. One day we asked for a plate of those with our breakfast. Next afternoon, when we came back from a full day of activities, a plate filled with just rambutans was waiting in our room. I've never experienced that kind of attention to detail at any other hotel\/resort. Someone obviously noticed we liked those. Why would you return and stay anywhere else? And I only have one thing to say about the spa\/massage--get one!!Many things to do in Bali, esp. with kids:--Elephant safari park a must--very interacive experience also--Monkey Forest not to skip--buy the bananas--Reptile Farm--want to hold a 2-feet iguana? Our girls did!--Ubud--lots of cool things to look at, buyAll of these things and more we did with the help of our fantastic driver. This is much cheaper than arranging transport through the hotel. You pay him a fixed price (which is quite inexpensive)and he is yours for the entire day. They live there so they know everything about the island.There isn't much negative to speak about. The hospitality and friendliness of the Balinese is something you would have to experience for yourself--there are too many good words to say. When we go back, I would not go in December, however. We were there over Christmas holiday and it was VERY hot!! Locals say it is usually their hottest month. But staying at the Four Seasons more than makes up for mother nature. Please go and enjoy and please email at cltran333@yahoo.com if you would like the name and number of the driver we used.
