{"text":"great Great Hotel, better than many 4 star european hotels. Housekeeping do a great job, rooms were spotless, we had a triple room on the 7th floor with four mini balconies, very nice, spacious, bathrooms are very niceand modern, vast array of complimentary toiletries. Bar is nice but closes around12 or 1am.Breakfast is not that cheap at 14 euro but very good, well worth it.Room service pizza was great and very hot when it arrived. Location is superb.Not actually related to the hotel but the three restaurants we visited were les 4 Gats, The Attic and les Quinze Nits,Les 4 gats was really cool place, very atmospheric and good food at reasonable prices, The Attic was awful!! Service and the incredibly rude restaurant manager were mostly to blame but the food was also well below par, I have read many good reviews of it But I can only begin to explain how bad it was, we were a group of 17 and had booked for 10pm many months in advance, when we arrived at 10pm we were told our table was not ready and we had to wait outside for 20mins when we sat down at 10.20 we asked if we could order a drink, the drink finally arrived at 10.50pm when they also finally took our food order. one of our party's main course never arrived and they had to come back out and take her order again after most people were finished, then her meal came out while everyone was reading the desert menu. Our deserts arrived at 20 to 1am. Through all of this not once did anyone even apologise.Les Quinze Nits- Fantastic! Well worth queuing for. We joined the queue at 7.50pm Sunday night and there was about 50 people ahead of us but by 8.30 there must have been almost 1000 people in the queue. Very cheap, very good, very fast, very pleasant!
