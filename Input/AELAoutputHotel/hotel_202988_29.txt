{"text":"Outstanding Hotel This is a beautiful, charming historical hotel. The rooms are spacious for european standards and the decor is typical italian style. The staff is very friendly and helpful when you attempt to speak their language instead of assuming they should understand your language.Our room faced the Duomo and we were treated each morning to the chiming of bells from the bell tower. Lovely! The only draw back is that because of the lovely tower of the hotel, tours are brought to the courtyard to view it. If you ring the front desk a staff member will ask the guide not to use the megaphone during their speech.Breakfast is buffet style with a wide assortment of fruits, dry cereals and breads. Eggs and italian style ham and bacon are also available. American style coffee or tea will be brought to your table if requested, or you can order like the Italians do and ask for a cappuccino. The housekeeping is quick and efficent. The hotel bar has a wonderful assortment of cocktails and dessert wines with plenty of snacks and. There are plenty of tables and comfortable chairs to enjoy your drink or just surf the interent on your own laptop.Don't forget to tour the hotel museum, ask the front desk for details. The tour is free but a donation of 1 or 2 euros is appreciated. Also the view from the top of the hotel is absoluting breathtaking. One advantage to staying at this hotel is that it is in the heart of the city, close to just about all the sites one would wish to see, so if you forget to grab a sweater or you want to drop off your shopping bags or more importantly use a restroom the Brunelleschi is ideal !!!!!
