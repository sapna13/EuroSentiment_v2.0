{"text":"Great location My husband and I just spent 4 nights at this hotel, May 3 -7, 2007. We had a dbl. Cathedral view room. We paid 210.00 Euro's per night. The furnishings consisted of 2 twin beds pushed together, 2 small chairs along with a side table and end table. The chairs were not comfortable so when I wanted to read I went down stairs to the lobby area and sat in their larger more comfortable chairs. We had a small balcony, I emphasize small, but it was nice to be able to look out over the square. The room was small compared to American standards but clean and comfortable. There was a TV that didn't get good reception and also intenet access. It was 9 Euros for 24 hr. use of the internet so we did that for one day. The keyboard didn't work so my husband called and they sent someone up right away to fix it. My only real complaint was the bathroom. The bathroom is small and the bidet sits right in front of the toilet. There's a very small amount of room for your legs and feet when you're sitting on the toilet. There is a restaurant on sight which we did not eat at but did sit outside and enjoyed a Sangria. The front desk staff were very nice. They do speak English. The hotel is located directly across from the Barcelona Cathedral which is covered in scaffolding. The location is wonderful. It's in the Gotic area of Barcelona so you can walk everywhere - which we did. I recommend this hotel to people who aren't going to spend much time in their room. I'm a coffee lover but found their coffee a bit strong and expensive for my taste. We were delighted to find there were 2 Starbucks within a block of the hotel.
