{"text":"I know you have to read these with a grain of salt... For those who are thinking of staying at this hotel....it is a safe bet for a good time. The beach is fantastic, clear, warm and miles long. The pool is not a big as I had thought from viewing the photos in the catalog....but also, a very good time had by all at this location.The Staff - Upon arriving at the hotel the staff is very helpful. There is one young man in particular (Ariel) who is always trying to help the guests enjoy their stay to the utmost. Generally all staff were a great help and tons of fun.The Room - Was smaller then I had anticipated, but clean and cool (AC). There was NOT a Iron in our room, so if you bring something nice to wear....bring a steamer or ask at the front desk for an iron. Also, plugs are not adaptable to most camera battery chargers so again....they will charge it for you at the front desk....no questions asked or no costs involved. The Food - The a la carte restaurants were kind of a disapointment. At the A la Carte it is a safe bet to order the beef as that is usually a very tasty dish. We did not try the Steakhouse so no comment on that. The main buffet is great. Tons to choose from, but not really too much Dominican food....appeals to tourists from all over. They choose a different theme every night - Mexican was amazing!! No sleeping in or you will miss breakfast....closes at 10am :-( But tons to choose from if you can get up. Remember this is a 3rd world country, so the food selection and choice will not be as good as home.....but overall - we didn't lose weight while on vacation ; - )The Activities - We chose to go away on the Monster Truck Safari. It was fantastic!! It is a day long trip that takes you through 3 Dominican provinces. Country side, typical living conditions, schools, fudge factory, voodoo clinic. Lots to see, eat and drink. Well worth the money - $95 USD. We also went to the restaurant Capitan Cook. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. The food was excellent, but nothing you cannot eat at home. The service was terrible (Slow).... and the water taxi's were full. So we had two choices...wait....30 min minimum or take a taxi cab....$60 per person....it's lunch....I don't roll like that : - (....food was very tasty though.General Tips - Tips Tips Tips.....$1 goes a long way. I know it is ALL INCLUSIVE....but if you drop $1...you will have great service. Otherwise....service will be great....but diminish. It may not be cool, but it is a fact.The rum they give you is very cheap - harsh. Ask for Brugal or Barcelo Anejo. Your drinks will taste so much better.ALL IN ALL - THE RIU BAMBU IS A GREAT RESORT - 4 of 5 for me....but who am I right? I hope my story is helpful.....ENJOY!!!
