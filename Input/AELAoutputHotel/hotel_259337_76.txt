{"text":"Perfect! After reading all the reviews we decided on this resort. What can I say everything was abosolutely perfect. We were checked in within minutes. We asked for a 2nd floor near the beach and that's what we got. The room was huge, beautiful and clean. The food was excellent, of course not everything was perfect but every restaurant had its own character and tastes. Remember its an all inclusive in Dominican republic. We ate at a la carte every night. We ate at every one (6), Asian, Spanish, Dominican, Mexican, Italian and Seafood. We loved them all except for the seafood one. The dominican was my favorite. You do not have to reserve the a la carte anymore. They were generous with the alcohol. The breakfast buffets were super, they had a variety of 10 different fresh juices such as watermelon, papaya, melon etc. A nice assorment of healthy food. Even served champagne at breakfast on a few mornings. They also had someone making crepes, waffles, pancakes and eggs. Lunches at the buffet were also great. The nice part about this resort is that there are 3 hotels so you have many bars, areas and restaurants to choose from. Yes the grounds are big but very easy to get around and at least you have different places to explore. The staff was friendly always asking if you need another drink. I think there are 4 different pools, all beautiful and large with swim up bars. The casino was nice, many slot machines but only 5 cent and I think 25 cent machines. The slots are open from 10am and the blackjack tables are open at night. I used the gym once, its very modern and empty I'm sure since its so beautiful outside with enough activities to do. There is a spa and we had some treatments there, they seem to know what they are doing, we enjoyed our massages. The beach as you heard is breathtaking and you do have to reserve your chair with a towel but I think that was the only annoyance there was the whole trip and it really wasn't a big deal. We felt safe at all times leaving our stuff behind for hours not worrying about it. The most surprising thing is that we thought we'd be around so many people but opposite was true, it was so quiet and peaceful. I think this is due to how the grounds are laid out, very spacious. There are some shops that are quite fun, we bought gifts and thought the prices were reasonable. The internet was also worth it $5 for 30 min or $8 for an hour, the only problem is that you have to usually wait so bring a book. The nicest resort of the 3 was the bavaro, seemed to be the most modern of the villas.We all had a wonderful time and really had nothing to complain about. At a cost of $35 we were able to stay in the room until 4pm. Also they will come pick up your luggage at your room in a moments notice. I highly recommend this resort.
