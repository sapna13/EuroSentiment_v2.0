{"text":"Fell in love with Venice ! We just returned from our trip to Venice to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary ! We selected Al Ponte Antico Hotel in Venice based on the ratings from trip Advisor. It was a wonderful boutique hotel ! The location is magnificent, the balcony looks into the Grand canal and has a wonderful view of the Rialto bridge. It used to be an old Venetian Palace and was painstakingly redone by the current owner Mattheo. Mattheo's family have been hoteliers for a long time and he is so passionate about making sure his guests have the best time. There are only 9 rooms and Mattheo and his crew will make you feel like you are the only guest at his wonderful palace. He makes the most delicious omelettes and crepes for you in the morning and don't miss the caffe from his handcrafted coffee machine ! Mattheo knows Venice inside out and gave us good tips - go early to St Mark's square before the day trippers arrive, don't miss the fish market, take the boat to the colourful village of Burano and have luch by the canal at Trattoria al Gatto Nero da Ruggero ( pasta with spider crab was delicious and grilled fresh sardines) . We had really some of the best meals in Venice, enjoy a nice lunch at Alla Maddonna, dinner at Dolo ( try the spicy squid on polenta), dinner at Osteria Boccadero near the Miracle Church ( go with the chef Luciano's recommendations, you won;t go wrong !)Al Ponte Antico has their own private dock, so best Venetian way to get to the hotel is to take a water taxi right up to the dock of the Hotel. Enjoy Venice !
