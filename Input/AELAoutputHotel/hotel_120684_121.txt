{"text":"a 3 star hotel at best just returned from our annual holiday trip in hawaii, having stayed at the outrigger waikiki on the beach years ago in an ocean-front room, I didn't think twice about staying there again in an ocean-view room on tne 7th floor. But . what I got for over 550.00 dollars a night was an average room with a tiny bathroom and a view of the ocean that I had to stick my head out of the lanai as far as I could I could see the ocean, and yes the walls are paper thin you actually hear every thing from the next room, but the money and the view was not my biggest problem because if you want a decent room in hawaii that is the average price a night, it was having to be in a room right above air vents so loud I could not leave the sliding doors open and if you have ever been to hawaii before you know that this is just not acceptable it just to humid. But what really suprised us was the lack of customer service detail througout the hotel (except for the valet parking attendents, always prompt and helpful). it felt like the managent had gone on vacation and left the kids in charge. Everyone in the hotel were just to laid back even for hawaiian standards.30-60 minute waits for everything including check-in, breakfast, dinner, I guess we just excepted a little more from a 4 star hotel.
