{"text":"Great location, good service, excellent value. LOCATIONAparthotel Silver is located off the L3 (green) subway line, a two minute walk from the Fontana stop.It is in a residential location that is quiet compared to the Placa Catalunya\/Ramblas areas.There is good shopping within walking distance of the hotel and some restaurants too.SERVICEAll of the front desk staff spoke english well. Check in and check out were fast and easy.The hotel also lets you store your luggage if you arrive early or need to leave late. The storage area is out in the open under the stairs, but the staff was nice enough to hold my laptop computer behind the receiption desk until I left.You are asked to leave your key at reception every time you leave the property. Reception is available 24 hours. Check out time is at 11 am.ROOMSI had a standard room, one that hasn't been upgraded. It was in need of an upgrade, but everything was clean and worked fine. The bathroom was nice. TV was basic and had a couple of english channels. The rooms come with a fridge and stovetop, very convenient if you're spending a couple of nights. Air conditioning worked well and a manual fan also is provided. A safe is available as well, and it has an electronic lock that is easy to use. Road noise wasn't an issue.BREAKFASTThe hotel has a breakfast area on the first (second) floor. It costs seven euros. Food was basic but good. It included croissants, cereals, toast, juice, coffee, and bread with meat and cheese. The sitting area is outside in a nice garden area.INTERNET ACCESSThere is a desktop PC in the lobby with an internet connection that guests can use for free. There is also Wifi in the lower parts of the hotel. You buy an access card at the lobby. This card has a PIN code on it. Once you're in an area covered by the Wifi, simply open Internet Explorer and enter the PIN code on the website that appears to gain internet access. Cost for a 24 hour card is 12 euros. You can also buy them in hour increments if necessary. Just note that you'll need a room on either the first or second floor in order to use the Wifi from your room. Otherwise, you can pick up the Wifi in the lobby or in their garden (breakfast) area one level higher.TRANSPORTATIONThe subways in Barcelona are excellent: on-time, clean, and easy to use. If you're there for a weekend, I'd recommend purchasing the 10 ticket pack. It lets you ride 10 times (transfers to other lines during the same trip are not included in your limit) and costs around 13 euros. There are machines at each stop where you can buy tickets, and you can change the language of the machines as needed. Credit cards are taken, although the credit card readers didn't work in some machines.On a side note, I found the cheapest place to buy a water or coke was at the Placa Catalunya subway stop. There you will find a huge vending machine on the wall that sells a 1.5 liter coke for two euros.SUMMARYThis hotel is very cheap compared to others in Barcelona. I paid 85 euros on a Friday in late summer. But it doesn't feel like a cheap hotel, and even the rooms that haven't been refurbished are pretty nice, especially given the kitchenette. The location is really ideal; no reason to stay in the Ramblas\/Catalunya area. The metro will take you there in five minutes and is very easy to use. It's nice to break away from the congestion of that area and have a quiet place to sleep. Aparthotel Silver is highly recommended.
