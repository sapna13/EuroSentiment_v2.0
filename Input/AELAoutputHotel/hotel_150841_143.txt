{"text":"Excellent Hotel well worth the money I stayed here with my family of five and overall our impression was amazing. I've stayed at quite a few all inclusive resorts and this by far topped them all. The food was well above average for an all inclusive and offered many different selections to please almost anyone. They had the staple foods, as well as native dishes to the island, and even added outdoor barbeque parties during the day which had homemade paella and sangria. The specialty restaurants were okay, the Japanese was the best. Lobby bar was great, staff amazing. Tip a few dollars, and you'll never go without your next drink waiting for you. Pool bar great, with swim up seats. Also, didn't realize until the last day that there are outdoor huts that also serve a good variety of drinks and snacks throughout the day.Rooms were always cleaned very nicely and very spacious. Loved that the bathroom was large and had a separate bath from the shower. Beach was very well kept. Plently of lounge chairs and huts for use. Water was beautiful, be careful of the coral. Suggestion for children, bring water shoes. Staff was amazing, definately made our stay 100%. They recruited for the activities and made everything very fun and exciting. The shows that they performed at night at the lounge were kind of cheesy and outdated, but when they asked for audience participation they got roars of laughter. Definately entertaining. Casino was much smaller than anticipated, and the staff there was very unfriendly.Disco I expected to be a little busier with young people, but since there weren't that many young people on the resort, it was not what I expected. They played decent music and still had a good time dancing. Overall, for all inclusive it was well worth the money. Food, staff, and activities were all amazing and I would go back in a heartbeat.
