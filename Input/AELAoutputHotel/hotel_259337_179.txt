{"text":"Perfect Retreat My fiancee and I had a WONDERFUL time at this resort. We went for 5 days. Food - you have three resorts to choose from, the variety is awesome. Yummy fruit juices, different international cuisines each night. Reserve your a la cartes the first night you arrive because they can get booked. If you don't get the time you like, just go to the restaurant and change it the day of.We enjoyed Le Catedral for its variety and quality of food. El Behique has a great breakfast!Rooms - pristine and clean, we had the junior suite. The beds were the only low point of the trip. The beds were uncomfortable.Beach - they clean it every morning. we didn't have any trouble getting chairs, but it's worth going early in the morning to get seats.Activities - the night shows are pretty good, casino is a little cheezy but makes for a fun few hours. Foozball and pool at the sports bar. They even had a Carnival parade one day.Grounds - are beautifully kept. We enjoyed walking around, but for those that are limited...there is a train that choos choos around the whole complex. Great place for couples. We didn't see many kids there, but there seemed to be an entire day of activities planned for them if you decide to bring your kids. Tips: We tipped everyone that smiled and gave us good service. It goes farther than their wages for supporting the local dominican economy..and they are so appreciative. Take the cooler mugs to carry your water, pina coladas, cokes in.Thanks for all the reviews! It's why we went to this resort and had such a wonderful vacation! We HIGHLY recommend it.
