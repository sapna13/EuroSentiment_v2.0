{"text":"Great stay @ Novotel My husband and I have just returned from Bali on 14th July 08. We booked the hotel from inbalihotel.com and globaltravelasia.com for 3 nights as they offered the lower price (nett and including breakfast) than the hotel official website√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ best rate. Our stay for the first night was at Superior Room, across the street. We checked in at 9pm. The room was spacious and clean. The toilet looks relatively small though. We found that there was no towel at all when we were about to shower. We called house keeping and they came with 2 bath towels quickly, yes just 2 bath towels, slightly grayish though (perhaps it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ more environment friendly by not using bleach). The bedsheet was somehow grayish and stained. We called house keeping again. They came quickly with the entire bedsheet set changed. I was terrified when I spotted a lizard near to the toilet door! My husband managed to trap it, and we called the house keeping again to clean up the mess, phew. The superior room looks slightly aged but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ acceptable and comfortable for both of us. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ one of the cheapest rooms in a 4-star hotel that I could find in Nusa Dua. We can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ complaint much about the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬Æoody√à√\u2020\u2022?smell of the room as Bali is a tropical area with high humidity, we are used to it anyway in Malaysia.We checked out Superior room early next morning and headed to Bekasih, thus leaving the hotel front desk to take care of our luggage. We returned to the hotel, obtained new room key to Tropical Terrace, and our luggage had already been placed in the room. The room was huge, very clean, very new, very well lit, modern but with a touch of Balinese design. The room has high ceiling, its air con is hidden in the ceiling and LCD TV with many international movie channels. There is small private garden that leads us to the room. We were absolutely happy with it as it looks exactly like what you see on the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ official website.The breakfast includes porridge, fried noodles, fried rice, sausage, fried potatoes, baked beans, mix cooked vege, miso soup, bacon, ham, cheese, breads, croissants, tropical fruits, cereals, yogurt, fruit juices, and fried eggs. Yes, everyday you get almost the same stuff, with minor variations (I expected Nasi Lemak, Malaysian famous local spicy food, but was told by husband that Balinese doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat that, too bad). We were happy with the tasty breakfast though.The Nusa Dua beach has lots of seaweed unlike the clean Jimbaran beach however the hotel management did not really do the cleaning. There is always strong wind along the beach and it gets chilly during morning and evening. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ experience noisy water activities although we stayed pretty near to the beach.
