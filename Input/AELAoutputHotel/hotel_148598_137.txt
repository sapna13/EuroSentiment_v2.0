{"text":"Loved the Wyndham Stayed at the Wyndham Rio Mar from March 9-13, 2008 with my husband and 2 boys (ages 9 and 10). We loved the location, across from the rain forest and away from San Juan! The service we received from staff was excellent! We have travelled all over the world and the same rules apply - say please and thank you and smile - you won't believe how well you get treated!Our room was spotless and cleaned every day. We did not eat at the resort due to the expense - so we rented a car and went out for our meals. Saved a lot of money that way and allowed us to see the island. We ate at Richie's - very expensive and food was only OK - but view is awesome. Also ate at Don Pepe's - reasonably priced, good food. The hotel activity pool was fun - just wish they provided a little more activity. The only thing they did have was aqua aerobics, no music. We checked out the kids club - sad. Small room geared towards little ones (under 5) and looked more like daycare than a kids club. Parking was expensive but worth it since we got a great deal on the trip. The valet is $20 per day - unlimited entries and exits. We only did one excursion - Bio Bay! It was an amazing experience and I hightly recommend it. We are on the adventurous side so it might not be for everyone. East Island Excursions was who we booked with. About $120 pp which included catamaran ride to Vieques, van to restaurant, dinner (best meal we had all week!!!), bus ride to bay, boat ride on bay. It was expensive but I think worth every penney!!!! The location of the Wyndham Rio Mar is not for everyone as there is no nightlife. We are from NYC so the hotels in San Juan did not appeal to us for a vacation, we see enough concrete and skyscrapers at home. The Wyndham is lush and green and out of the city. We had a wonderful stay and I would definitely return!
