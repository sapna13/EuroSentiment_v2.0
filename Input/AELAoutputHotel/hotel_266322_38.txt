{"text":"Amazining Roof Top Sunsets What a wonderful time to be in Phoenix! During my trip this February in part for work but also for fun, I had an opportunity to stay at the Clarendon again. I don't know how they do it but they have certainly improved on their already spectacular service and ammenities.Two of the Must Do's during your stay at the Clarendon. The awesome roof top sunset exeperience is one. I got a chance to enjoy a beer while watching the sun set from this amazing roof top vantage point. The roof has been recently remodled to give the guest a incredible panoramic view of uptown and downtown Phoenix not to mention the incredible South, Estrella and White Tank Mountains. The roof top seating provided for guests and vistors of the Clarendon certainly hold true the Hotel's creative and unique high end decore.The second must do while at the Clarendon, have a meal at their new restuarant, C4. This restuarant has certianly molded in to the hot spot for the hotel guests and locals. C4 is working with their local vendors and focusing on gearing their menu to reflect the produce and animals raised in the Phoenix Metro and surrounding areas.What again ties all of this together is the attentive employees at the Clarendon. This group certainly knows how to make guests feel how much they value you; from the nice lady who cleans your room and says, Good Morning, to the person who brings you room service in the evening.Thanks again Clarendon Hotel  Suites...Nick AlmendarezRegional HR ManagerLos Angeles, California ","annotations":[{"endOffset":669,"mention":"White","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":664}]}
