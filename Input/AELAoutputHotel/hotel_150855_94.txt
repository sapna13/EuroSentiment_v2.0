{"text":"Loved our vacation at RIiu Taino Our vacation at the Riu Taino was great! The hotel is nice and we had an awesome time! The atmosphere- it's incredible! The hotel is clean and lively. The grounds are very well kept. It's green and lush, just beautiful.The beach- is like paradise. The white sand and torquise waters. I've never been to a beach more beautiful. There is a pretty good coral reef in the water in the middle of the roped off area for swimming. Tons of fish. Bring bread to feed them and don't forget your underwater camera.The hotel- it's a four star. Very nice and clean. The layout is good. Everything is close in proximity. There are two pools. One is close to the lobby, a big outdoor restaurant\/bar and the beach. This pool is bigger and has a swim up bar. The second pool is smaller and more quiet but is also close to the beach and has a smaller restaurant\/bar. The rooms- are comfortable. Our room was a short walking distance to everything. Ours had two beds, one double and one twin. The bed was comfortable (I think we had a newer matteress set). BRING your own pillow. The pillows and bedding are dated. There are nice balconies with a hanging rack for towels or swimsuits. In the closet there are liquor dispencers and everyday the maid refills the fridge. There is also a safe in the closet and plenty of hangers for your clothes.The food- was interesting! I didn't starve but thankfully I didn't gain 10 pounds either. I'm a pretty picky eater so I lived on pancakes, hamburgers and steak. What I ate was good. They had a very wide range of food to please everyone and I didn't hear anyone complaining.The activities- were fun. I enjoyed the animation team. They had activities throughout the day like, water aerobics, bingo, volleyball, dance lessons ect... Everynight they had a different show that was pretty intertaining and then dancing til midnight. I would of liked to hear more of a variety of music but learned to love salsa and merengue.My advice- have a great time! Don't expect a 5 star hotel. Look past the little flaws and everything will be perfect. AND don't forget your underwater camera!
