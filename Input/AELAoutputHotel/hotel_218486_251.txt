{"text":"Had a Great Time!! Beautiful beach Stayed at Ocean Bavaro Jan 27-Feb 3 2007 although there were a few problems still had a great time. There were about 22 of us that went down because my sister was getting married there.We booked thought signature and flew thought sky service√à√\u2020\u2022?(I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not too impressed with sky service) the flight seemed to take forever√à√\u2020\u2022?first of all the entertainment system (TV√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ and radio wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ working for trip there and back) and the food was terrible (I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not one to really care about the food on the plane but when they serve the same crappy meal on the way there, then I start to complain√à√\u2020\u2022?at least offer something different!). Airport: No problems at the airport. It was pretty hot so make sure you at least have something light on because we were there for awhile waiting for our luggage.Hotel: check in took along time and we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get the room that we requested from the travel agent (which was block 5 or 6) instead we got put in block 100 which is way at the back and probably about the furthest you could be from the beach. They told us to talk to our rep the next day to try and get a room change.Rooms: When we got to our room the door was wide open, made me kind of uneasy about it then noticed there was no deadbolt or lock on the door but we weren't too worried about it because we knew we were changing rooms the next day or too.The Meeting with the signature rep was a little helpful but pretty much a waste of time, they could of handed out booklets and given us a card with her name and number on it so we could reach her√à√\u2020\u2022?everything she told us we pretty much already knew. We eventually talked with her and she got our room changed (there was about 6 of us that weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ happy with our rooms) to block 7 which I found to be pretty good. Day Trips: Did a trip to Catalina Island though the dive center which was on the beach near block 7. Had an amazing time!! Drove to a boat dock in La Romania where we were picked up, stopped in the middle of the ocean and went snorkeling and diving√à√\u2020\u2022?saw lots of fish, then headed to the island were us snorkeller√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ were dropped off at the beach and the divers continued for one more dive. Had lunch at the beach, drank, and danced. The staff tried really hard to get everyone involved. Had a blast on the boat driving to and back, the staff got everyone up dancing and were always filling up our cups with alcohol or pop (a warning: be careful on how much you drink because it is an hour and a half bus ride back). Went on a helicopter ride, it was amazing!! only did the 10 min ride.Outback Safari Adventure was a lot of fun!! (check out the website). Had the best Tour guide√à√\u2020\u2022?Omar√à√\u2020\u2022?he made the trip a lot of fun! Defiantly bring school supplies and treats for the kids, because you stop at a school and it pretty rewarding to be able to give the teacher something because they really need them√à√\u2020\u2022?And the money from the trip goes to the schools. This is a trip to defiantly go on if you want to experience the culture and country side of the Dominican. They serve you drinks the whole time too.Wedding: My sister wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ too happy... the wedding planner didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ end up meeting with her when they had planned she kept canceling and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ meet with her till the day before the wedding. Then they were suppose to have the wedding at sunset but couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ√à√\u2020\u2022?it had to be at 12:30 but didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ happen then because the lawyer was stuck at another resort√à√\u2020\u2022?soooo the wedding ended up being at 2:30. A couple pointers√à√\u2020\u2022?-Remember everything is in √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≠ominican Time√à√\u2020\u2022?which happens at a slow place so you have to be patient-Tip the maid! You don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to make her mad (someone√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ money got stolen in their room on the day of their wedding)-Buy a safe key!!-Tip the gardener√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ and brings them a drink√à√\u2020\u2022?they work very hard in the hot weather and deserve it.-Be careful what you eat (boyfriend and a couple others got sick the last day√à√\u2020\u2022?and think it was from the sushi)-Book at least a couple of dinners at the a la carte√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂Overall I had a great time and would go back again and stay at Ocean Bavaro. Although didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get to stay in block 5 or 6 but I wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really concern about it once we got into 7 because we were only there to sleep, and shower and the room really wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ that bad at all.
