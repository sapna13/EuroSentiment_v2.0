{"text":"Unbelievable Service at the Chesterfield Mayfair My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. We were there for three nights, business related but Sat. and Sun. we toured London. The Chesterfield was recommended to us by our travel person at work, a colleague, and tripadvisor.com reviews. Many of the trip advisor reviews note the high levels of service at the Chesterfield, but you cannot imagine it until you experience it. I would like to highlight the staff, we arrived at 7:30am on a Saturday, and we were treated extremely well, given our king room, Flavio helped us with our bags, Anthony the concierge was excellent, and the restaurant staff were exceptional. The breakfast crew, Fe, Carolina, and the other ladies whose names I cannot recall, were wonderful. The food was excellent. The dinner staff was similarily exceptional, Tara, the sommelier, the host (can't remember his name), Aldo the meat carver, and all of the wait staff were amazing. The food was delicious. We ate breakfast every day and dinner every night in the restaurant because of the service and the food, we did not care to try any other restaurants in London. The location was excellent for touring, many spots are within a short 5 minute walk such as Green Park\/tube station, the Big Bus stop at the Ritz, Picadilly Circus, Hyde Park, Regent Street shopping, and it's only a short 10 minute walk from the hotel through Green Park to Buckingham Palace.If I could offer any constructive feedback, the shower was not so good, the shower heads are too diffusive, my wife opted for baths as she is short and could not enjoy the shower, and the water goes everywhere in the absence of a complete enclosure or shower curtain. A minor issue when compared to the exceptional level of service. We'd stay there again and recommend it to all of our friends.
