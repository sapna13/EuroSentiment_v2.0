{"text":"Great week for our family We had an amazing christmas break week! I'll try to break it down easily.....Check in was a breeze, no waiting and luggage brought right up to room. We stayed in The Reserve in a Family Concierge suite. The kids were give beach bags, hats and t shirts. The room was stocked with suncreen, robes and slippers for the kids and the refrig. had lots of snacks and drinks. Room was huge-2 double beds, jacuzzi tub, pull out couch, full shower, lots of closet and drawer space, balcony etc.Pool\/Beach--Reserve pool is beautiful with couches, beds, comfy chairs and huts for shade. Pool has beds to lay on in water. We had our own bartender for the week who brought us everything. Pool has a full bar and grill. Kids zone is right there and the kids enjoyed it alot-they made projects, swam, played games and met alot of nice kids. Beach is not close to reserve but you can walk or take a tram--no big deal. Beach also had beds, chairs, huts etc. Beautiful beach-very clean and sand is so soft. Grounds--Gorgeous! Very lush. Lots of plants and trees. Very clean.Concierge-tip at beginning of week. He made all our dinner reservations, last minute spa reservation, arranged for a paper to be delivered and had milk and cookies sent to our room each nite. They are not your personal slaves and we found ours to be so helpful and great with the kids. A smile and kindness go a long way. Food-we enjoyed the sit down dinner-especially Japanese and Vento. Service is a little slower than home. Buffet does get repetitive for breakfast and lunch but it was never crowded on reserve side. We brought breakfast to the pool and ordered lunch from the grill. Shows\/Lobby\/Casino-Shows were fun and lobby is busy at night. There are beds to lie on, swings, comfy chairs etc. Just a fun scene.Language-learn a little spanish-just the basics are appreciated.Tip-it helps a great deal. Staff works hard and were so nice to our kids. Time Share-didn't get approached once.Mostly I'd say smile, relax, take things in stride. It's not home-no one is an rush. Do your research and know what to expect. Don't sweat the small stuff. Reserve was awesome. Hope you have a great time--we did!!
