{"text":"A gem of a hotel! We (me, my husband and college age son) just returned from 6 nights at the Luna  Simone and couldn't have been more pleased with room, location and staff. The room (#1) was clean, pleasantt and comfortable, with a spotless bathroom, cushy carpeting, and plenty of pillows and blankets. A fan added comfort on those warmer days and nights (yes, we had a few!). We stayed in a room for 3 (3 twin beds) on the lower floor and it was quiet and conveniently had an extra bathroom (toilet) just outside the door. We were also just steps away from the dining room. Breakfasts were served promptly and were always to order. If you have special requests, the staff were ready to oblige. Upstairs was a computer for internet access but my son had no problem finding a hot spot in the room for his laptop.The location was perfect for us. Bus #24 runs 24\/7 and stops just outside the door. Victoria Tube and Rail station is on the #24 line or just a 10 minute walk away. ATM, banks, restaurants, grocery stores, pubs, all very close by. Also, Victoria Tube has an upstairs eatery which has lots of restaurant choices. From the hotel to the city centre (Westminster) is only about 15 minutes ... and you can continue on to Trafalgar Square and even to the British Museum. Can't say enough about how convient being on the 24 line is. And as far as the staff goes, they were all marvelous. Friendly, helpful, genuinely concerned for our well-being and enjoyment. They will help you book tours, mail post cards (and they sell really nice ones too!), arrange a taxi for you, whatever you need.Can't say enough about the great staff at Luna  Simone!We will recommend to family and friends without reservation!
