{"text":"fantastic hotel-will be back First of all, the transfer seemed to be quicker and smoother than last year (when we stayed at Sunscape the Beach). That was a nice surprise!Check in was ok but we'd requested high room and got ground floor so we had to wait around for 3 hours before we finally got a first floor room but we were happy with it so c'est la vie! Had lovely view over infinity pool block 2 with sun on balcony in evening.The beach is beautiful, don't know why people moan about the colour of the sand! The sea is very choppy but great fun with boogie boards or just jumping over the waves. Stick to the right side (looking at sea) for calmest spot, also where the beach bar is and the gorgeous beds.Have a walk to the Serenis, next hotel down the beach to the right.It's a lovely 15 min stroll and you'll see the contrast between the hotels is vast. It's all snotty kids and lagered-up parents making the most of their all-in 3 star hols! Stop to see what the vendors have to offer on the beach- see Eddy, he's a real character!Back at the Excellence, for a bit of local shopping, go see the shacks to the left of the hotel on the beach. Visit Nancy in shack 6-if she hasn't got what you want, she'll know a man who has!She's lovely, educated in Canada but came back home 'cos her Dad's not well.On to the dining.....Breakfast at the buffet is amazing, there's nothing they haven't got. Best for me was the beautiful smoked salmon which I liked with scrambled eggs. Service can be a bit slow but hey, you're on holiday!We loved lunching at the grill and the lobster restaurant. Beautiful setting, looking out to the beach. At the lobster restaurant we were given an outside table where we ordered champagne and our waiter, Angel, appeared with a full bottle which he opened at the table and placed it in a stand, coming back to refill our glasses when needed. Ceasar salad and a prawn main.....that was the best lunch and be best tip we left!At the grill, the fillet mignon is outstanding! Absolutely the best steak I've ever tasted and I could've cut it with my butter knife!The french restaurant is ok but quite a limited menu and a bit stuffy for my liking. Didn't try the Meditteranean. Buffet in the evening is nice but we preferred eating al fresco.Dinner on the beach once a week bbq is a lovely idea and they set the tables up beautifully but the food isn't all that. Go for the atmosphere and drinks then have dinner at one of the restaurantsThe bars are fantastic, stocked with all the top brands and the bar staff really know how to make a bloody mary!Evening entertainment's ok but don't miss Michael Jackson, he lip syncs but the dancing is wow! Sax player every evening on the terrace is great, avoid awful karaoke.Was impressed with pizzas delivered to you at your sun bed on the beach but never wanted one. Although I saw staff taking drinks to people on the beach, we were never offered one.The maid service we got was apalling. Us brits normally tip at the end of our stay and we are generous tippers but I think the maids expect tips up front. This to us is wrong....surely you tip as a reward for good service, not to ensure it. We only got one very poor attempt at towel\/flower art, only got turn down and chocs twice all week. We didn't leave a tip at all-hah!All in all, this was possibly the best hotel we've stayed in. The staff are great, it's very clean and does live up to its 5 star rating.Book with full confidence and enjoy - we did!PS. Check out channel 21!!!!
