{"text":"Hit or Miss? I have just come back from a two week stay at the Conrad. First of all, during my stay, I read that 72% of all travellers spend two nights or less at any given property. For this group the Conrad provides a very well-oiled business-centric hotel experience. The IT guys will solve any problem you have in minutes and they're all over you. The rooms are all on the small side with bathrooms that are enormous and swamp the size of the room.If you luck out and get a corner room (#s 16 or 25), you'll have a fantastic view of water and highrises and sunrises from a bathroom with a wall of glass and wrap-around windows in your bedroom. The bedding is very comfortable and the rooms are amazingly quiet. There's no noise from inside or out. The Level 25 lobby and bar and restaurant area give you a great modern cityscape view on all sides. There's a great pool and jacuzzi, tennis courts and a spa. The swimming pool is heated to near bathwater temperature so it's perfect for an early morning or late night swim. There's a bar and restaurant on site which is actually across the motor court and up on the roof of the parking structure adjacent the hotel. The food here is all grilled right in front of you and very good. However this bar closes at sundown so you're out of luck if you come later to use the pool which opens at 6 am and closes at 10 PM. That is all the good part....now for the rest.The rooms have precisely two drawers for clothing. All other clothes are to be hung on hangers in your closet. Quite frankly, this was so woefully inadequate for a two week stay that the only solution was to have the mini-bar emptied to give myself another drawer. Similarly, I had to have another storage space in the entry hall cleared of the coffee maker and all that paraphenalia that people seem to think is essential in a business hotel but which I personally loathe looking at. I like a very clean uncluttered look and this can only be accomplished by losing all the black leather menus and phone pads and gewgaws that clutter every surface in these small rooms. The huge 37 inch TV and accompanying DVD player are among the most confusing to operate I have ever encountered. There's no universal remote and instead you have to use one to turn on another to switch channels. It's very frustrating and would be vastly imporved with written instructions but I had to ask twice to have these provided. There seems to be a problem with service in the hotel. While the universal response to any request you make is gracious and can-do, the execution seems to fall short. I had several requests that were made in duplicate. Finally, the food. The Atrio restaurant is a stunning space but the food is mediocre at best, overpriced and the only option besides a room service menu.I used room service twice and was disappointed in everything but a thin-crusted pizza bianca. The breakfasts are obscenely expensive. One morning I actually paid $18 for fruit juice and a wineglass sized porition of granola, berries and yogurt. There's no other eating option in the hotel and I thank god for the neighboring Novecento restaurant which is cati-corners across Brickell and which provides reasonable entrees, wonderful wines and good service to the beat of a very persistent latin rhythm and active bar scene full of young hot looking Latinos. So why the Conrad? We got a truly excellent rate for a party occupying 8 rooms for the 2 week period. I won't divulge what we paid but it was considerably less than the Columbus Hilton where we stay on frequnet trips to Ohio. That I would say is the real reason to love the Conrad. But if I had my druthers, I'd be down the block at the 4 Seasons in as fast as it took to walk there.
