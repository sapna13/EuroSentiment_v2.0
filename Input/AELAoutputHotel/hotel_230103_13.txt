{"text":"Airport hotel blues We arrived at the Ibis, Schiphol after a week long vacation in Paris and Venice for staying overnight to take an early morning flight. We were spoiled silly by the excellent hotel in Venice and I guess that set our expectation high. Ibis is good as a transit hotel...well maybe not. The airport shuttle which picks up guests for all Novotel and Accor guests tends to be a little crowded (with a 30 minute frequency). On arrival at the Ibis, we were checked into a standard room, which means no temperature control, and bare basic amenities. No mini bar, limited toiletries (we were given just one small bar of soap) and a room telephone with locked outgoing access is definitely not a friendly place. The Wi-Fi is pay-to-use T-Mobile which can be a bit of an issue when you arrive at midnight and need to shuffle out of your room in your bed clothes to get Internet.I needed to check-in online for my morning flight out and I had some technical issues connecting to the site and needed help. The other alternative was to use the phone, which thanks to the hotel policy was locked. So here I was, sleepy as hell trying to get the phone unlocked walking all the way to the front desk only to be told that I could not get it unlocked until morning thanks to a system backup. I was also curtly informed that I needed to get my credit card authorized for phone access when the system came back online.Fuming and frustrated, I returned to my room only to find out that we had to share a small bar of soap between the two of us.The only reason why anyone would want to stay here is because its cheap (74 Euros\/ night) and close to the airport. Given an alternative, I would avoid this place next time. ","annotations":[]}
