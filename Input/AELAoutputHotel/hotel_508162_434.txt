{"text":"Multiple fabulous stays! When I read these reviews, I am a little confused! I can't believe that some of the reviewers stayed at the same hotel we visted. This March was our 9th or 10th visit to the DR, and our third stay at this hotel. Every visit has been fantastic! The staff cannot do enough for you, and they are very proud of their English which they have worked to improve over the years. Many of them, suprisingly, given the number of people they see, remembered us from previous visits and the registration staff have even greeted us with Welcome home! The food is at least equal to, if not superior to most of the other hotels where we have stayed ( and there have been many) - there is something for everyone - the variety and quality is excellent! Is everything like what we have at home? No - but if I wanted everything to be like home, I would stay home. The one thing I do agree with is that there is hoarding of the pool floats, and there were parents who even allowed their children to take 3 or 4 floats so they could stand up on them, or jump onto them. We asked once if we could have one, and the parent told us to go find another one. But that couldn't ruin the great vacation! Our room was very quiet and clean. Every day, we came back from the beach to find our bed decorated with flowers or animals made from towels. These people work very hard, and a kind word goes a long way. Any noise that we heard was from some of the guests, not from the staff. I remember a stay at another hotel where the cleaning staff would yell to one another in the hallway at 7:00 am. I never once heard a cart rolling or heard the staff in the hallways here. As to the beach, we walked several hours each day, and the beach was beautiful! The staff work very hard to keep everything clean for the guests, and they are constantly going around cleaning up the drink glasses and bottles left around by some of the guests. As to the sea grasses that washed up on the shore - how could anyone blame the hotel for that? There was inclement weather and rough seas, so it washed up. I saw the staff out there most of two days with huge trashcans and rakes trying to stay on top of it and clean it up as it washed ashore. We were there over spring break and Easter - the staff really tried to make Easter special for the children with the parade\/show and with the Easter Bunny arriving on the Beach by helicopter. By the way, we did not have children with us, but we thoroughly enjoyed watching the Explorer's Club Team interacting with the children. The children appeared to respect and enjoy the staff, and seemed to really be having a ball! The activities group worked endlessly to keep people engaged - do they ever rest? We travel a lot, and our vacation to Dreams, Punta Cana is the one we always look forward to; we come home relaxed, rejuventated, and anxious for our next trip there! We love it, and already have our next vacation planned. We have referred many people there, and every single one of them has come back to tell us how pleased they were with everything! Kudos to the managers and staff at Dreams!!
