{"text":"WHAT panoramic view??? I expressly booked a 'Panoramic' view, expecting a more than 180 degree window or something similar. What we got was a 'standard' king room with a standard window. The view !!) was ridiculous: a glimpse of the city through two massive towers blocking our view: HOW DARE THEY CALL THIS PANORAMIC VIEWS!!! The harbour view room, although requested was no longer available despite us checking in as early as 1.30 pm, VERY DISAPPOINTING and NO MENTION of this on theri website!!!. I did check with reception, thinking we were given a wrong room but was told that all rooms up to the 8th floor are standard deluxe rooms, as the view is blocked by the buildings and anything above that was 'panoramic view'. But hey: our view was ALSO blocked by buildings and we didn't even get the requested harbour view, so WHY is this called a panoramic view, sounds like a con to me, so I tried to negotiate the price down to the standard deluxe rooms (S$35 + tax cheaper) on the basis that basis THAT we didn't actually have a view either but they didn't budge, HOW CRAP IS THAT! If you would like a view and closer proximity to an MRT station at a comparable price, DO go to the Stamford which is MUCH better value. Looking at their mid week prices at around S$300+ through their own website that's absolutely ridiculous!! Just as well we only stayed a night on the Friday at their weekend rate of S$175 (+ tax); otherwise I would have been fuming to get such an average room, well below average view at a premium 5-star rate. I would class this hotel a 4 rather than a 5-star based on our rooms and would suggest that they also offer the city view panoramic rooms at their standard deluxe rate, otherwise customers like me feel well cheated!
