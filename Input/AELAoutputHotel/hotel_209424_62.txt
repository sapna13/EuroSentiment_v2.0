{"text":"a sad old lady I checked in with my sister on 4\/25 and we were told ourrequest for a room with a view and kitchen only had a kingbed but for an additional $30. a night we could have one with 2 doublesso we took the upgrade. Part of this hotel has apparentlybeen sold to some time-share outfit so the section sold withthe main large pool was closed off leaving us with the verysmall pool between the Ilikai and the Hilton where a hugeconstruction project is going on. Cranes and constructionnoise all day long. Plus, attendees at a yoga teacher classbeing held on the premises took their break about 1015ameach day and at least 50 bodies dripping with sweat cooledoff in the pool. They apparently thought shower before entering the pool meant a shower when they got up not after working upa good sweat for a couple of hours. Our room had a lovelyview overloking the yacht harbor and ocean and wascomfortable with comfortable beds and duvet bedding whichwas immaculate. We had to call a couple of times to have theroom cleaned when we returned so made a habit of callingwhen we left to insure a clean room when we returned. Anewspaper was left outside the door the first and last morningwhich was nice to have with the coffee making set-up in theroom. We didn't try the two restaurants as one was only openfor dinner and the other had a sign that it opened at 1130amand it was 11am and I didn't want to wait so went elsewhere.There were delays for the elevators as they were being workedon as was the firealarm system which went off in our roomone afternoon and again one evening about 1130pm; I foundout that it would definitely wake me out of a sound sleep.Maybe they are waiting for the new owner\/management tospruce things up as the entire place just seemed a little shabby.I can remember staying here in the 80's and it was wonderfulbut for the money spent I will stay elsewhere next time.
