{"text":"Great Family Vacation on the Punta Cana Side with added Club Golden I booked a trip for the four of us to the Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana. The Gran Bahia Principe complex where we stayed is home to the Bavaro, Punta Cana, Premier, and Ambar resorts. With the Club Golden we had √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Öccess√à√\u2020\u2022?to both the Punta Cana and the Bavaro areas of the complex. (They are mirrors of on another). The Club Golden does come with some extra amenities so you need to determine for yourself if it worth it. Special check in and dinner reservation is included that alone to me was worth the price I paid. For us it worked out along with the other things we did (as you will read below).The trip was through Funjets \/ VIP travel which made the trip, especially once on property where our representative Amy was extremely helpful in setting up excursions for the family and providing me with a quick an informative introduction to the property.So that I can get this posted before next years vacations I am going to make it more of bullets to help your stay be the most enjoyable.Bring extra cash and tip √à√\u2020\u2022?we over tip √à√\u2020\u2022?and as long as you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e discrete, you will be quite pleased that most of the staff will recognize you and go out of their way for YOU.Also, we brought school supplies for the housekeeping staff for our room. Kids in the DR have free school but parents have to pay for supplies. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a little extra weight to haul the notebooks and stuff but I will tell you we hade no problem with the supplies and general keeping of our room. Also keep in mind the evening staff is different from the daily staff √à√\u2020\u2022?they change out the towels √à√\u2020\u2022?tip them too √à√\u2020\u2022?ditto for the mini-bar (we had extras stacked on top to replenish ourselves.Tip the cooks behind the omelet and crape bars √à√\u2020\u2022?it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ hot back there behind the grille.Invest in Bubba Kegs and take them with you √à√\u2020\u2022?you can get them @ Wal-Mart or Target √à√\u2020\u2022?if I could have had a case of them shipped to me at the resort I could have made quite a profit. Benefit will be in the fact you won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be running back to the pool bar for drinks (a lot) and the ice won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ melt before the drink is gone or you get back into the water.Using VIP for excursions we had the opportunity to have Miguel as our tour rep for a excursion to Soana Island and a second excursion with Bavaro Runners which took us to a Cattle farm and a plantation owned by local families. Both were long days but experiences that the family will never forget. Miguel is an excellent host for his country and has made it tempting to return to DR to stay real soon just to have him as a guide on more excursions.Quick list of bests:Restaurant: Garden GrilleHousekeeping staff member: Idania √à√\u2020\u2022?Building 22Bartender: Only female barkeep in the Bavaro side √à√\u2020\u2022?sorry for not knowing her name. She uses tequila for medicinal purposes while at work √à√\u2020\u2022?cleans the sinuses she claims. See her for your ailments if you know what I mean.Best Palapa at the pool: Located by the hot tub of the main pool, when you stand getting ready to get into the tub and turn around to face the beach it is just off to the right.Overall my family had a great vacation but with any vacation or activity you have to contribute to your own success!
