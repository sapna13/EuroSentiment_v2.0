{"text":"Nice hotel, shame about the mice Stayed here for 5 nights during March whilst on Holiday.Check in was ok, huge disappointment when I got to the room as it was so small I couldn't even walk around most of it, this was after paying for an upgrade to a club room. Spoke to a member of staff and explained that I was a Platinum member and should get a decent room. When I said that it was the smallest room I had ever seen she did say that the hotel did have one room smaller. Luckily we eventually got moved to a room that we could stand up in. Room was clean but for some reason you had to climb over a chair to get into the bathroom. Views from the room consisted of other hotel rooms which was fairly entertaining at times.Club Lounge access was worth paying extra for, great continental breakfast in the morning, free tea\/coffee and biscuits throughout the day and as much beer (Grolsch) and wine as you want in the evening. The lounge had great views over the city and a fantastic outdoor terrace . Club Lounge also had a family of small mice who seemed to be able to move very quickly when they knew you had food, bit off putting during the day but a few bottles of wine and you don't really care as much. Seemed odd that all the staff new about the mice but didn't do much about them. Hotel bar and restaurant (Dorrius) were great and certainly worth a visit. Restaurant can also be booked on top table if you want to collect some points. Anyway, overall a good hotel in a very good location. Complain until you get a decent room and you can't go wrong.
