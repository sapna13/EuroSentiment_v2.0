{"text":"Perfect location, great staff and good value for money. Our family ( me, my husband and our 3 kids) stayed at this hotel in July 2006 and again in February 2007 as part of our visit to the Sapporo Snow Festival in Hokkaido. The hotel is in a great location where we can walk about 10 mins from the nearest JR station where we got off the Narita express. The underground metro station is just at the corner of the hotel. Although, the underground metro is a bit more expensive than the JR, we found that it's more convenient for our family which have 3 small kids (age 9, 6 and 4) as it's station is less crowded than the JR's. From the hotel, it is also a short walk to the other underground station which we took the train to Haneda airport for a flight to Hokkaido.We booked connecting rooms. Rooms are nice, clean and very small. Anyway, we understand that this is Ginza (the most expensive area of Tokyo). The most impressing thing about the hotel is its staffs. Before my trip started, I had booked a hotel in Hokkaido with one of the Japanese website which I used for the first time. I was not sure about the booking so I emailed Mercure Ginza asking for some suggestions. Without my request, one of the staff had called the hotel in Hokkaido and confirmed everything for us. This is really impressed me. I plan to go to Japan again next year for Tateyama - Japan Alps and will definetly stay at the Mercure Ginza Hotel again as part of the trip.
