{"text":"A week in paradise!!! My wife and I visited the Iberostar Bavaro from Oct 24 - Nov 1. Wow wow wow...we had an absolutely amazing week and look forward to coming back!The hotel grounds were exceptional! It was extremely tropical everywhere you look! We especially loved the flamingos, peacocks, ducks, and other birds...which we were able to feed by hand. A huge thrill for bird lovers like us. The food was fantastic--we especially enjoyed the ribeye and veal steaks cooked while you wait, the amazing dark chocolate desserts, pasta cooked to order, pastries, and great European cheeses! We always found something very tasty to eat at the buffets. We ate at the gourmet, Japanese, and Mediterranean. The food was great--and one thing we found was if there are multiple appetizers you wanted to try on the menu--ask for both--ditto for desserts! The rooms were very nice. The beds were very comfortable (though we prefer more supportive pillows), marble everywhere, the toilet was a bit awkwardly placed but nothing too bad. We really liked the separate tub with a hand held wand (great for de-sanding) and the shower was very large, though it was a little odd that the door didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ latch close. We also appreciated that plenty of towels were provided (usually we spread several on the floor (to soak up water that splashed out of the tub or shower. The sunken living room was spacious with comfy seating. The large flat screen tv was nice but we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ use it much. We also really appreciated the balcony which was large enough for both of us to enjoy the table, chair, and love seat\/chaise lounge! All of the drinks in our mini fridge were restocked daily. The pool and pool bar were very nice...though we noticed some floating stuff in the waters. The pool was always cleaned each morning and we later found the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°loaties√à√\u2020\u2022?came from the thatched roofs and palm trees that overhang the pool. A very small price to pay considering the tropicalness. The water was extremely refreshing--especially with drinks from the pool bar in hand. We found it was large enough to never feel crowded. We also liked the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√±each effect√à√\u2020\u2022?..white edges in the shallow part that looked like sand, with the deeper parts shaded darker blue. It was also very relaxing with the palm trees and other lush plants all around. Absolutely phenomenal! The beach was great. The sand was a gorgeous white and extremely fine--meaning you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l bring it back to your room whether you intend to or not. The water was many shades of blue\/blue-green and nearly surreal. We did notice that there seemed to be patches of seaweed along various stretches. Not quite sure if it was just the time of year or what but very noticeable on the light sand. We also noticed the water wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ overly calm and moderate wave action kept the sand stirred up on the beach. Not a problem for us since we enjoyed the waves and body surfed a couple waves.One suggestion take bread\/fruit with you and feed the fish while you are swimming in the ocean...it is amazing to have the fish literally eat out of our hands. Even more fun if you have a mask\/snorkel so you can see just how many fish come out of nowhere! We found there were always plenty of palapas available on the beach as well as the around the pool! We also enjoyed the shark and ray excursion. It was amazing to feel just how soft the rays were underneath--liquid velvet--not to mention the thrill of swimming with sharks. Be prepared for very warm and humid weather regardless of the time of day\/night. We found ourselves sweating by the time we walked from our room (on the beach) to the breakfast buffet. After the first day, we wore our swim suits to breakfast and went to the pool to cool off...not to mention a perfect reason to visit the swim up bar and start the day off with a drink. Enjoy your stay!
