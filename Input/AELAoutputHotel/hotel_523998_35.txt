{"text":"Not too bad, but be aware I got to the hotel at night, so with all the lights it looked fantastic. The frontdesk was a little cold to wards us, but I thought thats how Chinese people must be, and was too tired to really notice much. Got to the room, nice room, excellent view and a warm feeling to the room.Had a shower, and went to the restaurant for some dinner. Was told that they had closed. So went to the shopping center wich is attached to the hotel, and went down to the supermarket, on the bottom floor. Got some noodles. Went back to the room, boilt some water so I could have something to eat.Woke up feeling groggy in the morning, so went for breakfast, as I was very hungry. Got there, nobody to sign me in, so I thought I would wait a few moments. 10 minutes on, nothing. So I walked in, got my buffet breakfast, sat down at a table, when a waiter came running out, and saying, this is a private dinner room, please leave now. He ushered me out, while me other friends were walking in. Our tourguide tried to explain to the waiter that they had booked this room for breakfast, and that I was allowed to eat there. He did not believe this, and got his supervisor, they checked the books, and yes, they saw we had booked the room.As I had already plated my breakfast, I was told I could not take some more as it was all setup for our little group, and my breakfast was cold by then. I asked for toast, which I did get.The remainder of the stay was ok, except on my last day. We went on a tour and I left my mobile in the room (forgot it on the bedside table) When I got back to the room, my mobile had gone. I went to the receptio to complain, and they told me to prove it, that I did not lose it in the city. I was angry, so I called for the manager, and was told he was too busy.Got back home, explained this to my travel agent, they contacted the hotel, and claim that none of this ever happend. I know it did happen, as my friends all know it did..
