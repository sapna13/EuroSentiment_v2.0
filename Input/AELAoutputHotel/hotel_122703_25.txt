{"text":"Above and Beyond This is a luxury hotel in the Dallas Fort Worth Airport Terminal D. I stayed here, as it is ranked the #1 hotel in Dallas, but I did not have a flight. It is not too far from the tourist stops if you are staying here for the weekend. I drive between Texas and Oklahoma and am seeking a mid-way point. I think I've found it.The staff working at this hotel are outstanding. The concierge were very attentive and took care of issues quickly. It was my birthday, and a wonderful concierge sent me a small snack of chocolate covered strawberries. It was so lovely to receive, as I was working on my birthday and was without family.The room is large and clean with a great view of the airport landing strips. The bed had 9 pillows. The bathroom has a separate shower and bath. All amenities are included-- slippers, bathrobe, full-size soaps, nice-smelling shampoo, Starbucks coffee, large TV, etc. I have T-mobile for internet, and the hotel did not charge extra. The pool is fantastic and you have a real treat watching the planes take off and land. The gym has several treadmills and high quality gym equipment. You have a view of the airport as you jog. The spa can get busy, and I could not get an appointment on Saturday short notice.Although you are at the airport, it seems the hotel has made an effort to minimize the noise. If you are very sensitive, you should bring earplugs. I had no problems, but some large 747s can come in at all hours. Terminal D was not very busy, and the concierge can provide you with a pass to pick up dinner, etc.I think the regular price for this hotel is typically $200 if you book far enough in advance or have a corporate rate. The value and service for the price I paid is excellent. A lot of reviews have probably been written for this hotel, as it is in the airport. There is a reason why this place is #1 in Dallas√à√\u2020\u2022?I would say service, cleanliness, location, and attention to detail are the top points.
