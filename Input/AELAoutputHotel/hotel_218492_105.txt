{"text":"Its great I am so fed up with reading negative reviews I am so fed up of reading such negative reports about this resort. We have been to the Dominican Republic for the past seven years, and have stayed at The Grand for the last five of them. When we first stayed there it was a Sunscape Resort, and we thought that is was very good but since it has been taken over and is now The Grand Oasis it has improved immensely.They have built three new buildings; there are now five swimming pools, and twonew restaurants. The staff cannot do enough for you and every one of them will go the extra mile, they are always smiling, are happy and polite. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a shame that some of the guests are not the same, and find fault with everything.The food is great, always fresh, and loads of choice. There is always lots of variation, at windows (the main buffet) as well as the other restaurants. The whole resort is spotless. Unlike other resorts we have stayed at in the Dominican Republic.We have met and made so many friends, both staff and guests, over the years, and still stay in touch with quite a few of them. We arrived home on Tuesday 20th May and I have rebooked for next year already. People ask why we keep going back to the same resort and I answer it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ like going home and they make you feel like part of their family. So why would I need to go anywhere else ","annotations":[]}
