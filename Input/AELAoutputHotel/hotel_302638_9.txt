{"text":"Nusa Dua Bali FANTASTIC!!! We stayed here for 10 days and have to say what a fantastic hotel. We arrived after a very long flight of 16 hours not really knowing what day of the week it was and from the start found evryone to be so friendly.We came here for our honeymoon which a lot of couples also had done in the hotel which was really nice, we upgraded to GOLD and have to say for the extra money its well worth it, upraged to massive room, access to mini bar, room service, massage, laundry you name it we got it!! reccomend the private romantic meal on the beach, we had lobster and ate in the restaurant most evenings, and lunched up by the shops, just meant we avided the buffet which was still very nice but with all inclusives you eat so quickly. The hotel entertainment come round in the evening singing songs on request they are quality!! hotel calefornia was excellent along with loads more ( human dukeboxes )The hotel is clean and the staff can do no more to help you, we had a private tour around the island and it was amazing, if you visit the art galleries guarantee you will come back with some! we took 4 back. The pool is great but is shaded around the edge so sunbathing is done on the beach which is lovely, only negative is there is a lot of watersports going on so not much opportunity to do snorkling or swimming in the sea unless in the roped off area.All in all what a fantastic place and great island the people are frindley and small tips go a long way as they earn pennies a month.Hope this helps, we will def be returning to the island ","annotations":[]}
