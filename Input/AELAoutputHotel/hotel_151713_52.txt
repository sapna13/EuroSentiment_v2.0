{"text":"Huge Rooms, Great for Families We just returned from spending the Thanksgiving holiday week at the Embassy Suites. There were three adults and three children traveling in our party so we booked a two bedroom suite. Once we arrived, our check-in was very smooth. Everything was in order and ready without delay.Our rooms were actually a king suite with an adjoining room with two double beds. We had two bathrooms and three TV's! The rooms were very clean. The only reason I did not give the hotel five stars was that the rooms could use a new coat of paint.We loved the huge breakfast every morning. My teenager also loved the virgin pina coladas every night and we enjoyed the adult ones! The pool was great but the water was a little cool. The kids didn't mind and swam every day. It is a beautiful free form pool surrounded by palm trees.We never heard the planes at night and slept wonderfully. the beds were comfortable and many extra pillows were provided.We ate in the Outback twice and once at the bar. We played in the casino which is a bit on the small side but full of nickel slots.We also ate at the Mi Casitas restaurant and had a great meal. It is in walking distance, only two blocks. We walked to the beach which is also two blocks and had a lovely day on Thanksgiving. We thought this beach was better than the Carolina Park Beach.We drove to Old San Juan twice without any problems and drove to the rain forest.The staff at the Embassy was very helpful. The breakfast chef made pancakes for us even though they weren't serving them that day. The front desk clerk made us copies of various restaurant Thanksgiving Day menus in the area. Maintenance came up right away when we had a problem the first night and fixed it.Great hotel, Great staff!
