{"text":"Best Hotel Service In Singapore We traveled to Singapore on September 21, 2006 and stayed in Singapore for 14 nights. After reading all of the reviews, I had a very hard time choosing a hotel. When I approached my husband, he came up with the idea of staying at a couple of hotels, each for three or four nights. We ended up staying at The Oriental, The Ritz Carlton, The Shangri-la, and The Sentosa Resort and Spa. The Oriental was by far the unanimous favorite. Our stay at the Oriental was phenomenal. The accommodations were exquisite, but more importantly the service was unmatched by any other hotel in Singapore. We stayed in a city suite with club access. We booked the Suite Success package, which included a luxury airport transfer. We were actually arriving by ferry, and the hotel was very nice and willing to pick us up at the ferry terminal. When we exited the ferry terminal (along with 150 other passengers) we greeted by name by the driver (don't ask me how he knew who we were, we are still puzzled over that one) and transferred by Mercedes to the hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted at the steps of the hotel (once again by name) by a very kind lady. She immediately showed us right up to our room where she checked us in. She also provided to us a letter that detailed all of our included amenities during our stay. (This was a very nice touch, since often times you miss out on things that were actually included, because you didn't ask.) Staying in the City Suite was a little more expensive, but well worth the extra money. The extra benefits we received practically paid for themselves. Access to the club lounge, complimentary laundry pressing service, late checkout in the club lounge, fresh fruit, complimentary internet access, and a gigantic room made us feel like we were royalty. There was even an extra 1\/2 bath that was convenient when you have a spouse that hogs the bathroom. Every single employee of the hotel went out of their way to accommodate all of our needs. After a long day at the Singapore Zoo we arrived about 10 minutes late for hors d√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√Øeuvres in the club lounge. We decided to go up to the lounge anyway to get a drink. Upon arrival to the lounge, we were seated and told that they had just put away the food, but she would fill us up a plate in the kitchen (with a little of everything) and bring it to us. She went out of her way, and it made all the difference.When it was time to checkout and move on to the next hotel, we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to leave. For the next 8 days, while staying at the Ritz Carlton and Shangri-la, everything was just okay. Yes, these other hotels are very nice, but compared to the service we received at the Oriental, they were disappointing. My advice to you is, stay at the Oriental. If you are determined to compare the other hotels, just make sure to make the Oriental the last hotel you stay in, because everything else dulls in comparison to the service you receive at the Oriental. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ do what we did, and spend the rest of your trip saying, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??ell, at the Oriental √à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®√î??\u201A√á¬®?When we return to Singapore, we will definitely return and stay the entire trip at The Oriental.
