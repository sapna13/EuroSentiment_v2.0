{"text":"Excellent location, Odd lack of service I stayed at the Century Southern Tower for four nights on a business trip.My room was on the 27th floor and had an amazing view of the city. The room itself was small (but pretty large for Tokyo) and had a fridge and a smallish TV. The bathroom was relatively small, but clean and modern, right down to the electric toilet seat.There are some surprising misses at the Southern Tower. To start with, there's no room service. There are several (pricey!) restaurants on the premises, as well as a convenience store right by the room elevators. There's a beverage vending machine on each floor, but no snacks. Also, there's a pants-pressing machine, but no iron or ironing board, and the staff wanted two days to press and return my shirts, so I wound up going to my meetings somewhat wrinkled.The breakfast buffet was mediocre and expensive. I did eat at the Chinese restaurant with a colleague (my meetings were in the office floors below the hotel) and I thought it was reasonably good. Not to worry, though, there's a Starbucks just about 100 feet from the entrance, as well as a Krispy Kreme (with a permanent and lengthy queue) for breakfast. A little further away, there's an excellent bakery near the New South Exit of the Shinjuku station.The location is great - only footsteps from the Shinjuku station (use the Southern TERRACE Exit, not the South Exit) and is right near great shopping - Takashimaya and Tokyu Hands are right across the tracks. There are also lots of great food choices in the vicinity.Overall, I enjoyed my stay, but I really wish they had irons in the room...
