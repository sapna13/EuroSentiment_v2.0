{"text":"Catered for the French If your not French dont go to this resort. They have special treatment for the French. They have there own activities, entertainment team, activity planner, specific place on the resorts are only reserved for them and signs around the resorts are in French. They should just make this resort as exclusive for French only.Most of the staff only speaks Spanish or French. FOOD - Same everyday some our recycled.ENTERTAINMENT- Lame ....Stayed at the Allegro last year the entertainment was amazing much much better than the Grand.ROOMS- Just the average.Some problems like the shower heads keep falling down.The toilet handle does not go up. The faucet leaks water all over the sink. STAFF- Most of the staff are not friendly at all but there are a few that were.BEACH - Thumbs up on this one. No seaweeds at all.SWIMMING POOL - Average Advice if you really have to go.Do not bother tipping the maid 1 dollar a day. It did not make any difference with us. If you start leaving a dollar and stop in giving in the middle of your stay they give you attitude.Time share people will attack outside the buffet. When you finish having lunch or breakfast they are all outside the restaurant waiting.Here is a good advice how to avoid them. I have my Spanish friend write a few small note on a little paper in spanish that says you are not interested in timeshare. I wrote a few and kept it in my pocket and gave it to them everytime they approach me and they leave us alone everytime they read the note.Overall I would rate this hotel average and would give Allegro better rating than this resort.
