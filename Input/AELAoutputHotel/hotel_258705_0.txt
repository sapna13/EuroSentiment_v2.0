{"text":"Great Fenway\/BU location This was our 4th stay at the Commonwealth in the past year and we find no reason to try anywhere else. A new hotel, it sits right on Kenmore Square and is one block from Fenway Park and at the east end of the Boston University campus. There is a subway station below the hotel\/square and we walk to all parts of the Back Bay, including Newberry Street (about 4 blocks away). Since we have a child attending BU, it is a perfect location for us. Also great if you are going to Fenway Park. Otherwise, there may be better located hotels to Boston in general. However, the Commonwealth is extremely clean and upscale with an excellent staff. The rooms either overlook Fenway Park or Kenmore Square. Not much of a Fenway view (the back of the green monster and some seats) and it also overlooks the parking lot and freeway. The Kenmore rooms are a little larger but also cost more. Also, if you need two queens, they tend to be the Fenway rooms. Having stayed in both, I actually think the Fenway rooms are preferable if price matters to you. The rooms are all well decorated and the beds are very comfortable.Hotel amenities are very good. Internet access is easy, maid service and turndown service with great sweet wafers on your pillow were flawless. The gym is small but looks brand new. Room service is excellent and prompt. The front desk staff is very helpful and the dinner recommendations have been excellent. There are two highly rated restaurants in the hotel but we have not tried them. They have a parking lot in back for your car, a rental car counter in the hotel, the subway\/bus station in front and we have never had to wait for the doorman to get us a cab. The umbrellas by the front door have come in handy as well. If you have a need to be in this area of Boston (or Boston in general), this is a near new, upscale hotel that we highly recommend.
