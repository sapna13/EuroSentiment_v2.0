{"text":"Terrible Service, especially if you book with Hotwire On arriving we had to wait for the front desk staff at the main building to finish playing with their hair before being checked in. They asked if we wanted a smoking or non-smoking king room and we said non-smoking. We had been put in the notorious beach building around the corner and across the street. As we entered the corridor there was an odd odour of car fumes and cigarettes but trusted the staff hadn't given us a smoking room. On entering the room the smell was awful, there was someone elses hair attached to the ceiling of the bathroom and the bed was clearly a single room. We couldn't understand it when I had signed a document at check in that said it was a non smoking king. We had a terrible nights sleep as we were on the ground floor and had buses and people being loud outside our room. As soon as we got up (not that I got much sleep - I didn't feel very safe) we asked the front desk in our building to move us. The room we moved to was twice the size and clearly a non-smoking room. The front desk, bell man etc in the beach house building are not reliable, half the time they were closed. When I needed quarters for the laundry (don't use the drier, your clothes would dry faster by blowing on them) we had to go all the way to the other building because they don't have any at the beach building. The internet was not working in our building as well. I am certain that we were given a single room because when collecting quarters a man at the front desk said we wanted to move from one and the number of his room put it in the same position as ours but on a different floor. In short, I wouldn't stay here again. They have poor customer service, unequal access to facilities based on where they put you and did not give me a room for 2 when that was what I paid for. It did not feel safe either. ","annotations":[]}
