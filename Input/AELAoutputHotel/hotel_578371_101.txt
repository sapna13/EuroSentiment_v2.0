{"text":"Our trip in November 2008 WE stayed 10 days in this lovely hotel. I would like to give my appreciation and thanks to the following people who made our stay extra special: They are PEDRO at10BBY bar,he always wisle as a bird and my husband would wisle back to him at the bar every evening before dinner. Very special people at the buffet restorants are : Jose, Omar and Jacquilin who made effords to make our wishes true (example I like to drink cranberry juice with lunch and there I had crambbery juice with lunch)Regarding maintanance: The clock in our room needed 9 V battery which after 10 days and 10 calls was not available. This was very important as we booked San Domenico tour and needed to be in lobby at 6:10AM, I went to receptionist in person and asked to wake up call which never came!!!!! If we were not by pure chance at 6:10AM in lobby we would loose $190.00.There are 3 showers slall at the pool by the building 2 none of them working. I aked 4-5 different people to fix at least one because it would be easier for them to maintan the pool clean and not have so much sand in the pools because peple are not able to wash off before going to the pool. I bet showers are still not in operations. There are so many maintainace people which I think need closer supervision.,All people smile,not because they have to but from the heart! ","annotations":[]}
