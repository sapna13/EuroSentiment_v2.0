{"text":"Wow!! We booked this hotel because our first choice, based on this website, Hotel Nikko was unavailable. Having stayed in the Langham Place I'm glad.Langham Place is in the bustling area of Mongkok. The hotel is attached to a shopping centre which has a food court with an immense variety of food outlets. It is also surrounded by streets full of shops and markets which have an unbelievable atmosphere both during the day and at night.The hotel itself wholeheartedly deserves it's 5* rating. The quality, efficiency and warmth of the staff, from the moment you step out of the taxi is wonderfull. Little touches such as the beautiful scent which greets you when you walk in, to the refreshing towels the staff give you whilst you are checking in make the experience, for someone who doesn't normally book 5* unless the rate is too good to miss.The room we booked was an executive room and we were more than happy with the standard of comfort and cleanliness. The bed was huge and we were offerred a choice of differently scented pillows. Having already read the reviews on the TA website we were well aware that the wall between the ensuite and the main bedroom was made of glass and we found this added to the feeling of space in the room. Besides that if you wanted you could watch the Plasma TV from the bath if you wanted.It was quite hot in Hong Kong when we were there which we were not expecting and so we found that upon returning to the hotel after a long days sightseeing and shopping we needed to refresh and shower. The main thing which impressed us was that when the staff came to turn down the bed in the evening they also completely cleaned and replenished the bathroom and shower area again rather than wait until the next morning.We eat breakfast in the hotel on a couple of mornings and the choice was wide ranging and excellent. I particularly liked the fact that the honey was from a honeycomb. We also spent most evenings in the bar which had an excellent Canadian jazz singer on most nights. The atmosphere was congenial, the choice of drinks good and should you get hungry they had an excellent display of fresh seafood (oysters etc) for you to choose from.All in all I would have to say this hotel has it all. I worried initially that it's location away from the harbour would be inconvenient but the MTR was right on the doorstep and the surrounding streets were lively and vibrant. We will definitely be back.
