{"text":"Mixed Feelings The location is great. The 1st room they assigned me was a suite that had faux backlit panels instead of windows. I changed into a tiny room but at least it had a window. There were no drawers and the only shelf was filled with minibar stuff so I had to put those on the floor so I could put my clothes somewhere. In the bathroom there is no place to hang your used towel which makes the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ülease decide for yourself√à√\u2020\u2022?notice fatuous. Hanger space is very small. 5 hangers and your clothes are pressed against each other. Of course there is a minibar and the checker came in about 4 times in one morning. No kettle, no couch, no luggage rack. I had to stuff the suitcase under the writing desk. Luckily it just fit. The room aircon was a strange metal plate hanging off the ceiling which was cool to the touch but did nothing for the room. Service is where the hotel shines. For a very busy hotel the reception staff is efficient and friendly. When I asked for an iron and 2 pillows I had barely put down the phone when they arrived. Internet speed was lightning fast. So don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect to put up your feet and relax in your room. But you will not be waiting around for service when you request it. The breakfast is in total contrast to the room, ie very ample, with a huge tea selection and good egg chef.
