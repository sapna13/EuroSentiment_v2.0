{"text":"Extremely annoyed and disappointed! We booked the Hyde Park Inn Sydney as a base to stay whilst we did the City 2 Surf Walk in August. It looked lovely on the website and got pretty good TA reviews so we thought we'd be fine. I rang them direct and booked a non smoking 2 bedroom unit for 5 nights and was given a quoted price, I mentioned how we would be doing the City 2 Surf Walk and how convenient it would be for us. My husband's secretary then rang and arranged payment, only to be told that the rates would be higher as it was the City 2 Surf weekend. They would not budge on it despite her explaining they had already quoted a rate. I then rang them and was told the same thing. I explained to them that they knew full well it was the weekend of the walk as I had mentioned it to them. They reluctantly agreed and we were given the orginal quoted rate. The unit itself was fine, despite a strong cigarette smoke smell in the hallways outside the room. As mentioned previously it has a full sized kitchen with everything you need to self cater. Our problems began on the second day when we came home from our day to find the room had been cleaned but no rubbish removed from the kitchen bench and the tea towel rolled up in a wet ball and not even replaced. I didn't complain as I figured it was just a simple oversight. However, when the same thing happened the next day and not only was rubbish left on the bench but food scraps and crumbs plus the tea towel still wasn't replaced I did go down to reception and complain. They were very apologetic and staff were sent up within 5 minutes to rectify the problem. Then my Mother's shawl went missing after the sheets had been changed so I alerted them to the fact and said that I imagine the shawl had accidently got caught up in the laundry and taken away. The receptionist's reply was to the effect of Well that's gone then! I had to push to get them to contact the laundry and find out what had happened to it and have it sent on to us. Not once did they apologise. Insult to injury was then added when I went up pick up the shawl from the Post Office and they had sent it C.O.D.! I rang them and spoke to a very nice gentleman who assured me they would recompense me ASAP and they were very sorry. I then waited 10 days for this to arrive! I will never stay there again certainly not recommend it to anyone else as I feel their service was sadly lacking which is a shame as it is a great location and most of the staff were very pleasant.
