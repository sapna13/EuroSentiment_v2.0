{"text":"Not as bad as I feared Hotel Manofa is located in Damrak street, only a 500 meters from the central station. After what we have heard about this hotel in advance (rats everywhere and crappy rooms) we feared the worst. But it was not as bad as that. The first impression was very good, the staff was very friendly and the lobby was relatively nice. As most small hotels in Amsterdam it was quite narrow and the hallways and stairs suffered from that. Small and narrow. The rooms were OK, but smelled kind of funky, a weired mixture of alcohol and old socks... Another thing was that there were almost no light in one of the rooms, probably because most of the light bulbs were disappeared.... In one of the lamps we also found a small bag of something, perhaps magic mushrooms or an old space cake. Apart from this the rooms seemed to be just fine! Except for the mouse and rats of course, we heard them every night, but we never saw them. When we looked beneath the wardrobe we saw a lot of mouse crap which did not look very nice. But the room had no mouse holes or any other small holes so I doubt that those small [-] could get in to the room itself, they keep in the walls. The best thing about the hotel was the location, close to the red light district, central station and dam square. The price was also very good, we paid 515 euro for five persons for three nights.The worst things were the smelly rooms which seemed to be out of air every morning, even with open windows and the missing light bulbs during the whole stay. The mice did not bother us, but it could be kind of creepy for more sensitive people. It is most certainly NOT the place you bring your girlfriend for a romantic stay. But for people who want to party and do not care about if or where they sleep, it is excellent.
