{"text":"Great hotel with great service We stayed at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe for eleven days, using our Hilton Honors points, and we were extremely satisfied with our stay to the point that I wrote thank you notes to many of the staff and sent a summary writeup to the customer service manager of this hotel. We were fortunate in getting a room upgrade that had a balcony, and access to the executive lounge. As many flights from the U.S. arrive early in the morning, it is important that the hotel expedite room availability upon arrival. The hotel let us check in at the lounge and then expedited our room for us, while we had breakfast in the lounge. A full breakfast is provided each day with a wide variety of food including an excellent machine that makes all forms of coffee ranging from espresso to cappucino's. You could also request a full pot of regular American style coffee. One nice thing about this hotel is that most of the key staff speak English and French and this is very handy, especially for those of us who have never been to France before. The concierge staff were really helpful in providing directions (very necessary in Paris), and restaurant recommendations. We also received help over and above the call of duty when I had my wallet stolen on the Paris Metro. The hotel customer service manager on duty called all of our credit card companies for us gratis, and arranged for an interpreter to accompany us to the local police station to report our loss. This helped to reduce our distress immensely. We also used the restaurant on two occasions and had excellent reasonably priced meals (by Paris standards) both times. Each night we had a different chocolate treat awaiting us, and we were able to use the executive lounge about 75% of our time at the hotel. This enabled us to get by with buying an average of one meal a day in Paris, which helped to minimize the horrendous $-Euro exchange rate. Our room was very nice, and very tastefully decorated, with a nice bathroom with excellent amenities, including luxurious towels. The room had a coffee\/tea maker, a minibar, and iron and ironing board. The hotel is situated on the right bank in a business district, with two Metro stations nearby. We were able to get to almost any destination in Paris within 20-30 minutes maximum. If you are a Hilton Honors member there is no better way to maximize your points than staying at this hotel.
