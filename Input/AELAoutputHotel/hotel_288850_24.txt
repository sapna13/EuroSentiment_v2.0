{"text":"Good quality Business Hotel Am currently spending quite a bit of time in Amsterdam and as I am working in Amstelveen it is easier to stay nearer to work than head all of the way into Amsterdam. I generally dont think the standard of hotels in Amsterdam is great and if working there, tend to stay in the Hilton. But to avoid the longer journey, I have chosen to stay here every week now for a few weeks. And I have to say the quality of this hotel is really good. Rooms are clean, everything is open and spacious....good internet connection: though a bit pricey at √à√\u2020√ü?9 at night.... overall a very good business hotel...free shuttle also from the airport. Wouldnt be too keen on staying here if holidaying in amsterdam (costs √à√\u2020√ü?5 taxi from hilton) but fine if you want to be near airport. Food is a bit boring but then again that is only if you spend 20 nights in 1 month there...one thing: √à√\u2020√ü?3 for breakfast is a bit spicey. Be aware there is nothing around this area so can be very boring and if there for lesure best to head into town for accommodation. There is a nice walk in Amsterdamsebos (wooded area) near the hotel and the hotel give bikes out for free...and you can also get some nice restaurants in nearby Amstelveen. Note it is built near the original airport and now the area for provate planes etc...but I have not experienced any noise disruption there. Good hotel in all...but time for a change I think...for me at least ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1086,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1082},{"endOffset":1209,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1205}]}
