{"text":"A tourist trap but still excellent! We arranged the Rolls Royce transfer to collect us which was lovely. A staff member met us off the plane and took us to immigration where there was a huge queue so they went on ahead and collected our luggage. Water and cold towels were given to us in the bakc of the car and it was a perfect start to our stay.We were welcomed by name and taken to the check in and then shown to our room by the check in lady. The room we had booked was a Grand Deluxe habour view. Very well equiped room, large in size with a seating area, desk etc. The view was out of this world. I can not put it into worlds! You have the best view from here for the light show that is at 8pm every evening over the habour.The staff were helpful but soooooooooooooo many tourists were in and out of the main areas that it did not feel that exclusive. There is a shopping arcade on either side of the lobby with some top dollar shops but again it attracts more 'non guests'.The spa is definately worth a visit. There is a lifestyle shower which is fun and various steam rooms\/saunas\/relaxation rooms which all over look the habour. Extremely good service too.The business center is only opened til 5pm and they charge for the internet which is not what many 5 * hotels do now. However they did open it for us one evening which was kind.Beware on the first Sunday of the month they have a tea dance in the lobby and afternoon tea is served in all of the restaurants which get booked up early and means that there is no where for you to use unless you have a booking. We eneded up going to the airport early as it was extremely busy and no where in the hotel could we get a coffee!Felix restaurant\/ bar has excellent views if you do not stay here but there is a smart dress code.Overall, its worth it if you get a room with the habour view. If you do not want to stay in a 'tourist attraction' then think again. The atmosphere would feel better if they restricted the amount of tourists. It felt a bit like the Bellagio in Las Vegas at times!!
