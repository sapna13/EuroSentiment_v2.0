{"text":"Exceptional hotel! This was a business trip, so our travel agency booked me this hotel (our office is near here). I've stayed at a few Starwood properties - I'm SPG gold. This was by far the best experience I've had at a Sheraton, and maybe at any hotel.The staff here is simply amazing. Everyone from the bell desk to the concierge is so friendly, it feels as if you're doing them a huge favor by asking something of them - as if all they want most in the world is to help you. Wow. I could get used to this!The included breakfast buffet is western style, but with the addition of dim sum, as it's in the Chinese restaurant. The other restaurant I tried is the Cafe California, a French restaurant with Japanese influence. I had the full 6 course French meal, which was excellent.They have a bus that will run you to and from the JR Yamanote line - aka the Green Line, which runs around the perimeter of 'downtown' Tokyo. If you don't want to deal with the bus or are planning to be out after 10 when the bus stops, ask the concierge for a map of how to walk to the hotel from either of the very close subway stations. This makes the Miyako hotel an excellent base for exploring the city. Even getting here and away is easy, as the 'Airport Limosine (really a bus) stops here.All in all, I'm very impressed, and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, should the need arise for me to return to Tokyo.
