{"text":"Perfect My new husband and I just loved this hotel! (we were married in Sicily on this trip) Everyone was so friendly and helpful. While checking in we mentioned that we had just gotten married and ten minutes later a delicious bottle of perfectly chilled champagne was brought to our room along with nuts and crackers. We enjoyed this on our private terrace overlooking the River Arno. We drank and watched the sun set behind the buildings, reflecting in the river... it was gorgeous!Also while checking in, we went ahead and had the staff book our tours of the Academy Gallery (Michelangelo's David is there), and the Ufffizi Gallery. They were delighted to do this for us(tip: have cash). We were at the end of a two week trip and needed to wash some clothes. We were told where we could do this ourselves (just a short walk from the hotel), but we opted to have the hotel send our laundry out for us first thing in the morning. We had it back that evening around 8 or so (fine, since dinner is later that 8!). It really didn't cost much at all. I don't have anything bad to say about this hotel. We had a double room, and the room size was fine. Tastefully decorated. Large closet space with a lot of hangers. Bed was comfortable. I was so happy to have a real shower stall after only having a hole in the floor in Rome(another review of mine). My husband and I have a problem with bathtowels when we travel. Some hotels give you these paper-thin things they try to pass as towels that don't even absorb any water. Not so here... Hotel River has some great, big, absorbant towels! We were very happy.I've already told everyone to stay here if they are blessed with the chance to visit beautiful Firenze. Rest assured, we will be back, and we will stay at The Hotel River!
