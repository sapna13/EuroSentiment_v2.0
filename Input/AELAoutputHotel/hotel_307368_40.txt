{"text":"Marvellous Hotel I was lucky enough to stay at this fantastic hotel for 2 weeks at the start of July.From the moment our Friendly Airport Limousine arrived at the hotel you could tell it was special, a group of hotel staff i can only describe as ushers showed us up to our room from the 2nd floor entrance through the 41st floor lobby to our room on the 48th floor.For the first time in a holiday (vacation to you yanks) there was no need to go upto the concierge and check in as all the hotel staff knew who we were and therefore the check in process was extremely painless and minimalistic captioned down to just signing a form and handing over the room key when in place in your room.Now i'll turn my attention to the hotel. I'll stop at this moment and allow you to all construct an image in your minds about what a high-class 5 star hotel should be like. Now this is what the Park Hyatt Tokyo is like, i've stayed at various hotels across the world that claim to be 5 star but fail and are more like a 4star + if you catch my drift. The Park Hyatt Tokyo is the real deal.Everything about the hotel oozes quality and excellence. The 3 restaurants on offer; New York Grill; Girandole and Kozue all offer fantastically well prepared foods that'll make your tastebuds sizzle. New York Grill is primarily a steak restaurant (hence the grill part in the name) where i had one of the nicest steaks ever; Girandole is a mediterranean restaurant serving a wide variety of foods from Spaghetti Bolognese to shellfish and a Moroccon stew whereas Kozue does all things Japanese (sushi, sashimi etc.)I stayed in a Park Deluxe Room with a view of Mt. Fuji for the two weeks i was there, and it was easily the biggest and best hotel room i've been in, the bathroom is a work of art by itself but with the 40 Hitachi Plasma TV and the sheer amount of space coupled with the comfy beds make the room sheer perfection personified.The contemporary look throughout the hotel is helped by the ornate decorations and interiors throughout the entire hotel from the lobby bar\/lounge area which greets you when you arrive by lift (elevator to people from the US) from the 2nd floor reception area is fantastic with great views across the city to the small touches that make this hotel truly special such as the marble\/lush carpet mixed flooring or the dim mood lighting when entering the toilets on the main lobby floor.If you choose the Park Deluxe room with a view of Mt Fuji, the view is absolutely fantastic and well worth the extra money from the standard room aswell as the other features mentioned above, however a big mention should be towards the total friendliness throughout the hotel, from the baggage handlers on the 2nd floor entrance to the concierge\/secretaries in the Business centre the service is 2nd to none...and you are reassured of this when fruit is delivered to your room with a letter from the general manager every 3 days with mineral water from a Japanese spring delivered to your room everyday by the maids.Everything about this hotel is a sheer marvel, sure it's an expensive hotel to stay in with breakfast sometimes costing √ä√£¬¢40 ($80) and a 3 course meal at the New York Grill costing √ä√£¬¢175 ($350) with the room costing close to √ä√£¬¢200 ($400) a night....but if you have the money there really is no other option for a holiday (vacation) in Tokyo, and i know i'd choose the Park Hyatt Tokyo again if i ever return to Tokyo in the future and if you have the money i urge you all to aswell...you won't be dissappointed.
