{"text":"great location,price and staff Great hotel for a good price and great location. My wife and I stayed overnight after our cruise ended in Puerto Rico. The hotel is a short walk from the pier and about a 15 minutes taxi ride to the airport.The hotel staff was friendly and courteous and allowed us to leave our luggage in a safe area as we arrived at 10:30am and check-in wasn't till 3:00 pm. This hotel is centrally located in old San Juan making everything within walking distance. There are shops up and down the street if you want to get a taste of the Puerto Rican culture.We happened to book the last available room for the night and it was in the front or street side of the hotel. I would suggest you book early and get a room in the back. I don't think this is a problem unique to the Hotel Milano as the streets are narrow in old San Juan with lots of vehicle traffic.Also there was a large festival in the town square of Old san Juan during our stay which may have affected he noise factor.My wife and walked through the streets at night and felt safe and the locals are very friendly with directions. The breakfast in the morning is adequate and the manager is a very nice fellow.I was very pleased with the Hotel Milano and if you check prices for other hotels in the area they are very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this hotel. ] ","annotations":[]}
