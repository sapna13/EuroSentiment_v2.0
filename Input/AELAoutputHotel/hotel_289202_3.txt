{"text":"Best Value For Money Small but perfect in many ways.Nothing beats a 3-Star Hotel with a 5-Star service and accommodation offer! The staff ensure constant personalised  friendly assistance. Your stay here is guaranteed to be comfortable, pleasant and hassle free. Conveniently located within a 5 minute walk from the central bus terminus at Piazzale Roma (the final stop for all vehicles before Venice) and situated directly opposite (across the Grand Canal) the Train Station, you are perfectly set within reach of all major attractions. The Vaporetto (public water bus service) from close to the Train Station here is only √à√\u2020√ü?.50 to Piazza San Marco.The hotel staff will surprise you with their unsurpassed knowledge of current events in the city, cultural or historical exhibtions and more. The rooms are incredibly decorated in the style reminiscent of pure Venetian romance. They are kept constantly preened and spotless by their 'attention to detail' housekeepers. I loved walking in to find a Baci chocolate on my pillow every night and I would let it slowly melt in my mouth while I smiled like the princess I imagined myself to be while gazing out of my window onto the Canale Grande.The breakfast was always fresh with a wide choice of healthy food items to choose from or for those who want to indulge  spoil themselves during their stay, there is always a delectable spread of tarts, fresh crossants and other mouth-watering goodies!I highly recommend the place. It's the best value for money anyone can get around venice....and believe me, the staff's genuine friendly attitude is priceless. I am definitely returning for a personal vacation with my partner and shall mark this hotel as my top choice!Francesca VincentiMalta ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1017,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1008},{"endOffset":1397,"mention":"tarts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tart"],"startOffset":1392}]}
