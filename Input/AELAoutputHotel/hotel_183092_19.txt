{"text":"A great base My wife and I have just spent 4 nights at this hotel and would highly recommend it as a base from which to explore Toronto and Niagara Falls.The lobby renovations did not negatively impact our stay and appear to be almost complete. The sports bar, 'Characters' did the job of the lobby bar during the day, serving drinks only but then around 4pm each day they began serving food from their bar menu.The hotel was very busy as the CFL Grey Cup was being played at the Rogers Centre on the evening of Sunday 25 November. Being from England, we didn't know a thing about the Grey Cup until we got to Toronto and people kept asking us if that was the reason we were visiting!We paid a shade over $100 Canadian dollars per night and our room was great. Nice and big with the most comfortable bed ever (as noted by previous reviewers), a large LCD TV and all the usual stuff you get with a Marriott hotel. The hotel definitely has something of a 'business' feel to it but its location means it is perfectly situated for leisure travellers too. There is a walkway which leads directly from the hotel to the Eaton Centre which in turn is connected to the PATH system of underground walkways. There are 2 subway stations accessible from the Eaton Centre too.The staff were all superb, plenty of smiles and only too willing to help. None of them would accept a tip - 'No thankyou, its all part of the service, sir' was the reply when I tried tipping the doorman or bellman.We paid a small amount to have a late checkout (6.00 pm) as we were not flying home until 11.00 pm and it was nice to be able to leave or bags in the room and then go back and shower before leaving for the airport.All in all, a most enjoyable stay in Toronto with the Toronto Marriott Eaton Centre as a perfect base.
