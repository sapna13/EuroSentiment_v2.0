Keep your small issues small and you will enjoy, our rule was not to let anything ruin our trip, and keep positive, and we had a great timePlease feel free to PM me if you have any questions, and if you are going to this resort have fun and realize how lucky we are to be able to go, there are alot of people that will never have a trip like this in ther lives.p.s. try the spanish coffee or irish coffee and a mama wana in the evening, your significat other will be happy, lol ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2405,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2399},{"endOffset":2421,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2415}]}
