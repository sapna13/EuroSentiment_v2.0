{"text":"Beyond Excellente! My sister and I have unfortunately just returned home from a trip to Excellence, Punta Cana. The word Excellence does not even begin to describe my experience at this resort!!From the moment we stepped foot into the resort it was hello's and smiles all around. The front desk staff was very friendly and welcoming.Chez Isabelle, the French Restaurant was wonderful. We ate there four out of five nights. The two Kelvins were the reasons we kept going back. Our last night, Kelvin M was scheduled to work in the kitchen, we were so upset, but Rafael went out of his way to accomodate us rearranged the schedule so Kelvin was able to be our waiter the last night of our vacation.The entertainment staff was truly excellente! Francisco, Luis Camilo, Luciano, Isabel, Ines  Franklin were the BEST! They are the reason we are looking into booking another trip for (hopefully) August. They went out of their way to make our vacation wonderful. They were all smiles, all the time, no matter what time day or night. We took dance lessons, Spanish lessons  water aerobics with Francisco and had so much fun doing all of them (none of these I would consider fun at home, but his enthusiasm made them fun so I wanted to do them). I have to say one of the best parts of the day was the club dance, so much fun! We bought the CD and have been listening to Taki Taki since we got home. I loved Excellence and would recommend it to anyone. This vacation was BEYONE EXCELLENTE!!!
