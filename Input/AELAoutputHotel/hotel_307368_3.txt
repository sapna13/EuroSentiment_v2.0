{"text":"One of the world's best This is the kind of place you hope all of your friends can visit at least one time in their lives. It's a phenomenal hotel with breathtaking views and the best service you can imagine (frankly probably better than you imagine). The rooms are spacious (in a place where space is very scarce), with a great modern, clean Japanese style. The lobby's on the 47th floor (If I remember correctly) and your room will be higher, this is on top of the fact that the hotel is on a hill anyways, so the views are great. If you go out late or are jetlagged, you can catch the sunrise and Mount Fuji on a clear day. The New York Grill on the top floor is not to be missed. Your steak will cost a lot (at least $100 US) but it will melt in your mouth and you will remember it. Also, be sure to go to the gym and swimming pool which are very nice and also have great views. The one (slight) negative is the location. While its near the Shinjuku station, its a 15 minute walk to anything exciting. You'll probably have to take taxis. If you want to explore without taxis, just take one to Shinjuku station and go from there (lots happening around there) -- the hotel also operates shuttles to there. One last thing... The concierge service is world class. They helped us plan a trip all around Japan, making all necessary arrangements for us. ","annotations":[]}
