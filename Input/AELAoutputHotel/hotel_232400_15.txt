{"text":"Very friendly hotel This small hotel has a narrow entrance squeezed in between a pizza place and a Wok to Go take-away with rooms on 5 floors, via steep narrow steps. The hotel is Dutch-Finnish owned with mostly staff from Finland and with Finnish magazines in the reception area. Room info is in English, Dutch and Finnish. The staff are VERY friendly. I got a big room for myself alone, bright, nicely decorated, with big desk, a TV on the wall, flat screen but not wide sreen, 35 channels via the cable, incl. BBC 1 and 2 and BBC World. Nice bathroom with shower.I did not find it noisy, even being on the street side. It is very clean, good beds (3 in my triple room). Price I paid was 99 Euro through a Dutch website [--], cheaper than via Booking.com. No credit card needed via this website I used.Not cheap but normal for Amsterdam. Location is very near Dam square, opposite rooms of the 5-star Krasnapolsky, ideal location I think, walking distance from central station and most sights in Amsterdam.For eating dinner in your room the next-door take-aways are ideal and cheap. No minibar in hotel room, no airco but a table fan, which I found to be VERY necessary in summer. Without it it would be too hot for me in summer in this hotel, but the fan means of course the room will not be quiet at night.In the reception you can get drinks and even toiletries. in bathroom there's only a dispenser on the wall, bring own toiletries. All in all a good place to stay, especially outside summer months. I am Dutch but stayed here because of a very early flight and evening activity in Amsterdam. Had to leave to early to say anything about breakfast but it is served in the room.
