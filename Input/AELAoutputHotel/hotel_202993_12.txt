{"text":"Fantastic I was totally speechless upon entering the small sleek lobby of the Continentale. The contemporary decor and art on the walls sets the tone immediately and tells you this place is different. It is simply one of the best small luxury hotels I have ever stayed at. The room was impeccable, with pure white curtains and bed canopy, the ultra chic decor includes washed wood and leather accessories, the bathroom is worth of a magazine article, with a stunning flat sink and rain shower. There is a relaxation room overlooking the entrance of the Ponte Vecchio and the Arno river, I took naps on the corner chaise, looking at passersby below. The breakfast is plentiful and of course, you are in Italy, so the food is inexplicably tasteful and fresh. The location, at the entrance of the Ponte Vecchio is very convenient if you want to stroll the area and do some shopping, most of the better shops are located within a radius of 500m of the hotel. They will make reservations for you if you want to visit the Uffizi Galleries, which I recommend, since there are long lines no matter what time. The staff is very friendly and just plain classy. There is a fab work out room in the basement, with a steam room and a sauna. The hotel is very small and compact, but the sensation of being in the heart of Florence in such a pristine environment is unforgettable. I recommend this hotel to couples, business travelers staying for a short stay or if you are traveling alone and want to feel special.
