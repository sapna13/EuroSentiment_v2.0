{"text":"Humungous hotel, great location and value for money Stayed at this 2,800-room hotel in Tokyo Dec 2007. Great price as part of package from ExpediaLOCATIONThe JR-Line and Metro train stations are literally across the road, so couldn't get any better. Located south of central Tokyo, i guess you could say. A couple of convenience stores, a shopping centre w\/ many restaurants and larger supermarket\/dpt store closeby. Really goodSERVICEAgain, this was also not to be faulted. Checkin\/out was straightforward. When room service was used (as I did on several occasions - i can be fussy when i want to be!) the queries were answered promptly and I don't know any Japanese so this could have been a barrier but thankfully wasn't as hotel staff mostly had a basic grasp.ROOMSDifferent towers of the hotel are reported to have rooms of varying size\/quality. I stayed in the Main Tower and it was fine, a bit dated but the bathroom was well-suited for our needs and looked modern\/clean with a powerful showerhead (which is always a must!). Fridge was providedEXTRA FACILITIESThere are loads but i didn't use many of them. 80-lane bowling alley, Imax cinema(!), 12 restaurants, shopping centre, Aquarium. Yahoo! cafe was useful but must spend on one drink (500 yen, or √ä√£¬¢2.50 was lowest price of a cup of tea) for unlimited internetVERDICTGreat for value for money and service. Downsides were that some of the rooms can err on the side of functional\/basic depending on which tower you stay in. Some ppl on the net have reported the Annex tower is the newest block (there are 4 in total) but as i didn't stay I cannot confirm.WILL I STAY HERE AGAIN?Yes i would, as long as i can find a good deal I know that this is a great value-for-money choice ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1303,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1300}]}
