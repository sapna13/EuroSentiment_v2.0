{"text":"Nice Resort, not-so-nice food My girlfriends and I spent our annual vacation at the Bavaro Princess from 7\/14 - 7\/17 and here is a brief synopsis of our trip. Our trip was booked through Apple Vacations who were very good about making the reservations and providing us with all the appropriate information. We booked the Platinum package which included access to the Platinum lounge (which is always stocked with beverages and munchies), a 20 minute massage, free meal at the resort's gourmet restaurant and one watersport activity. We had an early flight and arrived in Punta Cana at 9:30 am. After going through DR customs we were met by an Apple representative and whisked away on a bus to the hotel. The ride was about 35 - 45 minutes with one stop (to another resort). After our arrival, we went to the main check-in and was greeted by a waiter passing out cool drinks which turned out to be loaded with sugar. The drink was so unbearable that we tried to dilute it with water but it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ deaden the sweetness. The lobby of the hotel however, is beautiful and well kept. We were greeted with smiles and holas which was pleasant. After being led to the Platinum check -in, we boarded a tram which gave us a tour of the grounds. The resort is simply fabulous with greenery, flowers, flamingos, parrots, peacocks, etc and is identical to the pictures presented. Because there were four of us (two to a room), we had hoped that our suites would be adjacent to one another but instead were on opposite sides of the Platinum Lounge. Our rooms were very nice and well-maintained. The shower was hot in our room but the water pressure was somewhat weak improving over the course of our stay. My friend's room had no hot shower water at all. Some people on TA complained of a faint sewage odor and we could smell something in our room but it was not overbearing. In regards to reading the reviews of the food, we had hoped that the previously posted reviewers were exaggerating; however, this was NOT the case. By the end of the trip, one of us fell ill to the food; another was hit with something upon arriving home and all of us left the resort with an overall bad taste in our mouths. As my friend (who got sick) puts it: the food was merely an assembly line where they re-packaged it for the different restaurants. What was served on the lunch buffet was served at dinner. The safest bet was to eat the fruit and fish which was good. We were required to make reservations to all of the restaurants but once we got there, we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see the point. Again, we saw the same food at every single restaurant over and over and over √à√\u2020\u2022?For the most part, the beverages were okay (very sweet). Because the food was horrific, we will not go back to Punta Cana --- it seems that from reading the reviews from ALL resorts in Punta Cana, the food leaves a lot to be desired. When you are on holiday, food is part of the experience and can make an impact on your visit as it was the case here. Overall, the beaches, grounds, rooms and staff were very nice and hospitable. But, that's not enough to bring us back. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0}]}
