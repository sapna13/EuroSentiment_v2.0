{"text":"3rd time here- next year is #4-better than ever! This march was our 3rd trip to this resort in the last 3 years and was the best. It was hard to believe but the place got better from last year! Because of my wife's schedule it was just her and I this time around. We were to go to the Eden, but changed after reading the ongoing negative reviews from this site about its growing pains. Got there right on time and arrived at noon and had 3 hours to kill until we got our room. We had packed our swimsuits in our carry on-quickly changed and proceeded to the bar for 3 ice cold Presidentes in bottles-pure heaven! Went to eat at the Seaside grille and hung out at the beach until our room was ready. No problems at all. As expected our room was clean and well stocked with towels and refreshments. All week long we had great room service with turndown of the covers when we went for a drink later in the evening. Had great experiences at all of the restaurants and liked the French the best-great beef! One night we attended the Seaside grille for dinner and were told it would be an hour-no problem-we went to the buffet and had a great dinner there. Always had great service and there was always plenty of staff to make sure our glasses were full and our food was hot. We spent all of our time at the beach this year and really liked the waitress service that came around every half hour or so. The beach is great and the water is gorgeous. There are some rocks to the right that you should avoid, but outside of that-fantastic. We tipped regularly for the great service we received as it was even better than the previous times. Do yourself a favour and experience this place for yourself. It gets better all of the time and I'm sure will be in the top 5 in time with the great people that are there. We wil be goin back in 09' for trip #4 to dreams ...Presidente here we come! ","annotations":[]}
