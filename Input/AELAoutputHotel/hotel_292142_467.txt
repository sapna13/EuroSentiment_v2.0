{"text":"First Class The service, location and welcome in this hotel is fantastic. We had booked using [----] and got a brilliant deal even cheaper than quikbook! I emailed the hotel directly to request a large corner roomwith a great view and on arrival thats exactly what we received on the 32nd floor looking directly over to the Chrysler building with fab views of the east river. The room was very large and extremely comfortable and had the biggest bed ever and so comfortable which wasjust what we needed after all the walking. The kitchenette was a bonus - with all you needed: very large fridge, with mini bar inside and a daily supply of tea and fresh coffee, we didnt cook as it wasso cheap to eat out. We went to Eee's Cafe (turn left and cross over outside the hotel and its just over the lights on the right hand side)[----] every morning for the breakfast special egg on anybagel with coffee for $1.95, which was excellent and strictly Kosher and altogether so much nicer that Starbucks!!! We also bought fresh fruit for morning at the Murray Hill Deli on the corner.The staff at the Dumont were very friendly and courteous arranging taxis for us and providing us with maps for our stay. The Affinia is 5 mins from the Empire State Building and about 10 mins from Maceys.It is situated in a residential area just off Lexington Ave (near Opus Dei Headquarters - Da Vinci Code !!and was really safe and and pleasant to walk around during the day and in the evening. We would definately recommend this hotel and will stay again when we decide to visit New York . Stay at the Affinia you will not be dissapointed!!!
