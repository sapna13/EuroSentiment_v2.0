{"text":"Stunning This is a gorgeous hotel! It is located right on the Arno next to the Ponte Vechio and the Uffizi museum. A perfect location. The Accademia museum, the leather market the Piazza Republica, Il Duomo and dozens of other sights are within easy walking distance. We arrived in the afternoon on Friday and asked Micheala the concierge if it would be possible to get tickets to both the Uffizi and the Accademia (both closed on Monday) and we were leaving Tuesday afternoon. An almost impossible task but she pulled it off cheerfully for us. The room was absolutely stunning. We asked for a quiet room so it was away from the river, with a tiny balcony overlooking a side street. It was Beautifully decorated and had a huge bathroom with all the amenities including a dual US\/ European electrical outlet! A godsend for recharging camera batteries. Their breakfasts were the most decadently delicious I've ever had. They had great recomendations for everything. Our room was a standard but it would have been a superior or even a Jr suite at most other hotels. And their rooftop bar is the perfect place for a sundowner before walking out to dinner. Not the cheapest hotel we stayed at, but not overpriced either. We feel we got more than our money's worth and would recomend it without reservation. They also kept our luggage for us when we wanted to wander on our last day after we checked out. Really a top notch hotel with a great staff. And the complimentary sleep shirts were a nice touch!
