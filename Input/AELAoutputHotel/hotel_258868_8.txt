{"text":"Nice Hotel Close to Shops, A Bit Far from La Rambla......... Just back from a 3 day trip to Barcelona. We got a cheap-ish deal staying in the Hotel Covadonga situated on the Av Diagonal.The Hotel was sold to us as being in the heart of the city well i would say more the left shoulder!!. From the airport a Taxi took us 25-30 Mins to reach the hotel at a cost of about 21Euros. First impressions of the hotel were nice building and clean. Staff were helpful on booking in. Tried to get a room with a balcony but was unsucessful. So we ended up in a room on the 8TH(TOP) floor. Pleasent room clen and tidy on a par with Travel Lodge in UK. The air con had seen better days and at top whack it still left the room feeling stuffy. The view from the window -well no view!!we were looking onto three walls. So out and about we went to get our bearings of the city. The hotel provide Maps leaflets for places to visit, On walking onto the AV Diagonal first impressions are a busy main road flanked by shops each side. Walking down it is soon clear that the street is a shoppers heaven clothe shops line the road, every designer you can think of has an outlet. A 15-20 Min walk got us to the PG Gracia the main street that eventually leads down to the Las Rambla (Gothic Quarter).Again every shop under the sun, I would recommend going off the main street to side streets to get a drink or something to eat, Better service not as busy. The top tip for travelling aroung the city is to buy a ticket for the open top Bus the Bus Turistic it cost us 21E each for a two day ticket. This allows you to travel as much as you like over the 2 day period. You can get on and off as many times as you like. There are 3 routes being red blue and green, Taking you to the north centre and south of the city. You buy the ticket on board the bus, there are numerous bus stops littered about the city. The q for the busses can be if you try to get on at the start of the route, so get on at a stop away from the main stops.Overall it was a nice city brake with lots to see and do. I would recommend if you want to be close to Gothic Quarter and las Ramblas, Harbour to avoid the Covadonga and aim for a more central Hotel.If you do stay in the hotel be prepared for a good 25-30 min walk each way to the Rambla and harbour.
