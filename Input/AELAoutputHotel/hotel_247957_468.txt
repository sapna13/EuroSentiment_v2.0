{"text":"My January Holiday of 2007 5 girls from Canada went there in January of 2007.On the way to the hotel I thought I was going to die by the way they drove.Scary. They did not stop at stop signs or anything but whatever we made it alive.When we arrived we were greeted with a glass of wine which was fantastic after a long flight from CanadaThey did not accommodate my requests for our rooms to be next to each other but oh well....it wasn't the end of the world.The Front desk was very lousy but the service in the restaurants was absolutely amazing.The same goes for our room. Our house keeper took VERY good care of us and everyday there was either some kind of treat in there, extra towels and sometimes even extra beer..........nice.The Beach had to have been the best part and I basically spent my whole week laying there drinking beer out of my thermos that I brought from home. (What a good idea that was because it kept my drink always cold)My daily routine would be to eat breakfast at the buffet and head down to the beach. It didn't matter what time I showed up on the beach either because there was always a place for us to lounge.A photographer also came around daily and that was pretty cool. He was accompanied be either a parrot, a monkey or locals.I did spend a little fortune on pictures but whatever......they are great souvenirs.We did head out to the Disco one night and that was fun....but be careful....the local men are pretty pushy.Drinks are crazy expensive there too!So drink up at the resort before you go :-)I found the Beach Buffet to be the best place to eat.The Pizzeria up by the entertainment was also very good. I did expect the A La Carte restaurants to be much better then they actually were and I did get sick from the food.We made it on one tour also....the Safari one.It was long and so-so......I'm not sure if it was worth my $90.00 US but whatever. I did see things that I would never have seen if I would have stayed at the resort.The shopping plaza was also a nice touch being right across the street.I got very good deals and bought some really nice paintings for cheapie-cheapie :-)Be careful with your US money though. I' am use to my CDN money and I ended up giving a vendor a $100.00 bill instead of a $10.00.  (I was mad when that happened).Oh well though :-)It was my own fault and I 'm sure that guy is still talking about this CDN girl that was not paying attention.Other then that though I had an amazing vacation and I will for sure be going back to Punta Cana again!Here I come Punta Cana February 2008.
