{"text":"Beautiful Sofitel We normally prefer to stay in smaller boutique hotels, but wasn't convinced with the standard that you'd get in Bali with so called 'boutique' hotel (and have read some bad reviews on some of them on this site). So we decided to go with a recognised hotel name. Sofitel didn't dissapoint. It has a very beautiful ground, lush Balinese style garden. Our Deluxe Room was generous in size and clean, but a bit dark at night (could do with more lighting); the bathroom was a little old and has some damp smell, but overall it was a fine room. Breakfast was great, especially the Indonesian\/Balinese food section. General services are all very good. The pool area was fantastic, you don't feel crammed and on top of each other, or try to fight for a sunbed, as the ground is quite speadout. The location is very convenient, it is very close to the main street for eating out, shopping etc.The only downfall that we experienced at the Sofitel was the sales staff who we got at 2 locations: 1 at the breakfast who was offering the spa specials and try to get a booking from you; the second was when we were chilling out by the pool in the afternoon where a sales staff was trying to get us to view the new Sofitel at Nusa Dua and its incentive for doing so. It's ok if they'd go away when you say no, but they're so persistent and would not stop talking, and asking question about your holiday. It was quite a tiring experience due to their polite persistence! It was also our first day there so we really would have appreciated being left being alone. That's the only thing that put us off. Other than that it was a great hotel to stay and we'd definitely stay there again in the future (and would handle the 'sales staff' better next time). ","annotations":[]}
