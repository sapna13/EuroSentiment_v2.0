{"text":"Excellent...enough said!! My wife and I stayed at the Bahia from 4-21 to 4-29. I feel compelled to write, because I really appreciated all the info provided by other travelers. First, the hotel itself is large, but they have very efficient ways of getting to one side of the resort to the other with the shuttles running about every 5 minutes. The landscaping in the resort is nothing short of incredible. the workers there do a fine job of keeping the landscape beautiful.Food: I read complaints on this board in the past. Let me tell you.....We ate the buffets, snackbars and restaurants and at no time did we get sick. All water, drinks and food is safe as they use purified water. The food was very good for a buffet ( different variety every night) and all the restaurants, but the BBQ were excellent.Rooms: The rooms were kept very clean by the maids. These people work extremely hard and a $ 2-5 dollar tip a day was much appreciated and well worth the service.Beach: Yes, it is true you should get up early to get a lounge chair in the shade, but not to worry we never were without. The beach is without a doubt one of the most beautiful I have ever been to in my life.Shopping: The only downfall to the DR. The sales guys are pushy.....Always negoitate a price!!!!!! THey will comoe down to your liking.The entertainment was good with quite abit of crowd interaction.Drinks tasted great, but you must ask to get a little extra!!!All in all I give the resort a 9 out of 10 and would definately go back and I don't think I would stay anywhere else but the Bahia!!!Go there..Don't worry about complaints, I was very skeptical too, but turned out to be a wonderful place...Enjoy it and have a great time!!
