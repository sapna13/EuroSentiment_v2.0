{"text":"Ok, but not the best With few other options available when we booked this hotel, we weren't expecting great things, having read other Tripadvisor comments, but were determined to give the hotel a fair shot.In the end, it was much as expected - some good, some bad. Our room was quite spacious but the bathroom pokey. The pool wasn't bad - next to a busy road, but to be honest that wasn't a problem for us. The reception staff were helpful, concierge less so (we found booking a taxi through the concierge a lot more expensive than just waiting outside the hotel for a taxi to turn up).Breakfast wasn't bad at all, and the hotel lobby was really quite impressive, but the decor in the rooms wasn't quite as good.The main problem was the hotel's location; you need to rely on taxis to get to and from the city centre. Taxis don't take very long or cost that much, but the hotel's just too far out to consider walking in the heat of Singapore. The hotel's courtesy buses don't run frequently enough, but could come in handy if you know in advance what time you'll want to head into the centre. The main problem was getting a taxi back to the hotel, as one evening the taxi queues in town were massive and we were starting to think we'd be out all night (for this reason alone I'd recommend being central and so within walking distance of the subway system). Having said all that, the hotel is conveniently placed for the Botanic Gardens (well worth a visit), which suited my husband (a keen runner) down to the ground.A few other minor gripes - the cleaners threw away my toothbrush; one night we were woken by our room phone ringing (we still don't know why!); and another morning we were woken by a phonecall to ask if we were ready for our breakfast to be delivered (which we weren't as we were still asleep, and it was still 15 minutes before the earliest time we'd asked for breakfast to be delivered) - and even after the phonecall, it took 30 mins for our breakfast to arrive, so we were a little bemused by that. All minor things individually I know, but together they were a bit annoying.In summary, I probably wouldn't choose to stay there again, but it wasn't an awful hotel. ","annotations":[]}
