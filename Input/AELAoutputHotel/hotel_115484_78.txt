{"text":"Beautiful Biltmore -- Fabulous History, Location, and Style Wow! The AZ Biltmore has certainly received mixed reviews. I humbly state that I am a serious world travelor and have stayed in many of the grand resorts of the world. In my humble opinion, the Arizona Biltmore is worth a stay! The hotel is unique with history that no other Arizona property can match. Sure the formal Four Season's or Ritz staff may be more proper and perfect ... is that what you want? I enjoyed the Biltmore for it's unique location, history, and FLR style. This is a hotel that does not look like a cookie cutter product of an upscale chain (ie Ritz, Four Season's, etc.). I want a hotel that is unique to Arizona, not one that could be dropped in any city and look just at home.I agree that the room price is high. But seriously, the prices are high at any fabulous luxury hotel with location, location, location during peak season. Respectfully, I do have a point of comparison. I've stayed at the Phoenician (It's beautiful, but typical decor of any upscale hotel in the world), I've stayed at Camelback Inn (desert scape beautiful and quiet but not as grand as the lush Biltmore) and have visited many more of the Phoenix\/Scottsdale area resorts. To me, the Biltmore grounds, pools, and room (I stayed in the main building with a mountain view) were very comfortable and nice. And, the bed was just as good as any Heavenly Bed.To me staying at the Biltmore was a special experience. Walking around Bilmore Estate Drive and viewing the lovely muli-million dollor homes was fun, hiking up to mountain top historic Wrigley Mansion was stunning (however in need of some repair), and soaking in the Arizona sun instead of Chicago Winter.... priceless.Good luck with your decision. No matter where you stay, if you get typical Arizona weather -- be grateful you can afford to travel and enjoy your stay.
