{"text":"Excellent Choice with a couple of Caveats Stayed at Iberostar Bavaro and overall I was delighted. Here are the highlights and a couple of caveats.Food: Outstanding. True 5 star territory. The variety and freshness from MULTIPLE buffets and a la carte restaurants was outstanding. Christmas dinner?... LOBSTERFEST !! The food here is vastly superior to any all inclusive I have visited.Grounds: Gorgeous... two story townhouses nestled in a beautiful coconut grove. They had little LED lights affixed on plam trees and plants all over the property. At night the effect was romantic and calming... simply lovely. The lobby bars and pool area facilities are exemplary and kept spotless.Rooms: Average. Bed was a bit soft for my liking and on a couple of mornings the resort struggled to provide sufficient hot water to the the rooms. However, the room was clean and the maid service was excellent.Ambiance: Family friendly resort with a lot of kids running around. Don't come here if you want an adult only atmosphere. Pools were average - nothing special but clean and cool.Clientele: Distinctly european. North Americans were in the minority. Multiple langauages being spoken - it was GREAT ! But for conservative US types beware.. topless bathers on the beach and fat men in tiny bathing suits !!!!Beach: Gorgeous.. sand was soft and cool even in the hot sun. Water was warm and turquoise. I would say however, that Cancun waters have the edge !!! Lots of shaded leafed umbrellas and lounge chairs.Flexibility: Stay at Iberostar Bavaro and have FULL access to all three Iberostar resorts.. all three are side be side and the effect is to have one HUGE playground for the week.Service: First all inclusive where the service staff would NOT let my wine glass empty at the dinner table or my coffee cup empty at the breakfast buffet... friendly and attentive.Worth the premium price... did I mention the food? - oh my god the food...Richard from Milton ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1795,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1789},{"endOffset":1795,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1789},{"endOffset":1873,"mention":"premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":1866},{"endOffset":1873,"mention":"premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":1866}]}
