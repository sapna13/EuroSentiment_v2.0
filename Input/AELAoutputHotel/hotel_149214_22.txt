{"text":"Very Good Experience Arrived at the Punta Cana airport (PUJ) and learned that our Avis rental car was located 20 miles away - there is no Avis rental car office at the airport.But, things got much better from there. The Punta Cana Hotel van was waiting outside. We explained our situation, the driver checked with the hotel to make sure we had a valid reservation, then we got in the van and were at the hotel in about 10 minutes.The checkin process was efficient and friendly, the bell staff helped with all our luggage in a very friendly manner.We stayed in one of the beach houses, called Beach Casitas. Definitely worth it - you are a 2 minute walk to the water's edge. Rooms had properly functioning air conditioning, cable\/satellite TV and modern bathrooms. (Our beach casita had 2 separate bedrooms and 2 separate bathrooms).The beach is magnificent. A picture postcard of what a beach should be! The entire property was immaculate in terms of cleanliness.Staff at all the restaurants and at the concierge desk were warm, friendly and always willing to help or answer questions.The natural spring lagoon in the Ecological Area is a great experience - you definitely should try it - just remember to bring a towel.Food was ok - 2.5 stars out of 5 for the food.Now, maybe we had such a great experience because we visited during slow season (July 5 through 7). I don't know - but I do know that I would come back to this place. ","annotations":[]}
