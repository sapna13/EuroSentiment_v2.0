{"text":"Perfect experience We could have spent much more on a hotel and not had a better experience than we had. (As it was, we booked this hotel through British Air along with our air tickets, and they saved us a considerable amount.) The staff of this hotel was Johnny-on-the-Spot for anything and everything. The rooms  bathroom, while small by USA standards but typical for Paris, were beautifully kept, neat and clean, modern, and very, very comfortable. There was a small cigarette burn in the couch, and that's about all that marred a perfect hotel room. We were disappointed at the expensive connection for internet, but frankly, it probably served to keep us from frittering away precious time on the internet and spending more outside enjoying Paris! There is, however, an inexpensive internet cafe one block away from the hotel. The breakfast provided with the room was excellent -- great variety, very tasty. Be sure to try all of the jellies they provide (they tasted homemade, but we didn't ask.) The staff was wonderful, coming up in an instant when we called to say there was a problem with the hot water (the housekeeper had accidentally turned it off) or the air conditioning (we had opened the window, which automatically switches off the a.c.). Each time we called, they came so quickly, we thought they apparated up to our room, a la Harry Potter! Really, they were all terrific. We asked them to book 2 shows for us, which they did immediately (the Ballet of Cuba was wonderful; but if you've ever been to Las Vegas, skip the Moulin Rouge, it is sure to disappoint; try a different cabaret). All in all, we give 5 stars for this hotel, which, although not the cheapest, could not have been better at any price.
