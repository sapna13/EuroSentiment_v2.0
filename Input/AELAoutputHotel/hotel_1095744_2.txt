{"text":"A pleasant stay Just got back a week ago from a great week in Bali staying at the Mandira. Our room was the cheapest one (deluxe cottage I think) but had everything we needed in it - a huge bed, good air con and a small fridge. It was on the 2nd floor with a balcony overlooking the lovely gardens. The bathroom may have been in need of an update but it was always clean and we never had any problems with smells.One night we returned to find our air con not working and called maintenance who were up quickly to try and fix it. It seemed they couldn't find the probelm so they installed a brand new one. This was mainly done from the outside of our room and we had an even better air con within an hour so we weren't fazed by this.The 2 pools were great and there were plenty of sun lounges at all times of the day.Breakfast always had plenty of variety with about 8-10 hot dishes, fruit,cereals,pastries and bread, eggs any way you like etc. Coffee is poured at your table but we never had a problem getting one quickly. I'm sure this is just a safety thing as kids are also going backwards and forwards to the buffet and if people run into one another there could be a problem.Security was very good at the hotel and a lot of the restaurants we went to. Cars are checked underneath with mirrors.The beach out the front is great for surfing. There was plenty of swell which created decent size waves for surfers with plenty of white water for those just learning. The location is great with lots of restaurant within walking distance. Many of them have free wirless internet as well.Overall we were very happy with the service and standard at the Mandira. It is an older hotel so if you are looking for something newer you will have to pay more or move further away from the beach, ","annotations":[{"endOffset":950,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":944},{"endOffset":950,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":944},{"endOffset":950,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":944},{"endOffset":1434,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1429}]}
