{"text":"Great, solid hotel I stayed at this hotel for business, and this is also the first time I have stayed at a Ritz-Carlton. Service is impeccable. Everyone is incredibly courteous and remembers the tiniest details and your preferences. But of course, that's the Ritz-Carlton. The valet, bellman, people who checked you in, concierge, housekeeping, servers, everyone was so nice! The room was neat and clean. Bath products were great and smelled good. Turn down service included chocolates and water. I liked getting 2 bottles of water every night because you get so thirsty when traveling. The bed was soft and comfortable. Workout room was pretty good with two ellipticals, 4 bikes, lots of treadmills, and weights. Water and towels were provided. Headsets were provided so that you could watch TV while working out on the cardio machines, but sometimes, there were not enough headsets, so it's best to bring your own. The valet were great at helping with driving directions and telling you the best and quickest ways to get places. Business center was small with 2 computers with fairly decent internet connection and printer. There was also another computer designated to print out boarding passes. The hairdryer busted the first night I was there and the housekeeping staff was quick to replace it with a new one. The restaurant is good. I ate breakfast there twice. Service is great, and portions are smaller than most other restaurants. The guests at the Ritz-Carlton seemed to be the typical guests, wealthy retirees who expect great service and attention to detail. Great hotel with impeccable service.
