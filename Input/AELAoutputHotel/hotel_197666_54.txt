{"text":"Excellent boutique hotel with quiet location We loved this place. It is very close to the metro so you can get around town easily and it is within walking distance to the Eiffel Tower. Our room was small but very clean, well decorated and quiet. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and the air conditioner worked perfectly. The bathroom was really a treat with wonderful tub, shower, high end fixtures, designer tile, make up mirror and blow dryer.The morning breakfast offered downstairs provides a good amount of food options including cereals, yogurt, meat and cheese, breads, juice and coffee. The front desk staff is very good with providing tourist assitance and restaurant referrals. If you have an extended stay and want to take a break from french food then please try Goldini's Italian Restaurant just around the corner. The staff here was very friendly and spoke good english. The pasta was delcious. Also, if you are staying during the weekend, check out the local farmers market on Sunday morning located under the metro track around the corner. Lots of beautiful fruits, flowers and fun items to purchase or just enjoy a stroll with the locals as they do their weekly shopping. The Ares Eiffel hotel offers a convenient location along with a welcome retreat after a busy day in downtown areas. This place is a class act, as we had a plumbing problem at one point and we were offered other rooms of our own choice. They also provided a bottle of champagne with a nice note to apologize for the inconvenience. I would love to stay at this place again and would encourage others to book here.
