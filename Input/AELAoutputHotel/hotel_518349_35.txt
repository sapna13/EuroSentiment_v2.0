{"text":"A Good Experience From the airport, our taxi driver knew the hotel and 25 minutes (and 30 Euros) later we were there.The staff don't have a great understanding of English (I suspect this Hotel attracts more Germans) but they were all helpful and there were no problems with check in.Our corner room was on the 6th Floor and was as described by the other reviews. It was clean, well stocked with bathroom supplies and everything worked as it should - including the mechanical blinds which have 2 independent layers, a translucent layer for daytime and an opaque layer which did a good job of keeping out the light at night.There is a tram that runs in front of the hotel and the Glories Metro is about 5 minutes walk going left out of the hotel. Metro prices are really cheap so dont be afraid of going 4 stops to the centre of Barcelona.The Glories Shopping Centre is across the road - Dont expect loads of well known shops - there are 2 big shops though (Carrefour and PC World). Loads of coffee shops and places to eat. OK for a couple of hours looking around but thats about it.Moans - Well no major ones. The noise of the traffic may disturb some people perhaps, especially if on a lower floor. The design of the bath makes water splash widely. The TV has 70+ channels - but only a couple are English. I got round this by connecting my ipod to the TV (unclip the panel on the back of the TV) and watched my own programmes - you could buy an adaptor at PCWorld.
