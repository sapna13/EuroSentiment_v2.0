{"text":"Indifferent and unreliable We stayed as part of a conference package and I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ say it was an entirely positive experience but neither was it the worst Hotel I have stayed at.There were some good things about it√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?he breakfast was good.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?he shuttle service to and from the airport and to the T station was free and fairly reliable but was often overcrowded.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?ome of the staff were nice.Now for the bad stuff.If you are keen on clean, its not the place for you. I found a hair inthe bath on arrival and the vent in bathroom was very dirty. I am fairly tolerant about these things but if you like a place that has been well cleaned so that previous occupants are no longer in evidenceyou may not feel comfortable here.The toilet malfunctioned in such a way that it flooded the bathroom and some of the rest of the room in the middle of the night. When we reported this the following day the receptionist said √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ªoom?√à√\u2020\u2022? No apology no surprise.When I suggested that he might like to apologise he said √à√\u2020\u2022?what was the trouble ..running all night?√à√\u2020\u2022?and when I explained about the flood he said √à√\u2020\u2022?Oh that is a bad one√à√\u2020\u2022?All of this told me it was not an isolated incident. The toilet did run all night on the following two nights but I resorted to amateur plumbing. If you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like this sort of help the staff approach to hotel keeping again the Ramada Boston is probably not for you.The location is far from downtown and the shuttle comes every half hour to JFK. Since we were all at a conference together we generally ignored the bus being full and got on in any case. There are apparently no Taxis at JFK T station so if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ enjoy being stranded in the cold for some time again you should consider other options. BTW probably not the Comfort that is run by the same family on the same site.I suppose you might want to stay there if it was very cheap and everywhere else was booked but my recommendation is definitely look elsewhere.
