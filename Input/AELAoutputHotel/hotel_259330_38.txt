{"text":"you think your trip there was bad! The first evening at the Paradise, Sept 20\/08, the marble floors on the stairs leading to the rooms were extremely wet, so I slipped even though I tried my best not too and broke two toes. The room fridge was not working so I called for 3 days and finally it barely worked thereafter. No remote for the TV was given. Had to take the trolley to the main reception area or beach most of the time. The boat bar was only open for one night (Friday). Other than that you had to go to the main bar at the reception because the others (pool bar) closed at 6:00 pm. The casino is like something from a Vegas ghost town from the 50's so don't think you can win anything there. The food was only comperable to Cuban food, which you would expect in Cuba. The reception staff was unbelievably rude and I have never seen so many tourists complaining about various inconveniences in all of my. They even went so far as to say to their guests that they were LIARS. I tipped the maid $10.00 the first morning but the service was terrible. I also tipped every day thereafter a couple of dollars and choclates and still never even got towels, not once were they replaced without complaints. I finally went and stole about 10 towels from the cart and hid them in the room. I didn't need rose pedals on the sink, I NEEDED TOWELS!!. The only staff I found nice was the bartenders and the waiters, but they were also tipped very well. Night before checkout, I wanted to book the room for 3 hours extra due to the flight time. I was told to come back at 9 the next morning, went back at 9, told to come back again at 9:30. They told me that was fine and it would cost $10.00 per hour, no problem. 3 times I had to go back with the trolley for a card that would work, but still didn't. Found some staff person there and he opened the door for me, seriously I think anyone who works there has a pass card to your room. This happened earlier when I locked myself out. So I finally took a shower and didn't some male staff member decide to let himself in while I'm in the damn shower. I yelled every swear word imaginable and he finally left. Still don't know why he was there. The manager of hotel calls a few minutes later and asks what I'm doing there - can you believe it. Other than the pool and the beach, don't go. You can't even go outside the compound unless its a tour, unless you don't like your jewerly. Then at the airport they charged me $50.00 overweight, problem is, I didn't buy anything while I was there, they actually wanted $70.00 Canadian. The only thing I can figure is the clothes were damp and weighed more or the scales are fixed. As I said, I have never seen anyone complain so much at a hotel as I did there. PS: for the ladies, the male staff are like roaches, they never leave you alone. Also lock up anything valuable or else. Better still, don't go.I would take Cuba any day of the week, its safe there and the people are honest and the town is safe.Good luck,DC Toronto, Ontario ","annotations":[{"endOffset":740,"mention":"Cuban","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cuban_sandwich"],"startOffset":735},{"endOffset":777,"mention":"Cuba","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cuban_sandwich"],"startOffset":773},{"endOffset":1374,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1370},{"endOffset":2368,"mention":"compound","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Compound_chocolate"],"startOffset":2360},{"endOffset":2568,"mention":"Canadian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Molson_Canadian","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Canadian_Club"],"startOffset":2560}]}
