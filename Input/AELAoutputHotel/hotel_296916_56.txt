{"text":"Nice pool and good location Overall this was a very nice hotel. We loved the pool and the loungers on the roof, and the location was excellent - just down the road from the Ramblas and Placa de Catalunya, to which the Aerobus goes direct from the airport.We were only faintly aware of the vibrations from the underground trains, really not intrusive at all.The breakfast selection was very good, classic continental fare, as well as the usual breakfast cereals and a good selection of fruit juices. Unfortunately the Spanish have no idea about how to make tea, and hence it can be a bit weak!One thing that was quite irritating was that the roof was locked at 8pm. Guests are not allowed to use the solarium or pool after this time, which would have been a lovely way to spend the evenings.Although there were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, I am told this is not unusual for hotels in Spain. There was however free internet access in the Bar area for checking e-mails etc.I would recommend this hotel for someone that wants to stay central and see the city sights. It is perhaps not the best hotel for people with young children, although there were some families there when we stayed.Room service was quick and reasonably cheap. The room had very effective air conditioning. The en-suite was very clean but did get quite warm. There was a flat-screen television with a couple of English channels, but who wants to stay in watching TV on holiday anyway.The reception staff we friendly and helpful.
