{"text":"Comfortable and well located Previously in Amsterdam we have stayed close in near Central Station but this time went a little further out on good advice. This hotel isa straight line 10 minute stroll along an attractive canalside to Rembrandt Square - and from there 5 more minutes to city centre. The hotel staff are welcoming and helpful: our room was clean and fresh with a modern (if small) bathroom: the breakfast of egg, cheese, meats and lovely bread selection was excellent. It sits in a quiet street off a main artery.We took the Airport Connexxions bus to and from hotel - from airport it was a slow process as more people wanted the service than they hadthe capacity to provide; but return was on time and only 20 minutes to airport. If you have luggage this is the way to go - but if you can manage it, you are much better taking the train in from the airport to Central Station and then either the 4 or 25 tram to Freidrichsplein. The tram stops are just 50 metres from the hotel's street.If you want to avoid the noisy and overpriced centre for dinner, there are two local restaurants we would be happy to recommend to anyone. Thney are located about 200 metres along the main street (to the left) and sit close by each other. One is an Italian (live piano playing and owner occasionally sings!!) called La Storia Della Vita. The other a traditional Dutch called Van Aanderen which would be a wonderful choice for a special occasion dinner, a bit pricey but worth every cent for both food and extraordinary service and ambience. Reservations at both are recommended.Also close to the hotel (opposite the 25 tram stop) is a lovely cafe called Cafe Kale - like a tradional brown cafe which serves the most wonderful Apple Cake with coffee (and a full range of other snacks\/meals and drinks). The young staff are as delightful as the fare they serve. My wife left a ring in the toilet and when we returned an hour later, they had it behind the bar for her.We were reminded this trip just how lovely Amsterdam can be when one avoids the crowds in the centre.
