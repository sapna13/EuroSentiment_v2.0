{"text":"Caribe was great The Caribe is a big hotel, and a good location if you want close access to the airport and old san juan. I visited with my wife and two kids, 9 and 12.For the kids, I think this is a really fun spot, since they have a nice pool complex, and easy access to the ocean. You can snorkel in the bay, see some cool fish, or just stay closer to shore near the water toys. The pool complex might get boring after 3 or 4 days, but otherwise it is nice. The Caribe has a ton of loungers all over the beach complex, close to pools, to beach, to palm trees, etc. and that variety was great.For my wife and I, we liked the broad range of restaurants on site. They are expensive, so we liked to take our time, which doesn't always work with kids. Fortunately, my kids were happy to get take-out Subway grinders and eat in the room watching disney channel movies, which is a rare treat for them. This freed up my wife and I to enjoy a 2 hour meal right on the hotel grounds. Our favorite was Lemongrass, since it is set in the garden and perfect for outdoor dining.The staff at the business center were very accomodating and proficient. The concierge staff certainly tried hard, but my experience was mixed, since once they sent us to a local museum without noticing that the museum wasn't open on that day. The room decor, at least in the garden wing, felt dated, but housekeeping kept it tidy.
