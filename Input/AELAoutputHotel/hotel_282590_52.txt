{"text":"Sharp practice It's a shame to see this hotel sliding down the Trip Advisor ratings. This is a good hotel that is in a truly excellent location however I guess some of the staff are just upsetting their clients.I booked this hotel directly with the internet, booking superior velvet rooms for my group at their internet rate of Euro 115,00 per night. However, upon leaving the hotel realised that they had charged me a rate of Euro 139,00 per room per night. Okay, I should have had my wits about me (but had a heavy night previously) but the hotel will not respond to my e-mails nor will anybody in authority return my calls. They simply do not seem to care now that I have left.Having said that, the rooms (at the front) have a tremendous view of the street, are bright, spacious and clean. The furnishings are funky and modern with lots of nice touches. Make sure you get a room overlooking the street as the picture windows are great (and maybe better than the suites on the top floof?). There are rooms with a more 'traditional' bathroom than discussed in other reviews. Disabled \/ superior rooms will have the traditional bathroom style although it is more of a wetroom than a bathroom.People have raved about the breakfast on this site but to be honest it is rather ordinary. There are much better and far funkier places to eat for better food and better value.Similarly, when surrounded by so many bars, it's pretty pointless staying in the hotel bar which is smart but fairly dull but massively overpriced.The location is excellent for the S-Bahn and for the trams and there is a great choice of nightlife in this area.However on Oranienburgerstrasse, be aware of the pushy (but non-aggressive) drugs dealers who try and ply you with coke and hash. I mean, even my 71 year old father was offered some (and he doesn't quite look like a user...)! Also be aware of the very pushy prositutes. They all look the same with orange tans, bleached hair, skinny jeans and bum bags. I'm sure that they'll leave you alone if you are a couple but they really want to ply you with their services. All harmless enough though! Berlin is a great place, especially the old east, the hotel is in a great location, just take confirmation of your booking with you when paying or the staff at th Arcotel Velvet will sting you for full rate. Very sneaky!I have been to Berlin previously and will be back again. So watch out Arcotel, I'm coming back for my cash! Grr!
