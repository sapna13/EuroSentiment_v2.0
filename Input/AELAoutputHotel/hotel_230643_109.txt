{"text":"Hotel fine, city not so good!! im a junior travel agent so i did alot of research into my trip to Barcelona and the hotel i would stay in. the hotel Barcelona Universal was good, clean and nice. but only good, i did have a few issues with it, i asked for a room away from the front of the hotel to be away from the noise of the road but we ended up with an internal room, which when stayin for five nights in a four star i didnt find acceptable, i hate internal rooms and frankly having to wake up to look into other peoples rooms wasnt worth the money (which we did pay alot!!) when doing my research, the hotel i really wanted to stay in was the tryp apolo but reviews said it was in a very dangerous area so i chose not to. but to my surprise when i got to barcelona it was located right across the road from the barcelona universal! i do have to admit the area around the hotel did look quiet dodgy but we're were fine at all times. my only advice to give you about the hotel is to order the steak VERY WELL DONE (i ordered mine medium and it was still raw on the inside) and to request by email to the hotel 2 wks before going a room WITH A VIEW!! the shopping is AMAZING in Barcelona but its just as expensive as Irish shops. If i was going away for 5-7nights again i would definitly prefer a resort but Barcelona would still be nice for a short 2-3 night break!
