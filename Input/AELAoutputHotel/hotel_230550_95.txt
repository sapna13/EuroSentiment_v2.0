{"text":"Superb value, excellent room Stayed at the Park Inn Alexanderplatz in Feb 2007. Arrived at the hotel late at night (Around 30 Euros from Schoenefeld airport by taxi) and were checked in really promtly. First impressions were that it was a nice hotel, lobby with bar\/restaurant looked very modern and newly refurbished.We asked to upgrade but were advsied not to as the room we had was also newly refurbished and so on a par with an upgrade so we decided not to. When we got up to the room we weren't disappointed. The room was quite a decent size and the fittings were very new. The bathroom also was a plus with a large walk-in rain shower. The only disappoinment was that we were on a lower floor so didn't have a great view.The TV tower which is a few minutes walk away through Alexanderplatz station and was well worth visiting for a drink and even breakfast\/lunch\/dinner as it was quite reasonable.Alexanderplatz station, aswell as having tube lines running to the former West Berlin, also has overland trains. These go to airport which we used on the way back for a few Euros each. They also run to the Hauptbahnhof, which is within walking distance of the Brandenburg gate and the Reichstag, aswell as West Berlin with a station opposite Berlin zoo making it the easiest way to get around. We bought a card to get around, which I can't remember what it was called, but cost about √à√\u2020√ü?0 each for a few days and included all travel on the metro\/overland trains\/buses and trams. It also included discounts on attractions.There are quite a few restaurants around the Park Inn and all are very resonable and really nice. Most seem to specialise in steak or italian food. Te hotel bar was a little pricey but had a good atmosphere and always seemed busy so was a good location for a drink.Although this hotel seems a bit isolated from West berlin there is plenty around it and public transport in Berlin is fantastic and so easy to find your way around. All the forms of transport around Berlin make it, what I think, is the most easy city to navigate that I've been to, so the fact that the park Inn is out of the way isn't an issue. Most of the travel routes seem to run to Alexanderplatz which is ideal.Overall the hotel was fantastic value for money and I would definitely look to stay there again when I go back. Its newly refurbished and has everything you could need. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":243,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":239}]}
