{"text":"Great time I was worried about this resort after reading some of the reviews, but we had an excellent time here. We stayed from Oct. 22nd to 29th. The weather was warm and sunny everyday with the exception of 3 days that it rained for about 15 mins. Here are all the good things:1. The staff is very friendly and outgoing. Everyone says hola! when they pass you or see you. The staff goes out of it's way to make sure that you are confortable and have everything you need. Tipping isn't required, but we found that it is greatly appreciated. Everytime we told a staff member thank you or gracias, they responded with it's my pleasure.2. The pool is perfect. It just goes forever and is just the right temp. to cool you down. We spent most of our time at the swim up bar, where it was great to relax with a drink in the water. We never had trouble finding lounge chairs no matter what time of the day it was.3. The beach is beautifull. It is very well kept. The waves are huge and the red flags were out everyday, but that didn't stop me or about 50 other people from body surfing and playing in the waves.4. The rooms are pretty good sized and very cool. We had to turn the air conditioner down. The shower pressure amazed me for a resort in a third world country.5. We didn't sign up for the excellence club, but still got most of the perks involved. We had turndown service everyday, a bottle of chaimpaign, and bath robes and slippers which are all listed as being for the excellence club.6. World Series and Monday Night Football on a HUGE screen on the beach with surround sound and beer and snacks.7. The drink of the day is usually pretty weak, but just ask the bartender for an extra shot of Bacardi 151. Same with all the premade drinks. I read a lot of complaints about the alcahol being weak or waterdown, but I had no problems with it. In fact I got drunker than I thought I could off fruity drinks.8. Sammy Sosa's are probably one of the best drinks to drink in the pool. Just ask for Bacardi 151 to be added.The not so good:1. The food was good, but not great. I was worried after reading several reviews saying it was horrible. It's not horrible and in fact I enjoyed everything that I ate. It just wasn't great food. My wife is a very pickey eater and she didn't complain once about the food.2. Snorkeling wasn't what I expected. You can snorkel on the beach off the resort, but the waves were huge and we were told we wouldn't see much, so we paid $30 a person to be taxied to another resort 7 miles down the road and then jumped into a little john boat that took us 10 mins. out into the ocean. The waves were still huge, I only saw two different types of fish, I could barely see the coral, my wife was stung by a jellyfish, and 3 people on the tour with us got sick and started puking into the ocean from the boat where I was still trying to snorkel.3. I never drank the water, but I was sick two nights with stomach issues. I'm pretty sure it was something I ate, but not completely sure. I was fine after going to bed and getting up the next day.4. They allow vendors onsite a couple nights a week right around dinner time. So as you walk to dinner and come out of dinner you are hassled to look at their stuff. It got to be annoying.5. The free horse ride was ok, but the horses need to eat something. They were very skinny and almost sick looking. My horse kept stopping to eat certain types of plants whenever he saw them.6. I was never bit by a mosquito, but my wife was twice and some people we saw were really bit up.Things to bring:1. Insulated mug2. bug spray3. dollar bills for tipping.4. peptoAll in all we had a great time and would consider going back. I would recommend going in late October since it is the end of hurricane season because the resort isn't full.
