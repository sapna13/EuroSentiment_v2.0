{"text":"Beautiful Hotel, Incredibly Helpful Staff You can read all about this hotel -- its comfortable rooms, great value, location -- and I completely agree. We stayed for 3 nights in early August and loved it. I can't wait to get back to Barcelona and I'll be staying at the Hotel Montecarlo again.But what the reviews don't quite capture is how thoroughly welcoming and helpful and warm the hotel staff is, day and night. After 2 nights at the hotel, we were off to the airport for our return home. At the gate to board our first flight, to London Heathrow, the flight information suddenly disappeared and we were told to reclaim our checked luggage and go back in line for another flight. Well, this turned out to be the morning of the London raid on terrorists. Our flight to London (and then home from there) was not going to happen. With two young children, we decided to leave the chaos of the airport and head back to the safe haven of this lovely hotel and its lovely staff.They were, again, welcoming and helpful and concerned for us. They put us in the same rooms, at the same deeply discounted rate we had booked through their website. They directed us to travel agents, and I was able to use their lobby computer for website searching for a flight home. In a very stressful time, in an unfamiliar city far from home, the people at Hotel Montecarlo made us feel that we had a safe place to be and there were people who cared. ","annotations":[]}
