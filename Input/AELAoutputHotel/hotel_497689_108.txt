{"text":"Absolutely superb My husband and I spent 2 nights in a Junior Suite for a break away from the kids. We always stay in 5 star hotels and this was one of the best we have stayed in, the main reason being - the service. The staff are superb, they remembered our names, welcomed us with a smile, were always friendly and extremely helpful. Best of all was the Head Concierge, Sandro, who went out of his way for us, getting long sold out tickets to a top show and recommending and booking all the latest London restaurants for us to try.The suite was large and comfortable with a sitting area and big bed. The bathroom was a little outdated in decor but very large and kept spotlessly clean. The public areas are beautifully and quirkily decorated making it a very trendy yet exceptionally cosy place to stay. The majority of clients appear to be celebrities or media types and yet we never felt intimidated or out of place, even though we are thirty something parents of three!Breakfast at the Refuel restaurant within the hotel was disappointing, with little choice at the small buffet, but as it was included in our rate we didn't mind. It might be better to stay on a room only rate and have breakfast elsewhere, although again, the service was exceptional.The only thing lacking was tea and coffee making facilities in the room. If you order hot drinks at night, they charge you a √ä√£¬¢3 room rate. But, as others have written here, you do get offered complimentary milk and cookies when you come in at night, PLUS free water was by our bed which I thought was veyr thoughtful.All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel as we felt very looked after and made to feel special by all the staff, relaxing in a lovely environment. My husband also tried a massage in their spa downstairs which he said was excellent (and he is quite particular about massages).It is expensive, you can't get away from that, but we felt it was worth the money. Plus, the location is great, right in the centre of Soho, near all the theatres and fantastic restaurants. We loved it.
