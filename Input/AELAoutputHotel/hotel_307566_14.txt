{"text":"handy location My girlfriend and I spent three nights here whilst in transit to work in Timor-Leste. The location of the resort was perfect us; close to the airport and also the nightlife of Kuta.We organized complimentary pick-up from the airport with the hotel, which went well despite a delayed flight arrival. The hotel also returned us to the airport for our departure free of charge. The hotel also operates a free shuttle service [at set times of the day] to\/from the main shopping centres in Kuta.We stayed in a Club Villa, which was in all honesty too big for the two of us. Especially given that we spent most of our time out of the villa. The accommodations were very good with a separate lounge\/dining room, bedroom and well-appointed bathroom (with separate shower and huge bath tub. There were two small verandahs (one off the bedroom and the other off the lounge), which could accommodate two chairs and small table. The resort complex is located within a kilometre of the main runway so there is aircraft noise. It didn't trouble us but it does exist non the less, so don't expect a quiet tropical getaway when staying here. The pool areas (one [smaller] adults-only pool, and a very large general purpose pool area, which is located close to all the restaurants) were clean and well maintained. The larger pool has a swim-up bar, which was very popular with the guests. We had breakfast a couple of times, which was adequate and what you would expect of a resort of this type. We also had one meal in the Italian restaurant and the pizzas were OK. The remainder of the time we spent in Kuta.There is a business centre available but you are charged for Internet access. You need to purchase an Indotel card (from reception), which you can use also for wifi, which was available at certain hot spots around the resort but not in the rooms.Security is very strict here with vehicle searches upon entry to the resort. No touts were allowed to enter the resort though they did hang out along the beach front and called out to any prospective clients. As a point of interest we did try walking along the seafront towards Kuta but one part of the front has been washed away and therefore impassable unless you want to go swimming! There is a [beach] reclamation project currently underway with most of the heavy [machinery] work occurring at nighttime.All in all we enjoyed our stay and will be returning in a couple of weeks when we will spend a couple of nights there on our way home.
