{"text":"The perfect choice to stay while in Ubud In a word, this hotel is stunning. It perfectly captures the magical essence of Bali√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ serene side. A couple of previous reviewers have complained about service and location. Well, I can tell you that in my experience their claims are completely off base. My observations:Location: The hotel is located a short complementary drive away from Ubud center. Is it walking distance to shops and restaurants? No, but all the luxury properties are located a short distance from town (think Four Seasons and Aman). Whenever we wanted to head into town, a driver was ready within a few minutes at most. They were always prompt in picking us up at the prearranged location and time in town as well. The hotel is set in the rice paddies and this contributes significantely to its charm and romantic atmosphere. I strongly preferred its setting as compared to some of the other luxury properties we visited (F.S. and Aman). The setting is utterly peaceful, almost like a lushly painted landscape come to life.Hotel grounds: Wow! The hotel design captures the flavor of Bali perfectly and, at least to my eyes, seems utterly authentic and provides a very strong sense of place. I traveled nearly 12,000 miles to visit. The last thing I wanted was the standard international luxury style so common across the world. The hotel did not disappoint. All the amenities you could wish for are provided, but in a very unique way reflecting the Bali style. Everything is open air (excepting, of course, the comfortably air conditioned sleeping quarters). Eating breakfast each day in the restaurant was such a magical experience as all four sides are open to the setting.Service: Perfect. We met the GM, Helen, and she seemed sincerely interested in our feedback (all positive) and was genuinely warm and welcoming. Our butler, Uni, was very focused on our needs without being too intrusive. She took care of whatever we needed, when we needed it. We had no problems communicating, either with her or any other hotel staff. Other hotel staff were uniformly warm and gracious. All staff made us feel like we were very special guests.Room: I know I am beginning to sound like a broken record, but again all I can say is it was absolutely stunning. We stayed in pool villa #9, the most private of the villa locations. We had our own infinity pool, which was much larger than we expected. Each morning our Butler would open a small gate at the edge of the pool that looked out onto the working rice paddies. Our only surprise is when we discovered that field workers passed right in front of our open gate as they went about their business. The bedroom was again done in the Balinese style that seems to combine a modern minimalist aesthetic with ample touches of authentic local culture (beautiful wood carved platform bed, local art work etc√à√\u2020\u2022?. For us, it was perfect.In conclusion, in my experience this is probably the most memorable property that I have ever visited. For me, that speaks volumes because I have traveled extensively through Europe and the Americas and have stayed at many high end properties. The hotel features a wonderful combination of luxury, beautiful style and a strong sense of place. The magical setting will long live in my dreams.
