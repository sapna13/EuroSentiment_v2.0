{"text":"Really Enjoyed the Royal Hotel Barcelona We had never been to Barcelona before so we had to guess where a good location would be. I searched centrally located hotels using a tour book map. Las Ramblas seemed a good location for sightseeing throughout the city. I found the Royal Hotel in a list of hotels on a travel website. Using the hotel's own website (which was very good), we decided this hotel would be where we would want to be. We were a little concerned about noise being right on Las Ramblas, but the hotel ensured that the windows were double sealed. The Royal Hotel far exceeded our expectations. The location was absolutely perfect. We took the express airport bus from the airport directly to the Playca Catalunya which was only a few blocks walk to the hotel. The checkin was very easy, and having just endured an overnight flight across the Atlantic, we were very pleased to be able to checkin earlier than expected. The room itself was very nice (it could have used more drawers for clothing) and the bathroom was nice too. Our room looked directly onto Las Ramblas and we truly enjoyed watching the constant parade of people at all hours of the day and night. The hotel was correct in that the room was well insulated from noise, considering the location. We opted to include the daily breakfast downstairs each day (for 9 euros per person per day). It was a great selection of food and the service was good; everyone was very nice. One evening, after a long day of sightseeing, we even used the restaurant for dinner (really good pizza). You can't beat sitting at the big windows overlooking the parade of people on the street and across to Las Ramblas. We would stay here again and recommend it highly to any visitors to Barcelona.
