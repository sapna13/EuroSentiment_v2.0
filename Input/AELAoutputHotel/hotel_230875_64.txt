{"text":"Perfect Got back a few days ago from an excellent stay at the Rad SAS Amsterdam. It does everything is says on the tin, true it does not have the boutique hotel appeal (something we often prefer) but after a few disappointments on recent trips to boutique style hotels we opted for the Radisson.We got an amazing rate √ä√£¬¢326.00 twin, deluxe, with breakfast all taxes included. It took a while to find such a good rate but it was well worth the search.Location, location, location in an upmarket street right near the Niewmarket (5 min walk).Canal boat hop on hop off (starts from the Central Station) great value and really good fun.Buy tickets for all the museums in advance on the net (they allow you to queue jump), it is really hard to get tickets that let you jump all the queues when you are there and trust me with so much to see you do not want to waste your time in long queues. Evenings cool at the moment so pack warm.The Bird Thai restaurant was the best we eat in, loads of food, really yummy and fast (everywhere else was very slow)  service with a smileThe room was more spacious than we expected with plenty of hanging space. We had an arm chair  coffee table in a bay window, twin beds pushed together (so it felt like a big superking) plenty of lighting options, huge desk  mirror and the standard Radisson grey marble bathroom with shower over bath. We had a great street view directly opposite the lovely Coffee Shop Rusland (one of the best in the area). Air con was effective and very, very quiet. Beds were super comfy and lots of big squashy pillows. Breakfast was amazing, loads of fresh fruit, breads, cereals, juices and loads of cooked items. Coffee was fresh and plentiful.All the staff we so helpful and friendly something I think is hard to find these days.The bar looked nice but we never tried it and the lobby was ok not as grand as some hotels we have stayed in this class but you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ spend much time in the lobby do you?! I also felt it was a real shame that they had not worked with the old buildings they had a little better rather than making it look like a (60's\/70's) new build in parts. Hated the smoke everywhere thing but it was no smoking at breakfast and we had a non smoking room so it did not cause us much of a problem. All in all a great choice and would definitely recommend to others :-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1172,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1166},{"endOffset":1434,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1428},{"endOffset":1629,"mention":"breads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1623},{"endOffset":1680,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1674},{"endOffset":1680,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1674},{"endOffset":1680,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1674},{"endOffset":1680,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1674}]}
