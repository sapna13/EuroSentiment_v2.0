{"text":"Good hotel with reasonable location Hi I am from Hong Kong~I have been to Amsterdam for 4 days in July 2008.I find the Tulip inn city west is quite good. Some people complain the location is too far. However, I think the transport is good enough, I go to the city centre by Tram 17, (just 5-7 mins walk to the tram stop) and the journey is about 30 mins to the city centre.the hotel is quite near the airport actuallyOn day 1, I take the train from Airport to Amsterdam Lelyln station (about 5 mins, 2.8 Euro) and then change the bus no. 63 at Lelyln station to the hotel (about 10 -15 mins) And the bus station is quite near to the hotel. (within 1 min walk)If you take the train to Amsterdam Lelyln and change bus no. 63 to the hotel, it is cheaper and faster than you go to Central station and take tram 17.Whenever we wanna go to city centre, we can take tram 17. On day 3, we go to Rotterdam and Den Haag, we take bus no. 63 to the Amsterdam Lelyln station, and take the train to Den Haag.Again, it is faster and cheaper if you take the train from Amsterdam Lelyln station to Den Haag (35 - 40 mins) than you take the train from Central station.If you do not only stay in Amsterdam centre, but also visit other famous cities like Den Haag or Rotterdam.I think Tulip inn city west is quite convenient actually.Moreover, the surrounding of the hotel is quite beautiful, clean and peaceful. It is really different from the city centre of Amsterdam. And there is a famous building located next to the hotel is really wonderful. ","annotations":[]}
