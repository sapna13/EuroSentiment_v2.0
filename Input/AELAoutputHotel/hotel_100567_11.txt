{"text":"Overpriced and not great Very disappointing property. The setting on stilts hanging over the water is fabulous but that's where it ends.The decor is odd and incongruous with my impressions of Seattle. It's log cabin-ish and better suited to a ski lodge in Vermont or Colorado. I requested a water-facing room on check-in and was told it cost 50 dollars more than what I'd paid. Having already forked out around 300 dollars for the night, I declined and took a city facing room. The irritating part was that my colleague booked on the same room rate and through the same agent, who checked in right behund me, got a water facing room for no extra charge and without asking!Notwithstanding the odd decor, the hotel looks tired and worn. My room was abysmally small and I am amazed that American travellers would accept rooms of this size, knowing how spacious hotels are in general. I am not a large person and do not have a problem with the typically smaller rooms that one finds on the Eurpoean continent. There was barely space to move around the double bed and if I had been sharing I would have felt claustrophobic. The city-facing rooms are next to a railway line with a busy level crossing and a clanging bell every time a train passes by!! This happens throughout the day and night. These rooms need to be twice the size and sound-proofed. I had 3 nights on the trot in Chaicago, Seattle and San Francisco and this was the by far, the worst value of all 3 cities. You can do a lot better at the price elsewhere in Seattle. ","annotations":[]}
