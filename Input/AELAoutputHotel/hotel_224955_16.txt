{"text":"50 yards in the wrong direction The hotel had very clean rooms and bathroom and an excellent staff at the front desk. The hotel had free hi-speed wireless and nice sitting areas on my room's floor. My room was small, but I liked it. It was in many ways more like a small hotel in Paris than one in the US. A strength of the hotel is its location, which is very close to the Powell street BART station, close to the main stop of the cable car lines, and within easy walking distance of many big stores, union square, and the convention center.  The location is also the hotel's main weakness and it is a significant weakness. Mason street is a street on the edge of a bad neighborhood. Many of the people on the street seemingly were homeless or aimless, frequently asking passersby for handouts. It is a street where there is a lot of shouting. It's only 50 yards along the bad street (Mason) from Market street, which is generally a good street, but that can seem like a long 50 yards. On the other hand, I walked in and out several times on several days, was sometimes annoyed by repeated requests but never bothered, and never saw anyone else bothered.  A secondary drawback is that the rooms in the hotel do not seem to be air conditioned. Usually in San Francisco it doesn't matter, but on a warm day it will, partly because the open window lets in noise from the street below, even several stories up, which goes on until 3 or 4 am.  Overall I liked the hotel, but I am not sure I would go back again, knowing what I know now. Someone who decides to stay there should think of it as a bit of an urban adventure.
