{"text":"Enjoyed the Littre Overall I really enjoyed Hotel Littre and would recommend it to others who wish to stay in a great location that is quiet and close to the Metro station. Upon check-in we received a room upgrade, though my mom and I wonder if they do this for everyone. Nice touch regardless. The room was spotless during our eight day stay and there was plenty of room for two adults. No real view from the window, but that wasn't an issue for us. Room amenities and oddities: plenty of towels and wash cloths in the bathroom, standard soap and shampoo\/shower gel combo, hair dryer was functional though whimpy (the travel dryer I brought was no better though). There is no clock radio, but the television has an alarm option and clock. Be sure you know military time-subtract 12 from any time between noon and midnight to convert from military to non-military time. We asked for a wake up call one morning and it never came, I was glad we had set the t.v. alarm. Our room had slippers and bathrobes, another nice touch. So I know you aren't going to Paris to watch t.v., but the t.v. station selection was foul so now you can't say you didn't know. Someone failed to tell us that if the window was open the AC would not work. Sounds like a great invention, but when the housekeeper leaves the window open and you don't know the trick, you end up with a stuffy room. Don't know if this happens with the heat, you may want to check if you are staying during cooler months. Buffet breakfast was included in the room price, the food was ok, but the coffee was wonderful. We really liked the steamed cream brought with the pots of coffee. If breakfast is not included in your rate don't worry, there are shops on Rue Littre that will satisfy you with wonderful pastries and breads. The local butcher shop is only a few doors down and they had an amazing selection of meats and rotisserie chicken.The hotel mini bar was way over priced so find the Monoprix located inside the INNO by Gare Montparnasse for affordable drinks, wine, take out food and other grocery items. Shop here for treats to bring home to your co-workers. Pass on the hotel bar and hit a local brasserie (two can be found on Rue Littre).We were not impressed with the concierge services, when we asked for a dining recommendation the staff seemed at a loss. They ended up telling us to go out and make a left. Huh? Good thing we found Blvd Montparnasse and places to eat. I loved Montparnasse 1900, but the waiter was rude in the beginning, though by the end of our meal he warmed up to us. We never did figure out what that was about. Hotel staff did refer us to the travel agent just a few doors down where we made travel arrangements to Brussels on the high speed rail-what a fun journey (if you go, take a taxi from the rail station in Brussels to the Grand Place and bring your appetite for food and shopping). Hopefully you have found this information to be helpful and enjoy your stay in Paris!
