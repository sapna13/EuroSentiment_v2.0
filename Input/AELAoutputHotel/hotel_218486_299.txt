{"text":"Not what i expected... We just returned from Punta Cana Ocean Bavaro resort. we stayed from 7\/28 to 8\/4. the resort grounds are well kept, service is very poor. tipping will help but not so much. check-in was the worst. we got to the hotel @12 and finally got a room @4:30. they will give you a bracelet so that you can go and use the buffet. you may want to pack a bathing suit in a carry on bag so that you can at least get in the pool while the room is ready. we traveled with apple vacations and got a ocean view room in block 5. the view was incredible but had to change room the next day since the shower was not working. we were moved to block 6 room 6114. this was a larger room with a jacuzzi, the view was not as good as the one in block 5 but definitly a much nicer and newer room. the room was clean. Also, it is very humid in the room i recomend packing extra clothes since it takes a while for the clothes to dry. the beach was great but the water was not as clean since there were lots of sea weeds especially after a windy\/rainy day. there are plenty of chairs on the beach and by the pool however, if you want to be close to the beach and have an umbrella plan to get up early to claim the chairs. i got up at 7 to put towel on the chairs and never had any problems. the food is Ok, we tried all of the 5 restaurants on the resort. we found the japanese the mexican and the brazilian to be the best. you will need to make reservations for the restaurants. they take reservations by the main buffet area as early as 7 am. i got there each morning around 7:15 and always got what i wanted. the all you can eat buffet is also great, they have plenty to eat there. there is also a nice coffee shop by the lobby area. try the cappuccino and the cold frappuccino, they are great!! i recomend going to see the shows each night at the resort theater they are very good. plan to get there between 9:15- 9:30 to get good seats. Overall we had a good week at Ocean bavaro; however since both my wife and I got sick the last 2 days, I wold probably try another destination for our next trip...
