{"text":"Average not Excellent This is my first time staying at the Excellence resort and enjoyed my stay but would stay at another Excellence resort. Pros:Resort  BeachThe resort is always clean and well kept.Beach was very nice. The water was clear and the sand was soft. They have plenty of seats and umbrella for everyone, so need to wake up early to claim your spot. RoomHotel room is clean and spacious. We did see a few insects in our room when we came back from dinner two nights out of the 4 nights. I really like the Jacuzzi in our bedroom. StaffStaffs are excellent; they are very friendly and nice. All spoke English and I did not have a hard time communicating with the staff. The resort is catered toward Americans. They offered almost every thing in English. The TV stations were in English with CNN, Stars, Showtime, etc. which is great for me. Oh by the way they have a porn channel!Cons:RoomThe bed is very firm so we had a hard time getting a good night sleep. Toward the end of the trip I asked for a pillow top mattress to be placed on the bed but it never came. I would recommend you asking for the pillow top mattress the first night if the bed is too firm for you.Customer ServicesServices could be better. I went to one other all inclusive resort in Puerto Rico and their services was better than Excellence. We paid extra to get the Excellence Club services and I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think it worth it. We got to use the Club room where we had snack, food, drink, internet services, and dvd check out, but the extra attention was not there. I would not recommend the club service. As mentioned earlier, I had to ask for a pillow top mattress 3x and I still didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get it. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get turn down services a few days we were there. I guess since it is a big resort, housekeeping may have a hard time keeping up with the rooms.Food and EntertainmentThe food was okay. I had better all inclusive resort food. Some night we had to wait for 30 minutes to be seated in the restaurant. They have a wide selection of activities to do at the resort. They have cooking, dancing, and scuba classes. Every night they have a different show to entertain the guest. They also have a wide variety of sport activities to do at the Sport Bar (pool, air rifle, archery, ping-pong, tennis, cards, etc.) Airport FeeI was not aware that we had to pay $10 per person at the airport. Thanks goodness we had some cash on us. So make sure you bring cash!VendorsVendors were very pushy. I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like being bother at the beach every day with people trying to get me to sign up for the different activities on the beach. I understand that they are trying to make a living but it could be very bothersome. ShoppingI highly don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ recommend you shop at the airport. The airport was charging 2x more than the resort. There are a few shops at the end of the resort and I heard people got great deal from. I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know that there were shops at the end of the resort so I shopped at the stores in the resort. Make sure you ask for a discount.
