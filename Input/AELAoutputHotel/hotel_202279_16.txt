{"text":"Good Location to Airport - Served its purpose: one-night stay, near airport The Intercity Hotel is located right near the airport property in a suburb known as Cargo City Sud (South). The area is aptly named since there is literally nothing else around the hotel except warehouses full of cargo waiting to come into the city or go out of the airport. The Intercity Frankfurt Airport Hotel, which makes it a perfect choice for a night's stay before a early morning flight. My husband and I stayed at this hotel the night before we leave Frankfurt to Malaysia. This seemed to be a good spot prior to leaving on early flight.This hotel is part of the Steinberger chain of hotels. But note that there is another hotel, called Steinberger Hotel Airport. Do not confuse the two and take the wrong shuttle bus. Which, we did. Oops! The bus driver was kind enough to send us back to Terminal 2 to wait for the correct shuttle bus again.The hotel offers a free shuttle service to and from each airport terminal, every half hour. This is on a full-size city bus, and it is heavily utilized. But for our needs, traveling via free shuttle from\/to the airport was easy enough. If in the future I were in need of an airport hotel for a one-night stay, I would consider this one. The shuttle bus is very spacious and it's very convenient to carry our baggage and stroller in the bus no doubt the bus do not have luggage storage compartment. It is also very friendly towards handicapped passengers (especially those on wheelchair).Our rate was USD105 (twin double) √à√\u2020\u2022?(booked from otel.com), included a wonderful buffet breakfast and free shuttle to\/from the airport I seriously doubt that you can find any other rooms at this price so close to the airport, especially if you just need a place to sleep before a morning flight, this hotel is hard to beat.The hotel d√ã√\u2022√ñcor are modern, clean, and simple. We checked into a room with a twin bed. We find the rooms fairly spacious, clean and comfortable but some might find the bathrooms a bit tiny even by European standards, and contained a shower with no tub. No bar soap or shampoo was provided. Instead, liquid dispensers containing body wash were installed in the shower and next to the sink.Strangely enough, the bed slept well and was comfortable. Items in the mini-bar were reasonably priced and TV has English channels. Staff was professional and courteous. Queues for reception always seemed to be a bit long but the staffs were helpful and friendly. The service is ok and English is spoken by all.The restaurant (The Fluggi) had a decent buffet at each mealtime, and the food was good. Breakfast buffet is extensive and of a high quality. Excellent! There was a variety of fruits, yogurts, pastries, eggs, bacon and sausages with plenty of tea and coffee (expresso machine) to go around. The buffet dinner (forgotten how much we paid for) were fine but not memorable. The pub (Ju 52) was quaint and stocked with plenty of good beer and spirits.There is Internet in the lobby at an outrageous two Euros per minute. This is a good airport hotel, especially if you are looking for something close to the airport, but don't want to spend a fortune, this is a good choice. It is quite basic, but it beats the alternative of having to try and rush to the airport from other areas in the morning! Overall, this would be an okay hotel to stay for one night if you had a long layover or wanted to rest before a long flight. An excellent value - highly recommended!Be advised√à√\u2020\u2022?there is NOTHING to do near the hotel. You would need to go to the airport, then take the train into town for activities. This might not be such a good choice for business travelers staying several nights. Alternatively, since there is a train station right in the Frankfurt airport, using a non-airport hotel should also be considered; getting to such a hotel might not take any longer than traveling by shuttle to the InterCity Airport Hotel. Not recommended if you are looking for room service, etc. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2747,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":2739},{"endOffset":2792,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":2789},{"endOffset":2803,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2797},{"endOffset":2792,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":2789},{"endOffset":2803,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2797},{"endOffset":2792,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":2789},{"endOffset":2803,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2797},{"endOffset":2792,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":2789},{"endOffset":2803,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2797},{"endOffset":2792,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":2789},{"endOffset":2803,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2797},{"endOffset":3192,"mention":"fortune","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fortune_cookie"],"startOffset":3185}]}
