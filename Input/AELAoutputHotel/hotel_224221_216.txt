{"text":"amazing stay Just returned to Dublin after our five night stay at the Library hotel. Having read the reviews here we decided to book our stay with them and we were not disappointed at all. The hotel is on the corner of Madison and 41st. It's location is amazing, being one block from 5th avenue. Given its location, we walked everywhere. On the rare day when we were going further afield, Grand Central Station is 2 blocks away and you can catch many subways from there. Staff were very friendly and accomodating without being pushy or in your face. Our room wasn't ready on arrival as we got there early so they took our bags for us and we were advised that we can go to the second floor if we liked and have breakfast. There is also a room on the second floor which has two computers and a printer, which was so handy as we could print out directions to different sites and check our emails. The breakfast was substantial with lots of cereals, muffins, fruit, juices, eggs, bagels, cream cheese and different pastries. There was tea and coffee available all day and the champagne, wine, cheese, nuts and crackers were amazing. It was great after being out walking all day to return and have a glass of champagne to relax before heading out for the night.We stayed in a petite double room, which I think is the smallest room that they offer but it was fine for the two of us and we would book it again. It was spotless and we got a room on the 8th floor so it was quiet. Nice amenities left in the bathroom and good water pressure in the shower. Hair dryer in the room also was good. We had also emailed them prior to arriving to advise them that we were celebrating a special occasion while we were there and they left a bottle of champagne in our room and a personalised card wishing their congratulations which was a very nice touch. Will definitely stay here again next time.
