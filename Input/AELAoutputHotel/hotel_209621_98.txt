{"text":"OK ... if you REALLY love Art Deco! My friend and I stayed at the Normandie for five nights in mid-August. This was my second trip to PR, and having stayed at the neighboring Caribe Hilton before (and having walked over to the Normandie and been really impressed by the gorgeous lobby) I decided to book our stay for this second trip at the Normandie, since I really love Art Deco, and since they offered a great rate of $130+tax a night. When checking in I made sure I asked for a room AWAY from the N Lounge (since many other reviewers here have recommended that) ... the check-in lady seemed amused\/surprised, but she gave us one nevertheless.Well, what I realized upon staying here is that 99% of the hotel's charm lies in its magnificent exterior and its amazing public areas (the aforementioned lobby and the very unusually-shaped pool). The room itself was a disappointment. Keep in mind the rooms with King beds (like the one we had), which are all located at either ends of the building, are much smaller than the ones with two double beds which are all located in the middle portion of the building, although if you ask for one in the rear of the building the sea-view is much better. There were stains on the walls (especially in the bathroom), the ceilings and the whole bathroom itself were very institutional (ugly and unimaginative, as if all the class and style visible in the lobby area somehow disappeared when one got into the bathroom or looked at the bedroom ceiling). Housekeeping was also hit-or-miss (bottled water some days, none on others, only one coffee pack, and a very distasteful If you need more coffee, let housekeeping know and we'll add $5 to your room charge!). There were also no washcloths in the bathroom, only bath towels and hand towels. The bed looked comfortable, but actually was not very (it was soft but strangely unsupportive). The separate nook for the desk was nice (unusual), and the oversized desk as well as the TV counter were magnificent pieces of modern, Scandinavian-style furniture. A two-seater couch would have been nice to have in addition, especially by the window (they just provided a single-seater).The BIGGEST disappointment however was the lack of a balcony (unless you rent one of the very few and VERY expensive executive-level suites). I applaud the hotel designers for imaginatively designing it to reflect the spirit of an ocean liner, but didn't those have balconies? What's the point of a seaside hotel if there is no place to sit out in private with a friend and enjoy the view and breeze?The other gripe I had was that, while the hotel lobby cafe was extremely overpriced (which is reasonable, given how beautiful the surroundings are and how tasty the food is), but there were NO budget ($25pp) eating options within walking distance except the Subway restaurant. The Condado and Old San Juan areas are much better in this regard, and that's where one had to go to (and pay the to-and-fro cab fare) in order to get meals that did not cost a minimum of $100 for two people.But all said and done, I did not regret my choosing to stay here, because after all, it is a one-of-a-kind building (an absolute Art Deco treasure) with very intriguing history, and it's the kind of place any Art Deco lover ought to stay in at least once. But ONCE is really the keyword for me. I don't think I will stay here again, because when I vacation in a tropical seaside location I absolutely MUST have a balcony, even if it is just a small one. I also need the option of having local restaurants nearby to provide an alternative to expensive in-hotel food.Tip: Actually, having traveled to PR, St. Thomas, and St. Croix, I must say that beach-front hotel rooms are surprisingly cheaper in the US Virgin Islands than they are in PR, even though the latter have a reputation of being more upmarket. But then the biggest reason for me to visit PR is for the people ... simply among the friendliest and most cheerful people I have met in all my travels. Places like USVI and Jamaica don't come anywhere close in terms of friendliness and hospitality to PR, which is why I will visit this beautiful island again and again, if I can...
