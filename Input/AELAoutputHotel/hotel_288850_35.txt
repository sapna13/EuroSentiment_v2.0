{"text":"Great hotel, but no Amsterdam atmosphere Generally this is an excellent hotel, but not suitable for tourists who want to experience the city and late nights; however, great for stop overs or business. A shuttle service takes guests back and forth to the hotel during the day - the journey is approx. 10 mins. From the airport you can then catch a train into A'dam centre which takes around 30 mins. All-in-all I would allow one hour from leaving your room to reaching central A'dam. The hotel is situated in a business\/office park on the edge of the airport so there are no amenities outside the hotel, nor nowhere to walk.I stayed in a standard room, which was very well furnished and clean, but I would have found it a bit small for two people. I was somewhat concerned about the feather beds and waking up with an allergic reaction - but they were very comfy. There are two restaurants and a bar (american style); the bar served reasonably prices food, approx. 20 euros for a meal. Breakfast was excellent, but 22 euros a pop. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Free wifi is available in the lobby and bar area, but no wifi in standard rooms! The tv had a good variety of channels, an on-demand movie service. (Parents beware of the adult channels - they are not completely locked and can be previewed.)My only criticism of service was the checking out procedure - this took 20 mins of waiting around, then dealing with a trainee, then dealing with someone else, during which time I was becoming increasingly nervous about missing my flight. Also the lobby was on many occasions swamped with people meeting for business workshops etc. ","annotations":[]}
