{"text":"Great resort !!!!!! Stayed at the Sirenis Tropical from April 13 -20 and had a great week full of Sun, great food and lots of activities . Arrived on Sunday morning at 11 am. and our rooms were not ready until 2 pm. but this was not a problem as they watched your luggage while you headed for the beach , pool or bar to begin your fun. Rooms at the tropical are spacious and well kept . The maids did a great job on our room each day and never an issue here. The breakfast buffet was good with lots of variety and the morning Coffee was great. The staff at the buffets were very freindly and were always available to assist you. The Dominican people are some of the friendliess and funniest people you will ever meet. The pool is beautiful and the two swim up bars are very popular . The bartenders were friendly and the drinks are awesome . The beach and beach hut area were very nice with a beach barbecue and bar area so you don`t have to go far for your food and drinks when your at the beach . The activties during the day were a blast and the entertainment crew worked hard to make sure everyone was involved . Chico Rico , James Bond and Spahgetti were especially friendly . The entertainment crew worked all day at the beach and then performed nightly at the shows which were also great . The A la carte restuarants were good ranking them 1-4 , Italian , Chinese , Steakhouse and Mexican . Shopped for souvenirs on both sides of the resort ( you have to barter with them for a good price) found the shopping at a plaza (5 minutes away - $5.00 by taxi)of the resort better . My wife and i went with another couple and completely enjoyed our stay at the sirenis and are looking forward to returning again .
