{"text":"Great Hotel! ..Please Read The hotel is in a prime location as far as attractions, dining and restaurants. The staff was extremely professional, very delightful, friendly and extremely helpful. The rooms were considerably small, however, I felt at home! My room offered a very nice decor.. It was a bit on the small size.. considerable smaller than the average size hotel room but I felt very comfortable while staying in it. My room offered a decent size bathroom with a stand-up shower-l arge enough for two, it was very clean, and house keeping comes by twice a day to make sure you have clean towels. My bed was very, very comfortable, furnished with a down comforter, and down pillows.The room also offers free high speed internet and a desk to do work if needed. Their was a cd player and a complintary cd in the player to listen to during my stay..I enjoyed it very much that I purchased it before leaving. The tv featured all the local channels, cable channels and the latest movies for order.The armour was very nice but not large enough for more than one person so if you are not traveling alone, keeping your clothing in your suitcase seems to be your only option. The room also features a mini bar with snacks and refreshments, including, water, soda, wines and liquors all for purchase...HOWEVER, i do recommend you finding a liquor store nearby if you plan on having a drink in the room.. and picking up all your needed items because a small (one shot) bottle of Belveder Vodka was $9.50. Snacks were condsiderably reasonable but if you dont want to spend unnecessary money..stop at a local store!Room service was OK. If traveling on the weekend, give yourself about 45 minutes to order because it takes that much time for them to arrive due to many orders. Breakfast is served from 6:00AM- 11:00AM and they do not take any breakfast orders after that so don't call past that time if you are looking to eat breakfast in. As far as the menu- for breakfast.. their is not a great deal to choose from but the french toast and smoked bacon was pretty good but ask for extra maple syrup on the side if you enjoy syrup because they hardly give you any. as far as dinner and desserts... i enjoy salt with my food but the food was EXCEPTIONALLY SALTY.... the lobster sandwich with fries was pretty good but do not get your hands on the ceaser salad if you have high blood pressure because it is wayyy too salty..as far as dessert . they offer only two sweets..the chocoate bread pudding, and the coffee cream brulee..if you enjoy bread pudding which is why i ordered it, you will be very disappointed because it did not taste anything like it! they also offer coffee-cream brule but that was pretty goodAs far as the fitness room, it was also very small but managable and noone is ever in it so working out in there was very nice because I felt like it was my own room.As far as the hotel resaurant ko prime I never had the chance to eat in there but Its decor was very nice.As far as nearby dining, lucca Restaurant was great! It is located on Hanover street in the heart of Boston's little itay. I ordered the antipasta for two which was very good and I had the beef tenderloin which was excellent and the service was up to par. Tresca was also very good.Overall, my stay here was very pleasant and I felt very comfortable here but the above average rating that I give is more because the staff here is excetionally better than most other places that Ive stayed and also the location is great! Enjoy your stay.. if you have any further questions you can contact me!
