{"text":"Marriott Frankfurt is a great hotel for business travelers. I stayed at the Marriott Frankfurt for a week during October of 2006. The room was outstanding and a decent size for a European hotel. As to Marriott's usual standards, the bed was at the high end of what you can expect at a good hotel.For doing business, the Marriott is nice and close to the financial district (walking distance) and right beside the large convention center. There is also public transportation (trolley) immediately outside the front doors with easy access to all the tourist sites in Frankfurt.The main terminal is also within walking distance (10 min) and there is plenty to explore in and around the station. You can also catch one of the out of city trains for longer trips.The tower itself is extremely high and offers outstanding views of the city and park situated to the side of the building. There is also an American style restaurant off the main lobby that offers great tasting ribs and wings. I don't usually visit hotel restaurants (especially casual ones) but the restaurant is fantastic to have a beer and a snack before heading off to bed after a long day working. The staff at the front desk were outstanding and managed to process my checkin in only a couple of minutes. I also left my bags in storage on the last day while I toured the markets and musuems of Frankfurt. If you stumble accross a street vender in an outdoor market selling Brats on a kaiser, try one (they're delicious!)I hightly recommend a business stay while in Frankfurt at the Marriott!
