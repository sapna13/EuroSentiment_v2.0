{"text":"fantasic holiday Me and my boyfriend have just returned from a stay in the Sirenis Tropical suites, we only went for a week but I would of been quite happy to stay for a lot longer.We stayed in room H006 it was on the ground floor so has a terrace balcony and was based near to the main path but was still private. The room itself was a little tired and warnout in places but the beds were comfy the room was very clean so overall had no reason to complain. Our maid was very friendly , I was dissapointed that I only got a few animal shaped towels and flowers but one couple we got chatting to got flower petals in thier bed everyday with different towel arangements (Each block seemed to have its own maid and they obviously do there own thing)I cannot fault the staf in the hotel they were always so friendly and happy to see you, and assist in anyways they could, what we did find though esp with the barmen if you leave a tip on your first visit to the bar you did seem to get your drinks alot quicker the rest of the week. I recommend the cocktails, I think me and my boyfriend worked are way through the entire list.The buffet restuarant where you have, breakfast lunch and dinner is huge, we never had a problem finding anywhere to sit and the staff again filling your glasses up with water, wine etc even if its only a little empty, one thing I can say is you will never be hungry im quite a fussy eater but there is such a big varitey that even I was happy.The pool and beach are lovely I couldnt actually believe how quiet the hotel was, always a sunlounger free and the fact that you can swap your towels asoon as they get too wet or dirty was a plus, the swim up bar was a great place to meet different people a real socialising place.The only time the hotel seemed busy was at the weekend when the locals were about but they mainly just stayed to themselves and again they are all very friendly.You wll never be bored in the evenings the entertainments team work SO hard, they put on shows everynight from dirty dancing to Greese, A few of them can speak nearly 5 languages so that you dont feel left out, very friendly always getting you invoved with things and VERY energetic (I dont know how they can do it)All in all loved this hotel and my week here will definelty be going back it was a fantasic holiday.
