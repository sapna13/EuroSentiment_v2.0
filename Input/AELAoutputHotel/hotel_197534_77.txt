{"text":"Thumbs up...a most pleasant stay in Paris We stayed at the Hotel Napoleon for two nights during Spring Break in the first week of April. Our family of four very much enjoyed the experience.We booked our rooms through Expedia, and had been looking for a nice, centrally located and decently priced room that could accommodate a family of four. The reviews on TripAdvisor helped us to decide on this hotel. While the rate that we booked our junior suite was not a cheap one, we thought that we got good value for our money.As noted in earlier reviews, the Hotel is quite well-located just a few blocks from the Arc de Triomphe, and is a short walk to the Champs Elysees and Place de Charles de Gaulle Metro\/RER station. Taking advantage of the spring weather, we actually walked from the Hotel Napoleon down the Champs Elysees through the Place de La Concorde and Tuillieries Garden to the Louvre in just over an hour.The hotel itself was a pleasure. It is a well-kept property that has lots of nice older furnishings with modern touches like flat-screen TVs and in-room Internet access. The interior design was quite baroque, particularly for those of us familiar with the minimalist chic of modern boutique hotels. We had nineteenth century style furniture in our room, along with plentiful and colorful drapes\/wall hangings and a leopard-spotted carpet. Somehow, it all worked together and fit with this historical building. The junior suite had a separate sitting area, a large bathroom with large tub and separate shower stall and a separate walk-in closet for coats\/luggage.The staff was very pleasant and helpful with check in, check out and luggage storage. Our Expedia reservation was handled seamlessly.Our family has agreed to make the Hotel Napoleon the place to stay for our future trips back to Paris.
