{"text":"Great value, quiet place The stay was great, I can only cite user adt52's comment: The Hotel Icaria is a fantastic place. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast which was included in our cost was second to none. The room was nice and clean, very comfortable - though some might be a little annoyed by the technology (hint: the key-cards). Location is quiet, near to the beach and Port Olimpic, bus stops for lines 14  41 that take you to the centre (Monument Colom, Placa Catalunya...) and 92 (to the Park Guell)are in front of the hotel, and a shopping mall is some 100 m away. Taxis are all around and relatively cheap, metro works really great.  From the airport (besides a taxi of course) you can take the Aerobus to the Placa Catalunya (4 EUR per person) and from there bus 41 across the street (or 14 that stops in famous La Rambla some 100 m further), but the Renfe train line from the airport to Estacio de Franca would be the best solution as you can use a single ticket for the ride (unfortunately, at the time of our visit this line was not accesible). Check the Bus turistic lines as they seem a good option (not personally tested), one of the lines stops near hotel - othervise take advantage of the cheap T-10 bus\/metro\/Renfe\/tram ticket. And of course, prepare yourself by searching the 'Net for all the info you can absorb before you embark! :-) ","annotations":[]}
