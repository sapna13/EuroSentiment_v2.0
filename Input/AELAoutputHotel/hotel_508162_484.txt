{"text":"Dream Come True!!! I have to say that I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ already planning my next trip To Dreams Punta Cana. From the moment I stepped foot into this beautiful oasis my senses were filled with fragrant incense and grand luxury. As I pulled up to the hotel I was welcomed with smiling faces and the utmost warmth. I immediately left my world behind and entered a tropical paradise which I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ wait to return to.If you want to get away  Really enjoy yourself then Dreams is definitely where you want to stay. The rooms are situated near the beach and the serpentine pool which encircles the area. You can either sip on pina coladas and soak in the sun or you can participate in the countless, fun activities the staff has prepared during the day at the beach  poolside. Every night a very talented team of professional entertainers create a Beautiful show for your enjoyment. I have to say that the entertainment staff and management team is one of the friendliest, professional, hard-working, and multi-talented group I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe ever met. Can they move!!! I had the most amazing time with everyone and anticipate my next vacation. They made the trip most memorable(Happy Happy, Clappy, Clappy) and without them my vacation wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be the same. I miss them all already-Mickey Mouse, 50 Cent, Michael Jackson, Usher, JJ, Carlos, Harvi, Judy, July, Latecia, Louis, Bezil , Julio, Jose (hope I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not forgetting anyone)The staff is so accommodating and the dining experience was Excellent. From a multitude of restaurants and cuisines from which to choose the food is delicious and very well prepared. The hotel itself is impeccably clean and the spa is ohh so divine.So, would I recommend Dreams? In a heartbeat!!! ","annotations":[]}
