{"text":"Rooms without Windows Many rooms at the Hotel Milano have NO windows. None, they are like closets. I reserved directly through the hotel and neither their website or any of the communications I had regarding my reservation made any mention that the $155 room I had booked was window-free. I would have never reserved the room and in fact would have paid more for even a sliver of real light. It was really claustrophobic.Of course by the time I was in, the place was full - as was San Juan - so I had no choice. A sympathetic staff person said it was the policy to only tell people their room would not have a window if they asked. When was the last time you thought to ask: will my room have a window?Other complaints (which I would normally let go, but am willing to list given the hotel's unethical policies regarding giving guests full information about their rooms):1) The advertised wi-fi doesn't always work. Another guest and I couldn't get the system to give our laptops IP addresses to connect.2) Breakfast only lasts until 10am, not uncommon but with a noon check-out time you'd think staff would let guests know the hours, especially given the relatively generous check-out time. I found no hours posted in the room (I did find some lights so I could see in the room...)3) Also minor but worth noting: the TV channel selection is woeful. C-SPAN but not network stations that would show things like the NFL during playoff season.All-in-all, I wish I could have liked the Hotel Milano but the egregious policies regarding the sale of windowless rooms plus the general lack of comfort means I can't. At least I wasn't tempted NOT to spend every waking moment outside of the hotel enjoying San Juan.
