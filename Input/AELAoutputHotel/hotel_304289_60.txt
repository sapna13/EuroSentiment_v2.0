{"text":"Convenient location in central downtown Tokyo The Hilton is comparable to most city hotels you find in large cities, like Tokyo, New York, London, etc. The more you pay the better amenities you are going to get. So in an expensive city like Tokyo if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ pay a lot of money you won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get top notch luxury most times. I think that pretty clear. There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ typically two ways to improve your chances of getting a better room in hotels, pay more or join loyalty programs. In my case my experience at the Hilton was pleasant. I stayed there for close to a month. I was fortunate because I could pay a reasonable price but since I am a Diamond member I was upgrades to a junior suite. So the lesson here is usually a hotel will treat you better if you are loyal otherwise pay a lot of money to gain access to the amenities. That√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ just the fact of life in big cities across the world especially since now the hotel industry is booming again due to business travelers traveling more again. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ just supply and demand, so prices are high.The other nice things I liked about this hotel is it is centrally located and in walking distance of the Shinjuku Station. And for me this was important because that was my mode of transportation to get to work and it is the fastest way to get around because there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a lot of traffic. There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a good variety of restaurants to choose from but I always suggest to people to venture out into town. This is also a way to get better prices on food. The views of the city and Mt. Fuji is a plus if you are on a higher floor. ","annotations":[]}
