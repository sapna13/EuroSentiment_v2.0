{"text":"Great stay at Springhill Suites Stayed here June 28 for 2 nights prior to our Alaskan cruise and one night after the cruise. Room was booked by our tour company and what a pleasant surprise! The staff was great - very accommodating. Our room was a nice size with a mini kitchen. Bathroom was spotless and had a brand new shower head that was just wonderful after a long day of sightseeing. The pool was rather small and in the afternoon seemed to be rather crowded. The fitness room was small also, but all guests of the hotel were welcome to use the 24-hour fitness center just across the street - just show them your room key. Also across the street is a Starbucks, of course! The location was great for us - we don't mind walking. The hotel offers a free shuttle service to the Space Needle, but you have to make reservations for it - we didn't want to be bothered since everything was within walking distance. Pike Place Market and the waterfront were just about a 15-minute walk and a great shopping district just a 10-minute walk. In the Westlake Mall, within the shopping district, you can catch the monorail ($2 each way) to the Space Needle. There was a Whole Foods market also within walking distance that offers a great salad bar and hot food bar if you don't feel like eating out at a restaurant. You could eat in the market or take it back to the hotel. I highly recommend Springhill Suites for a pleasant stay in Seattle.
