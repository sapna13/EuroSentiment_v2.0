{"text":"It All Depends What You Want... We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour group, and as with most things in life, it is dependent upon one's expectations. I would say this is probably closer to a 2.5 star hotel, rather than a 3 star hotel, and while we liked it just fine, we would not opt to stay here again on our own time.Because I was traveling with my father, we were assigned a 3-bed, 2-room suite, #37, which was really nice. The rooms were clean and well-maintained, and the maids cleaned it daily. The shower is a good size, and one of the more well-behaved showers I have experienced in Italy, but the toilet seat is awkwardly large and I found it especially uncomfortable. We were never able to open our large windows, but since there was only a street and another building outside, we did not mind too much. The downside of being on the outside wall was we did pick up a lot of traffic noise, as well as the city's bells. Not enough to really be a problem, but someone who is sensitive to noise will probably want to request a room on the opposite side.Breakfast is served in a bright and open terrace area on the top floor of the hotel, but not on the tower. It is self-service of pastries, yogurt, and fruit, as well as water and juice. On each table is an additional basket of pastries, and the servers will bring you coffee, tea, or cappucino. The desk staff is very helpful and friendly, and will hold your key for you when you go out, if you wish. There is wi-fi available, and a computer where one can purchase 5 euros\/hour of internet time. The cheapest internet points in Florence are near Santa Maria Novella, and on Via Faenza. The hotel itself is practically around the corner from the Ponte Vecchio, which puts it in the more pricy tourist zone, but Florence is so compact I found it well worthwhile to venture after the cheaper internet cafes.Because I prefer smaller, homey BB style hotels, I would probably not have picked this hotel on my own, nor would I stay there again. However, someone who wants to stay in an old tower building, in a safe, clean hotel with a helpful, English-speaking desk staff, could do a lot worse.
