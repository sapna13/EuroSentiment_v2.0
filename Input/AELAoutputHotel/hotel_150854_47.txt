{"text":"Small things could spoil the trip! I stayed a the Riu Palace in Punta Cana, Dom Rep from June 20-24th, 2008. Do not be alarmed by the drive to a beautiful resort. The local scenery was very dirty and unattractive. However, the resort itself was very beautiful. My first impression of the room was clean but smelled like mildew because of the humid climate. Everything in the room was wet making a good nights rest uncomfortable. There was plenty to drink with alcohol in the rooms and a refrigerator to store additional items. The buffet was displayed very nicely but the flies sampled everything ruining the appearance. The staff was friendly at the resort until it was time to shop. They were very aggressive while tempting to sell overpriced and outdated merchandise making the shopping very uncomfortable and tiresome. Do not rely on off resort shopping. The experience was unfriendly and rude almost to the point where I felt as if they would physically harm me if I did not make a purchase. There was inconsistent pricing from guest to guest and the hospitality short-lived if you gave a sense of browsing. There were times when I was not given my change back and the taxi driver tried to charge my friend and I $20 for a ride to the next resort. With this, I would not advise leaving the resort without a male escort. There was plenty to do and much fun as you make it. I loved the pool area, the outdoor bar and the view. You may get hungry throughout the night because the 24 hour food in the Sports Bar was old and unsanitary. I would recommend the stay for the price but would probably reconsider because of some of the negative hospitality.
