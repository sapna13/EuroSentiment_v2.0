{"text":"please read before booking If you get a good rate, you only want a place to sleep. This hotel is for you. If you are wanting a hotel with all the little extras, do not book this hotel. I was there for part of my honeymoon in July and was so disappointed. I had read the reviews and research the hotel on the internet. It claimed to serve a breakfast to your room, deliver a paper to your room, and be brief walk to the beach. The breakfast is in the lobby. I know many hotels do serve in the lobby, but they don't claim to have in the room. I didn't receive a Sunday paper. When I called to ask why , they respond by saying they don't deliver the Sunday paper. The real bad part was construction going on across the street. It was so loud early in the morining. I know they can't help what other hotels are doing, but they could mention it on their website. I think I brief statement about construction would be helpful to future customers. The construction also blocks quick beach access. You should expect about 10 minute walk . I also booked a massage for two. They overbooked. My husband and I were sent to aqua bamboo(about 1 mile away). We did agree to go. We were told to come down for a cab about 6:30 p.m. and didn't get to leave to after 7. I hate to admit I like the Bamboo hotel better. The deluxe view is not woth the money. I know these are small things, but they are reason I booked the hotel over others with miltary discounts. I thought the attention to detail would overcome the fact it was away from the beach. It wasn't. Tripadvisor did exactly job on the rest of my stay in Hawaii at maui and big island. At one time, this hotel may have earned it's ratings. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone at this time. (By the way, I was charged twice for my deposit. Please check your bill and allow time for mistakes on it.) ","annotations":[]}
