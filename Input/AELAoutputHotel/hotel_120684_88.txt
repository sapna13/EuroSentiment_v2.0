{"text":"fun place for honeymoon we went to honolulu as a side trip from our main honeymoon in kauai. overall, i would say that i prefer kauai 10 to 1 over honolulu, but that is not the point of this post, after all. first off, the outrigger is in GREAT location. it really cant be beat. the property has a number of GREAT restaurants, esp Dukes. we were there on a sunday and some locally famous musician was playing outside at Dukes--it was a real party and packed with locals. that being said, this hotel may be best for the younger crowd who likes loud music and partying. the view from our room was spectacular. we book oceanfront and starred off miles into the pacific every morning. no sunset views from anywhere in the building though--the sheraton is in the way. The pool area was fun and poolside service is good. food not too expensive and drinks are standard. a tip for those like me who want to save money on alcohol--go across teh street and buy your stuff from ABC and bring along a soft sided cooler from home and tote it with you to the pool. no one will stop you. The only problem with this places as I see it is the cost. we paid 350 for our room, and yes had a great view, but it just felt lacking for that price. The inside seems a little bit old and out of date. The service was nice, but I did NOT like the check in process. The guy sat us down and offered us a drink, and everything is going fine. Then the guy starts talking real loud about how much the room will cost and all of that. My wife almost lost it when she found out how much it was. Whether you prices are high or low, please use some discretion! I know how much it costs--I booked the darn thing!definitely see pearl harbor. we rented a car for 2 days from budget at the airport and only paid 50 bucks TOTAL. (just avoid buying any of their insurance). We paid as much in parking (25\/day) as we did for the car.overall if i go back to waikiki (unlikely), I would stay here again. Maybe I would just go for the cheapest room I could get and not worry about it b\/c apart from the view, they're all the same (and not really that nice). spend most of your time at their pool, beach, and restaurants which are all genuinely fun.
