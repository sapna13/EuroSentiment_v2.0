{"text":"Excellent choice This hotel is extremely quiet, centrally located (you can walk to both the Royal Palace and the Prado), within a block of one metro line and two blocks of two others, and the staff is generally very helpful. The front desk was able to identify all Italian restaurants within a ten block radius for us and also printed out all the train schedules for day trips and could make reservations. There were only two things I didn't like about the hotel: whatever cleaning fluid they use on the towels has a pretty distinctive and unlikeable odor. If this sort of thing bothers you, bring your own towels. Also the stuffed animal that my daughter had hand-made disappeared from her room, and it took four visits to the front desk before they would call the laundry to see if it got mixed up in the sheets. They never did find it. Presumably one of the housekeeping staff took it, which points up a general problem with Madrid and indeed every city we visited in Spain: the petty theft and pickpocketing is completely out of control. There were three attempts on us and we watched as a thief brazenly walked into a restaurant where we were sitting on the main street in Madrid and started to walk out with someone's camera after eyeing our (well-protected) backpacks. If you are going to visit this country you have to start out with the presumption that they are going to get you unless you are on alert all the time. Also the hotel restaurant at the Preciados is very expensive by American standards and the lobby is currently undergoing some sort of renovation so that a small part of it is blocked off.
