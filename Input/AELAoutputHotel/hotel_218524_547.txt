{"text":"Beautiful beach, terrible food We just stayed at the Excellence for 5 nights. While we definitely enjoyed the experience and found it incredibly relaxing, there were some negatives. Maybe we're spoiled by the food in New York, but the food at the Excellence was, for the most part, awful, in our opinion. We found the only decent options were the Asian restaurant and the pizza at the beach. We also ate at the Italian restaurant (mushy pasta), the Grill (tough, overcooked chicken and instant mashed potatoes), and the French restaurant (heavy sauces and fish overcooked to the point of being inedible). All of the tables for two at the restaurants seem HUGE, which is odd when the place is so obviously trying to encourage intimacy in every other way. And the music in the restaurants (or the karaoke from the plaza) is awful. We decided to upgrade to the Excellence Club mostly for the availablility of snacks, since I had read some bad reviews of the food, but found the food there to be either bland or greasy, and the same exact spread every day. That said, the Excellence staff was very nice and helpful and we couldn't have asked for a more beautiful beach. We got up early and snagged the canopy beds on the beach almost every day -- total heaven. It is, however, very annoying when people claim spots in various places and don't use them. If the food had been better, we might have gone back, but since that's something that's pretty important to us, I think next time we'll try a different vacation destination.
