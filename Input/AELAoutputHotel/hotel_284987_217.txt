{"text":"Has potential but has many problems Spent 5 nights for business and pleasure at resort. Here are the goodparts. Nice pool, gardens and facility overall. Beach is long but in most places pretty thin. The resort seems to be on a point and it blocks most wave action near the beach which results in very still waters. Rooms were quite large and nice overall. The rooms are cabanastyle and pretty spread out on the facility. Expect to walk quite a bit. The hotel offers golf cart shuttle service for your bags and self but it can be spotty. Now for the bad. You are isolated. If you do not have a car, you are stuck with the hotel food service which is mediocre at best. It is pricey too boot. Check-in took me about 1\/2 hour. Service is spotty and overall slow. (My room was always nicely made and cleaned each day however.) Forget about taking a cab to explore the area because they cannot promise you that you will get a cab to return (especially at night.) The hotel is about an houraway from Old San Juan. There are no nearby resturants. The rainforest is nearby however. There is a golf course (Coco Beach) nearby but expect to pay $10 shuttle service for a van to take you a 1\/4 mile. The course is expensive which is typical for outsiders in PR and not well maintained. It has a pretty nice design but needs a lot of maintenance. Some bunkers had nice powdery sand, others had rock-filled dirt. Overall, there are better choices in San Juan area.
