{"text":"Great location + great price= fantastic hotel! I was in town for a conference and all of the conference hotels were booked- since I used to live in Boston, I remembered the Charlesmark and was very pleased to not only find that they had rooms available, but to find out that their room rates were almost $100 less than the other area hotels!! We arrived early in the day and they let us check in early. It's true that the rooms are on the small side, but I found the space to be more than ample for just me. The room had a queen sized bed and a small pull out sofa. My bathroom was smaller because I was next to the elevator, but I was very happy with the slate tile and the large shower stall. My co-worker's bathroom was about 3X the size of mine, and he had a bathtub, but the trade off was that I had 2 huge windows overlooking the Boston Public Library while he had a window to the alley. Since I was right next to the elevator, I expected it to be loud throughout the night but was very surprised when it was quiet all night long. I love city noise, so I wasn't disturbed being right on busy Boylston St., but if you're not used to nighttime city noise, it might take some getting used to!I think one thing that we all loved was that the room is wired with surround sound and besides the Direct TV channels, it also has all of the music channels, so showering with music playing was a big hit for all of us! The hotel serves a small continental breakfast in the morning with fruit, bagels, muffins  donuts  instant oatmeal. There is also coffee  juice. Since I'm familiar with the area, I opted to grab breakfast elsewhere but I did bring it back and sat in the hotel's lounge to eat. The lounge is really nice and at night, turns into a very hip bar. It got pretty busy on the weekend but was still a nice chill place to relax.The Charlesmark's location can't be beat. You're right across from the Copley T stop and within walking distance of pretty much the entire city. I highly recommend this hotel. I know that when I come back to Boston, this is definitely where I will stay!
