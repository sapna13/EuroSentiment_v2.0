{"text":"Loved it!!! We just returned from 2 weeks at the Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana, we had a gr8 time and would recommend it to people who want to get away from it all and RELAX.Where do I start???????Cleanliness - from the rooms to the pools to the restaurants, we were amazed at how clean and tidy and the keen attention to detail that was used, especially in a resort as big as this - and it definately is big!Rooms - not luxurious, but comfortable, air conditioned along with a fan which is needed on the hot days ~(of which we had many). The maids are very attentive, especially if you tip them regularly!Food - we were so suprised, we have stayed in an all inclusive in Bavaro before and the food was appalling. This hotel astounded us, the food in the buffets was excellent (not always hot) but the variety was excellent, and it didn't feel like a cattle market as can sometimes happen in a buffet. The speciality restaurants were also above expectations especially The Gourmet which could rival many A La Carte restaurants back home. The Steak House wasn't up to scratch which disappointed my husband, but the Mexican and Italian were very good.Reception - Friendly but be careful, they tried to diddle us a couple of times when giving change etc.Bars - The Lobby Bar gets really busy but the waitresses are really friendly. My husband thinks the spirits are watered down but never the less he downed far too many cocktails!Casino - I think the staff in there have all had sense of humour bypasses, you will mfind it really difficult to get them to smile. BEWARE, drinks are not all inclusive in here (madness really)! Another thing we found was that if you pay for things in Dominican Pesos, you pay roughly half of what you would if you paid in US$ so make sure you have the local currency with you!Shops - The lobby shops were ok, have limited stocks of things. It is the only source of medical supplies within the resort, so prepare yourself in advance as they charge astranomical prices for basics such as headache tablets. The staff in the shops aren't overly friendly.Beach - It is a really large and very clean beach with lots of watersports activities (book in advance).Pools - There are 2 main pool areas, the 1st in the centre of the resort, it is split into 2 seperate pools (1 for the Bavaro  1 for the Punta Cana) with a swim up bar. The pools are really clean and they put on entertainment such as aerobics. The larger pools are next to the beach, here you will find the snack bars (fabulous burgers) and swim up pool bars. This pool gets really busy and you find that the shaded sun loungers are taken really early every morning.The resort is honestly massive, but the transport from one end to the other is excellent, they continually have at least 3 train\/bus type things going up and down the resort from early in the morning to I think 3am every day.We didn't bother with the entertainment in the Theatre on an evening although, people said it was good especially for families.My only real gripe would be that on the occasions that we had rain (1.5 days in 2 weeks) there was very little to do - the events team didn't have a backup plan, which I think they should have considering the tropical climate.Definately take lots of sun lotion with you it gets sooooooo hot that the rain is welcome when \/if you get any.Enjoy ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2519,"mention":"burgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":2512},{"endOffset":2519,"mention":"burgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":2512},{"endOffset":2519,"mention":"burgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":2512},{"endOffset":2519,"mention":"burgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":2512}]}
