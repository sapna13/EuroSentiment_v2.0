{"text":"Check Out the Mercure Checkpoint Charlie ... you won't be disappointed! I found the staff to be very friendly, extremely helpful and professional  courteous at all times.The hotel itself was a joy. Great location and beautiful, clean  comfortable rooms. You could have quite easily fit more than myself in one ... if only, anyway ... despite the small reception area, we were allowed to make full use of it as our daily \/ nightly meeting point and virtually ended up dossing there when we staggered back from the nights out! Waiter service from the bar and we were set for life.The hotel is in a great location and we certainly found it within walking distance of the main sights we were so desperate to see: Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag etc. etc. not forgetting Checkpoint Charlie itself.The U-Bahn was minutes away and we had no problems in getting around. We easily found our way to the main stations where we took a train for Ravensbruck  Sachsenhausen. Those not joing us on that day - spent a lovely day at Lake Wannsee.We made friends with the staff and they looked after all of our needs. They advised us on nightlife as well as restaurants; where we were keen to try the local cuisine ... the bread  dripping starter isn't quite what your Mum gave you on a Sunday tea but it's good! The Berlin equivalent of the kebab shop or post-drinking-binge eatery is also a comfort ... mmmm ... bratwurst.GO TO BERLIN AND STAY AT THIS HOTEL ... you won't regret it. Our trip was all the better and more memorable thanks to the team at the Mercure Checkpoint Charlie ... thanks guys x ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1206,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1201},{"endOffset":1224,"mention":"starter","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pre-ferment"],"startOffset":1217},{"endOffset":1206,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1201},{"endOffset":1224,"mention":"starter","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pre-ferment"],"startOffset":1217},{"endOffset":1206,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1201},{"endOffset":1224,"mention":"starter","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pre-ferment"],"startOffset":1217},{"endOffset":1275,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1272},{"endOffset":1325,"mention":"kebab","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Kebab"],"startOffset":1320},{"endOffset":1325,"mention":"kebab","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Kebab"],"startOffset":1320},{"endOffset":1378,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":1371},{"endOffset":1378,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":1371},{"endOffset":1378,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":1371}]}
