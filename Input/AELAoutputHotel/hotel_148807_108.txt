{"text":"Nice resort in quiet location The Copamarina is a solid 3* resort. It offers plenty of space for enjoying a quiet, relaxing time or active amenities such as tennis, swimming, diving, snorkeling and a boat trip to Gilligan Island, a uninhabited picnic and snorkeling island.There is one upscale restaurant Alexandrias which is very good but not exceptional. The other restaurant offers beachside dining and on the weekends an all-inclusive program serving buffet style for breakfast and lunch. They will pack a picnic lunch for you if you are taking a day trip.Service is good, staff is very friendly and helpful. We had a problem opening our in-room safe and the maid took care of it immediately. The room was kept clean and cool. The resort has 2 pools, a hot tub and a wading pool for small children. This is a family resort with limited children's activities.There is a nice game room for the older children and teens andpeddle boats and ski-doos for an extra charge.There is a $15.00 per person beach towel fee which is refunded when you return the towels.The spa was clean and offered typical spa services of massages, facials, and various therapies. There is also a small exercise room with flat screen T.V., weight machine, bikes, eliptical, etc.They have conference rooms and a 3 bedroom private villa.The beach at the resort is kept clean and raked and there are huts, umbrellas and canopied day beds.They also have an on-site dive shop and mini-general store.All rooms have either balconies or patios, cable T.V., 3 phones, in-room safe and unstocked mini-fridge.We were there in late September for 4 days and it was very quiet, with the majority of guests being local Puerto Ricans.I would highly recommend the sunset snorkel trip from La Parquera with the Paradise Scuba and Snorkeling Center to the remote islands, dinner with the owner and an evening snorkel in the Phosphorescent Bay with the dinoflagelites, or a day trip to the Guanica Dry Forest which gets less than 15 inches of rain a year.
