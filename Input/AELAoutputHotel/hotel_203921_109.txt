{"text":"P_H We visited Firenze in the beginning of April 2008. Because of a real chaos at Zurich airport we arrived to Hotel David at 1:00 in the night, 11 hours later than scheduled. The receptionist was very helpful and she even would have fixed us some coffee and something to eat in the middle of night, but we were very exhausted and only needed sleep. Our room was not very spacious but newly painted and the beds were comfort. There were no shelves in the bathroom, which was a real flaw. The towels were changed every day, which is not usual in every hotel. Also the room was cleaned daily. Sometimes we heard snoring from the neighbour room, but it did not disturb us.During our five nights staying the breakfast was much the same every morning. Just sufficient to start the day and keep the hungry away until the lunchtime. In some morning the waitress even asked if we liked to have cappuccino, which was not in the regular choice. A pleasant surprise was the wine and snacks service every evening. The reception staffs were very helpful and ready to give advises. They behaved very tactfully, never self-assertive, but always were willing to help whatever we asked. The hotel has own web pages www.davidhotel.com where you can choose one of 16 languages to check the availability and make the reservation. That is what I call a standard of service.The hotel locates in peaceful surroundings, not in the historical centre. Anyway, there are good bus connections if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like to walk 15 √à√\u2020\u2022?30 minutes to reach the mainly tourist attractions.We enjoyed this decent hotel with obliging service, clean rooms and quiet nights to sleep. If we return Firenze some day, we surely check first the availability of Hotel David.
