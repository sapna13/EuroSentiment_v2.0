{"text":"The Best Holiday Ever!!! We stayed at the Bavaro from 2nd August until 17th August there were seven of us from the uk three teenagers and four adults.From the moment we landed at the airport we knew our holiday had begun the greeting of a band playing made you feel so welcome and the staff at the airport were very friendly, the transfer to the bavaro was a bit of a bumpy ride but we still felt very safe with the driver.On arrival at the Bavaro the check in was very simple and we were greeted with a nice cool drink although people before have said dont drink it because of the ice all the ice is made with purified water and is safe to have in your drinks. We had requested three rooms close together and they accomodated our request we were in rooms 2541,2543 and 2544 just of the main walkway and close to the pool and beach we had asked for beach front but due to the renovation work there were none available in hindsight we were very pleased with the rooms we got as the location was very central for everything we wanted ,our rooms were not the renovated ones but we were still very pleased with them we did look at the new rooms and they were very nice and i am sure that in time all the rooms will be done as they are working very hard to maintain the excellent standard.The grounds are very beautifull and the staff work all the time to make sure they stay that way the peacocks and flamingoes only add to paradise experience. The pool was wonderful and we had no problems getting beds the same also applied on the beach wich by the way when i was sat on it i thought i had died and gone to heaven need i say anymore!!!!I have read a lot of people saying bad things about the food i dont think they stayed the same place as we did,the food was fab we ate in the buffet the beach bar and the pool buffet also we got 8 reservations at the Bavaro restaraunts and one at the dominicana my top tip would be pay the extra to stay at the Bavaro as they are all airconditioned and this made it all more enjoyable, the food was excellant in all the Bavaro restaurants and we tried them all.Now to the best bit the staff they work so hard to make your holiday the best ever the waiters and waitress all the bar staff the star friends are just amazing i have never met such happy people anywhere else in the world they provide you with all day and night entertainment if you so wish and are not offended if you choose not to take part, the shows we saw were very good although we did only see two but when we return we will try to see more .Another top tip if you are travelling with teenagers they have to be wearing a white band to get into the night club i think it is age 16 and over although we had a 15year old with us so we changed her band and there were many 15 year olds in the disco had we not changed her band she would have been dissapointed, we had no issue with the teenagers bieng safe and they had a fab holiday meeting kids from all over the world.To finish this review i will say that we will be returning to the Bavaro and would not hesitate in reccomending this resort to anybody as you will find there is something for every age group and you can do as little or as much as you wish.
