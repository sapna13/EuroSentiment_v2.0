{"text":"Wonderful Stay Just returned from 5 nights at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe and really enjoyed it. The lobby was beautiful, nice area to sit with beautiful chandeliers. The staircase leading to the lower level was very grand as well. Our check in was swift and staff was very helpful and efficient. Front desk and conceirge all spoke english. We were upgraded to a suite that had two bathrooms and a seperate sitting room which was wonderful. Our room overlooked the outdoor courtyard and was very quiet. Our kids had a room that faced out over the street and they didn't complain of any noise either. The executive lounge for Hilton Honors guests was very nice for breakfast, snacks, drinks etc.We also had complimentary breakfast in the restaurant. The rooms were clean, comfortable and had art deco style. Our bathroom had both a shower and a seperate tub. The location was fine for us, not in the heart of the sights but close enough. It was a nice 10 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe. There were several nice place to eat within walking distance. The recommendations the conceirge made for dining were all very good, not touristy nor too expensive. We never had to wait for a taxi in front of the hotel and the doorman always made sure to tell the taxi driver exactly where we were going. Highlights of our trip were the segway tour and my husband and son went to the Normandy D Day tour. We are very glad we chose this hotel.
