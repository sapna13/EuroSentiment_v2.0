{"text":"Great Location I recently stayed at the Argonaut Hotel from 8\/4-8\/7. I chose the hotel based on the reviews here on Tripadvisor. I reserved the king size bed w\/ a view of the Cannery. The room (#381) was the same size as any other hotel room. It was above average. The window opened out to the plaza next to the Cannery. There was a band\/singer performing. I could clearly hear him, but it wasnt a nuisance. The room was $295\/day after tax which is a lot for anywhere but San Francisco. I did see the suite w\/ view of Bay and Alcatraz. Wow! Very nice room and large but i couldnt justify the extra cost. So all and all I was happy w\/ the hotel. The front desk and concierge were NOT helpful at all. I agree w\/ some other reviews in that it seemed the front desk wasnt happy w\/ their jobs. The doormen and bellhops on the other hand were helpful and great. The best things about the hotel were its location at Fisherman's Wharf and cable car turn around and the fact a Starbucks was located in the same building in the back. That was a life saver.  Here a couple of suggestions\/ideas\/random thoughts: The cable cars are very cool and are a great way to get around town. U can buy a one day pass on the cabe car itself ($11) and you dont need exact change. The operators are very helpful and outgoing. it can get very busy at certain times but i waited no more then 15-20 minutes. Alcatraz is a yawner!! As a tourist, one is obligated to go to Alcatraz. So go so u can say been there, done that. It's too crowded and uneventful. Buy tickets at least a week in advance and it will be windy and a bit chilly on the ferry ride. Fisherman's Wharf is a tourist trap nightmare. There are so many people milling about. Cheap t shirt shops and crowds are a huge detractor, but again as a tourist one has to go. I ate at Pier market and loved it. Neptunes restaurant was okay and it did have an awesome view. Bubba Gumps has the best menu but there was a 75-85 minutes wait on Sunday night so i skipped it. The highlight of my visit was Golden gate bridge. Beautiful!! nothing more to say. I took bridge over to Saulisito and ate a place called Burgers. It's a hole in the wall. Just look for the long line. Well worth it.
