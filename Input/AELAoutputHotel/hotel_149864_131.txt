{"text":"Very Dissapointing! Glad to be home! Our family was extremely disappointed with this resort to the extent that we were never so happy to be home from a tropical island vacation as we were at the end of this vacation. From the moment we left the registration desk upon arriving to Club Med Punta Cana, to the moment we got on the bus leaving the resort, we never had a clue what was going on as French was the chosen language with no interpretting in any other language, not even Spanish, done for the other PAYING guests at the resort.We visited this resort a few years ago and were so impressed with it back then. Wow! How times have changed. Club Med really needs to apologize to their non-french speaking guests. We booked this trip viap hone with a club med agent who did not warn us that if we didn't know french, this was not the resort to visit. The GOs were semi-friendly but some were just plain rude and refused (even when asked) to interpret what they were saying in English. We were told on a few occasions to simply learn French. We did not spend our hard-earned money for a week vacation in the Dominican Republic to be told to learn French. Club Med gets a big 0 for customer service. There is no excuse for staff to speak to guests that way. Club Med should be ashamed of themselves. It was obvious that the European guests received preferential treatment. If you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ speak French, all you hear day and night is blah blah blah blah blah. Exercise classes, shows, water aerobics, nightly bar entertainment was in french with no interpretting. Not one word was translated.If you want to experience the Dominican (Hispanola) culture, you won't find it in Club Med Punta Cana. The accommodations were clean but tiny. You need to shut the bathroom door in order to turn around in the bathroom (90 degrees). Very tight quarters. Our clothes were damp all week and if you don't have a balcony, you need to bring your bathing attire to the pool the next day (what you wore the day before) to dry it while you are lying in the sun. We had a storm one night and 3 other families, including ourselves, experienced puddles in our rooms from the windows. We wouldn't even want to think about what it would be like there during a tropical storm or hurricane. The grounds are impressive, however, this tropical resort has never heard of a ceiling fan. There was not one to be found in either dining room, bar area, lobby, exercise area or theatre. Be ready to sweat no matter where you go in this resort. And if you plan on brining International calling cards, forget it. The phones in your room will not accept calling cards so you are stuck paying for calls at Club Med's rate.They offer great activities but once again, everything was spoken in French so if you don't speak or understand french, why would you even bother. While there was a variety of food to choose from, it was very bland. We spent 30 dollars on a taxi to go to Burger King for dinner one night. That is pretty sad but it was so worth it.Overall, we did not enjoy this vacation and would not recommend it to anyone! There are better, less expensive, friendlier, all-inclusive resorts that make you feel welcome and satisfied.
