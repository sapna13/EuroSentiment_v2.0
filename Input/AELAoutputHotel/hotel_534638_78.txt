{"text":"Quite Good Overall The Sofitel was much better than expected. I think some of the earlier reviews on here are from during the time when the Sofitel was changing over from the Imperial Hotel. Now, it seems quite nicely run, and I'd go back again for sure.I paid $145\/night, which did not include breakfast. But, having stayed in Seminyak before, I knew there would be some places serving breakfast on Jalan Dhyana Pura, and I was right. I ended up at one place where the road curves that had an excellent full American breakfast--eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, hash browns, pancake, and fruit--for about US$3, cheaper if you don't want so much to eat.Also nearby: restaurants with cuisine from just about any country you can think of (Italian, Moroccan, American, Greek, Turkish, German, etc) are all within a 5-minute taxi or walking distance. So are at least 2-3 gay clubs, which is why I especially like Seminyak. :)As for the hotel, it was nice! Very spacious room (I didn't book the lowest category, this was the middle category available; I called the hotel and was told that the cheapest room was 39sqm, with a normal bathroom, while this one was 46sqm with a rainshower, and an upgraded bath. It was as advertised, with an upgrade based on my Sofitel Privilege card--but to be honest, I couldn't figure out what the upgrade was, possibly to the 3rd floor (the highest, with a peaked ceiling was an upgrade, vs. other floors?). Balcony with some chairs to sit on, nice amenities in the bath. A surprise was the excellent food we got from Room Service--the sweet potato curry soup was wonderful! Also had a club sandwich that was good and fresh, and all were delivered in about 20 min.Service was, without a doubt, very attentive! Every single staff member I passed by in the hall greeted me--every time. Smiles and offers of help all the time. Especially if you do pay a bit more, with the upgraded rooms, I don't see how you can go wrong with the Sofitel! In fact, for about $275-350 per night, there are also these traditional Balinese villas at the Sofitel with private plunge pools that look heavenly! Too much for me, though.Seminyak isn't the Bali people expect, however--it's extremely quiet in the daytime, the beach isn't crowded, though there are people all around. At night, however, Seminyak is really jumping--the best and most trendy restaurants, and clubs. So if you're looking for a secluded spot with no human contact, I'd go elsewhere; also, if you're looking for beaches heaving with heavenly bodies, head to Kuta.
