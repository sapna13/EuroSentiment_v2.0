{"text":"The Good, The Bad, The Ugly We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro for our honeymoon, and it had it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ up and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ downs: The Good: The beach was great. There were a good amount of chairs (we went in the offseason) and the sand and water were very nice. The pool was also very cool as it was very big and a lot of places to lay out. The restaurants were very nice and top class. There are 6 to choose from, and we were able to go to one per night. The food there was great, and we never got sick from it. The buffet was a little subpar. There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ plenty of food to choose from, but it gets a little old after a while. The show was also pretty cool.The Bad: We stayed in a Caribbean Spa Suite. Although it was spacious, there were many problems in the room. The ceiling leaked, and when they came to look at it, they simply drained the water and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ fix the leak. Getting hot water in the afternoon was a crapshoot, and the locks were broken. This could happen with any room though so I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ sure they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e not all this way. Other than the room, there isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ too much that was bad. There are plenty of activities but we never knew where they were. The Ugly: The staff was horrible. First, if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know Spanish, you may have a tough time. With our package, we were given 30 free minutes of Internet, and it literally took 3 days to get that from Guest Services. When I finally got it, I waited in a room while the staff talked in Spanish about me behind my back. We were also given free use of the spa facilities for the day, but when we got there, they said we had to pay. They say that tip is included, but they expect you to tip every time. If you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ, you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l get scowls left and right. Lastly, one day a week they invite vendors to come in and sell their products. Do not go near them. They√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l suck you in and pretty much force you to buy something. Last but not least, half the people that go there are European, so you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l definitely see some topless women (which could be good, but could be ugly), and men in Speedo√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂.
