{"text":"Great motor inn! We stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of our 16 night tour of the west. I booked this property using the advice of fellow trip advisor travellers. The motel exceeded my expectations.We had rented a car from the airport and were able to park up for 3 days no problem in the free car park beneath the hotel. We went out early evening for a drive along the marina and were able to get a space on our return.I had requested 2 quiet rooms for our party of 5. The 2 bedroom suite was situated at the back with little view but very quiet. The other - our king room, was situated right by the elevator and the ice machine and on the front by the busy road (though had a view). I guess you win some you lose some. When I asked, we were told we could move rooms if\/when one became available but we decided to stay put as we liked the room.Our floor, I think it was the 2nd floor, looked like it had been recently refurbed. Rooms were clean and spacious with large flat screen tv. We also had a little balcony, not that we had time to use it. Had coffee maker, ironing board and hairdryer.It was about a 5 - 10 minute walk to the bay, a little longer to reach pier 39. Would highly recommend Pats cafe for breakfast, just up the road slightly and to the left! Lots of Italian restaurants nearby. Cable car also just 5 minutes away.All in all would definately recommend this place, especially with the rates so low as they are. Great value.
