{"text":"Buyer Beware!!!!! Arrival- This was my first all-inclusive vacation. My past vacation√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ has included Myrtle Beach, several locations in Florida, and two Caribbean Cruises. After we booked the Palace I read several questionable reviews that made me nervous but I thought the author√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ must have been hard to please. I owe the author√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ an apology because they hit the nail on the head. This trip was booked with a total of 14 people who helped contribute to this review.I was anxious to arrive at the resort and have a week full of fun and relaxation. We arrived at the front desk to an unfriendly staff who did not want to honor the upgrades we paid for. They were not very welcoming at all. We were stuck in a cheaper room for 36 hours before we were finally upgraded. Our travel agent spent several hours working to resolve this situation before we were upgraded. The customer service was lacking in all aspects!Food √à√\u2020\u2022?Most of the restaurants are included when you stay at the Palace. The best food I found was the small grill next to the ocean (Next to the 6000 building). The cooks were friendly and the seafood and steaks were grilled while you watched. The steakhouse was also good. The buffet was an open concept and birds would fly in and eat off of the buffet and your plate if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e not close enough to detour them. Besides the ice cream and cheese cake, the dairy products had a lot to be desired. The ham, burgers, sausage, and hot dogs had a weird taste. I have a tough stomach but I am still having cramping after being home for two weeks.Service √à√\u2020\u2022?The housekeeper was polite and did an excellent job. The wait and bar staff had about 5 people who were pleasant throughout the whole week. Service was typically slow and unfriendly. The same items ordered from a menu would be completely different when served. It was nearly impossible to get refills as you ate and be prepared to spend one hour each time you have a meal because they are slow. The bar drinks were good when you could get service and they do not skimp on the alcohol. The premium liquor upgrade was a sham, do not waste your money!Rooms √à√\u2020\u2022?Clean but outdated. Reminded me more of a mid class hotel than a resort. My room had a funny smell and 3 nights our room was infested by several flying ants that enjoyed crawling on us while we were trying to sleep.Pool √à√\u2020\u2022?Awesome and very cleanBeach √à√\u2020\u2022?Beautiful powdery sand and gorgeous turquoise Caribbean water.Golf √à√\u2020\u2022?The course was OK and 3 rounds of golf were included in our package. I would rate the course a 5 out of 10. The green fees were included but the cart costs 30.00 per person. The fee was high for the quality of the course.I assure you that I am not hard to please but I was very disappointed in this trip. I am used to the friendly servant style service of a cruise but I felt unwelcome at this resort. If you are undecided I would definitely stay away from this resort and may reconsider the Dominican all together!The El Presidente beer is good!The next group trip will be in Mexico!!!
