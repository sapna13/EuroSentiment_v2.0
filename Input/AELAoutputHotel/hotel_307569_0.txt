{"text":"Heaven on Earth My wife and I spent three nights at the Komaneka Monkey Forest prior to our charter flight to Wakatobi Dive Resort. I wish it had been three weeks instead of three nights. When you enter Komaneka from busy Monkey Forest Road its like you go through a transportal on Star Trek as the noise melts away and you enter the garden of eden. Every person I interacted with at the resort was as nice and gracious as anyone I have ever met.Having arrived late on our first night I grabbed the ice bucket and made the short walk to the restaurant to get some ice. Because of the hour I didn't want to wait the 15 or more minutes I am used to in the US for room service to bring it. The employee at the restaurant said he would bring the ice to us. I went back to the room and told my wife that they insisted on bringing the ice so it would be awhile. 30 seconds later there was a knock on the door. In comes the waiter with the ice. When I tipped him he replied with a huge smile you are so very kind. I relay this as an example of the way that you will be treated by everyone during your stay at Komaneka. I won't repeat all the other embellishments of the other reviewers except to say that I concur with all the good reviews.I do want to emphasize that you should visit the Komaneka Spa. Though a Balinese massage can be had for half the price out on Monkey Forest Road I was more than satisfied at the price and quality of my Komaneka spa experience. In fact, I think I had some kind of spiritual epiphany during my second massage. A gentle rain was falling on the semi outdoor massage terrace contributing to it being one of the most relaxing massages I have ever experienced. If this spa is not in heaven I don't want to go there.Stay at Komaneka if you are in Ubud!! ","annotations":[]}
