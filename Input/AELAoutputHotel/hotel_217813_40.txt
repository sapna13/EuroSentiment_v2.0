{"text":"Dreadful experience in exhorbitantly priced budget hotel We booked this hotel for two nights through Expedia.com at a cost of $342.00 per night for what turned out to be a budget hotel. On arrival no assistance was available to help with the luggage and we had to look for a luggage trolley to bring our luggage to our room. Rooms were clean and adequate, if somewhat drab and location was good. However, the exorbitant price we paid for the room was not reflected in any way whatsoever in the room or service. It might be reasonable value at a third of the price we paid. Free internet (2 PCs provided) was supplied but was not working on our first night. As with most San Francisco hotels, car parking is expensive and at $44.00 per night, this hotel was no exceptionBreakfast was a complete fiasco on both mornings and we cannot understand how other reviewers spoke so favourably about it. People mobbed around the self-service breakfast area and had to use cardboard trays, plastic knives and forks as well as paper cups and plates. Food variety and standards were poor with service very bad and with a large number of guests milling around, the queue for food was very slow. There was nowhere to sit to eat breakfast with all tables used up, other guests using all lounge chairs in the foyer of the hotel whilst the remainder had no choice but to carry their breakfast to their rooms. Without any doubt this was the most astonishingly dreadful breakfast experience we have had in nearly 40 years of staying in hotels around the world. Our stay at this hotel was an unbelievable experience, an absolute disgrace at any price but at $342.00 per night it was appalling. ","annotations":[]}
