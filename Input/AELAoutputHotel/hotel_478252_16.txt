{"text":"one of the nicest! Although we are seasoned Caribean travelers, this is our first review mainly due to our overwhelmingly positive experience at this wonderful resort. If you want fine french cuisine......go to Paris. If you want non stop high-roller gambling........go to Vegas. If you want a hip party seen..........go to LA. If you want a safe, relaxing,enjoyable and good value holiday...........go to this resort.We booked our holiday from Dec.7\/08 until 14\/08 thru Air Transat from Toronto. The flights were punctual with no confusion during transfers.Upon arriving at the hotel, everything went smoothly for us during check-in as we did ask questions and patiently received answers with a smile, proabably because we said HOLA.Our rooms were pristine! My wife is a clean freak and even she could find no fault. The room was larger than average with tiles and marble\/granite in the washroom.........easy to keep sanitary. Our fridge was replenished several times daily and our room was kept in the most orderly fashion by a wonderful lady named Sonia. We had ajoining rooms # 6208-6209.The beach is stunningly beautiful. The pools are lavish and clean. The grounds were so well kept I can only pray that some of these guys come to work at my golf course in Canada! The food was plentiful and none of us became ill. I only say this because regardless of what Carabean resort we ever stayed at,The food does become redundant after the 2nd or 3rd day. The staff was allways extremely polite and very anxious to please. The nightly entertainment was the most enjoyable anywhere..........not Broadway or Hollywood but the most heartfelt and well practiced performances one can imagine for this part of the world. Our 4 yr. old was in heaven as were my wife and her mother.......all in the same evening. This resort is definetly the real deal for unpretentious, open minded and well travelled people of all nationalities. ","annotations":[]}
