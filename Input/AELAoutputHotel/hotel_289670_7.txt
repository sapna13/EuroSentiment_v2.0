{"text":"New favorite in BCN A new favourite hotel in Barcelona. Got a pretty good deal through the hotel website, an executive room, breakfast included for a total of EUR 147. Was happily surprised when I was upgraded to a Junior Suite (unfortunately only one night's stay there). Room on the 19th floor was spacious, had a big bathroom with separate shower, bath and double sinks. Separate work area, and living room area with a couch (possible to convert into an extra bed), TV and music center. And of course a fabulous view of the Montj√Å√∫√¢ic mountain and Plaza Espanya.Breakfast was served on the 23rd floor and the food could easily match the views. A rich breakfast buffe with lots of cold cuts, fruits, hot items as well as all the necessities in a breakfast buffet.Staff courteous, helpful, and polite. Only downside was that internet did not work in my room (cable). Was offered another room but declined, used the wireless service in the lobby and business center instead. Got some coupons (1 hr free internet, complimentary drink, discount on spa treatments and parking) due to the fact that I had booked on the hotel website.Airport bus leaves every 10 minutes and stops outside of the hotel, a good choice (depending on time of day as traffic can be a bore in Barcelona). Barcelona Sants station is served by both long-distance trains as well as buses and metro. Recommend the metro, on time, clean and cool (the walks in the tunnels to the metro platforms are considerably hotter and can be looong).All in all, a very nice hotel which I will surely use next time in BCN.
