{"text":"Not the best NH hotel On arrival at the Barbizon Palace it was beautiful, so lovely, checkin was fast and friendly, no help with luggage up to the room, not good for a 5 star hotel, the room was basic, not a bad size, excellent bathroom and shower, the thing that put me off was dirty walls, old carpets, ripped wallpaper. with this i decided to put this in writing to the duty manager. I went for a walk and back in 2 hours with a letter under my door asking me to contact Esther (duty manager) who had a nice chat with me and tried to find me a new room, this was all good but i asked what about other guests using this old and dirty room, she said it would be sorted soon, so if anyone else stays in room 174 please let me know what it was like. Breakfast is huge and plentyful with Free flowing champagne, obviously you dont want that much this early in the morning ( i hope) the cost is 22.50 euros per day, it is a bit much but you ge champagne.Hotel provides a Gym, sauna etc..... but at an extra charge.the staff are not that friendly which is a shame because the Dutch are naturally friendly people.I would recommend this hotel only if you are wanting to stay in an upgraded room (which i wasnt) or just on a romantic getaway.The NH hotel group have some fabulous properties, but i seem to think they have let this one slip through their fingers.if you have any questions about this hotel or Amsterdam, please email me and i will as always answer any questions of the places and hotels i have been to. Happy travelsPreston and Carl ","annotations":[{"endOffset":510,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":506}]}
