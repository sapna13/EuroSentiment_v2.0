{"text":"I found heaven and paradise First of all when I read these review before I went - I almost did not go. We went from August 11-18 and the first time I have ever been to the DR. It was absolutely beautiful. All the people that gave bad review are crazy and should just stay home. We arrived from New Jersey the day after the security change - nervous as .....But the trip was well worth it. The Apple people were very helpful at the airport. The lines in were not long and we got right on a bus. The ride there was a long but enjoyed looking around. It was not bumpy at all. When we got to the hotel we automatically got a room and right into it to change. The room was wonderful but the air condition needed a little adjusting in building 12. When someone told us how to put the dial at 12:00 -1:00 it got much better. I did not see one bug.The first day we went to the cascade pool (which was beautiful) and very quiet, but then on we hung by the other pool that went around the hotel. That is where alot people go and the excitment. The entertainment crew were absolutely great - Silvo (I think that is how you say it), Maria - (everyone - I am sorry I forgot everyone's name. If it was out by the pool dancing, water aerobics, water polo, volleyball, cooking class or even playing ring toss. They also have a CD to take home for $20.00 which I think everyone should get. Applause..Applause....!!!!The bar.....my drinks were great. Just top it off. I don't know who said there's was water down. They are crazy. Some nights ran into each other!!!!! Jose and Benjamin (they are sisters) were great. They take care of you promptly and are always there. Everyone should throw some tips because ALL of these guys work hard. EVERYONE. Let us not forget Mommy (I don't remember her name) - the cocktail waitres that goes around the bar. Just tell her Poppy said hi.The food was ok. You could have more then one dinner. (it is all inclusive). Skirt steaks at the grill are the best. The french place is very nice too. Nice and cold at night. If you don't want to wait an hour to eat, throw them a $5 or whatever - you sit faster. You have to have dinner on the beach - it was the best and worth every dime.The excursions you have to go on. Somona Island was beautiful - lets us not forget Ramon. Also the James Bond Speed Boats with snorkeling were the best. Also of fun and the guides were great. (a little crazy - but that is what made the trip). Everyone has to get a spa treatment. Girls are very professional. We had the honeymoon package (double). Four massages and one facial each and it was worth every dime.We meet alot of crazy people. There were a few I would have like to get their emails. The ride home though was long. 5:00 a.m. did not cut it and we were at the airport way too early and alot of waiting. We did not get to Newark and driving home till about 4:00 p.m. so it seemed like 12 hours of traveling. That was the only thing I did not like.We had beautifll weather every day. But one thing we did not get to do is go to more than 2 shows and not to the disco. We never made it after 10. Sometimes 4 in the afternoon. But that is ok you are on vacation. I would go back in a heartbeat.EXCELLENTE!!APPLAUSE, APPLAUSE!!I will get some pics soon.
