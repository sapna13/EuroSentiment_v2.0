{"text":"Sants - not pants! We booked this hotel sight unseen, as it was via Lastminute.com's Top Secret hotel choice. This is where you get a heavily discounted rate for a 4* hotel, but don't find out where it is until you've booked. So when we'd booked it, we checked out the location, and found it was in the Industrial area, near the Sants RENFE train station.When we arrived at the station, we realised that the hotel is actually part of the station.Once you leave the station and enter the spacious lobby, the place starts to look 4*, with a very modern feel.We stayed in room 224, which is actually on the 3rd floor, offering a quite elevated view of the Sants square and surrounding buildings. The room was a double, quite big with TV, mini-bar and a shower and bath ensuite. Although the room had air-conditioning it was not very effective and the one window could not be opened.The hotel staff were pleasant and helpful, speaking excellent English, and happy to recommend bars and restaurants.Within a Kilometre there are several Tapas bars, cafes and restaurants, which work out cheaper than the hotel. and the station is a 5 minute train ride from the placa Catalunya, which is a good starting point to explore the city.Despite my initial impression, I would stay here again as the train access makes sightseeing easy, and the station offers the Barcelona card (universal travel ticket) from it's tourism booth.I would classify it as 3* and pricey, but overall very good.
