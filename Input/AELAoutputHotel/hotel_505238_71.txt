{"text":"Some Good Some Bad Booked to stay at the Barcelona Princess Hotel sometime ago and found the reviews on this site quite good, then recently checked again and became a bit concerned. Well having just returned from a long weekend thought I would give my view.Good PointsGreat Power ShowerLarge Bath Sheets Very CleanFantastic View from the hotelI know it has been posted that you are not allowed to take in your own refreshments - we did and found that if we order a couple of mixers and ice, room service was very prompt.Not so goodAir Conditioning in the room √à√\u2020\u2022?very poor. What made it worse was that all power is turned off when you remove your room key, hence no cooling. The Mini Bar is also powered off so the free drinks (nice touch) are not cold. A point to note √à√\u2020\u2022?opting for a city view does have the disadvantage of attracting the afternoon sun. So come late afternoon the room is boiling, unless you keep the blinds down, which rather defeats the idea of having a city view.The lighting in the bathroom whilst quite good throws off a great deal of heat adding to the problem.The pool on the 23rd Floor didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ appear to be heated but certainly cooled your feet down after a day walking around. Unfortunately due to the location by late afternoon the sun had moved completely off the pool.The bar advertised on the 23rd Floor didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ open at any time over our long weekend as already noted by others.The location of the hotel we found to be too remote, whilst it is serviced by the tourist bus, metro and tram, to get into the city required a number of changes, hence we used taxis most of the time which were reasonably priced, but trying to get one late in the evening can be a bit of a problem.Generally found the hotel a bit too modern and without atmosphere.
