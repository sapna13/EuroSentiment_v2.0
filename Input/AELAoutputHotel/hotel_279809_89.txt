{"text":"Nice Time! After reading the different reviews,I was skeptical of this resort. I 'm a 'timeshare exchange'.guest.My travelling partner,was even more skeptical,after seeing prices,were so much more,at other, 'Alll Inclusive' Dominican Rep. 'resorts'.But,on the last day, she said, 'This was the best vacation'! ( FYI She speaks fluid Spanish\/English,a definite advantage!) Let me start at the begining,on our arrival,the luggage ,from A\/A,came out and was waiting,as we 'cleared' customs.$10U.S.,when you arrive.The airport is nice,open air,thatched.I rented a car,there are no 'rental car',offices @ the airport! I did NOT know that! It was organized 'chaos'.A nice 'taxi driver',let me use his 'cell phone',and 'low and behold','a Europcar(rental co.)',driver was in the area! Phewwww! Make SURE you call your 'rental car co'.beforehand,,and have the EXACT location, +time,to meet you,probably @ the 'cafe',right in front.$215,for a 'mid-size',@ Yahoo'($260,w\/tax,and GET the 'INJURY INS..,@ $5,a day,The majority,@the 'resort',were Europeans\/Canadians..The food here, was very good,they have a dif.buffet 'theme'@El Mirador',most every night. Both of us, did NOT get sick.We both took 'yogurt', 10 days prior to our trip,and they have 'yogurt,'@ breakfast.The food, 'poolside', is Franks + Burgers,'char-broiled,and sometimes 'chicken\/Dom.sausage'.Drinks everywhere. The resort is basically, a 'large circle',walk around the first day + get 'acclamated'.They'll give you a map.I belive the best rooms, to be  the 2nd floor,Rooms #3115 to 3119,and the the 3rd.floor,Rooms 3215 to 3219.These rooms DO face the pool, a little noisy,during the day.(There are NO elevators)But a beautiful view, all day + evening The seafood restaurant,'Estrella del Mar'(Star Of The Sea),has a nice, 'special' Friday ,dinner,on the beach.All 'ambiance',the $47 dinner for two,was too much $$$$,and 'chewy'! The full moon,clear sky,and' waves' breaking nearby,'MADE,the evening,worth the $$$ !Tip dine, when the restaurants first open! You will have to make,daily, reservations for everthing,but the 'buffet'+'poolside'area.Tip'Buffet' area, #1,first on the left ENTIRELY 'NO SMOKING'!! Postcardsbuy + send, from 'resort',D.R.,Post Ofc.was Impossible to find!! Cost= $1 stamp,$1 postcard,U.S.The resort has a $2 fee, on ALL calls,toll free,or NOT.TV has many 'English' speaking,cable channels.No 'CD',or 'Radio s',in rooms.The 'grounds',etc.are very clean! Do visit 'Manati Park($30 each!)',free bus leaves from resort,get there for the 10:30a.m..show,then the other 4 shows follow, (@9a.m.,you can swim w\/the Dolphins,additional $50\/or so each )so you're back by late lunch,or so.Every evening(@9:30p.m.), they have a show,most were very good,with very 'energetic' performers!The 'Disco',you will lose weight, there,the doors stick open,the A\/C(if it's even ON), flows out,and it's ,just lIke 'Buster's'song'HOT,HOT,HOT'!!! The 'DJ',did NOT play a 'good MIX'! It got 'OLD',after a few nights! Roberto, @ guest services, was very knowledgeable\/friendly!So, was Juan,@the front desk.And waiter 'Agnel',by the'poolside'restaurants. .And waiter 'Juan',,in 'buffet', dinning room #1.Hello,Roberto,and 'Amico's! My main 'gripe'  OBLIVIOUS,to their own health,or the health of OTHERS, smokers and 2nd hand smoke,were prevalent,here,as I'm sure.@ other Dom.Rep.,resorts !!! Last tip bring @ least $400,U.S.cash(2 people),for tips,etc.They take U.S.,$$$$,it's was about 33.5,Peso's for a dollar(as of 12\/18\/07).I DO NOT advise exchanging $$$,@the airport!!!!!  There is a $6 fee and they only gave me 28 'Peso's', on a dollar!( 5+ 1\/2 LESS,Peso's,on EACH DOLLAR, than the Dom.Rep.,does) All in all,you will have a GREAT TIME + Yes,the beach +pool, are wonderful,too!! p.sNo doubt you WILL, at sometime,pass the main 'intersection',where the 'Texaco' gas(a landmark) station is, I asked one Dominican, if they let everone out of the 'mental hospital',at the same time,and gave them motor vehicles, to drive!! There IS a'non-working' traffic light, there,by the 'Texaco', Why,you ask, is it NOT working??? ?I was TOLD Traffic was WORSE, with it,ON!!! I'm a professional driver,I never saw such a 'conundrum',as that 'crossroad'!! Mopeds\/trucks,cars,coming at you, from EVERY direction,like Bees, leaving the 'hive'!! I missed a Moped,or he missed me,by inches,after he 'shot out' from some driveway,or,store,there!! In the end, I put 200 miles on the car,safely,in week!
