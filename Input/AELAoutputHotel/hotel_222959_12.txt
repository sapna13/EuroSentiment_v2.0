{"text":"Best decision was to stay here Whilst some may like noise and crowds, we do not. Having stayed in NYC twice before, this time we chose the Ritz Battery Park because of its location in a less popular tourist area. And we got it 100% right! The staff were attentive without being over the top. The room was very well appointed and a lovely size, including the bathroom. We had a City View Club room - did not want or ask for a Harbour view as my husband wished to photograph the buildings at night from our window. We were lucky enough to be able to see both the river and the buildings from our window so no complaints from him. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. We had room service one night and whilst expensive, was prompt and edible without being outstanding. The Restaurant was ok -I found the servers to be a bit snobbish and also a little supercilious in their approach to me as opposed to my husband.The Club Lounge was brilliant - except when there were noisy children there which I felt should have been kept quiet by their parents - after all, it is not a play room. Perhaps the Club Concierge would have spoken to the adults if we had asked but we preferred to return to our room with our drinks rather than upset anyone. Our choice. This did not spoil our view of the Club Lounge - the breakfast choices, lunch a la carte and late night nibblies plus free wi fi were all a hit with us. The Club Concierge also sorted out a billing error we had. We placed our own water in our mini bar fridge which required moving items already in there around (but not out of) the fridge. We were charged over $100 for items that were still in the fridge - purely because apparently the person who replenishes the bar just opens it, looks to where items are supposed to be and bills accordingly. Not a good system and one which could have proven quite expensive for us. But the amounts were reversed without fuss.The location is excellent for the subway - we journeyed up town a few times with ease. We also walked to Soho and Little Italy and if you are going to go to Century 21, it is a short walk away - very convenient for their early openings. One night we dined in the Meat Packing District, a $15 cab fare.The ability to walk through the Battery Park gardens and along the river early in the mornings with little noise or fuss was very cathartic. We will definitely stay again.
