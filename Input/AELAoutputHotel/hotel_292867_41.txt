{"text":"Would not stay at the Caribe again Customer service at the resort does not exist, when we asked for towles, or extra soap they would tell us in 5 minutes and they never show up.The bedding, blankets,e.t.c. was old and worn, there were 3 tiny very soft pillows in a king size bed.My husband's brand new polo shirt with the tag still on was taken from the room, we reported the incident but they came up with nothing, if you do stay at this resort, please lock up your valuables in the safe box.We've been to Punta Cana 3 times prior to this, we never had any problems.. the staff at the resort needs to be educated in customer service and learn to speak some decent English.The food was nothing special, leftovers from dinner were made into a different dish for next day's lunch.The specialty restaurants were anything but specialty, we went to the Italian restaurant, (Mama Mia) and ordered white wine, the waiter comes by and before I could stop him he re-filled my glass with red wine, the waiter had no clue what he did wrong..At the Chinese specialty restaurant I hadn't finished all of my soup, and when the waiter came to take the bowl he was looking inside and stirring the left over soup with the spoon, I was mortified, I thought he might pour it back into the pot, that incident was very creepy and weird.The maids were more polite than the customer service at the front desk, they deserve a tip every day.My husband and I have been to most of the islands in the Caribbean, our stay at the Caribe Club Princess in Punta Cana was the worst.
