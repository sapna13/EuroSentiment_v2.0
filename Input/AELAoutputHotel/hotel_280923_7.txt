{"text":"good A few teething problems at start of stay but these were resolved fairly quickly by staff at reception .Good hotel - nice reception area, 4 internet terminals -1euro for 10 mins.Breakfast - had large selection of choice ie breads, ham, cheese, pastries + rolls fruit etc and a chef to cook fresh eggs, omlettes, bacon + sausages also different friut juices + cava wine if wanted.Rooms - alittle on the small side for us ie 2 adult + 1 child but functional - adequate towels soaps etc. provided - mini bar free!! soft drinks + beer + tea + coffee facilitiesRoom service we used twice + the second time we had to send food back as it was cold but this was sorted very quickly.Spa - I thought a little expensive it cost 15euro per adult + 7.50euro per child - but the children were only permitted to use it between 10am - 11.30 am which shortened your day for doing other things.Area - 5mins walk from CAMP NOU well worth a visit even if you are not into football but go early ie 10am as it gets very busy later on. Metro 5mins walk around the corner so very handy for transport to everywhere.Just to the right of collblanc metro station is a hiving area of bustling activity small markets + stalls + good at night.There are also a couple of good fruit shops + cafe bars close byand a hairdressers called EGO - which my mother attended for a cut + blow dry excellant work! Overall a nice stay, good location, nice area, easy access, taxi from airport 30euro.
