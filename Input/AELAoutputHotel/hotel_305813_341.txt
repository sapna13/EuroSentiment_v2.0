{"text":"What An Experience Wow, where to begin ?We stayed for four nights in a Langham Suite and our final night in the Chuan Infinity Suite, each with access to the Langham Hotel Club executive facility.Firstly the rooms. The Langham Suite was lovely. It has a large lounge and fully equipped kitchenette. The super-king bed is incredibly comfortable and the bathroom has a separate bath and excellent shower. As mentioned in other reviews it also has a glass wall to the bedroom, with mechanised screens. The room also has large flat screen TVs and dvd players in lounge and bedroom, wireless broadband and floor to ceiling windows overlooking Kowloon.The Chuan Infinity Suite is something else. It is incredibly luxurious. The whole room is done immaculately in dark wood and again has two large TVs, internet etc. and also console controlled ambient lighting and music. The real attraction of this room though is the bathroom. It contains a lovely infinity bath with hydrotherapy and chromotherapy, plus separate toilet, shower room and steam room ! The photos on the web site do not do it justice.The service that we received from the hotel and the club facility was amazing. They were incredibly friendly and brought out special vegetarian food for my wife every evening that we were there. One of the waiters even took a trip out to a local market to buy a whole range of vegetarian meat substitute dishes and served this to us one evening with a range of vegetables. In every respect, the staff went above and beyond the call of duty.The spa and the treatments were amazing too √à√\u2020\u2022?highly recommended.The location of the hotel on Kowloon is fine. It is very close to the city MTR underground system (depending on how you navigate the journey) meaning that you can quickly get to most places in the city. It is also on the doorstep of the more traditional markets too.All in all, I cannot recommend the Langham Place hotel highly enough. I honestly don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think I can find anything to improve on.
