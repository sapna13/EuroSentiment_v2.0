{"text":"Honeymoon in Paradise My husband and I just returned from 6 days in paradise. As everyone else has said the ride from the airport to the hotel was not fun but the bus was very clean and air conditioned. You make the best of it knowing that it's a small price to pay to arrive in paradise. We were greated at the hotel with cool towels and champagne. Because we upgraded to the Excellence Club (well, worth the money), we were whisked away to a special area for our check in. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. The food was amazing. There was plenty to do or you could do nothing. The bed in the room was down right awful. The mattress way too firm. The other travelers were friendly and helpful when it came to sharing helpful hints. The shows at night were entertaining. The Michael Jackson show was like a Jr. High Talent Show but still entertaining. Don't miss Chris Blizzard. He was amazing. The music on the patio at night was outstanding. Don't forget to bring bug spray for the evenings because the mosquitos can be quite hungry. Sunscreen is a must. I used a 15 and was fine. My husband needed a 50. The pool is immaculate and the staff is constantly fussing with something to make it perfect. Tips are not necessary but helpful if you really want to be taken care of. We loved it. It was paradise and plan to go again next year.
