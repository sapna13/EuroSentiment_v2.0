{"text":"A Parisian Treasure I was lucky enough to be taken to Paris for Valentine's Week by my boyfriend. He booked the hotel as part of a package with Eurostar and I have to say I was very pleased! The hotel was incredibly easy to find, just one Metro ride from Gare du Nord which was good as we had our luggage with us, and when we surfaced in Montparnasse it only took a minute to get our bearings and work out where the hotel was. It was down the pretty quiet street Rue Littre which had a large post office on the corner and a couple of little eateries on the way down to the hotel. I think there was also a school at the end of the road although I can't be sure. The reception to the hotel is gorgeous and we were given an extremely warm welcome by the reception staff who checked us in quickly and also offered us a map of the city along with some brochures. We were on the 6th floor so were very pleased for a lift. Our room was lovely, a decent size, clean and very comfortable. When we unpacked we discovered a problem with the safe in that it didn't work properly but after speaking to reception we headed out for the afternoon and by the time we came back it was either fixed or replaced! While we were there my boyfriend was taken unwell so we ended up spending an entire afternoon in the hotel. I ordered some room service in the evening as I was starving but my boyfriend was not well enough to go out - the food wasn't too bad, I had a curry and he attempted some soup with little success. The bread was lovely although I was so disappointed that we weren't provided with milk for our tea and coffee. It seems in France you have to ask for milk if you want it! We also had problems with our television in that the 3 English speaking channels all froze and never seemed to come back - obviously I wasn't too bothered on the days where we were doing something but when we had to spend the afternoon in the hotel I would have liked to have something other than my book (which I finished that afternoon!). All in all, this hotel is a lovely little gem. I would have no problems staying here again and would certainly recommend it to my friends!
