{"text":"Not that bad I recently stayed at the Flamenco Memorial Day Weekend. We stayed for 6 days, and there were 4 of us. It's not that bad!!!! Were there a few issues, yes, but you're on vacation, lighten up and go with the flow.Check-In: somewhat of a long line, but went pretty quickly. Not too much of an issue there, the help at the desk was very nice and friendly.Rooms: Very large, spacious, plenty of room. Our bathroom was clean and the water, toilet and shower all worked fine all week. How often are you in the room anyway????Food: buffet was very big and you could find most of anything. I am an extremely picky eater, and I had no problems with the food anywhere. The pizza at the upstairs rest was very good! The Home Rum sports bar-you can get burgers, fries, hot dogs etc... again food was good.Beach: UNBELIEVABLE!!Pool: huge and beautiful!!! there was always someone cleaning it. say hola to alfredo at the swim up bar, he's great!!!The power did go out a few times (1-2) for only approx 30 minutes each time. Once was at night around 9, the other was approx 530, a bit of an inconvenience, but your on vaca, try to make the best of it, it was back on within a 1\/2 hour.Overall, the hotel could use a little updating, whcih they are doing building by building. You're not going to get the Plaza!!!We had no problems and had such a great time that we are going back in September!!! So if it really was that bad, we certainly would not be going back!!! The workers work very hard and they are always smiling and happy and try to welcome you. They are great people!!! I think some people just expect too much. You're on vacation in a poor country, lighten up, relax, and just have a good time!!
