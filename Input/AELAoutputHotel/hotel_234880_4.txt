{"text":"Would definitely go back again Having been told about Propeller Island via an e-mail forward, I decided to visit Berlin JUST to stay at the hotel, taking my father with me.We weren't disappointed. The hotel is, first of all, very conveniently located for the major sights of the city; it's an interesting walk straight down the Kurf√Å√∫√¢rstendamm to the Berlin Zoo, or to the bus terminal which will take you further afield.The hotel itself is frankly eye-popping. As we were staying for more than four nights, the management offered us a change of room mid-stay. I started off in Forest (#45), which I chose because of its soothing red colour, and then moved to Hol(l)y-Wood (#14). My father had Clouds (#4) and then Landscapes (#32). We found the bathing\/toilet facilities to be perfectly acceptable, although we had purposely chosen rooms with their own private facilities.(Incidentally, the shower taps in Forest are, for some reason, labelled backwards. The hot tap turns on the cold water, and vice versa. A little disconcerting, yes, but okay once you've worked out what to do!)The rooms could have been a little stuffy, although both of mine had their own private balconies and I had no issue with leaving the balcony door open for ventilation overnight.What can I say about the breakfast? It was superb. Soft-boiled eggs were offered and well-cooked, and everything else was delicious. The staff only work part time, but when they are there they put in a fine effort for the guests.In summary, I didn't find everything about this hotel to be top notch or up to the standards of the Dorchester, but then, I wasn't expecting to. I visited hoping for an unusual and lasting experience, something to tell my friends about, and this is exactly what I got.
