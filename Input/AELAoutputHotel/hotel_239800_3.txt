{"text":"Nice Hotel, Great Value, Good Location This was my second stay at this particular HIlton GI, and I would say it is one of the nicest ones I have been in..... and I have been in a lot! Staff - Above and Beyond friendly, courteous, and helpfulRoom - Upgraded to a 2 room suite in second tower past pool. Room was nice and spacious. Small wetbar area. Couch and club chair. Nice king bed, very comfortable mattresses, nice linens, great pillows. Bathroom was nice, clean, well equipped and with above par soaps and shampoos. Pool Area - Very Nice in the center of the hotels towers, and looked to be clean and well maintained. A lot of people gathered there in the evenings. Restaurant - Nice, a little bit expensive, but not out of the ordinary for a hotel restaurant. Room service was offered. Parking - Yeah, as you have read by other reviews, its not the best. You basically park in a lot shared by a high rise office next to the hotel. plenty of spaces, so that is not an issue. It is not a long walk, but it is a walk, across a small access road in front of the office. BUT IT IS FREE, and for any hotel in any major downtown area, that is a rarity. I just paid 30.00 to park at the Hilton GI in New Orleans this week !! So its free, its ample, but its just a short walk away. Get over it. :-)Note - Lots of road construction going on in front of the hotel for the new trolley system phoenix is putting in, but it does not in any way effect the noise or the access to the hotel. just a small annoyance when driving to the hotel Will I stay here again. Absolutely! I believe I paid 90.00 or so, and it was well worth it.
