{"text":"Excellent stay at the Hotel D'Aubusson! My husband, 6 year old daughter and I stayed at the Hotel d'Aubusson July 1-5. A good friend stayed here during the winter and raved about the hotel and the service. We booked the Romance Package (not much romance with our 6 year old in tow) and it was worth every euro. Our stay in a deluxe room included a private transfer from the airport, roses and champagne in the room, tickets to the Louvre, breakfast each day, a bateau mouche ride, tickets to a concert and a delicious champagne lunch with foie gras. We considered staying on the Right Bank as we've done in the past, but we would have gotten much less for the same price.Our room was spacious by Paris standards. At first, I was disappointed that we didn't have one of the exposed beamed rooms they show on their website, but it turned out to not be a big deal. The rooms are super-soundproofed from street noise. We all slept very soundly. Since we weren't there over the weekend, I can't comment on the noise from the jazz band that plays in the lounge. The Hermes toiletries are a nice touch. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning our room and replenished all our toiletries daily.The staff is unfailingly polite and helpful. We asked for recommendations multiple nights for places to go for dinner and were never disappointed. We particularly liked the restaurant Aux Charpentiers, which is walking distance from the hotel. The neighborhood is wonderful and close to everything. There are lots of restaurants to choose from and great shopping (a wonderful children's clothing store is on the Rue Dauphine across the street from the hotel called Bois de Rose and you can walk to Pierre Herme on Rue Bonaparte). You can't go wrong by staying at the Hotel d'Aubusson.
