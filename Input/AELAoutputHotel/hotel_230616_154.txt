{"text":"Fantastic Hotel and Great Staff. Ideas For Your Holiday Well, thank you Trip Advisor Holiday People. I chose the Banks Mansion on the remarks on this site. My wife and I have just come back from 5 nights at the hotel and cannot praise the hotel enough.But first let me explain one thing, we work hard to be able to stay in top quality hotels, with great locations, great rooms etc, and have been lucky to stay in many beautiful hotels around the world.So what was so unique about a hotel that is graded as a three star, but here on trip advisor as a five star, and it deserves it.For the first time I went by reviews here, and made notes of everthying my wife and I did to help you all, and make your stay as good as ours.This hotel does not go for massive luxury, but has massive amounts of friendliness, comfort, service, drinks, coffee's etc.Unique is the word for the all exclusive service, pillows yes lovely, bed yes very comfortable, televisions great, shower well did not want to leave the shower!Our stay was even made better by all the reception staff, especially Frederique and Sonja (hope I have spelt them right) who went out of their way to help my wife find some craft shops.The lounge area was also very nice for the internet, coffee, Baileys, Brandy, Beers, waters, fruit juice, snacks. With also drinks in your fridge in your rooms, and Gin, Whiskey and more.All this and we hardly drink, but I have to admit to enjoying a baileys and coffee at the end of the evening.The area also is perfect, 10 minutes away from shops, rembrandt square (loads of cafes), 20 minutes walk at the most from Grand Central Station, 10 minutes from DamSquare.Highly recommended to you from someone who studies what to do on holidays.1 Anne Frank House2 The Red Light Tour3 Sauna Deco (more in next paragraph)(has it's own web site)4 Privare hire of driver and his car (with drinks and snacks)(Dennis Van Leerdam phone 0655785832)5 Canal Bus (14 stops, get on and off canal bus)6 Candlelight Canal Tour (lindbergh)I really hope this help you, and is not too much reading.Sauna Deco, Wow !!Twenty Minute walk from the hotel, on the same canal, where you can have sports massage, and any massage. But if your not modest it is a unisex sauna, steam , relax , showers, plunge pool , with no clothes, another eye opener and very relaxing.The private car with Dennis Van Leerdam was great to travel to the windmills, Boerk, and the Waterland area.I hope you enjoy your stay , please feel free to mention my wife and my name (Mr Sean Peters and Mrs Tracey Peters), let me know.May post photos later, don't forget to ask for a canal view.I really enjoyed Amsterdam, the old bikes, the great people, and the great coffee shops, beautiful properties.
