{"text":"Very Good Hotel Arrived at the hotel very wet as it was peeing down and did for most of our vacation but that didnt put us off!! We arrived very early at the hotel as our flight landed at 8.30am and they couldnt do enough to accommodate us with warm drinks and a comfy seat! Our rooms were almost ready so we hung around and were unpacked and back out to hit Amsterdam by 11am! The rooms are small but adequate and our friends managed to get the attic suite with a bedroom and seating area. The stairs are very steep and narrow and by the end of 4 days our legs were aching but you have to do it!!! There are no lifts in these old buildings. We didnt find noise an issue from our 3rd floor room - the only noise we could hear was the rain!The breakfasts were good. Freshly squeezed orange juice, cereals, eggs, cheese, ham, fruit and various freshly baked breads and rolls. The coffee is also really good and service very attentive. In fact all the staff are excellent and so friendly. Nothing was a problem and they went out of their way to speak to you on your way in and out of the hotel.The location of the hotel is also very good. About 5 minutes to Dam Square and the train station and 20 mins to the Southern Belt. We found the whole experience really good and would return to the hotel and recommend to others. Another good point, they have loads of umberellas which were needed during our stay!
