{"text":"The value just wasn't there... I saw all of the good reviews on trip advisor for this hotel and started to search around for prices. I found them listed on hotels.com with a price of $115 per night, but no mention of the bed size, and we wanted a queen or bigger. I decided to contact the hotel directly and they offered me a queen bed at $135 a night, which seemed a little high, but I decided the extra $20 per night would be okay. Watch out for the additional fees, though. They charged an additional $9.00 per day as a maintenance fee or something like that, and there is a 14% tax on top of that. We ended up paying $682 for 4 nights, or $170 per night. Now, I was looking for a small, quaint hotel that would bring with it the charm of the local community, and a sense that we were experiencing a part of Puerto Rico. This hotel just didn't offer that. This was a $100 per night hotel at best. For $170 a night, we shouldn't have had the following problems: The first night there, the water would only turn on cold. There were 2 of us, and we turned the knobs every which way trying to get hot water in the shower. Finally, we asked at the desk. They agreed to look at it in the morning while we had breakfast. After, they brought us in, and showed us how to turn the knob and said the hot water was working all along. There is no way it was working prior to that. Why couldn't they just apologize for having to turn on the water heater? In addition, after breakfast, we brought our coffee back into the room with us while we were getting ready. When they cleaned the room, they didn't remove the empty, used coffee cups. For the price we were paying, I would expect the room to be perfect when we returned for the evening. I ended up having to bring 2 days of coffee cups back out to the breakfast area myself. I know these things seem small, and I would overlook them for a less expensive hotel, but I know there are other hotels in the area that provide better service for the same price. (I had previously stayed at the Wind Chimes Inn and would have booked there again, if they weren't all filled up.) The good things: the courtyard for breakfast was beautiful, but don't expect anything very healthy (yogurt with lots of sugar, pastries, and processed cheese and ham... they also had cereal, but only cornflakes.) The bed was the right size, but it was just outside the courtyard, so when people would congregate for breakfast, they woke us up every morning. No need to set an alarm! The rooms were cleaned well except for the coffee cup issue, and the location was great.If you are going to stay here, I would ask NOT to have a room near the courtyard, and be careful about pricing. I see another post here that states a room with a king bed was only $125 a night. I don't know why my price was higher. They also recommend that you tip the maid $3 per day. I usually tip the maid, anyway, but I just felt like they were nickle and diming me with this suggested tip as well. Make it $173 per night. I have never given a bad review to a hotel on trip advisor before, and I still highly recommend Wind Chimes Inn if you are looking for a hotel in the Condado area. I felt the service and the people there were wonderful, and I didn't feel like I was getting less value for my money.
