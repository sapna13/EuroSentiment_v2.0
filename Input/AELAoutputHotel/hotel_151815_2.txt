{"text":"I hope this review will be helpful to others I stayed at the Melia Ponce in July while attending the Caribe Gyn conference. I am not an MD but the company I work for was promoting a product to Ob-Gyn's attending the conference. I have to admit that I called American Express travel and, being told that the Ponce Hilton was sold out, promptly accepted their suggestion of a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢elia Ponce√à√\u2020\u2022?under the assumption that this property was affiliated with Spanish-based Hoteles Melia. This was my first mistake, because they bear no relation (it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ only after you get to the Melia Ponce that you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e constantly reminded of the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µroud independent heritage√à√\u2020\u2022?. The second mistake was not trying to get into a different hotel upon discovering the first mistake (and besides, the hotel's 5-day cancellation policy was probably designed with that in mind). And what a bad hotel this was√à√\u2020\u2022?I suggest not allowing yourself to be fooled by those who describe it as √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢raditional√à√\u2020\u2022? √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ªomantic√à√\u2020\u2022? √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âozy√à√\u2020\u2022? √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°amily-owned√à√\u2020\u2022? etc. This is really a glorified two-star motel -- sans the heart-shaped jacuzzi. Built in the early 20th century, the building does show its age at every step: old doors, filthy carpets, dusty and smelly linen, signs of poor maintenance everywhere. To be fair: the walls are made of concrete, if that is any consolation. The room reeks of cheap disinfectant and air freshener, and the wall-mounted A\/C unit produces significant noise, but not nearly enough to suppress the techno-electronic music piped in from the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µlaza√à√\u2020\u2022?in front of the hotel. The √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°ree breakfast√à√\u2020\u2022?was a joke: bad food served in orange plastic trays and flies everywhere in the sun-drenched √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ªomantic rooftop√à√\u2020\u2022? Coffee was served from pots that I saw abandoned on the floor the night before. This is a cheap motel in every sense, except in the daily rate (+\/- USD 110\/night). In summary: avoid it like the plague, unless you really want a more √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢ypical√à√\u2020\u2022?or √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Ödventurous√à√\u2020\u2022?stay in Ponce (I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ comment on the city because I did not have a chance to visit). P.S. The hotel leases ground floor space to a restaurant called √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢ark√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂√à√\u2020\u2022? The areas surrounding the hotel do not make you too excited about going out for dinner, so I decided to take my chances √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√£n house√à√\u2020\u2022? Surprisingly, I had an excellent dinner at Mark√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂. Its US-owners have created a great place, with awesome food and good service. In the end, leaving the restaurant and heading back to my room at the Melia only made it seem more depressing than it should be, and I was lucky to spend only one night at this poor place.
