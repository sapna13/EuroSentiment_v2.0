{"text":"Fantastic time with 8 friends Loved Loved Loved the Residence Inn!!!Each year myself and 7 of my good friends hike on it NYC to spend the weekend. Last year we were at the Rhiga which is now the New London. we would of stayed there again but the rate was crazy and I got bad reviews on the New London. Got a almost unheard of rate which I snagged the last week before we went. Believe it was $189....Originally I was paying $259 a nite which still is not bad for NYC.We all went in by limo and checked in around 4:00 pm on a Friday. We booked 3 rooms. They were on the same floor. Hotel is not all that big so easy to get around. Rooms were extremely clean however they are relatively smaller than most residence inns.Staff are wonderful. We had an incident whereby our neighbor next door to us called security saying we were slamming doors.Now I am a 50 yr old woman who might have closed the door twice to visit our friends 2 doors away.Once the security men came to the room and took a look at all of us they just laughed. They became our friends for the weekend.Breakfast is normal...nothing great but free and it sure beats leaving the hotel in the middle of January to find a cup of coffee.We had brought in some snacks and obviously our own libations. It was wonderful to have the fridge and sink.Once in the city we took in a show, did a tour and went to the restaurant One if by Land Two if by Sea. Highly recommend it. We did this during restaurant week so prices were cheaper.On Sunday we trekked on down to Chinatown, shopped around a little and wound up eating in Little Italy. Although lately Little Italy is a true name...it is almost gone. This is so sad. But we all had wonderful meals.I would also recommend eating there as well.So for next year we all took a vote and once again we are going back to the Residence.
