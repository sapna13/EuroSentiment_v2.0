{"text":"Excellent stay Location:Excellent location - the next block is where the cable car is, so it's very easy to get to. Union Square is the hub of the shopping in the city centre...good place to exercise your plastic. Before I went people were saying that San Fran has a lot of homeless people and a lot of needles...the reality is that there are homeless in all major cities and we didn't find this any more than normal. We saw no needless anywhere in San Fran. We felt very safe in the location of the hotel and you could easily get to where you needed to.Staff:Very friendly staff from the front desk, the housekeeper and the conceirge. No complaints at all - everyone was very helpful.Room:Only slight negative is that the room we stayed in was very...shall we say compact. But the reality is you don't need a massive room as you're never in the room for long in the first place. If you can, avoid the rooms in the corner of the hotel, as they seem to be the smallest. Our friends, who paid the same price as we did, stayed in the middle rooms and their room was considerably bigger. Amenities in the room including the bathroom products were good - we liked the products - minty and natural. The room was clean, which is the most important thing and the bed was very comfortable.Top tip:5.30pm-6.30pm - residents get free wine tasting...I'm sure this is until they get their license sorted but until then...a great way to start the night!Recommend?...Definitely! We loved San Fran and we will be staying at the Larkspur again when we visit again. ","annotations":[]}
