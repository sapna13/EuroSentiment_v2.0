{"text":"Go to the Paradisus!!!! We have had a great time at other Occidental resorts, but this was not worth the money. After one night there we transferred to the Paradisus Punta Cana which I would highly recommend. Also, some of the things that happened was bad luck for us.√à¬£¬©?During check-in our reservation was lost. After 45 minutes they found it and took us to our room where the key didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ work. After getting another key we found that the room was occupied. After going back again we found the right room.√à¬£¬©?Our first room had wet floors and mold growing on the wall. I believe it had been cleaned earlier in the day and not allowed to dry so it was like walking into an old basement. Lauren is allergic to mold and immediately started sneezing and having trouble breathing.√à¬£¬©?When we asked our concierge for another room he did not want to help because he was afraid we were going to go to another building. (Each building has a concierge. We were told right away that they make a commission off any tours we book so they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want you to use another tour operator.) We finally left and went to the front desk where the clerk did not want to help and we were brushed off after being told every room was full. I found another clerk who was more helpful and was able to find us another room. After tipping him he went back and found an ocean front room for us, which turned out to be a big improvement over the first room. This whole process took over three hours.√à¬£¬©?There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a disco on the property that plays the music so loud that it sounds like the club is directly outside the room even with all the doors and windows closed. Our room was facing the beach and the disco is at the other end of the property. The music played from 9pm to 1am. (We could hear it walking on the beach at the Paradisus, about a half-mile down the beach, the next night.)√à¬£¬©?The second room was much nicer than the first, but there was still mold growing on the walls, the floor would sweat in places, and the shower had large rust spots. Lauren was still having sinus problems due to the mold.√à¬£¬©?The hotel allows other tour operators on the property. Every time we went anywhere near the lobby we would be swarmed with people trying to sell us tours. You would have to be almost forceful for them to leave you alone.√à¬£¬©?We had to get our room key reset two more times during the time we were there. The concierge is not able to ask them for a new key so it requires a ten-minute walk each way to the front desk. √à¬£¬©?When we transferred to the Paradisus many of their employees came from the Occidental and asked about our problems as if it was common knowledge. We were in our room in less than twenty minutes.
