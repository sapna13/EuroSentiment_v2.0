{"text":"Don't be put off I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights\/3 days at the end of March this year. Having booked the hotel for 18 girls travelling for a birthday weekend I was terrified after reading some of the reviews and in a panic tried to book somewhere else due to the proximity to the red light district  reviews on cleanliness.... Im glad I wasn't able to find somewhere else! We all had a great stay  a great weekend!!This is not a hotel for a romantic break or family holidays or for business travellers who need comfort but for singles or carefree couples its perfect for exploring the city. Just across the road from the central train station (around 4 euros each way for 15 min journey to\/from airport)  lots of tram stops its ideally located. On the map it appears right on the edge of the red light district, which in a way it is, but its far enough away that we never felt insecure or in any danger. Nearly everything in the city centre is within walking distance so long as you have a pair of comfy shoes.The hotel wasn't stylish but all 5 of our rooms were very clean  we had plenty of room. The bathrooms were spotless  the rooms were tidied each day. The stairs were indeed a nightmare but we didnt have to use them as the lift was always in perfect working order. Breakfast was fairly good and the hotel bar was cosy  friendly. The hotel staff were all very nice except for the guy at reception on the day we checked out who was very rude to 1 of the girls but otherwise we have no complaints at all. I book weekends away for my friends all the time  usually go for budget hotels. Some reviews seem to think that this hotel was overpriced.. we paid approx √ä√£¬¢90 each (with the current exchange rate) for our stay but the central location meant we didn't have any other expenses eg. taxi fares which for such a large group could have been a nightmare. I cannot comment on the parts of the hotel located further down the street as we were all in the main building but we all had a very comfortable happy stay at this hotel  would certainly use it again.
