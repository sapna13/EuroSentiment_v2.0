{"text":"Don't go here!!! We booked this through Apple Vacations, and they highly recommended this resort. We let them know we were on our honeymoon. We got to the resort on Thursday at 3pm, it took us over an hour to check in. We upgraded to VIP package as per the suggestion of the front desk. VIP doesnt mean anything. We were informed that you had to make reservations for dinner the day before, or else your only choice was to eat the buffet. Noone told us this,and since we arrived at 3pm we had to eat our frist night in the buffet which has no fans and was HOT and disgusting. We were also not informed that there would be a dress code for men in all the restaurants, which we were told was strictly enforced. After making my husband adhere to their rules, there were plenty of people eating in shorts. If you did not wake up at 7 am to put your towel on a chair you didnt get one. One morning I woke up at 7am to put towels and reserve chairs, wehn we got there after eating breakfast someone had moved our stuff and put there stuff down. When we went to the desk abotu it the guy said it happens all the time. Very frustarting when all you want to do is relax. The staff was not helpful to us at all, and we are very generous tippers. We tipped everyone and did not find that we were treated any nicer. Of course we r in a different country and dont expect them to speak our language but some were not helpful at all. We also had ants in our room, which they came and sprayed 4 hours later, with us in the room. We had to call to request all of the things included in the VIP package more then once. The food was terrible. We both got sick, which as I said is expected to a degree, but when you eat in a buffet thats outside, hot with bugs crawling all over the food, obviously your going to get sick. We were told the VIP package include 24 hr room service, when we called at 11pm one night they had only hamburgers.We made reservations at the spa, walked all the way over there to be told they had no record of our reservation and we had to come back 4 hrs later.They gave us two keys that didnt work. After dinner we walked back to our room to find our keys didnt work. We called the front desk, (which is a 10min walk at least) and they took 1 hour to come with a new key. It was 110 degrees, and we had to stand and wait, then they came with the wrong key. After we finally got into our room 1 hour and 15 min later, we called to complain and they told us there was no manager at the time and nothing they could do about it. The pools and beach were beautiful. The brazilian restaurant was the only good dinner we had all vacation, and as stated in previous reviews thank god for breakfast. We travel all the time, and go to many places. We wanted a nice relaxing honeymoon, and instead had a weekend filled with stress. This was one of the worst vacations I have ever had, thank goodness they have nice beaches and nice weather or I would have come home early from my own honeymoon. I would recommend spending a little more money and going elsewhere.
