{"text":"Fresh and Vibrant Hotel! Over all the hotel and staff were very friendly and thoughtfull.The reception staff are friendly, the rooms are a good size with a big not so hard not so soft bed.We had a room with pool view and was very nice in evenings.The spa was sooooo nice both of us had a 60 min massage and it was very very nice and proffessional.The staff love children, my kids were 15months and 4 years old and they played with them a lot, they would take them for walks around the fish pond where we could see them while we were eating.The cleanliness was very good although we stayed 10 nights and our room was cleaned every day but the toilet was just kind of wiped round so in the end i bought my own cleaner from shop down the road.Location is good if you dont need a pushchair or pram as the roads are very bumpy- very bumpy.Be prepeared to be hassled by sreet vendors and beggars.Food- the breakfast buffet consisted of the usaual eggs, sausages then fruit and buns etc......We ate at our hotel most nights and the hotel food is very nice with a good range to choose from.Every one must try the fried icecream we had one every night- scrumpsious.The sky bar was great with 2 screen and shows all sports and is open till all hours.The pool is very relaxing with a modern obver flow feature, also had a kiddies pool.Have a great stay!!!!
