{"text":"Best hotel yet. I have stayed in hotels all over the world, mostly 4 and 5 star places for work and I am yet to experience another place of the same quality as this. It is not the most luxurious or the grandest but they have the best service I have ever come across, really nice rooms and free wi-fi. If you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stay here in Florence you are missing out. Within hours of booking I received a personalised email from the owner, Fabrizio, offering assistance with anything I required with my stay, I took him up on his offer and he booked me some museum tickets at no charge- when I got there he advised me that there had not been many people at that museum that afternoon (unusual) and I could save money using another entry method instead of the reservation he had made for me saving us the additional cost. He also spent time explaining to us all the things to do and the most efficient method to achieve what we want and gave us maps in the process. He had personally looked out for our welfare and we were grateful, this is the sort of service that you can receive at this hotel- in a modern world this place is a breath of fresh air. Free wi-fi, including a free computer in the room, we had our own computer so he gave us two log-on codes for both computers free.Free movies or games.Huge room by any standards and very clean and comfortableFree wine and nibbles in the bar at an appointed time in the evening designed to allow the guest to meet and chat.When we arrived in this hotel we had been travelling for a while and been in and out of many other hotels and this place shocked us with the fabulous service. Another thing, we suffered a bit of a family emergency and had to travel back to London and Fabrizio helped us out with anything we required and was very understanding and courteous. If you are in Florence don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stay anywhere else. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":278,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":274}]}
