{"text":"our second time  Just got back last night and had to write this review.Our family of 6, (3 adults 3 teenagers) traveled March 29th-April 4th 2007. This was our 2nd time at Iberostar Bavero and it WON'T be our last!!! I can't rave enough about it! What I do have to say to all the people complaining about musty smells, foreign foods, and getting up early to get a prime spot in the sun......STAY IN AMERICA!!! Why are people surprised that in a warm, humid climate to experience musty smells? Why are they taken back by some foreign dishes being offered, wasn't the pancakes, french toast, waffles, and omellettes enough to satisfy them at breakfast? French fries, hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza and roasted chicken were always available at the lunch  dinner buffets! I've eaten in the best restaurants in the world and their gourmet restaurants are not bad, but you don't go to an all-inclusive for the food! Drinking water in ANY foreign country is just plain crazy, some precautions should always be taken when traveling abroard...ie. drinking and brushing teeth w\/bottled water, peeling fruit, no raw veggies or salad and stay hydrated! The rooms are well kept  spacious, the grounds are gorgious  immaculate, the beach  ocean are breathtaking! Every employee works beyond hard to please, but the star friends make your day extra fun. Lewinske, Henry, Oscar and all their associates go out of their way to make everyone feel special and have a memorable vacation. Bartenders Danielo, Wildon and their associates are quick with a cold drink and ready smile! Our daughters' 18th birthday was celebrated during our stay, and all of our new found friends made her day extra special. Samuel, made a special cake for her, the band sang to her and they all took a turn salsa dancing with her near the pool bbq!  There are enough activities to keep everyone happy and busy. A small casino keeps some busy, and is questionable about it's ethics(what do you expect without a casino commission?). The disco is lots of fun after 11. A teenagers paradise! But adults have fun too! I read the monthly forcast religiously prior to our trip, it said rain EVERYDAY,  we didn't get a drop during the day, only once at night...so don't pay attention to that! Lots of touristy stuff at the beach huts, haggle for a good price, hair braids 1\/2 the $ then the hotel. I've NEVER been to a hotel or cruise where we DIDNT have to get up early for our favorite spot in the sun, so I don't know where these people have been(The early bird catches the worm!) But there is plenty of room both at the pool  beach. The buffet area is huge, the lines minimal, and plenty to choose from. The gourmet rest. must be booked at arrival, 16 and older males MUST wear long pants in enclosed restaurants. Peacocks are everywhere, and VERY vocal! BUT no traces of them anywhere, flamingos, swans etc are nice near the buffet. The complex is huge, alot of walking on slippery, uneven pavers(ladies, wear comfortable, flat or wedgey heels) You can catcha golf cart for long treks. Our rooms were 1111, 1121  1122, they were great, very central convienient. Champagne was mucho frio at the lobby bar. And a few dollars go a long way, like having Stoli ready for you at the pool bar. These people work extremely long hours, very hard , at least 14 hours, 12 days on, 3 off. for very little money! A tip here and there is very appreciated BUT NOT expected!  So go to this wonderful resort and enjoy a memorable vacation, you won't be dissappointed, and believe me I'm not easily satisfyed(my nickname is High maintenance!) We're already planning a return trip!! April has a nice breeze, July is extremely hot, But either season ....I'll be back!!!!! Say Hi to Lewinske from Ali's and Johnny Bravos family....we miss them already!!!!!!!!
