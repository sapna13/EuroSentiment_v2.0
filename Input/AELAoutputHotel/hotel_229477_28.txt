{"text":"Fantastic! My husband and I just returned from a two week honeymoon in Europe and Amsterdam was our middle stop between Ireland and Paris. We had a great time in Amsterdam and thought that the American was a great place to stay. It's in a fantastic location, we came from the airport on the tram, which was totally cheap and even easier to navigate. The tram stops right in front of the hotel, which is super convenient, no taxi is necessary from the train station or the airport. We booked a standard (21 day advance) room which did the trick for us. We were looking for something economical, but a little nice since it was our honeymoon, thank the US dollar! The room was very small compared to what we expect in the US, but it was big enough for us and our stuff, but there was some tripping over suitcases. We actually didn't even manage to make it into the famous Bar American for food or drinks, but it was beautiful and we regret no making it in there. The location is really fantastic, it's walking distance to a lot of things, which was very nice. The main street off the Leidseplein Square is great and has a ton of shops and sweet shops! There are a TON of restaurants near the square, too many choices almost. Also, a ton of bars, coffeeshops, cafe's, etc in very close proximity. We took a canal tour with the company Lovers, which actually isn't just for lovers...The stop is literally right outside the door and a 1 hour tour is only 9 euros, very nice when you are looking to stop walking. Overall, a great city, a fantastic location, great hotel and staff. No english speaking channels on tv but CNN and BBC, but that is only if you need more tv, we didn't watch too much. They brought us a adaptor when we requested one, which was lovely and a much needed touch. Free internet was nice too, always is....
