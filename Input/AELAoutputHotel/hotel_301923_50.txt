{"text":"Check your bill carefully This is a beautiful resort, but I had major problems with the front desk. Our airport transfers were supposed to be included in the room rate -- although when I arrived, they wanted me to pay US$30 (after originally failing to meet us). When I departed, there was another charge for US$20 for our return trip to the airport. I contested both and they dropped them without much complaint as if it happens all the time (i.e. they were clearly padding the bill). Also, they advertised a discount if you paid with American Express, but then refused to grant it to me, originally denying the promotion existed, then saying it was only at one specific restaurant. (there were brochures for the promotion at a few places in the resort) When I asked to speak to the manager or assistant manager, they said they were in a meeting and couldn't speak with me. After 30 minutes of trying to work out the problem, they refused to honor the discount they advertised, refused repeatedly to call the manager, and I had to rush off to the airport. I followed up with a complaint and they replied I must have misunderstood the brochure (although it was in English and I'm a native speaker -- they were not). That said, the resort grounds are beautiful and spa\/gym nice although the location is FAR from other places of interest in Bali (1 hour from Ubud and 1-1\/2 hours to Kuta -- depending on traffic and if the resort's driver has to stop for petrol.) The restaurants were fine, although we've had much better breakfast buffets elsewhere in Asia. Rooms need upgrades - -pretty gross stains on the chairs. If it weren't for the problems with the bill and the refusal to honor their own discounts, I'd say this place was fine. But, I won't stay there again. If you do, CHECK YOUR BILL CAREFULLY!!
