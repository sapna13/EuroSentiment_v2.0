{"text":"Loved This Hotel We bookd this hotel for our wedding. We were there with a group of 33 inlcuding 3 kids under the age of 6 and everyone loved the resort.Food:Food was great. There was a different theme at the buffet every night and the a la cartes were all very good. We did have to wait at the Italian one night for an hour, but the food was worth it. You do not have to reserve at the a la cartes which is a nice bonus and you can visit each one as many times as you like. If you get there between 6 and 630 you usually can get right in and don't have to wait.Pool:The pools were very nice and they are huge!!!! They also both have a graduated entrance which is great for children. The yellow pool has the activities and the blue pool is nice and quiet. The blue pools has nicer chairs that are padded and there are two bar tenders at the pool bar which make getting your drink a bit faster. The yellow pool is closer to the beach and gets a bit sandy because some guests do not rinse off before getting in after being at the beach. We never had any problems getting chairs or umbrellas no matter what time we made our way to the pool.Beach:The beach was absolutely beautiful. Always clean and again you could always find a chair and some shade no matter what time it was. Sand is soft and white and doesn't get hot and there was always a beautiful breeze down there.Room:We were in a Junior Suite which is the hotel's standard room. Big bathroom, two sinks, soaker\/jacuzzi tub. Nothing fancy, but they were always clean, fridge was stocked with beer, pop and water every day. One tip: the shower door only goes half way across the tub, so the water goes all over the floor. We adjusted the position of the shower head so it pointed down a little more and we had no problems after that.Wedding:Our wedding as absolutely perfect. If anyone is considering this hotel for a wedding, it is an excellent choice. The wedding co-ordinator is on top of evrything and makes sure that all your requests are met.We had our ceremony in the gazebo, since it is more private than the beach and we didn't have any on-lookers in our photos. It was also less windy up there, which was nice too.We had our dinner at La Brasa which is the a la carte on the beach. The food was excellent and they print up a menu for all your guests with the dinner choices with your names at the top. I thought that was a nice touch. We had the entire outside terrace set up with our tables and a dance floor. It was so private and we didn't have to pay extra for that.My flowers were great and exactly what I had asked for. The ony thing that was disappointing was my cake. It was so ugly, a white cake with big pink blobs of icing for flowers. We both just laughed since it really wasn't that big of a deal.Overall:The resort is really big. It is probably a good 5-10 min walk from the beach to the lobby. There is a tram that goes around that you can get on, but a lot of the time it is taking people who are checking in\/out so its loaded with luggage. We didn't have any problems with the walking but for someone who may have mobility problems the size of the resort might be an issue. The beach markets are located right next to the hotel and on Fridays certain vendors set up a market at the hotel. The vendors are kind of pushy and you REALLY have to negotiate, and be careful of what you buy. My brother bought a bottle of Mamajuana on the beach and it was nothing but red wine and some sticks.We would go back to this resort in a heartbeat but we would like to visit anothet resort on our next trip since this was our first time to Punta Cana.
