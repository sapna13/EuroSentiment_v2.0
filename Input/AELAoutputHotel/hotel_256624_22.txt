{"text":"A+ for Families at Quay West I have stayed at this property four times now with my family and the Quay West has yet to dissappoint. We first stayed at the Quay West seven years ago on the recommendation of a travel agent. After arriving in the middle of a record setting hailstorm, the entire city of Sydney was without power. The with charm and grace, the bellhops lugged our giant suitcases up 10 flights of stairs with only the glow of flashlights to guide us. Huffing and puffing, it was an experience I will never forget.We returned to Sydney in August 2007, again to stay at the Quay West. I must say I was just as pleased years later. We love the magnificent view and the spaciousness of the apartments. The location is perfect for sightseeing. Everyone in our family of five had their own comfortable bed - plus two bathrooms AND a washer\/dryer. The kitchen is adequate. Perfectly suited for a take-out dinners and everything you need to make your own breakfasts. There are grocery stores within walking distance. One of our rooms had an enormous patio.But perhaps our favorite amenity of this hotel is it's swimming pool, hot tub, workout room and sauna on the upper floors. There is nothing better to combat jet-lag or relax from a day of sightseeing than a refreshing swim or a work-out. Most of the time, we were the lone occupants in the facility. The view over the city and harbor is breathtaking.I highly recommend Quay West for families looking for higher quality, spacious accommodations in a picture perfect location in the heart of Sydney.
