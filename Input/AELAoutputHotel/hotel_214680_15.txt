{"text":"The Perfect Spot Upon entering the Park Shore Waikiki, you have entered the Perfect Spot to embark upon your Hawiian adventure. The lobby is quiet, comfortable, and beautiful. The famous ABC stores of Waikiki occupy a space on the lobby level down a short hallway and anything you need is in that store. Marvelous! The front desk and staff are waiting to serve you with a true Hawiian smile and friendliness that made us realize at once we were in a comfortable and user friendly enviornment. We were booked into an oceanfront room on the 8th floor for a stay of 9 nights. The elevators are very efficient and fast and with three(3), to use, coming and going was always quick. We loved our room. It was clean, nice bathroom, comfortable mattress, nice little refrigerator, table, and the T.V. worked perfectly. T.V. was housed in a cabinet and pulled out and swiveled for easy viewing. The balcony was a good size and very safe. The railings were high and very sturdy. They did not move. Some might say the room was small but we were there for 9 nights and I didn't once feel uncomfortable. We never really heard our neighbors so the sound proofing between rooms was very good. Mely was the name of our room attendant. I will miss her smile and friendliness forever. She made our room clean and comfortable every day with and a  job well done  is the term I apply to her efforts. The director of guest relations, Leonor Wong, is someone you might want to introduce yourself to in the first day or two of your stay. She's a wonderful person and loves her job. She is quite capable of making your stay more than you expect it to be. Hint: Maybe tell her why your visiting. (i.e. anniversary, birthday, etc.). The Park Shore is located ground zero Waikiki Beach. There is no better location. You take the elevator down, walk thru the lobby, or ABC Store, and cross the street to Waikiki Beach. The front desk will supply you with towels for the beach upon request. Beauty, friendly, efficient, location. Park Shore Waikiki is all this and more. If we go back, we know where to stay. P.S. Waikiki is a busy place! The noise levels are high at first but upon closing your sliding door and using a little air conditioning,( that worked very well), after a day or two, you melt into the experience of Park Shore Waikiki!
