{"text":"Great for the Money I understand that there are mixed reviews of Grand Oasis. You have to compare what you are paying to what you are getting. For our honeymoon we booked 7 nights for a junior master suite and spent $1200, for TWO people. Our room was very luxourious, jaccuzzi, huge walk in shower, CA, cable TV. The choices of restaurants were sufficient, specialty restaurants' portions were sort of small. The buffet has more than enough choices for all meals. Our house keeping was great, remember to leave a modest tip each day if you want them to go the extra mile; ie: flowers on your bed. We chose not to do any excursions because the tour guides charge too much. We did however opt to use the sea kiaks and sail boat. You should learn a little Spanish to talk to local venders, my husband is bilingual so we had no problems. The only problem that I can mention is the venders that come out a couple of evenings, I guess they do this so tourists don't have to leave the resort. Yes they are a bit pushy, just keep walking if you're not interested. We also had to walk way down the beach, off the resort grounds to find peace and quiet. Don't go alone, for safety reasons. It was an adventure for us, we found someone selling coconuts and handmade art. There was too much activity for us and loud music at the main pool and lots of toplessness going on at the resort beaches. Bugs were minimal, and only at night. Oh, and we wanted more local music and dancing, like marangue, bachata, salsa. I think the resort mostly catered to the prodominent Eureopean crowd.All in all we were pleased with our trip, we will go back again. ","annotations":[]}
