{"text":"Fun time! My husband and I stayed at the Caribe Club from November 10 - November 17th to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. We were a litte worried going there based on some of the reviews that we had read but I am happy to say that we had nothing but a wonderful experience! The staff from the minute we arrived to the minute we left were AWESOME! Their english was great and their personalites and humor were great! We did get the VIP package and we were very pleased with it! I would reccommend that package to anyone! It provided us with a great room, great drinks, a wonderful massage and a delicious dinner at La Cava! we went to almost all the restaurants and La Cava was hands down our favorite! Chinese was our next favorite. We didn't care for the Mexican though but that is what the buffet was for ;) The only bummer we experienced was the weather. I know that we went during rainy season but still! It rained all day on Tuesday which we really didn't mind since we had already scheduled a shopping excursion for that day. It then decided to rain all day on Thursday so by the afternoon we said that we are here on vacation and we are going to go play in the ocean while it was raining! So we did! Other folks had the same idea and we had a ball! It wasn't thundering or lightning so we were fine! We had a blast catching the waves and just having good old fun in the rain and water! It then decided to rain all day on Friday so we went and got massages at the Spa. We can't say enough good things about the spa! Go! It is beautiful! We tipped our maid $2 every other day and we never had a problem. She was great!Food - buffet was good. Always something there to satisfy ya! Room service was good and timely too!Pools - all 3 were great! It was nice to have an option of getting away from all the action at the main pool....Service - WonderfulWe would definitely consider going back...Have fun! No worries!
