{"text":"good but a bit random I couldn't decide if to give three or four stars, I believe it claims to a six star hotel (whatever that actually is) and well that its definintely not.We had a one night stay on the club floor for our wedding anniversary, Carlo the chef at their upmarket Itlanian restaurant having run the restaurant at Sheraton where we had wedding reception way back when.Service was decidedly mixed overall with the Filipino and local staff were good (some very good) but the others mainland Chinese et al were somewhere between average and I get better in my local coffee shop - and they speak better english. If you are a six star hotel your club lounge staff need to be able to communicate in the main international business language - that's just the way it is.Generally speaking the reception etc staff were good to very good, while the FB staff seemed largely untrained and vaguely hopeless (a huge contrast). Breakfast in the club lounge verged on laughable with a woman cooking eggs etc who had obviously been hired from the local hawker centre (although that is an insult to my local joint). Thick as two short planks is an understatement.The rest of the FB service was average as well, excepting the manager(?) and Carlo in Risortante Bologna.The room was really nice, and a way cool shower. However rock hard pillows did litlle for actually sleeping. The aircon was very warm with no apparent way of turning up the fan, and the absurb number of unlabled light switches was just plain irritating.Overall - nice rooms, some very good staff - and if they could iron out the kinks would be a great hotel - but at what we paid average for the price.
