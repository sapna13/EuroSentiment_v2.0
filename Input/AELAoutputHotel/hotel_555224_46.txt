{"text":"Very nice hotel but customer service needs work. We chose this hotel because of the great reviews on tripadvisor and the free parking  internet.This is definitely a great hotel to stay at if you plan on renting a car for your stay. There is plenty of parking (free!) and the T station is about a 10 minute walk. There is a big plaza right behind the hotel with a bunch of box stores (Best Buy, Marshall's, Target, Home Depot, Circuit City), a supermarket, and a couple of restaurants (Applebee's and Olive Garden).The hotel rooms are big, clean, and very nice. The internet is also free and the connection is fast. The one weak point of the hotel is the customer service. I went to the front desk four or five times during my stay: once to check in, a few times to ask for information\/advice, and once to check out. Not once was there actually somebody at the front desk. I have no idea why the staff there like to hide in the back office and not be out in front. Customers build up in front of the front desk like idiots wondering where the heck the staff are.The housekeeping staff don't get around to making up your room until 2:30pm depending on where your room is. Small things: they didn't have any razors or tea.Overall, this is structurally and location-wise an excellent hotel for the price. If they can improve their customer service, it could truly be an excellent hotel.
