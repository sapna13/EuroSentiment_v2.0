{"text":"Relaxing Vaca! My friend and I stayed at this resort from 5\/3\/08 to 5\/8\/08, I would return to Punta Cana but try a different resort. Apparently it was a long weekend in the countries so it was mobbed around this time, check your calendars or do some research before you book! We were pleased with our stay but it does get a little boring at night because there really is no entertainment- it's more of a relaxing get some drinks and walk around type of resort! Our check in was a disaster, the front desk was very unorganized and rude. There is no check in line or anything so it's basically bombard the front desk until someone sees you. Our room wasn't ready for about an hour b\/c housekeeping was a little slow. I would recommend checking in on a Thursday or Friday b\/c the weekend was mobbed..... Check out wasn't a problem. Get an extra key to your room, they only give you one at check in! We didn't use the safe in the room we were both a little uneasy with leaving money while we were out. The resort and the grounds were gorgeous, very clean! Our room was average nothing special which was fine for us girls! The only problem was the shower ceiling was leaking when someone upstairs was taking a shower... The tv only gets 2 american channels if you want to nap or just hang out in your room, bring an ipod or a portable DVD with some movies if you get tired of being outside! The beach was amazing the water is crystal blue and the sand was so fine and white- loved that part! Bring SPF 50 or higher b\/c you will burn it's a strong kind of sun out that way!!! The workers offer Aerobics and yoga which was very entertaining! All of the workers were nice on the resort always saying hi! The restaurants were very hard to find, we ended up finding them b\/c we walked around one day. There is Japanese, Carribean and Mexican located in the Cafe Domenico they are small restaurants so make reservations quick it gets filled up fast! The buffet was alright you get sick of the same foods everyday but it was fine for us! Pikalo Pizzeria was the best they served pizza and burgers up until 10p if you were hungry or in the mood to snack! The waiters try their hardest to entertain you which was pretty funny but they were really nice! We had great massages, those women worked hard to please us which was very nice! I totally recommend taking a morning or afternoon to go- that was well worth it! There is no shopping unless you take a bus off the resort, we didn't do that seeing that this was our first time in that country. The local stores on the resort were fine for us! The resort offers different things to do at night by taking a bus off the resort for Casino, swimming with the dolphins, excursions and snorkeling however we just went there to relax.... It was a good, relaxing time we definitely needed a break from everyday life but I would try a different resort next time. Oh and bring bug spray and spray those legs I got chewed alive at night! Pack very light your in your bathing suit all day and at night it's a little muggy so sundresses and tanks are the way to go!!! Hope this helped a little....
