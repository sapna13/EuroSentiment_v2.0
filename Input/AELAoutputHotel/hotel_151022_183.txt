{"text":"Great vacation in the Sun We stayed at Natura Park Jan 11-18, 2007 and we had a great time. There is always something to complain about if you want to, but it was definitely a nice resort.We travelled with another family and had 4 children between us (ages 5, 7, 9 11). The kids were feeling a bit too old for the Kids Club but did participate in the Mini Disco show when they could. Petra was nice and did invite the kids to the club. Jimy encouraged the kids to participate in daily activities at the pool and on the beach. He was very friendly. They had sand toys and games by the pool - shuffleboard, mini-golf, bean bag toss etc.The beach did have seaweed. What built up over the day was collected each morning, so it wasn't horrible. There seemed to be more build up on the hotels next door (Allegro, Punta Cana Grand). We spent most of our time at the pool - though the older kids did some snorkelling. It was windy - so the ocean was wavy but the breeze was nice. It did bring in some clouds - and sunshowers, but really only lasted a minute or two.The rooms were average and we got good maid service. We did not use anything in the Mini Bar because we didn't need to. We had plenty of towels, soap etc. We got lots of water in big bottles every day.Don't buy from the vendors (sharks) that come on to the resort. They wear pink\/peach shirts and hound you if you are around the pool. You can get much better deals at the hotel gift shop or if you feel like bargaining there is a market down the beach at the Punta Cana Grand (to the right). But beware, they will all want you to visit their shop for the cheapie, cheapie deals. Just be prepared to haggle or say no. We ate at all the restaurants -including the beach grill and none of us got sick. We liked the smoothie bar at the main buffet. But there was always a wait.The resort was getting busier as our week progressed and we did have to line up for lunch at the main buffet one day (I think they weren't able to clean up tables fast enough) and the pool restaurant was more crowded. But really what is the rush if you are on vacation?DO NOT change any money into Dominican Pesos. Everywhere takes US dollars and you can't change the Pesos back to any other currency. DO NOT take the bus to the Palma Real shopping center. It took over 40 minutes with all the stops at other hotels and there were only 4 stores open. It will be nice when it is done, but give it another year or so.DO take a bun and feed the turtles at the bridge at the front entrance. It is a hoot to watch the turtles, ducks and fish fight for the food. They all seem to come out of nowhere.DO take the country adventure\/safari trip. We went with County Adventures - there are lots of tour companies that do it. You get to see a Dominican home, a school, a sugar plantation, a coffee\/cocoa ranch, have a horsback ride and boogie board at a beautiful beach. (And the requisite stop at a tourist gift shop - with items made in China). The kids really learned a lot about how easy they have it. Also we took some school supplies to leave at the school (pens, pencils, erasers, crayons, notebooks etc). Enough said. Enjoy the quietness of the resort. There are no other attractions (other than a Casino) around, so you will relax. Take sunscreen and bug spray (we did have mosquitos at the Italian a la carte one night - but otherwise none).
