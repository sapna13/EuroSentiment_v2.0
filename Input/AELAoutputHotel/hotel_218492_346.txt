{"text":"This hotel is a 5 stars for facilities but 2 stars for service I was in this hotel from the the 05 march 2007 till 12 march 2007 and i will give you some comments of this hotel.First of all, the hotel has a colonial style as everything is made in wood and infrastructure is very good has there 2 swimming pools, tennis courts, etccc and the rooms are big.and clean. The activities are also well organized.But of course there are some very serious problems for a 5 stars hotel like :- the food is bad, be careful at what you eat as they repeat the same food everyday. For example : day 1 : normal chicken day 2 : the same chichen with sauce day 3 : the same chicken but fried day 4 : the same chicken in salad and so on; I had 2 times belly problems. Be careful also because they want to give tap water on your glass, so ask always bottle waters.- there is no enough parasols on the beach. If you want one, better wake up at 07.00 in the morning; put your towels on the chairs and go back to sleep.- the service on the restaurant is very slow. You can wait till 30 minutes before they bring you your glass or it never comes. Also if they need to repair something in your room, it can take 3 to 4 days (we did not have hot water for 4 days). - the doctor cost s 80 dollars a visit - there are shops int hotel which do not stop to call you and annoying you in order to try to sell you something. Even in the buffet, the waiters try to sell you necklaces and so on. This creates that there are some areas in the complex you want to avoid.etccc..In summary, the hotel facilities can be a 5 stars but the service is really 2 to 3 stars maximum. - ","annotations":[{"endOffset":708,"mention":"salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":703},{"endOffset":708,"mention":"salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":703},{"endOffset":708,"mention":"salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":703},{"endOffset":708,"mention":"salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":703}]}
