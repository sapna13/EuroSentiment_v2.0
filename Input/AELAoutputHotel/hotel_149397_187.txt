{"text":"Beautiful resort, great food, outstanding!! We went to this resort with another couple, aside from all the crazy reviews written. All the photos were amazing, the good reviews were outstanding, and the bad reviews, were mainly over petty things (how long of a wait for room service, etc - are you on vacation or WHAT??)Our experience was absolutely AMAZING! The grounds are beautiful, the staff is friendly, the food choices were incredible... I could go on and on!We were in the Platinum Suites - 2nd bungalow in from the beach - FANTASTIC! The beach was simply stunning - Honestly, on our 3rd day there, we were all wondering about the negative reviews and simply thought they could NOT have stayed at this resort, there must be some mistake!! Not ONE of the complaints that were posted were anything close to being true - and we met others there who read the reviews as well and thought the exact same thing.The food - where can I start?? The choices are abundant - the only tip - book your a la carte dinners the day you get there (or the 2nd day) as they book up fast, but are well worth it! The first restaurant was Mare Norstrum at another Princess resort - and it was FANTASTIC!! We also went to Licey's (which was actually not that great, considering people who don't upgrade to Platinum have to pay $30\/person), Sakura which was great as well, El Gaucho - the steaks were good, as well as the Argentian Salad!! The rooms were great - spacious and clean - flowers left in your room everyday... housekeeping was very friendly!If you are expecting to be waited on hand and foot, with nothing but your favorite, most expensive foods offerend 24\/7, and someone there to wipe your a$$ - definitely stay at home! BUT, if you are looking for great service (yes, sometimes you need to wait a MINUTE for a drink!), great food with lots of selection, beautiful beach, fun pool and friendly service - Bavaro Princess is where to go! We will definitely return!!
