{"text":"Simply Fabulous! (heated towels, great location - what could be better?) While in Paris, I stayed in two different hotels (Hotel Muguet and this one), this being the latter and the better (from 12\/12 - 12\/14\/07). We booked a triple room which came with: 1 double bed, 1 single bed, a flat screen TV (2 English-speaking channels), safe box, and a large-sized-for-Europe bathroom (equipped with standing shower, hair blow dryer and heated towels!!) The only downside to the room is that wireless internet connection is not free. (They sell access cards at the front desk and there is also an internet cafe around the corner from the hotel.) The front-desk folks are extremely nice and helpful!The surrounding area can only be described as perfect! The area is very lively in the evenings and very safe during the day; we did a few morning runs along the River Seine, which is just a stones throw away. Right downstairs from you is a bakery for your morning croissant and coffee. On every street flanking the hotel, around every corner, and across the way are plenty of souvenir and Parisian shops (Etam, Cote a Cote). There are also numerous restaurant choices all around, a French book shop right across the hotel door entrance, and for those aching for a regular sized coffee by American standards, there is even a Starbucks just 2-3 minute walk away (although I preferred the downstairs bakery)!Here is the approximate time\/distance it took us to get to various places from this hotel:Notre Dame Cathedral - 5-10 minute walk (cross the bridge and you're practically there) Monmarte (for the Moulin Rouge) - 15-20 minute cab rideGare du Noir - 20 minute cab rideMetro stop - 1 minute walk (Saint-Michel stop)I would absolutely stay at this hotel again and definitely recommend it!
