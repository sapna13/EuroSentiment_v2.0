{"text":"Not up to the usual Westin standard Booked the hotel for two nights through Starwood, got a very favourable rate at 229 USD per night. When entering the hotel I was forced to let the doorman have my suitcase, even though I really prefer to take it by myself. I tried to check in at noon, but was told that there were no rooms available, and that the check-in time was 3 PM. I went out, and came back at 2:30 PM. I was told again that my room was not ready, so I sat in the lobby waiting for 3 PM. There were several guests waiting for the same. At 3:05 PM I went to the reception again, and was told that my room was not ready. Several guests tried to check-in but everyone was told the same. Then I asked to confirm that 3 PM was check-in time, and the rude receptionist told me that Check-in started FROM 3 PM. I told here that this was nonsense and demanded to speak to the managere. At frist, she would not get me the manager, but I insisted. After 5 minutes the manager came out from his hiding place (behind the reception) and told me that they had a room for me. What's the purpose of this??? I can understand that the hotel have a strict check-in policy and won't check in guests before check-in time. But I do find it rude and aqward what they don't even want to check-in guests AFTER check-in time. Westin did not show any kind of flexibility, so I will not do so either.I got my room on the 26th floor (I think). It was large and airy. It had a large LCD-tv (with a library of on-demand movies) and two very comfortable twin beds. However it was very dark and there was not enough light points. The bathroom was Westin style (e.g. very small, cold and crampy). The bathtub was too small to have a proper bath in. I do find the bed heavenly, but the bathroom is not heavenly by any means! I had a nice view over Times Square and Empire State Building, which was very nice. The housekeeping is highly inconsistent. My room was not serviced for turn-down service the first night. And my room was not serviced the following morning either. I returned to my room at 6 pm, and found my room to be just like I left it in the morning. I called the housekeeping and complained.However, the hotel is TOO big and TOO inpersonal for my taste. There are huge lines everywhere, and the hotel are not capable to offer their guests tabels at the restaurants or the bar, cause everything is full. The public areas of the hotel are well kept, shiny and nice, but it looks like a mall and are very business oriented. The location of this hotel is GREAT, just one block from Times Square. Many restaurants and shops at the doorstep.I will not return to the Westin again. New York City have a lot of other and better options. But you should definately go with Westin if you can get a rate like I did.
