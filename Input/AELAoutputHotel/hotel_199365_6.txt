{"text":"awesome hotel Decided on the upstalboom after reading a few reviews and them being the only hotel with a triple room.We got to the upstalboom just before midnight to be greeted by a smiley receptionist very quick and easy check in. The room was Big with two single beds and one fold out sofa bed. The bathroom was basic with toilet and shower(no bath) and a washing basin. Our highlight was the fridge it was HUGE and we could fit all our alcohol in it.Breakfast-Really good, good choice of cold cuts\/cheeses, Cereals different types of breads. Hot foods sausages\/eggs\/hashbrowns. Lots of different choices of teas and juices. Fresh cakes-i recommend the cheesecake if you are so lucky to get some. We didnt it went really quickly and they didnt bring out anymore.There is a gym and sauna room which i didnt use but had a look at. very basic gym and small sauna room. Internet terminal we read was free didnt manage to use it as they had a private function in the room you need to go through to get to the terminal. It also has a printer too. Unfortunatly the thing we were looking forward to most is the roof terrace bar but it was closed due to cold weather and snow.Otherwise everything in hotel was good and for the price you couldnt ask for a better hotel in a great location.We found it easier to get the the hotel from Warschaser Strabe (5-10mins walk), which has all the S\/U Bahn lines so easy to get to from the airport.Lots of bars and restaurants nearby on Simon Dach Strabe.
