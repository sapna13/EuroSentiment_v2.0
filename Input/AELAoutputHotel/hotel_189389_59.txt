{"text":"Excellent Experience We stayed at the Grand Amsterdam for four nights the end of July, en route from the U.S. to Africa. I had done a lot of internet research on hotels and prices, and this looked perfect - and it was. We have three teenage children and so needed two rooms, which really increases the cost of lodging -- but still wanted a four or five star experience. As noted by the other readers, this hotel is lovely, professional and comfortable, and treated our children with as much respect as they did adults. We had one courtyard room (junior suite, with room for a single bed in the small tv\/changing room), which was wonderfully quiet, and a canal room which had minimal noise. The deciding factor for us in choosing this hotel was that it is air conditioned, and this proved to be important - it was quite hot the week we were there, and to come back to an air conditioned room after walking for hours, and look out over a beautiful, tree and flower filled courtyard, was lovely. Friends of ours stayed at one of the canal hotels, which they found quite charming but quite hot. We wanted to arrive in Africa well-rested, and air conditioning made sleeping much more comfortable. I found a very good rate on premierhotels.com, which included breakfast - breakfast is very expensive separately, and we would not have done it otherwise, but it turned out to be one of those experiences that really make a travel day. It is a comprehensive buffet with fresh orange juice and incredible hot chocolate, and was a wonderful way to start the day. It also allowed us to eat a light tea\/snack in early afternoon, and then a more substantial dinner. We had both tea and lunch in the courtyard restaurant, and both were excellent - although a little pricey. Even though we booked through an internet website and I was anxious about every aspect of the reservation, we had absolutely no problems, including with the price. It's still a good idea to bring written confirmation, though, since it makes it easier for everyone when you're holding an actual document. As for location, the red light district literally began at the end of the block, but there was almost no spill-over of activity, and it was easy to avoid it. We did walk the edges a number of times, and it provided a great opportunity for our small-town kids to see another side of life and a very natural way for us to talk with them more about those kinds of activities. I would definitely stay at the Grand again, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a wide range of people.
