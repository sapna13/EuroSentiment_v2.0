{"text":"Best location in CBD The Radisson Plaza Hotel was a great hotel. Less than 200 m from the Wynyard train station and less than a 10 minute walk to Circular Quay. Many restaurants are located near the hotel. You could not beat the location!Check-in was very easy. My room was not ready when I arrived at 7 AM, but they stored my luggage and let me take a shower in the health club (a nice thing after the overnight flight from Los Angeles).Rooms were quiet and comfortable. There wasn't much of a view from the room, but you didn't hear any road noise below. I stayed on the club level and the full breakfast was good.The business centre was not staffed, but I was able to use the computers whenever I needed. There is a small fee to use the Internet, but it is much cheaper than the Internet access in the rooms if you aren't using your personal computer for long periods of time.The concierge was very helpful with restaurant suggestions.Bilson's restaurant is located within the hotel and is one of only seven Sydney restaurants to be given the three hat award by the Sydney Herald. It was expensive but well worth the experience. The staff were wonderful and friendly.The only complaint I had was with the health club. Some of the exercise equipment was not properly maintained, and there was a wait for to use some of the new machines. No equipment was provided to clean up after workouts and there was only the large bottle of water available for hydration. The pool, spa and steamroom were all clean.I would certainly stay here again if I ever traveled back to the Sydney area.
