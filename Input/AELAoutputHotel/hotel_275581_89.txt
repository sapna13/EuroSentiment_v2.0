{"text":"Nice modern hotel. I stayed there with my wife for 3 nights on 24-27July. The hotel is modern, very clean and has internet connection in rooms with no extra charge as well as iMac TV\/monitor and computer keaybord + mouse so you can use it as a TV, quick London information source and a computer. The rooms are air-conditioned. We got a room on early arrival (11.00 am) and there was no problem to deposit the luggage for late departure. The size of the room and bathroom was just OK. There is no special place to put the suitcases on but you can live with it for a few days stay. The hotel is quite large with lots of guests but there is enough polite people at the reception to handle it. Plug adaptors are available at the reception, so you do not have to worry about plug-in of your devices. The buffet breakfest is not bad. People who like continental breakfasts will be fully satisfied. You can have full English breakfast, if you like. The quiet location is a plus but it takes 7 minutes walk to the nearest pub, 10 minutes walk to the nearest tube station Pimlico of Victoria Line. However there is a bus stop nearby where every 10-12 minutes there is a double-decker bus 88 (daily travel cards for all transport accepted) by which you can get to Oxford Circus through Trafalgar Square and Picadilly Circus. In view of low standard of the majority of hotels in London (even those 5*), this hotel is a very good choice.
