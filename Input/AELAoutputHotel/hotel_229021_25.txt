{"text":"Good Hotel, but we ended up in a bad room This hotel is in amazing location: It's a couple of minutes from the Duomo in one direction and Piazza della Signoria and the Uffizi gallery in the other direction. It's about 10 minutes from the Ponte Vecchio and about 15 minutes from the train station (with luggage in tow). I can't say enough about the perfect location.The hotel itself is very nice as well: It's bright, clean, and inviting. The breakfast was in a very nice room, and it was quite good: There was eggs and bacon every morning in addition to the standard cold-cuts, rolls, yogurts, fruit, etc. The server in the breakfast room even had our cappucino \/ tea orders after a couple of days. The only really bad thing I can say about the hotel was the room that we ended up in. We stayed in room 101, which is immediately next to the kitchen. Starting at 6am every morning, the kitchen is a hub of activity, and the sounds were quite loud in our room. I would imagine that our room is the only room in the hotel that suffered from this problem, as there were no other rooms immediately next to the kitchen. We probably should have simply asked for another room, but we were in a supermarket the second day and saw ear-plugs, so we just picked them up. We slept just fine with the ear plugs. The room was quite nice. It was large and the bathroom was modern and clean. The service in the hotel was OK - no one was super friendly, but they did memorize our room number, and they did memorize our drink orders for breakfast. Overall, this hotel gets great marks for location, above average marks for cleanliness, and the only real detraction was the sound from the kitchen next door. If all of the rooms were next to the kitchen, I would have given it 2*. But since we were in the only room next to the kitchen, it gets 4*.
