{"text":"Probably the greatest...... ...hotel in all of Berlin !This is a special hotel. Established in 1907, it was severely damaged by bombs in the latter stages of World War II. The Adlon familiy (in concert with Kempinski hotel) re-developed this hotel after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the new Adlon opened for business in 1997. The new hotel takes much of its inspiration from the old hotel, which was steeped in history. The first film contract to involve Marlene Dietrich as an actress was signed in the Adlon. And Bertolt Brecht stayed and worked in some of the surviving rooms of the hotel in the late 1940s.The hotel corridors are unlike any I have ever experienced. The floors are covered in white marble and diamond-style rugs, the walls are also a marbled white. The whole effect is to give an impression of openness and brightness. An intriguing contrast to the more claustraphobic corridors I have encountered elsewhere. Even the elevators have been designed to look exactly as they would have looked back in 1907 (albeit with the benefit of more efficient working technology).The bedrooms are a beguiling mix of new and old. A bedside finger-touch lighting system and up to date hi-fi speakers in the bathroom are coupled with Art Deco style furniture and prints from an earlier era. The bedroom is so intriguingly old world that staying there feels like travelling back in time. The experience of being in historically-styled surroundings was so surreal that there were times when I felt I was in the film version of Agatha Christie's At Bertram's Hotel. The emphasis in the Adlon is on comfort and the beds have a wraparound quality to them which encourages night-time hibernation (especially in sub-zero climes).The lobby of the hotel is truly a jewel. It serves a mouth-watering afternoon tea. But, in addition to this, a tasty supply of meals and snacks is available until late in the evening. I had the wiener schnitzel, pommes frites and cucumber salad, washed down with a couple of Jupiter pilseners. A simple repast. But everything in the hotel is cooked to perfection and arrives soon after you have ordered it. And the service is out of this world.If you stay here, check out the ground floor restaurant. If you're lucky (like I was), they'll give you a table overlooking the Brandenburg Gate. There's something quite cool about munching on breakfast and having one of Germany's most iconic monuments in your line of vision at the same time. A great place for daydreaming.
