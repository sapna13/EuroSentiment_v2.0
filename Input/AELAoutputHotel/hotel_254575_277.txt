{"text":"So Many Good Things ... We just returned last night from our second trip to London. The Luna  Simone Hotel was a great experience.We love Belgravia and stayed there last year (in another hotel), so the neighborhood felt like home. The room was very nice, although not overly large, which we expected. However, it was roomy enough for our purposes and both the room and the bath were immaculate. The bath was fine, with a roomy shower and lots of hot water in the morning.Peter and Bernard and staff are welcoming and friendly and ready to answer any questions, no matter how small. I had requested a room on a lower floor due to some slight mobility problems on my part, and my request was noted in the reservation and we were put into Room 2, at the back of the hotel. Very quiet.Breakfast each day was hot and filling and served very quickly. The breakfast choices were fine with us and the coffee was hot, strong and delicious! (That's important for us -- we're morning coffee people and it helps us get started on the day).Bus 24 stops right outside the hotel and can take you to many of the places you will probably want to go. Excellent restaurants just steps away, Boots just around the corner and Victoria\/Pimlico stations a few minutes walk away.BUT ... there was one thing that we didn't find enjoyable. The beds were VERY hard. Not just firm, but hard. This being our first experience with the hotel, we weren't sure if all the beds were this way, but the twin beds in our room were on the verge of being uncomfortable. However, we enjoyed the hotel so much in other respects that we actually contemplated bringing an inflatable mattress on the next trip. More comfortable beds would have made the stay a 10 instead of a 9.All in all, our experience here was positive and I can recommend the hotel without reservation. This may be the best value in London.You will not be treated nicer in any other establishment, and that is something we are sure of.
