{"text":"Awesome!! We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess from Jan 7-12, 2008. I'll I can say is we can't wait to go back. I travelled with my husband, my son and his girlfriend. We all had a great time and can't wait to go back. From the staff to the accomodations, everything was perfect. I liked that this resort is adults only, no kids jumping in the pool, etc. Very relaxing, the staff cannot do enough for you, from helping you decide on which excursion to do (we asked the staff for alot of advise on what to do, they were extremely helpful) to climbing up a tree to get you a fresh coconut! The food at the buffet was pretty good. We never went hungry, but we definately enjoyed the al a carte restaurants more. The Tex Mex Steakhouse and La Cava were incredible. Bring a sweater for the restaurants, they are air conditioned. The swim-up bar with Nelson was great. He makes the best Coco Locos, as well as BananaMamas. Once he was off shift, I stopped ordering Coco Locos, no one else can make them like him! Also, don't forget to visit Emelio at the Lobby Bar. He puts on an awesome show, as well as pouring some really good drinks.We did a sport fishing excursion, using Mikes Marina as our contact. We booked a half day, and though the fishing was pretty slow at first, we ended up catching 3 Dorado (Mahi Mahi). My husband is still smiling thinking about the experience!Our kids did a sunset horseback ride on the beach and said that it was great! Overall, no complaints. We meet alot of wonderful people from Canada, which we hope to keep in contact with. Americans were certainly in the minority here, but that was not a problem for us.If you are on the fence about this resort, don't hesitate. The only thing keeping me from booking again right now is we have told so many people about it, and they all want to come down with us, we are juggling too many schedules at this point. We may just have to book it and say to the rest come if you can! ","annotations":[]}
