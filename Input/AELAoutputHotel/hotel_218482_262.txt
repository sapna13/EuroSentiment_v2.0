{"text":"When can I go back????? We stayed at the Catalonia Bavaro All Inclusive Resort from April 22nd to April 27th. All I have to say was that it just wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ long enough! We had an absolutely wonderful time and met a lot of fun people. We did not do any excursions √à√\u2020\u2022?only enjoyed the wonderful pool and the beach and took advantage of all of the food and drinks we could fill our bellies with. We were concerned about the weather when we checked the reviews and the forecast before we left. It only rained for about 20-30 minutes on Wednesday morning and then again for 20 minutes later in the day. We couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ complain. We both came back with great tans and great memories. We ate at the Beach Party on Monday which was mediocre √à√\u2020\u2022?we were slightly disappointed. We expected it to be on the beach but it was on the patio and very chaotic. We just figured it was because they had a lot of rain and weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ sure of the weather conditions that night. We ate at Mikado (Japanese restaurant) which was overall the best √à√\u2020\u2022?good food, good service, good time with our table at the hibachi. The next night we ate at the French restaurant. I liked mine (grilled lobster), my boyfriend√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ meal was OK. He had lobster thermadore with melted cheese. The following night we ate at the Steakhouse. We both had T-Bone steaks (we were a little worried when we ordered but figured we could still make the buffet if we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like it.) Let me tell you √à√\u2020\u2022?they were cooked perfectly and tasted pretty close to a good ole American steak on the grill. We had no trouble scarfing it down! The waiter messed up our appetizer order but it was no biggie √à√\u2020\u2022?we had more than enough to eat. We both got the red raspberry cheesecake and that made up for the mixed up appetizer. Hope this review helped √à√\u2020\u2022?I hope you have as wonderful of a time as we did.If you have any questions, you can e-mail me at: kendraj@wcnet.orgResort √à√\u2020\u2022?3.5Rooms √à√\u2020\u2022?3Check-in- 3.5Check-out- 4Pool √à√\u2020\u2022?4Beach √à√\u2020\u2022?4Beach Party Buffet - 2Mikado - 4French √à√\u2020\u2022?3Steakhouse √à√\u2020\u2022?3.5Breakfast Buffet √à√\u2020\u2022?4Lunch Buffet √à√\u2020\u2022?2.5 ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1764,"mention":"cheesecake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cheesecake"],"startOffset":1754},{"endOffset":1764,"mention":"cheesecake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cheesecake"],"startOffset":1754},{"endOffset":1764,"mention":"cheesecake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cheesecake"],"startOffset":1754},{"endOffset":1764,"mention":"cheesecake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cheesecake"],"startOffset":1754},{"endOffset":1764,"mention":"cheesecake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cheesecake"],"startOffset":1754}]}
