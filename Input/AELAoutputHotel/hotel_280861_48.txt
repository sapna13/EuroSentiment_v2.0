{"text":"Basic budget hotel near the Fira Stayed here for 4 nights during a large conference which was at the nearby Barcelona Fira.On the positive side, the hotel was 15 minutes walk or 2 metro stops from the Fira. I can't oversate enough the importance of this when you see the hundreds of people queuing for taxis outside the Fira main gates at 7pm.My room was on 6th floor in the main part of the hotel (not the part accessed through the car park!). The room faced the main road, which could be noisy if you are not used to traffic noise. On the whole, it was not a problem, apart from one night where a large number of people were gathered on the far side of the road making a lot of noise at 5am. My guess is that it was closing time of some nearby nightclub!The hotel is also within easy walking distance to Las Ramblas. The fact that the hotel is on a main road means a good supply of taxis driving past at all times.Had drinks  tapas in the adjoining bar one evening. The tapas were nothing special but by no means offensive! The friendly staff make sure you are well looked after - in fact I still have one of their cigarette lighters!Would I stay here again? - Yes, if I was at another work event at the Fira. Would I book it for a weekend break I was organising myself - no chance, unless that is all your budget can stretch to!
