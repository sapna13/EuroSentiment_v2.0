{"text":"First time all inclusive I would agree with most of the comments from sc00by-doo therefore I will only comment on other points.We accompanied two other recently retired couples flying out of T.O. on Skyservice Airbus 320 organized by Nolitours.Flight:Great service from Skyparx delivered us to the terminal in plenty of time. If you are on the tall side, ask for the seats next to the emergency exits over the wings. Food consisted of a sub-like sandwich, dessert bar and small container of water. You pay for alcohol. Earpieces cost $3 if we listened to the on-board movie but were free on the return trip. Merchandise can be purchased duty-free i.e. Bicardi (1.4L) for $18 CDN and Crown Royal (750 mL) for $18 CDN. It can also be ordered for delivery on the return flight.Airport\/TransferArrived at 11:30 p.m. Luggage was quickly processed and our transfer mini-bus was ready to go. It was an HOUR long trip around more pot holes than roads. Some of our members used Gravol to ease the experience. Just remember this is a country that is desperately trying to improve. Our tourist dollars might help.Arrival At 12;30 p.m. there was a buffet ready for us. Our suite (pool view) was clean. Everything worked, including the two TV's.The staff at the front desk spoke English (as well as other languages)TippingWe tended to tip our room person more than others. Our tourist agent suggested that purchases from the dollar store as well as cash might be in order. We brought things that might be suitable for children as well as adults.FoodThe buffets provided a variety of foods for all meals. Be prepared for digestive disturbances. Some of our friends depended on Immodium which they brought along with sunscreen. We were entitled to 2 ala cartes but we had three. Of the three, Italian, Steak and Mediterranean restaurants , we preferred the Mediterranean for its food and service. Reserve early and be on time. ExcursionsWe looked for the excursion with the shortest transfer distance so it was the Sunset cruise. We enjoyed a half hour of snorkeling. Some brought their own equipment. Lots of alcohol was available. The cruise included an on shore lobster dinner.Several of our group had digestive troubles after this day. There are many other excursions available which vendors sell near the front desk. These vendors speak many languages. Sign up early.Beach\/PoolDespite what some have said, you will need to reserve a loungeif you hope to have a padded one or one with a synthetic mesh. It appears that people respect a towel on the lounge as an indication of a reserve sign. People will keep the same lounge all day. We kept our towel all week as they were not always available. Remember that a tube or SPF 30 sunscreen costs $18 US at the resort for something that costs $9 CDN. Even with waterproof sunscreen, I still had a tan. If you are bringing children, don't forget to prepare them for toplessnessShopping There is a small mall at the resort that consists of a variety type store, a first aid station and a store that sold local wares. A local store owner about 5 minutes from the resort will pay for your taxi ride if you shop at no other store. The prices for jewelry appeared reasonable. The beach vendors are friendly and expect you to barter. They also like to collect tourist's hats. So why not barter.Children's Play areaOn the way to the small mall, there is a building that houses a play area consisting of a pool and badminton table and other games.In all, we thought that the staff performed their duties very well. Many of the room staff do not speak English so a Buenos dias or a Buenas noches or a Ola helps to bridge the gap.
