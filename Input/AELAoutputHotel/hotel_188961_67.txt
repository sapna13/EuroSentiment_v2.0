{"text":"41=100% Hotel 41 definitely deserves the five-star rating. The entrance is situated right next to the Reubens (actually, above the Reubens, on the 5th floor), having a private, key-card access. In fact, it is part of the Red Carnation\/Reubens hotel chain. It is all of a 5-minute walk over to Victoria Station and directly across from the Mews. We found the room was more than lovely; they surprised us by upgrading our room at no additional charge. Two types of robes, full-length mirror, flat-screen TV, everything from shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, toothbrush  toothpaste, hair-dryer, iron, ironing board,lemon  water, and other miscellaneous ammenities plus the complimentary Plunder the Pantry as well as the demeanor of the staff put this boutique hotel up at the top in our book. Oh, another thing that was complimentary were free passes to the gym nearby--LA Fitness Center.There is no question that 41is on the pricey side, but all things considered, I think you get what you pay for. There certainly were no surprises in the end-price by tacked-on additional charges which weren't known when booking. We liked the breakfast--the food was hot and delicious and fresh. There are also complimentary computers, so you don't necessarily have to bring one, and newspapers and a welcome drink--choice of champagne, wine, juice, or whatever. The staff treats you like you want to be treated and are genuinely interested in each guest, even remembering your name. Rooms are extremely quiet and peaceful. At night when the beds are turned down, they even put a small water candle in the bathroom. If you are a single female traveler, you cannot ask for a more perfect place as it is so centrally-situated, safe, and peaceful. I asked the manager whether it's better to book online or by phone, and he said by Internet as that has the better prices. They have a 'lowest fare' guarantee where if you do find a price better than the one you already have, they will honor the lower price. I was surprised to see somewhat negative comments by other travelers concerning 41 as we experienced only top-rated service, attention, andsatisfaction. However, 41 is certainly not cheap and if you have a weakening American dollar, the price per night can turn you off. Do think again, though, as to how to budget. If you are able to do a splurge on your hotel room, you can always find ways to save on funds through eating cheap and traveling via the Tube--even to and from Heathrow. On one of the days of our stay there, we stayed in during the entire morning and into the early afternoon instead of fighting the crowds outside. Just 'hanging around' like that made our whole stay even moreenjoyable and gave us a bit more mileage for what we paid.
