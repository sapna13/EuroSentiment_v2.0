{"text":"Good break Amsterdam was OK for a weekend break - reasonably tacky, but tacky can be fun ! Loads of nice restaurants, and the native Dutch themselves are really friendly (can't say the same about all the nationalities there). Downside was graffiti everywhere, and by our fourth day (we were flying back in the evening) we were pretty bored as we had really done all the local sights and would have had to start travelling further afield. The shopping is pretty dull. So a two or three day trip max is good, unless you are planning on travelling outside of Amsterdam.The Hotel Nadia was nice and adequate for our purposes. Again, the staff were really friendly, and the room, although really small and dark, was comfortable and clean - the bathroom was very clean and well maintained, which was good.Nadia is well located - close to the shops and central Amsterdam, so we walked most places. Took the tram out to the museum quarter, which was a quiet area, so I'm glad we were more central.If we could ask for an improvement, then it would be stronger ligghting in the bedroom (we had a 'delux' room - number 5) and a more varied breakfast. Croissants and bread everyday gets boring fast. Again, adequate, but some fruit, yoghurt and cereals wouldn't go amiss.All in all, Nadia is a comfortable, safe hotel in a good location at a not unreasonable cost. Get past the initial impression that the front door gives you and the small bedroom, and you'll end up feeling that it is OK. We would stay here again without any problem.
