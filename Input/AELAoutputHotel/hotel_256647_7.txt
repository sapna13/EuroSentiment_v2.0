{"text":"Good views The rooms were very comfortable. We booked two king rooms with views over sydney airport which was very nice. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was spacious. The rooms were very clean. The parking is a bit of a nightmare. If you want the hotel to park it for you its $15 each time you need to use the car. Otherwise its $10 per night. Even though we had one car each of us were charged for parking per day. This became very costly over a few days. We ordered room service which was fresh and came to the room fast. Make sure you find the card on the bedside table to use the 20% off each meal in the hotel if you dont get your room made up every night. We didnt notice it till it was too late. We had the seafood buffet. Although it was nice I dont think it was worth the money. The prawns were a bit slimey and the crab had no flavour. I strongly suspect that everything was not as fresh as it should have been. The smoked salmon and salads were delicious. There was great variety of desserts. We tried many of them however some were stale and not very nice to eat. The service here was not very good at all. Overall we did enjoy this trip but then when we reviewed the bill at home we found that we had been charged for mini bar items we did not consume. This left a bad feeling so I guess I would try somewhere else in the future.
