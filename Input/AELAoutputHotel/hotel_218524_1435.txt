{"text":"Best vacation ever - don't believe the lies..... Returned from trip at Secrets Excellence. Have done a good bit of traveling  truthfully was worried based on the reviews, well seriously...........it's totally not true! I'll break down the categories:Cleanliness: Excellent- never did I look up  not see someone cleaning- VERY CLEAN! Yes, there were some ants  a few rodents, but you're in the Caribbean. But, never did I feel like I wasn't clean.Pool: Clean  absolutely breathtaking. The view was speechless  the swim up bar was awesome! Also, there are lights on at night  if they forget to turn them on- just ask.......... Whirlpool was nice, but not hot at all, but still relaxing  romantic!Food: Loved, loved, loved the Bordeaux-- Again, I have traveled a lot  the food there was awesome. El Patio - great, Himitsu- good, World cafe- good\/great; Seaside Grill - great; Oceana- good. Restaurants were hot at night, but again.........you're in the Caribbean. Just wear cool clothes, eat late, drink  enjoy! Paid extra for the romantic dinner on the beach  it was worth every penny! Food was some of the best that I've ever had! Lobster was cooked perfectlySpa: very nice, but wouldn't recommend doing a lot of things. Maybe one or two would be perfect. Its can get expensive. Definetly recommend the midnight massage- it was perfect! Activities: Hotel has a lot of things going on every hour or so; great entertainment staff  highly recommend the Michael Jackson and Ideal Couple!! The couple who won that night was awesome!!!!Drinks: great flavor  not too weak (like people said). Just ask them to make it stronger if you'd like. They're always bringing around drinks  truly making it effortless for you! No need for an insulated cup, just drink it  order more. Rooms: Clean, but the mattress is firm. Good for some, not for others- just drink some wine  sleep people! Tip your staff though, a dollar or two goes a long way. These people are extremely poor!Excellence Club: Not sure if I'd do this again. Believe me, it was nice to have the food at anytime (buffet style), congerie assistance all the time, but really all the rooms are nice  everyone is helpful, so maybe this money is best spent elsewhere. Overall: Had a fabulous time  felt the price was truly a steal. If you're considering going to this resort, just do it! You won't regret it. Keep in mind that someone is always complianing about something. With many travel miles behind my belt, this is one of the best OVERALL resorts that I've ever attended. ENJOY! DEFINETLY VISIT THE SECRETS EXCELLENCE - PUNTA CANA- YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
