{"text":"Fun in San Juan The Marriott Stellaris is a very good choice in San Juan. We stayed for 4 nights in late July and had an excellent time. After a quick ride from the airport we arrived at the Marriott and although we were hours early were promptly given a room. I upgraded to ocean view and wow, it was quite a view from up on the 14th floor, very impressive. Room was average size but very clean, tasteful and comfortable. Pool was nice with kind of a strange layout but I think the big attraction at the Marriott was the beach. Hotel provides umbrellas and chairs (don't forget to tip the kid setting them up-it looked like a tough job digging those holes in the sand all day!) so you can just relax and enjoy the beautiful water.As far as restaurants we had breakfast at the hotel, very good selection for the buffet but pricey ($40 for 2 people) and ate at the Japanese place (tasty). There are plenty of places nearby on Ashford Ave. so go out and explore. Ajili Mojili was a walk away and recommended for Puerto Rican food. Also, for dessert make sure to hit the gelato place across the street from the Marriott....so many choices of flavors!Overall we would definitely go back to the Marriott. The staff, without exception, was friendly and the hotel was a very cool scene on weekend nights with live entertainment and dancing. Casino was good sized, fun, and a pleasant way to spend the evening. This is one of the best choices in san Juan for a vacation getaway.
