{"text":"Surreal architecture in the jungle.... It is difficult to be critical of this hotel. It is run to perfection, the service is first class, the location is beautiful, the rooms are comfortable, the food is good but√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®√î??\u201A√á¬®?The architecture has been mentioned in other reviews and it really is something you like or don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ and I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ. A previous reviewer planted an idea in my head about the entrance to the rooms feeling like entering a (albeit incredibly posh) public toilet and he was spot on. Once in however the outside living room (we were in a river view suite) was amazing and all the amenities were as you would wish. There was lots of space and total privacy. We got plenty of sun during the day here.Mention has been made of the rafters going by however for us they were not a problem √à√\u2020\u2022?there were only around half a dozen that passed while we were in the room and if we were in our lounge or on the sun loungers we could not see them and they could not see us √à√\u2020\u2022?their screams just made us smile and only lasted a few seconds. (Villa 18). This room was also good as it was within easy walking distance of the main pool, the informal caf√ã√\u2022√ñ and the spa and gym √à√\u2020\u2022?no need for a buggy.I was disappointed with the view √à√\u2020\u2022?I had expected rice paddies and panoramas and in fact beyond the river was just jungly forest √à√\u2020\u2022?which was very high and took a lot of light. The hotel is actually in the river valley so everything feels kind of down rather than up!!! For this reason if I were returning I would consider a room in the main building or request one of the villas overlooking the rice paddies which would have more light. Also the river water rushing by was a great noise but it was definitely a noise. We were on a package that included a 1 hour Balinese massage. This was the best massage of our trip by a mile. It was in the spa area next to the gym which is not quite as restful as other spas so I would probably recommend if you were paying for it to go to one of the spa villas. The treatment rooms (I surmise) are under the restaurant and it was annoying to hear the scraping of tables and chairs being moved around just as you were relaxing into a stupor. Every day there is a free trek to the nearby (very) paddy fields which was pretty and good fun. Be prepared to get your trainers muddy if you slip.Super breakfast, the light food in the restaurant by the pool was excellent (fajitas yummy) but the main restaurant was just OK. We ate at the Amandari one night (free transfers between the two hotels) and for us it was head and shoulders ahead on food.Perfectish√à√\u2020\u2022? just lost by being slightly corporate, slightly without heart and slightly dark.
