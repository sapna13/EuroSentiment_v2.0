{"text":"Clean Place, Friendly Staff I won a bid for this hotel thru Priceline for $75\/night.Most sites rate this hotel 3-star, Tripadvisor rate this 2-star.Hotel exterior looks old, but once you step in, it's a different story. The lobby is bright and clean and spacious.Parking was ~$20 per 24-hour. Its valet.I had a good experience, because they upgraded us to Tokyo Executive Room. What a surprise even I booked this thru Priceline. Apparently, there were two groups of tour (from Japan I guess) checked in before us (We checked in really late night), thus all standard\/deluxe rooms had been taken, we got an upgrade.The room was very good, bed very comfy, nice decor, given that I only paid $75 for an executive room in downtown LA, it was a very good deal. But I am not sure if I would say the same thing if I was in a standard room.Due to the fact that the hotel was fully booked that night, the problem was, there was not enough hot water. And that is the only thing I would complain. Water from the shower head was not strong and water wasn't even warm... I managed to finish my shower. When it was my boyfriend's turn, hot water was all gone, we called the front desk and ask for help. They allowed him to shower @ the Spa with no charge. Surpringsly, Spa has unlimited hot water for him to enjoy! and he also used the sauna. His experience was OK.Staff were all very friendly, except for one lady. They all put on a smile and tried their best to make you happy. Neighbourhood was good. Felt very safe @ late night. I am a Chinese and love Japanese food, the area has a lot of choices! Overall, this is a good hotel, and I would consider going back if I win this thru priceline again.
