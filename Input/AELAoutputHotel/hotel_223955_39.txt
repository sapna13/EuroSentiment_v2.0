{"text":"Wonderful, Modern, Lovely Stay We spent two nights at the Courtyard in San Francisco and really enjoyed our stay. The staff was polite and very accomadating. Our room (we were in a king suite) was perfect for our family. It had a large sitting room with a modern-looking sofa bed, lounging sofa (which also could be made into a bed), as well as a large seperate bedroom with a king and a bathroom with two sinks, as well as a seperate shower\/toilet area. The sitting room had a nice LCD, flatscreen, TV in it, and the bedroom also had a TV. The pool was nice and kept clean and the exercise room was well equipped with great workout machines (each of the treadmills, stairsteppers and bicycles had there own TVs built into them). We ate breakfast at Jasmine's on both days of our stay. The buffet was always fresh and delicious. The location is in the business district of San Francisco, but we walked to the farmer's market and piers, but it was a bit of a hoof . For those who aren't walkers, cable cars and buses are a short stroll from the front entrance. For those not wanting to eat at the hotel restaurant, San Francisco has great cuisine that definitely needs to be had. During our visits to the city in the past, we've enjoyed great Chinese food (China Town), as well as lots of other ethinic types. Across the street from the Courtyard is a great Indian restaurant whose name I forget, but it's literally across the street and can't be missed. In the Ferry Building in the Slanted Door. We decided to dine at this hip Thai restaurant. It was delicious. It's not cheap, but we found it definitely worth the splurge. The Courtyard is very up to date with wonderful staff and all at relatively good price. We'll be back!
