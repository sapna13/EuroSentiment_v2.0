{"text":"disappointing Having read the reviews on Trip Advisor when I was planning my trip to Majestic Colonial, Punta Cana, I was really looking forward to my vacation there. Unfortunately I was very disappointed.The concierge staff was very matter of fact and the staff of the hotel was not friendly. The rooms were very spacious but you have no privacy at all because the bathrooms are wide open (NO WALL OR DOORS) and if you should want to get up in the middle of the night you will wake everyone in your room. The toilet bowl is in an enclosed area 2 feet by 3 feet (this is not an exageration), a big person will have great difficulty manuvering. The refrigerator in the room did not refrigerate any thing. After a rain storm we had a leak in the room. They claim to have seven restaurants but what they really have are three restaurants and two huge buffet restaurants all severely understaffed. The food however is the same where ever you go and is mediocre. My all family got food poisoning and we spent the last three days of our vacation throwing up. A bottle of sun tan lotion is $28.00. 75% of the people who go to the theatre can not see the stage; if you want a decent seat you must get there one hour before the show and since the shows are very amaturish, it is not worth the time invested. We decided to take a Safari Tour with a company called TURINTER; it was a total rip off and at one point we were attacked by some haitian sugar plantation workers brandishing machetes and demanding tips. The tour guide never intervened to protect the members of his group. If you are going with children there is a $70,00 a day fee for each child to enter the childrens park. Although the beach was ok. (nothing spectacular) I would have enjoied it more if I din't have to explain to my children why a number of women were topless. We should have been warned about that. ","annotations":[]}
