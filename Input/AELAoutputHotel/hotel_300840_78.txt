{"text":"Not convinced about the Marco Polo We stayed at the Marco Polo from 12\/9 to 17\/9 2006. On check in we were extremely frustrated (especially after travelling such a long distance from the UK) that they had allocated us a twin smoking room. We then entered into a rather protracted and tired conversation to try and obtain a double room (as this is what had been booked and it was our honeymoon!) and a non-smoking room. At one point we were told we would have to wait a further 2-3 hours to check in to get such a room (we arrived at about 4.30pm which was not particularly early) but the reception desk then managed to find us a room. Unfortunately the whole experience tainted the start of our visit as we didn't really feel as if they were trying to help us - if we hadn't had pushed so hard for the room change i doubt we would have got anything out of them. The rooms were spacious (though we ended up with two single beds pushed together with two single duvets!) and well equipped but overall the hotel lacked an ambience. Ok it did everything it was supposed to do, the location is great for the harbour view (make sure you get one of these rooms as it is amazing) and it has great access to the star ferry which takes you into central hong kong. There are also some nice restaurants next door in the shopping centre which offer a great view over the harbour which is great at night. Overall a good hotel but it lacks ambience and character, and, the check in experience left a lot to be desired. ","annotations":[]}
