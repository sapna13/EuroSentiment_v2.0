{"text":"Has Potential, But Needs MUCH Improvement This hotel needs some work. A lot of work, actually. It's obvious they are trying to do just that, but in the meantime, the rooms are very, very outdated. The furnishings and amenities are way behind what we've come to expect in a hotel at $400\/night. The doors, trim, air conditioning vents, balcony railing and plumbing fixtures are all in really awful, outdated condition. They should have been updated 10 years ago -- they are *well* beyond their prime. If you are accustomed to seeing flat panel TV's, contemporary furniture and duvets on the beds, this is definitely not the hotel for you.On the plus side, the beds are comfortable, the rooms are spacious and nicely arranged (other than the bathroom, which is the smallest hotel bathroom I've seen in years.) The beach access is fantastic and the beach itself is very nice. The view from the oceanview rooms is not going to be beat. There are a few restaurants (ie: other hotel restaurants) within walking distance, which is a nice plus, and the restaurants in the hotel (with the exception of the downstairs breakfast restaurant) are nice.The worst part of this hotel is that they had our email address since the day I made the reservation several months ago and we were never notified about the pool renovations. That is really an unacceptable oversight. (And I am probably being generous in calling this an 'oversight.') I cannot even begin to imagine the disappointment this would have created had my stay there been a family vacation! Until the pool is complete, I would be not recommend this hotel, unless you do not mind staying in an outdated room at a resort with no pool. Even when the pool is complete, I would personally not stay here again unless the entire hotel were fully renovated. We debated between this hotel and the Ritz-Carlton, and there is no question that next time, that will be our choice.
