{"text":"We'll be back My husband, daugter, son and myself just returned from our first trip to the Dominican Republic - and overall we were thrilled with the resort and the people.The staff are super friendly, and go out of their way to make you feel welcome and pampered. If you don't speak Spanish, take the time to learn a few words - it makes life so much easier.The rooms are clean and a good size - though the ants that get in everywhere are a bit of a problem - and they bite!If you want to tip the maids, remember that you get a daytime and an evening maid, so a couple of dollars on the pillow for each of them is nice. We were told by a friend who's husband lived in the Dominican, that the Dominican people love candy, so we took a bag of Werthers with us, and left 2 or 3 with the maid's tip everyday.The pool bar is lovely - just the right temperature and the bartenders very liberal with their free pour drinks. Whether you choose to tip them or not - ( we tipped a couple of dollars everyday ) they treat everyone to big smiles and a few friendly words everytime you swim up. The grounds are spotless and a true tropical paradise - the baby peacocks with their Mom's were a delight.The beaches are powder white sand, and we never had a problem finding chairs to lounge on. It was more of a problem at the pool, where people tend to leave their towels, even though they might have left the area.Ladies, pamper yourselves at the Spa - it's worth it :-)When you go to the restaurants, don't expect north american size portions, the meals tend to be on the small side. It was fine for me, but our son who's a 22 year old army brat, often ordered room service a couple of hours or so before we went to eat.If you're a scuba diver - remember that with the Platinum package you get a free dive for each week you stay. We got 8 free dives for the 4 of us because we stayed 2 weeks. The dive centre is great - and Sabrina, one of the dive masters, was lots of fun to dive with.The downside of the trip for my daughter was the extraodinarily huge phone bill she got when she arrived home. She spent about 40 mins on the phone during the 2 weeks we were there, talking to her fiance and using the 800 number that is posted in the rooms. Her phone bill was almost $400!!If you take the time to go outside the resort grounds, you will be inundated by the store owners, who all want you to go into their shops to buy souvenirs. It can be a bit imtimidating,even though they're all very friendly. The outside excursions don't neccessarily live up to their hype - the stables where we went to ride, made us sad for the conditions of the animals.Having said that though , the ups FAR outweigh the downs - we'll definately return and learn more Spanish before we do - it's their language after all, and we're the visitors.Enjoy your trip - and maybe we'll see you there :-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":720,"mention":"candy","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":715},{"endOffset":720,"mention":"candy","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":715},{"endOffset":1217,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1212},{"endOffset":1217,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1212},{"endOffset":1633,"mention":"brat","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bratwurst"],"startOffset":1629},{"endOffset":1633,"mention":"brat","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bratwurst"],"startOffset":1629},{"endOffset":1633,"mention":"brat","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bratwurst"],"startOffset":1629},{"endOffset":2552,"mention":"hype","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hype_Energy"],"startOffset":2548}]}
