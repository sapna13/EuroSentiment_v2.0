{"text":"Absolute Paradise! We went to the Chedi Club for the first week of our honeymoon in Bali and stayed for 5 nights. This place is absolutely amazing!I would echo the comments of all the previous reviewers, such as:1) The grounds are stunning - you are surrounded by lush paddy fields and they have really given attention to detail when they have designed the hotel. If you want to properly relax and unwind, this is the place to come! You can do complimentary yoga several days a week and I have to say that doing yoga looking out onto acres of green paddy fields is just about as good as it can get (I'm a bit of a yoga fan! )2) The service is EXCEPTIONAL. My husband travels a lot with work and has stayed in some pretty amazing hotels, but he had never experienced service like this before. The 'personal butler' service is amazing. Our butler dealt with our every need but without ever invading our privacy. He was simply exceptional. We were amazed however, at how ALL the staff at the hotel were so polite and friendly and delivered exceptional service at all times from the gardeners who said a cheery hello as you passed, to the restaurant staff, the main pool attendant, the reception staff and the drivers who take you to Ubud. They really cannot do enough to please you and you feel that the staff are being genuine, rather than giving good service because they feel they have to (they don't seem to expect tips either, although we did give some). I don't understand how one couple who made a review on this site said the staff were 'cool'. We found the total opposite. 3) Hotel rooms - amazing. We stayed in a pool villa - which was beautiful. A decent sized infinity pool (larger than we expected), with doors which the butler opens to look out onto the paddy field. Our own personal sun loungers too and a fridge stocked full of complimentary soft drinks (or vodka, gin, whisky if you really want it!) and snacks (nuts, dried fruit etc) BLISS! Just beware - as they are working paddy fields and the paddy field workers do pass your villa and give you a cheery wave as they do so! (We didn't have a problem with this, in fact, this was part of the place's charm, but make sure you don't bathe topless in your private pool (or worse!) if the gates to the paddy field are open!!). The semi - outdoor bath was also a real treat!4) Spa - is excellent - great service, as you'd expect and great treatments, all looking out onto the paddy fields. Very relaxing.5) Food - very good quality. The restaurant prices are pretty high though (we live in London and they were the same price as a decent restaurant in London) and a bottle of wine is likely to set you back √ä√£¬¢15 - √ä√£¬¢20. However, restaurant prices in Ubud are must cheaper (insanely cheap in some places) and the hotel will run transfers to Ubud up til about 11.30pm (and nothing much happens in Ubud after this time anyway!). Ask the reception staff or your butler for restaurant recommendations in Ubud, as there are lots of choices and some are better than others.The hotel is abut 15 mins drive from Ubud, but the hotel will drive you there and pick you up for free in your own private car whenever you please (although at busy times it is advisable to book about an hour before you want to go).It's all the little touches that make this place so amazing - and there are too many of those to list. I would definitely recommend it if you want a relaxing break and I'd definitely visit again.One point to note though....this hotel is probably best suited to couples. I'm sure if you are two friends on a holiday, you can have a relaxing time here too, but it definitely seemed geared towards couples\/romantic breaks\/honeymooners.
