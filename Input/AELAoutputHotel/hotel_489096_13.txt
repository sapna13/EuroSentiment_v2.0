{"text":"Excellent Location and Facilities We have just returned from a week stay in Sydney and had a marvellous time. We booked a 2-bedroom apartment at the World Towers which was as excellent as any 5-star hotel in the city. Prices were reasonable although the weekend rates are a bit hefty. Views of Sydney from the apartments are magnificent. The daily housekeeping service ensure that we have fresh towels each day. The personnel even washed all our plates and cups again even though we have washed them ourselves! The laundry and dryer came in handy as I was washing our toddler's clothes daily due to the mess that he sometimes get himself into.The fully equipped kitchen was a tremendous help as I was fixing wholesome and nutritous meals for our 23 month old toddler each day. The location of the apartments meant that I could pop down to Coles supermarket located in the basement of World Square anytime to get our daily essentials like diapers, formula milk as well as oats and cereals. If you need to rent a car which we did, you can just pop to Avis which is right around the corner on Pitt Street. The apartments are also close to Darling Harbour, Powerhouse Museum and Chinatown whic are just a short stroll away. QVB and Circular Quay are only a bus ride away. The receptionists on duty each day were very businesslike but helpful in assisting us with our needs. I wouldn't say that they are friendly except for the one who helped us book a day tour to the Blue Mountains. The only downside I have are the noisy party revellers jamming the lifts on the weekends. This is despite the fact that the property has a strict no party policy. Nonetheless, I was impressed with the facilities overall and would definitely stay here again when we come back in 2010.
