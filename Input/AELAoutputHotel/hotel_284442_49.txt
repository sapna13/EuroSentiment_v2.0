{"text":"Quiet Peaceful Getaway This hotel resort is incredibly scenic and the rooms were large with one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. We were a long distance away from the lobby, but were quickly taken to our room by a friendly young man in a golf cart, who carried our heavy bags up the stairs for us. We were in an ocean view room, with large lanai, and woke up every morning to the sound of tropical birds. The front desk clerks could have been a little more pleasant. Halfway through our stay, both of our room keys quit working. Since this is a sprawling property, it was a long walk up to the lobby to get the problem fixed. The clerk did something with the computer and handed back our keys, but never apologized or acted like she understood there was any inconvenience. This is a good resort that could be outstanding with a little more attention to detail. The pool area is gorgeous, but only open dawn to dusk according to the hotel's information. There wasn't a jacuzzi, and the pool area wasn't well-lit after dark, which might be why it closes. It would have been a nice place to end the day's sightseeing if only it were open. Other reviews talk about the remote location, and we spent around an hour each way going into the city. Relaxing here away from the crowds of Waikiki was a great vacation. I traveled with two teens, and they were much happier here than in the city. We would definitely stay again.
