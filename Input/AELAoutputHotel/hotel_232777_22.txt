{"text":"What?! Just Ok My husband and I stayed here for a quick weekend trip and besides the location were not all that impressed. The cava at reception is a nice touch though we had to ask for a glass (?) We were in Gravina II which I think might be a newer section on the 5th floor. Because we were traveling with a small child we needed to use the elevator which barely held myself and a child, but you still had to go up stairs to get to the elevator to Gravina II. THE MOVING FURNITURE SOUND UNCOVERED, it is the ceiling mounted radio speaker!! For some reason the radio can be controlled on the headboard of the bed and the speaker is mounted in the ceiling. Cool I guess, but the problem is even on volume as low as it will go it comes on supper supper loud with this Errerrrt sound, and you quickly turn it back off. Once we did it we started noticing others doing the same thing which does sound like furniture moving. The room initially looked good until closer inspection showed molding coming unglued and loose caulking in the shower. Not that big of a deal but maybe spend the $$ fixing these instead of a celing mounted radio that is useless! We were lucky enough not to get the two twin beds pushed together although this was the hardest bed I have slept on. (another place that $$ could have gone)The breakfast is crap I tell you! and was more worth the 10Euros with the discount on the first day. Take a left when you exit the hotel and there is a wonderful bakery down the next street open early for freash breakfast. WAYYY better than my runny eggs and 4EUro Coke at the hotel. On the other hand the staff was very friendly and honest. Im not saying this isnt a good hotel for the price and location, but I would look around before I would stay here again.
