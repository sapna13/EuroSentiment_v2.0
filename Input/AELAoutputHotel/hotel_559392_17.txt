{"text":"Not bad Singapore has always had good expensive hotels and varying degrees of basic hotels. Harbour Ville was not luxury but sounded good. The taxis at Outram MRT station did not know where it was though only a mile away. Luckily I had printed off a map. It might help if you tell them it is next to St Teresa's church, which is what buses 61, 124, 143, 166 recognise the area as. Check-in was friendly and easy. I was disappointed with the room (A super-Queen room means you have a queen-sized bed). It looked quite basic but after four nights in the room, I thought it not bad. I think I had expected too much originally.Daily maid service with fresh towels. Complimentary 500 ml bottle of water daily as well as enough makings for two cups of tea and two of coffee, and a kettle. Complimentary shower gel and shampoo. All important fridge. TV has HBO, 2 sports channels, news, a general channel with films, series, etc. The area is quiet. Door cannot be locked from inside so use do not disturb sign. Air conditioning works a bit too well and I settled on low fan and 30.C as being just right.Hotel has small internet room, gym, laundry. Internet avaialble in rooms extra. Lobby has small snack bar with choice of sandwiches, drinks, noodles.Though not in the centre, regular buses to Outram MRT station and Chinatown just beyond it as well as other places. When returning, be aware that Outram station has a number of exits. I used bus stop across from Pearls Centre (shopping area). Cross the road from the hotel and depending on what bus stop, Vivo City (mall) is only 2-3 stops away (124 does not go there). Buses do not give change and flat fare is 90 cents, or $1 if you do not have change. Hotel will change notes for coins.
