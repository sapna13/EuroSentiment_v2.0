{"text":"Fantastic Hotel a Little Far Out The staff at this hotel are amazing, the rooms are a step above the average, and the property well maintained. Need an umbrella? The front desk has those. There's no need to pack one. Need directions? Just ask at the desk, they know the way. Want something to eat? There are plenty of great local restaurants a short tram ride away. The neighborhood is completely 100% safe and quiet. The hotel is a short 2.5 blocks from the Apollolan tram stop. Cabs seem to be always at the ready during normal hours.... Also - kudos to the housekeeping staff. We were very late in leaving our room on some days and the staff always had the room ready when we returned. Turn down service was prompt and efficient. The rooms were spotless.This is the type of property to book if you don't want to stay in the loud and rowdy downtown area. I honestly don't know how anyone gets any sleep in some of the properties downtown. That isn't a problem here. The proximity to the Apollolan tram stop means you can be at the museum district in 5 minutes after boarding a tram, downtown in 10 minutes. Remember that trams stop running at 12:30 at night, so budget a 20 Euro Cab Ride and you'll make it back fine. Tell the cabbie Apollolan Tram Stop and they'll get you there. Finally, if flying out early in the morning inform the front desk and they'll have a cab for you. The price is $33 euros to be taken directly to the airport - a bargain when you're in a rush. Plan to leave for the airport 2-2.5 hours before your flight. It's a 15 minute drive. As for the room decor - somewhat chic. The pillows were too soft and large for my taste, but very nice nonetheless. Also, if you want two beds you might need to rearrange the furniture as the room we stayed in had two twins that were pushed together to make a king. We moved the nightstand, seperated the beds by putting a nightstand between them, and everything worked out. I am certain the hotel would have done so if we had asked. This was one instance where it was easier to do it ourself and much faster than calling for assistance. I do this often in foreign countries and it seems to work fine everytime.
