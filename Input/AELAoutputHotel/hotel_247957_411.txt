{"text":"Very Good Hotel The vacation was very nice..we were there April 22nd - 28th and we are a family of four. We had a rocky start. We didn't have great weather...2 1\/2 days of rain\/no sun but it ended with three beautiful days on Tues., Thurs.  Fri. When we arrived on Sunday, we were at the hotel by 1:15 and grabbed lunch and changed into bathing suits and put our suitcases in Security. The only problem was that late in the afternoon (no sun at all, all day) it POURED!!! We hung out at the beach bar\/restaurant which is really nice. When we finally went to our room, it was leaking from all the rain and the floors were wet. We were able to find someone in housekeeping in our building (which was located closest to the beach which was great!) and got some towels to start soaking up the water. It rained for a while and we had no luggage although calls were made twice for them to bring it to us. Finally at about 6:30 my husband ventured out because NO ONE would answer the phones at the front desk. They finally found someone to bring them and our luggage to our room.When it rains....be careful. The floors and walkways do get very slippery. The walkways also flood\/puddle quickly. Many times we walked barefoot or had to walk on the grass area. The room was fine.....we had a cot in there that my daughter slept in, so the three of us shared two double beds that were pushed together to form one king size bed. You may want to consider two rooms so you have two bathrooms. That was a bit difficult, sharing one bathroom. We did have a nice balcony, but honestly, we didn't use it much. The bathroom was also roomy. The room itself was decorated nicely and it seemed like it was updated. The bathrooms can stand some more updating. We stayed in building 26 which was closest to the beach which was great. It forced you to get up and walk to breakfast and dinner which was where the lobby is located. Continental breakfast was available at the beach bar\/restaurant.The food was very good.....no complaints.....but never found anything to be very hot. Only items that were cooked to order were very hot and the PIZZA was great!!! Breakfast and lunch were always good, with plenty to choose from. Dinner, at the buffet, was not great. Thank goodness for the specialty restaurants....they really were very good....not great and not like here, but never had a bad meal. No one got sick. We drank bottled water and brushed our teeth with it, did not eat any salad, but we did have ice cubes and frozen drinks. Not a problem. Sports bar had hot dogs, hamburgers, french fries, etc. The ICE CREAM was delicious. The people were very friendly....many did speak English, but we also spoke Spanish and it was fun. Lots of activities when the weather was nice. Activity directors all around, but not bothersome. Volleyball, dancing, table tennis, non-motorized water sports and tons of tours to sign up for. We chose, because of the limited sun, to stay put. The kid club was too young for our son. It was right across from our building. More geared towards little kids. We went to the fitness center, played tennis one afternoon and basketball twice. The pools were very nice and the swim up bar too!Do bring plenty of sunscreen...like others said...it was very expensive to buy anything in the hotel. There are a few stores and a spa. Make sure you get everything you are entitled to...don't expect it to be offered....make sure you ask. We paid slightly extra for the conceriege package and it was worth it. Free massages, priorty seating at dinner, beach towels delivered the first night to the room, etc. Also, BE PATIENT...check in was a bit slow.Vendors are allowed to walk on the beach but NOT bother you. You only saw one at a time. The nice thing was that on Friday night the hotel brings in a huge group of vendors, all dressed very well, and tons of items to choose from. Youdo need to haggle!We would go back and I would recommend the hotel...no it's not 5 star, but I'd say more like 3.75. It was VERY clean, well landscaped and maintained and the public bathrooms were spotless (lobby area, beach bar). Entertainment was good....not great...buy hey you're not in Vegas!! They had a Michael Jackson show one night that was REALLY GOOD.
