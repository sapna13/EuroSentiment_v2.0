{"text":"Great hotel, Perfect Location, Awesome Staff, Safe For Single Female I went on Trip Advisor and was concerned about the negative comments, mostly about the unsafe neighborhood. I was very surprised because it was much nicer than the internet postings would lead you to believe. I am from the Midwest, but I have seen a lot of rough urban neighborhoods, and this did not even come close at all! In addition, my husband was attending a conference, so for the five days I stayed here, many of the time I was alone and felt completely safe. I did walk in the neighborhood and felt safe, but I could take the shuttle to so many locations there was no need to walk.We did ask for a higher floor to help lessen street noise, but I can tell you that was not a problem - and I am a light sleeper. The two rooms are small, but more than adequate. And for a five night stay it was nice to have the two rooms and the living room area. It was especially nice to have the fridge, microwave and wet bar. The hotel was just very well maintained and had a nice decor and room layout.I had an exceptional experience I had while my husband attended a convention. I spent a lot of time at the hotel, and I cannont compliment the staff enough for their positive attitude, helping spirit, and ability to maintain composure under great stress! The front desk was really overwhelmed at times, yet Melinda (Mindy), LaDarryl (Darryl), Felicia, Nora, Jonny and Xavier never lost their cool and always were able to continue to offer incredible customer service. I was simply amazed! And Maria in the breakfast area is a saint for her helpfulness to all the foreign attendees and her patience. She was kept running but never lost her smile! And Yvette in housekeeping also went the extra mile over and over again to accomodate guests. And then the shuttle drivers! Preston, Hector and Dennis were incredibly helpful and so nice to me, especially since I was alone so often.People are the first to complain, the last to compliment. So I wanted to take the time to say how perfect my stay was at the Roundhouse Inn. Two of my husbands sisters live in the Boston area, and I would not hesitate for one moment to stay there again.What a wonderful place to stay!
