{"text":"For Beach Lovers After reading many reviews on Trip Advisor we decided to spend our Holiday at the Excellence Resort - Punta Cana. We arrived Dec. 22st and departed Dec. 26th. To make it easier to read the review we are going to categorize the sevices.Transportation\/Arrival: Do not take the limo ($175), a regular cab will be much cheaper and the fastest way to the resort. One couple we met took a bus and they said it was fine but we prefer a cab. ($60) It was approximately 60 minutes depending on the cab plus the roads are filled with holes for 1\/2 the trip. Check in was a breeze at the Excellence Club (this was one of the very few amenities this club gives you).Accomodations: All of the rooms are the same. So you are paying for different views. We had a Junior Suite Ocean View. The rooms are spacious but a little outdated. The beds were like sleeping on a ironing board. Pillows were like marshmallows. Bathrooms were well appointed with a lot of towels and all the toiletries that are needed for an extended stay. Balconies are very small and the sliding glass door did not have an exterior handle to get back in. You also had to have the patio door shut for the A\/C to run. We would suggest the swim up rooms if you want a big patio area the higher the room number the better.Service: They have an abundant staff that is waiting on every need but a communication barrier is very apparent if you don't speak spanish. They have a hard time deliverying on specific questions. Tipping is not expected unless you receive excellent service. We saw some people tipping and others not tipping.Food: Not good. They try really hard and the presentation is pretty good but the food is below par at best. We rated this part as an overall disappointment. We did run into a few good dishes at the restaurants (Agave and Toscana) but they were rare. Sometimes the bartenders would be absent for extended periods of time.Casino: Very, Very small but they do an adequate job. 2 Blackjack, 2 Carribbean Stud, 1 Roulette and 1 Crap table. 40 slots that do not take bills.Beach\/Pool: Excellent. This is what sets this resort apart from all the others. Beach\/Pool service was outstanding. Plenty of towels, Tiki huts, and chairs. Sand was fine with no rocks or shells which made playing on the beach and water enjoyable.Activities: We did no off-site activities but we are not sure you would want to risk them. This is a do not leave the resort type of vacation unless escorted. Shopping is weak but if you like something go to the shops next door down the beach. You will purchase the item at 1\/2 the price and you are able to barter the price down.Overall: If you are a beach lover that wants to relax with no kids around this is the resort for you. If you like activity, excursions, good food this is probably not the place for you. It claims to be a 5-Star resort but we think it is a middle of the road resort in the 3-Star range. 65 out of 100.
