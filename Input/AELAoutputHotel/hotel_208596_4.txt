{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience I have had in a hotel I booked a 4-night stay at the Gran Via on the recommendation of a friend. Upon arrival the receptionist completely ignored me and continued to stare at his computer despite the fact that I was stood in front of him. Eventually I was shown to a twin despite explicitly asking for a double. Back at reception the extremely rude receptionist informed me that 'its a double, but its not a double - understand?' Well, no, but I did when I was shown the room - the bed was about four feet wide and the room itself resembled a monastic cell. Back at reception I was told to take it or leave it, and that my partner was too big for the bed, not that the bed was too small. I took the twin for 1 night and checked out the next day, moving across Placa Catalunya to a lovely, friendly modern hotel for about 5 euros more per night. Even checkout was a horrible experience, conducted largely in silence with the receptionist gesturing for my credit card and pointing at the screen to show the amounts (and yes, he spoke English). I should point out that I am not difficult to please and have never felt the need to write in these terms before, but this place is an absolute shambles.My recommendations to The Gran Via are:Sack the receptionist and ensure he is never allowed to talk to the public again.Buy some decent furniture.
