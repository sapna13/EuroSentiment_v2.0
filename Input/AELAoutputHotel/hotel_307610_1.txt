{"text":"Xmas  Have just returned from a 13 days stay at the Padma.Would definately stay there again. The service was excellent. We stayed in the Garden Chalets which with the experience of the Garden Club Lounge was well worth the extra charge. Breakfasts at the Bella Rosa Restaurant was more superior than the large Buffet breakfasts, although without the vast choice. We had a ground floor room which wasnt anything 'special' but adequate. However, next time we would ask for a first floor room as the upstairs neighbours were not very accomodating in their noise levels throughout the day\/night. The Hotel was full but we had no problems in finding a bed\/chair at the pool. During the stay they managed to find extra beds so no-one had to do the towel reservation at dawn! The bar prices at the pool are the same prices as you would pay in Perth, so not cheap for Bali standards.We didnt spend any time on the beach as it was quite disgustingly dirty. Bottles, plastic and dead fish. The amount of litter was an eyesore. Cant understand why its not cleared or cleaned!We can recommend a nearby Restaurant\/Cafe\/Bar called Indo-National on Jl Padma. Owned and ran by Aussies.The food was quality for a cheap price. Try the Garlic Prawns. Half a kilo for $10. We ate there a lot. Good service and clean, Also, nearby is a good bar\/club to go to is called Legends.If your looking for handbags you wont get any better deal than buying from Instyle shop which is just outside the Hotels main entrance.The prices are good and the bags quality is good. Tommys bags are great if you want soft leather. They will make bags for you, just bring them a picture.The beaty Salon called Lindas is just outside the main entrance. Can get a massage in air conditioned rooms for 50,000rp I also had my hair washed and blow dried for $10. They are just as good as anywhere and much cheaper than the Hotel.The Hotel offered money changing. For the first time ever, the Hotel had the best exchange rate. We did not find anywhere else offering a better deal, and of course you wont get burnt! We didnt get transfers from the airport but chose to use a Taxi. If you use the Taxi stand on r\/h side as you exit the arrivals lounge you will pay a standard charge for the trip. We paid 55,000rp to the Padma. Did hear other Aussies saying they paid 180,000rp but they didnt use the Taxi stand and negotiated with the local 'transport' !! Be careful :-) The best cabs to use are called Blue Bird cabs. They use meters and are very reasonable.
