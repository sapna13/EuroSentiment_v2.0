{"text":"Second time round and just as amazing!! We returned to the Bahia Principe for the second time 17.07.07 - 01.08.07 and we were not disapointed.I had e-mailed Laura at the hotel a couple of times to request a room similar to what we had last time as we like to be near the lobby on the second or third floor and she said she would do her best to accomodate.We were checked in on the coach which was very efficent and they had given us silver VIP wristbands, when we arrived at the room which was where we requested it was decorated in balloons with free t-shirts, rum and champagne for our anniversary. They had set the table with little cakes and a lovely fruit basket and we also got a free safe and turndown service with bathrobes and slippers for us to use during our stay. It was a lovely touch and really made us feel welcome to be back.Everything was just as good as last year, John the barman who works at the beach and the theatre bar greeted my husband like an old friend!! The restaurants were all good especially the Japanese, the only critisism was the service at the italian was a little hit and miss, they brought our main course before they had served our soup but they were quite appologetic, everyone makes mistakes.The shows at night were different to last year, the Micheal Jackson show and the Circus were amazing and our daughter took part in the Lion King show which she loved. As we were there for two weeks the shows were repeated, some we were happy to see again but others not.The girls at the kids club were different to the ones last year but even with a bit of a language barrier my daughter loved them all and they made her feel very welcome.Overall we love the Bahia Principe and would go back again, probably not for another couple of years though as we want to visit other places, but i would recomend it to anyone without a second thought!
