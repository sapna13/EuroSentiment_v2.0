{"text":"Please Avoid I stayed for a week in this hotel. Firstly, the location is superb. Right next to the LAs Ramblas and metro etc. However beware if you want to have a good night sleep.When I entered the hotel, the offered us champagne and I was impressed. We were given a hotel room where we had to first take an elevator to the 2nd floor and then go up and around to another elevator and then take to 5th floor. We said ok no problem, i have seen weirder things in Europe.The Room was better than the average rooms, it was good for the size. Bed looked good and the bathroom was good.However, the problem I had was the A\/C did not work. It was nearly 90 degrees and the a\/c wouldn't work at all. It would just blow air and not cool air as it was running in their lobby. They sent a repairman, he didnt speak english but was very nice and tried his best to fix it. We gave up and had to open windows at nights to sleep.The bedsheets seemed to be full of bed bugs or maybe it was too hot to sleep? I was scratching myself all over and so was my wife..we were so annoyed. 1st night in Barcelona was hell for us because of the room. We woke up groggy and said ok lets just enjoy....maybe it will get better. However they did not change the bedsheets and we complained again and it was then changed. But for some reason the problem still was there.I can go on and on. I just landed and got home and on the plane ride home, my wife kept on reminding me that make sure you write this revieew or you will forget. If you like good location and dont care for good location. This place is it..go for it. If you do want to book this hotel, beware of the rooms where you have to take 2 elevators..maybe those are the bad ones? ","annotations":[]}
