{"text":"Service could be far more attentive I decided to take my wife for ou 15th wedding anniversary to a top hotel without the chidren and chose what is supposed to be the best in Hong Kong. The Rolls royce transfer was great, the welcome and the view as well, the room had zero default. I organise flowers to be put on the rooms on arrivals that were not there...., we booked for afternoon tea on arrival. An hour later we were waiting ten minutes in the lobby on the side of a huge queue, the table was set up for 4, there was 2 of us, the service was hectic fast, unpersonnal, you could see that this was a money factory machine, a shame for this great lobby. I wanted to leave asked four times for the bill, I left without signing at the end, but is was still charged on check out.We visited a lot of friends, on one occasion it was raining we asked the head of the door to tell our taxis in chinese where we wanted to go (as we had the indication written in english only) to be told in a very rude manner to take the queue like everyone else.... , by that time I took him on the side and told him off...To be honest, as we just arrived this put us off trying even one restaurant at the peninsula. We tried many restaurants around and loved the famous Japanese NOBU just accross the road.And by the way, even if you have an adress for and excellent taylor that was recommended to you; do not ask the concierge where it is located as he will try to tell you in a suttle way that HIS adress is much better...!!!!Finaly the I found the breakfast to be of sub standard, qeuing to seat, not a great choice.The spa was fantastic.The experience maybe a must.... , maybe maybe not....
