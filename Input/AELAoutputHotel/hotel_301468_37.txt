{"text":"Outstanding service, wonderful hotel I can't speak highly enough of our stay at the Mandarin Oriental, Singapore. From arrival to departure we receive the best service of the many hotels we stayed in on a round the world trip. We arrived very early morning after an overnight flight and were greeted with smiles and a lovely breakfast. We had a beautiful suite overlooking Marina Bay and the Singapore skyline and it was just perfect, with wonderful touches and the most comfy bed in the world. We ate in all of the restaurants and every one was a delight - particularly the Cherry Garden and Morton's. The swimming pool with regular service of iced fruits was just perfect after a hot day's shopping. We also made use of the Business Centre which had excellent facilities and the staff there were so helpful and courteous. The service as this hotel was outstanding, we felt that many hotels could benefit from the customer service training the Mandarin Oriental provides to its staff - they seemed to anticipate our needs before we even asked. The shops and attractions are really not far away and it was a delight to wander along the waterside, visit Clarke's Quay and see the Christmas lights on Orchard Road. This was a particularly special visit for my husband who lived in Singapore as a youngster so we looked forward to a very special return - we were not disappointed and we will certainly return to this hotel whenever we visit Singapore.
