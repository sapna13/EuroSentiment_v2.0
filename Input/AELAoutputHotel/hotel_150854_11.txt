{"text":"Nice but not as much as a palace as I expected! This was my first time in an RIU and I travelled with a group of regular users of RIUs, particularly in the Dominican Republic. Overall our experience was good, particularly service from staff who were great. One night there was a power cut and the staff still served despite being in a blackout! The rooms were a big dissapointment. Whilst they were big they were tired - definately in need of a refurb to enable the hotel to live up to its Palace status. Our balcany door was so old it was hard to open, the fridge was tiny and whilst the beds were huge, the hotel didn't provide linen to fit. Linen wasn't always stain free! The hotel offers room service which is lovely, food is hot and tasty but ordering is a hassel. Everytime we called, someone non-english speaking picked up and after a long conversation with 2\/3 people there was no choice but to hang up. WIthin time someone English speaking always called back and made sure you got your order so it wasn't all bad. The rooms were not cleaned until about 4pm and the cleaners had a habit of removing things without replacing them. For example, the shower gel was taken from our room and it took a few days and requests to 5 different staff members before it was returned. Only a minor thing but frustratingThe Thomson rep was appalling. A complete drip and only interested in selling trips. Hardly saw him and when we asked for help, he wasn't interested and never got back to you when he promised to. Definately in the wrong job and completely out of his depth. I am surprised he was even recruited by Thomson as he is such a wet blanket. If you are after great service by the waiters, and a relaxing holiday this will be great. It wasn't a bad holiday but the small things started to build up and became a bit frustrating. Our feeling was that RIU are putting all their efforts in the grand palaces ie Palace Punta Cana (which we visited) and letting their standard palaces go a bit. If you want a hotel with a wow factor go to the Punta Cana. However, the Macao was a personal hotel as it was a bit smaller and the staff tried hard. Oh and it does smell damp!
