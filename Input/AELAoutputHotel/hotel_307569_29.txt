{"text":"Honeymoon We were chauffered along a narrow road, slightly tar which is just wide enough for only a lane of traffic and occasionally requires bigger vehicles to come to a halt inorder for traffic travelling on the opposite direction to pass.Little wooden houses and cottages 'curtained' by the most unusual pieces of art releasing colours, talents and the artistic abilities of the people in Ubud possess. A true infusion of art and humble civilization! This inate talent is displayed in the most humble manner one would imagine and may put some famous artist to shame!My soulmate and I were breathless when the staff of Hotel Komeneka gave us a short but informative tour around the hotel. Imagine landscape, waterscape and artscape in an oasis of tranquility, serenity, peace and harmony. The kind that would normally be seen in programmes eg 'World 10 Best Hotels' or Most Romantic Getaway'. Exactly what one would expect in a dream paradise.Our guide politely told us that there are only 20 esoteric, intimate rooms with villa, padi field and garden themes and views that fused together through exquisite natural Balinese landscaping.The spa is my favourite spot coz I felt an immediate rapport, a haven of enchanment, drowning in the aroma of sweet and natural fragrance of essential oils. So soothing and relaxing; one may just need pampering almost immediately especially when its so cleverly designed just next to the padi fields with birds, bees, insects and butterflies chirping and flapping without compromising the privacy of the luxurious santuary of relaxation. Sheer beauty!It was at this very moment that I realized my soulmate had done a superb job coz this is a true paradise for 2 persons so deeply in love!We almost wanted a dip when we saw the swimming pool. It's really a sight to behold! Although not too big but it etched against the sky among the trees and overlooking the lush greenery and enveloped by cottages and padi fields over the other end of the horizon with intermittent sunshinge piercing through the trees above us.Inspired and for many, even inspiration itself........a small garden and with a neatly designed brick and stone pathway surrounded by honeysuckles coiling naturally on the beautifully constructed wooden shed and a surprisingly cute pond with lively colourfulfishes swimming so freely in it. Is this the way to our room?.........and so we both thought.AND IT IS!.........Our whole lives were further lifted....... we were on top of the world when we saw our room for the first time! Its really the kind that any lonely heart would fall in love all over again. Everything in the room is designed with superior finishes, fixtures and fittings. Its absolutely a romantic getaway with the pole-side bed with pure white bedding and laced with the most flowy white curtain surrounding it. Immediately we were in each other's arms when we saw a big heart intricately woven (frangipani) in the middle of the pure white bed and to our surprise, we were there were 2 sets of night gown flawlessly ironed!We save the best for last!............the aroma and the sweet natural scent of flowers finally brought us to the most romantic bath I've ever seen! We had our first floral bath which was pre-prepared with lots of petals of flowers floating on top and also the various beautiful fragrant soap and lotion being generously placed around us. We had the longest bath that anyone would have and I'm glad all these had further cement our love for each other even more......
