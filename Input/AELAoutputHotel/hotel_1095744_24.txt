{"text":"Bali Mandira paradise!! Just returned from the Bali Mandira, and have to say that it was EXCELLENT!! A friend (who is a travel agent) and I got a great deal on a Deluxe room for 7 nights, and we had a fantastic stay - considering this was my first trip to Bali, and I was pretty uncertain of my new surroundings, the staff and atmosphere put me immediately at ease. The room was really lovely and cool, and very clean - I think that the Mandira has impeccible standards when it comes to presentation. You will see gardeners gently sweeping fallen frangipanis from the grass outside your room each morning - it is totally divine...This hotel is pretty flash - probably beyond my normal budget had we not got a good price - and perhaps not the ideal hotel for a young person wanting to have the full-on crazy Bali experience (for example, this hotel does not have a swim up bar!!). Having said that, though, we had some great nights out in Kuta and were easily able to taxi home for about 10,000 rp (about $2), and it was such a pleasure to come back to a cool, airconditioned room, have a shower in the amazing rock walled bathroom, and then order some fantastic room service (which is always fresh, hot and delivered quickly - bonus!). We also had some great laughs with the staff working there - I can honestly say that Balinese people must be the friendliest people on the planet!We ate in the restaraunt twice (Parsols) and found the food and the service very nice - the menu is quite westernised, though, which is by no means a criticism. We ate breakfasts in both the regular and deluxe dining rooms, and there really wasn't that much difference between the two (besides the egg and pancake chef in the deluxe - he makes anything fresh and to your liking!). We also had Club Benfits included (free morning\/afternoon tea, free cocktails, etc) but didn't use them - the room is quiet and a bit TOO peaceful, so we prefered to head towards Kuta for our evenings (I recommend Espresso Bar on JL Legian!).We also took advantage of the in house spa, and spent two luxurious hours being scubbed with grated baby coconut, massaged with essential oils, and enjoying the quiet and the warmth of our private treatment room. The spa is expensive, I guess, compared to others around Kuta, but we felt very safe and pampered (plus we charged the whole thing to our room, so we didn't have to deal with the messy business of cash till the very end - another bonus!).Basically, the Mandira is somewhere I would recommend to any one looking for a quality escape in the heart of Bali - it is close to the heart of Kuta, but not too close... luxurious, but not over the top... and the service and staff are easy, relaxed and very natural. I will definitely be coming back, regardless of the price!!
