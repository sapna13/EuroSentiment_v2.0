{"text":"Lovely little hotel My boyfriend and I stayed at the Owl from 24.06.07 to 30.06.07.This was my eighth visit to Amsterdam and we decided to try a different hotel, we were very pleasantly surprised. The staff are all very friendly and helpful, the cleaning staff are brilliant. Our room was cleaned and made-up one morning after we came back from breakfast!! They keep the place lovely and clean, the reception, lounge and breakfast areas are very pleasant on the eye and everything is really chilled when you go for breakfast which is a great relief from the craziness of Amsterdam.The breakfast does not offer enormous variety but it is very good and everything is very fresh and tasty, it set us up perfectly for the day.They have a free internet service next to the breakfast room where you can have a quick check up of emails, etc on their PC. This is a first for me and a great little service.There were a couple of minor things that need slight repair in the room but nothing that would spoil anybody's holiday. For example, one of the sockets did not work.Yet another great visit to Amsterdam, will no doubt be back next year and I will definitely consider staying in the Owl again. Oh, and try the Toro Dorado grill restaurant on N.Z. Voorburgwal for a great meal, I've been a few times and have overlooked mentioning it before! Oriental City is a lovely Chinese too!Stay at the Owl, you will not be disappointed.
