{"text":"Sweet and Sour My boyfriend and I checked into the Affinia for my 23rd birthday. I am from Miami and this was my first time in the big city. The sweet, the hotel is beautiful and at first the staff was very accommodating. We arrived on time for our check in; the staff proceeded to inform that our room wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be ready for another two or three hour√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂. We were not upset and decided to take a walk around town. The rooms are very spacious (two queen beds), Kitchen and their specialty all the pillows you want, they actually have a pillow menu which I found very unique and comfy, the beds were also very comfortable and the rooms were spotless! This room fits a family of six perfectly as they also provide a couch with bed capabilities. The sour, after October 1st the law does not require establishments to provide air conditioning to their guests; they are only supposed to provide heat. Note the Affinia does not have air conditioning after Oct. 1st √à√\u2020\u2022?March 30th! You will not read this warning anywhere but here (feel free to call and verify), you have to keep the windows of the room open. If you suffer from allergies like me, you will find this to be a huge problem; my nose was bloody for the entire duration of my visit, and although the beds were comfy I had a tough time breathing making for an unpleasant sleep. Other hotels like the Fitzpatrick, which I also stayed in (more expensive); do not make their guest sleep with open windows. There is nothing the hotel can do as they shut off the air to the whole building! More sour, when our check out came around I called the front desk to explain that we were going to be delayed due to the fact that my boyfriend became ill, and we were stuck all the way on the other side of town, they gave us one hour. To our surprise when we make it back to the hotel (2 hours late) they had charged us an additional $200!!! After explaining to the manager (an over weight red head) our situation, my boyfriends sickness and the fact that my nose was bloody my whole vacation, she felt the least bit compassionate and did not waive the fee or at least bring the price a bit down due to the circumstances. I found her and her employee (a thin colored woman) very rude. A word to the wise, do not come one minute late to check out as the Affinia will not consider you. My opinion is that the hotel is not all that bad, and if your ok with what I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe mentioned, then I would recommend. But the Fitzpatrick which is near is way superior and the difference in money is well worth it. ","annotations":[]}
