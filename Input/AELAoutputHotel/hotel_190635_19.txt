{"text":"Very nice This is a beautiful hotel in a location we liked a lot - some complain that it is a bit removed from the center of things, but for us this was a positive, and cabs are easy and relatively inexpensive since most everything in Barcelona is quite close. The rooms were very large with great views of the city and beach. We appreciated the light and openness, as compared to most standard European hotels. We had a club room and the lounge and food offerings were excellent. So, in terms of the room, comfort and location the hotel is highly recommended. However, as other reviews have mentioned, the service was not up to par for a hotel of this caliber. I will say that most everyone we encountered was very nice and appeared to at least try, but...for example, we had connecting rooms with the rest of our family and it took two hours (several phone calls, plus my husband going down to reception twice), before someone finally showed up with a shrug to unlock the doors between the two rooms. On several occasions when calling the front desk or operator the phone would ring endlessly with no one ever answering. We were not there for the pool really, but it is very small for a hotel of this size and the couple of times we walked by it was very crowded. A few times we overheard very angry guests who had arranged for things that were not done properly (one person was left at the airport without the ride the hotel was to have arranged for her). For our purposes, we were very pleased with the comfort of the hotel and it was just for a couple of nights. But, if you are looking for someplace with great service that you can depend on, not sure if this is the place.
