{"text":"The spirit of Aloha is well alive here! After noticing the Outrigger reef was under renovations and needing a stopover hotel for 2 nights after a 5 week trip through Canada and the US i chose the Outrigger Waikiki. As soon as i arrived by shuttle the bellman took my bags and i was greeted personally by a man who presented me with a lei, checked his clipboard to tell me they had my reservation on record and then directed me to the Check In Desk.As someone said you sit down to check in which is a nice touch and a little different as that's the first hotel i've been too that does that.The check in agent offered me a room upgrade from a city view to a full ocean view as part of a Deal they had. I decided to go for it and ended up with Full Ocean View on the 15th floor for an extra $300 US for the 2 nights i was there! I'm so glad i did that my room was wonderful!Room was very spacious, Immaculate and even had a walk in wardrobe! Toliet\/Shower were spotless and they had a nice generous serving of tolietries. Whilst i could hear the odd person out in the hallway the thin walls never really caused any problem for me.I also liked the fact they had an express elevator for guests on Level 14 - 16, Saved so much time than having to go floor by floor!The gym was 24 hours and the pool was great, The only problem i had was the pool closed at 8pm! That was so early, but i loved being able to swim in the pool whilst watching the waves come in on the beach.I used the coin operated washer and dryers they had set up one night out near the pool, They were great to have nearby but i did wonder why they'd put them out in the open, I mean what if it rains?A great hotel and i'd be happy to stay there again!
