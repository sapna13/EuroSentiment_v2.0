{"text":"Classy Hotel in the heart of Seattle I have stayed in this hotel about 15 times in the last three years, for a total maybe 45 days. Each and every stay was special. The hotel is classy. To be honest, it is not really my style. I tend to go for boutique hotels, moneys allowing. However I never switch hotels here. PRO:- Best service ever. I all of my stays I have experience only once a slight impatience from a member of the staff. The rest of the time the staff was bending backwards and really doing their very best to honestly try to accommodate- Great location, with nice views. Some of the corner rooms have great views of the river but even the other have very nice views of the surroundings- Magical atmosphere: no matter how difficult the day was, the hotel staff creates a great atmosphere. The little touches like having the bed prepared and the Jazz channel in turned on every evening, the room made twice a day, the music in the hall, etc. - Great gym: quite a few treadmills and similar cardio machines. A nice gym with some machines, a swimming pool, a great sauna facilities, etc. Again, nice touches like getting water bottles, headsets and having personal TVs on every treadmill. Very rejuvenatingCONs:- It does not have a modern look to it. If you're absolutely looking for that go to the W across the street.- Expensive, not necessarily overpriced, if you don't have a corporate discount.Word of advice: even though the hotel occupies a whole block, it is often booked well in advance. So make a reservation as soon as you canAlso, when you reserve the restaurant through the Concierge, not only do you get great recommendations (they really understand what you are after), but you also get sometimes a free appetizer thrown in courtesy of the Fairmont Concierge,really a great hotel. Would go back even if I was traveling on my won, and not for business.
