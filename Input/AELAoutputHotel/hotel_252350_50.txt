{"text":"An above average hotel with some nice bells and whistles Based on the great reviews here at Trip Advisor, I booked a stay here for over a week, and have mostly liked the place. The Watertown hotel has great bells and whistles, but first let's look at the basics:* Room size and layout - We had a suite--no complaints there. I especially liked having 2 sinks, one across from the bed and one next to the bathroom door.* Bed comfort - Excellent with a nice pillowtop mattress.* Cleanliness - Some hairs left behind from previous guest, but otherwise good.* Helpfulness of staff - Quite good.* Quietness - Here's where they fall down. We heard lots of noise from the room above. Very easy to hear footsteps above you. However, they appear to have double-paned windows, and you can't hear much noise from outside. On the weekend, there were a lot of teenagers talking noisily in the hallway, but the halls were quiet at all other times.* Temperature control - A bit difficult. The thermostat says high heat, low heat, high cool, low cool and fan only. Unlike a thermostat where you can set the temperature, it was challenging to get this room to stay at a comfortable temperature.* Water pressure in shower - mediocre but adequate.* Refrigerator - Tiny box fridge.* Free internet service with ethernet cable provided.* Free underground garage parking. Garage moderately difficult to maneuver in. Always found a parking space.To sum up the basics, they were average to above average, but definitely not excellent.There are other features, however, that further improve the quality of one's stay here:* Instead of nickel and diming you like a hotel that charges $3 to $6 for a small bottle of water, there is no bottle of water in the room. Instead, they filter the water for you in the room!* Free breakfast which my partner enjoyed (Foods listed in a previous review.)* Free happy hour wine tasting* Washing machine and dryer on every floor--free! (But be sure to take all your clothes out of the washer or dryer by 10 pm, or they'll get locked in the laundry closet. But if they do, a staff member will come upstairs and lock it for you.)* Their ala cart program. You can request one of a dozen or so carts. For example, their art cart has art supplies; their games card has board games, playing cards and music; and their spa cart has items including a hand held massager and aroma therapy.* Their gym is tiny but functional, and unlike other hotel gyms I've seen, this one lends you bicycles you can ride on the nearby Burke-Gilman trail.Another thing I love about this hotel is the location, in walking distance from many restaurants, Trader Joes, Half Price Books, and much more. As a vegan, I especially enjoy three of the restaurants in walking distance--Chaco Canyon Cafe (vegetarian, half raw foods), Araya's (vegan Thai), and Bombay Grill (Indian Food--not vegetarian, but vegetarian- and vegan-friendly.)Despite my gripe about the sound proofing, so much is excellent about this place, that I would not hesitate to stay here again.
