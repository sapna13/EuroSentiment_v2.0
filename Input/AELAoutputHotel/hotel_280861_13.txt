{"text":"Great place if u're in a budget! I booked this hotel through hotwire. Hotwire is a letdown. The web mentioned the rack rate was 400 sth dollars per night and that we'll be saving 70 %. Instead , the rack rate when we stayed was 88 euro per night. We paid almost the same if not more through hotwire. Terrible!Anyway , back to the hotel , we stayed 3 nights in this hotel ,May 2008. It was clean and has good location ( 1 minute from the parallel station which harbors the green and the purple lines ; also next to barcelona universal hotel). La Ramblas is about 10 minutes breezy walk , the mirador colon and the seaside is about 5 minutes walk. If you plan to go to Montjouc , the furnicular departs from parallel station , so that's a plus too. The staffs are friendly and speak fluent english. Basic amenities are provided in the room , but no hairdryer. Air-con was working fine. Breakfasts were okay. There is a 24 hour supermarket, just 5 minute walk from the hotel (ask the staff for the location , they'll be most happy to direct you.). Next door there're restaurants serving pizzas , paellas , and other catalan dishes. Price is not bad , beware though if you ask for mineral water , they might pull the most expensive bottles ,water in glass bottles instead of your regular plastic bottles. It's best to ask what brand is available and how much. The tap water is drinkable , but it's not tasty (near the sea..). I wont reccomend this hotel to light-sleepers because the hotel has a lot of young guests, some nights they can be noisy. All in all , the hotel is good if u're in a budget or if u just need a place to crash in at night. Save money by getting the T-10 transportation card. It is valid for 10 trips, more than one person can use it at the same time. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1090,"mention":"pizzas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1084}]}
