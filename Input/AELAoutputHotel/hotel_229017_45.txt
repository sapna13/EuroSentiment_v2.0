{"text":"An Unexpected Surprise On our last day in Italy we returned to Florence for a last night stay. We had to get up for an early flight and were simply looking for a place to stay near the train and bus station to get us to the airport. We chose this hotel only because it had availability on January 1st and because it was right across from the train station and bus station at Santa Maria Novella. Our stay was an unexpected surprise and this hotel is a good find.First, the price on such short notice was 171 Euro (not the 250 Euro plus average on Trip Advisor). The room was actually a suite with 2 separate sitting rooms, a bedroom, and a fantastic view of the Duomo outside. So the price was a value. The bathrooms were modern and wonderful and the room had all other amenities.The hotel, itself, is charming with lots of beautiful charms like old wood accents to the halls, rooms, and lobby. The only problem was that the entry to the room door was a bit of a hassle. It reads a card and then you had to put a shoulder into it to get it to open.The price includes an enormous breakfast buffet with fresh and tasty options from eggs, Italian bacon, to fresh fruits, pastries, yogurts, and juices. The view from the breakfast room on the top floor is spectacular.We really lucked out finding this place. For the weary person arriving by train...book it...it is steps away. It is also only about 4 bloack along a nice street to the Duomo and is about 2 blocks from the city market.
