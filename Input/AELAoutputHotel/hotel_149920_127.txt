{"text":"Recommend highly My husband and I just returned from a week at the San Juan Marriott. We booked a room with a city view and upon arrival, got upgraded to a corner room, which is always more spacious and in this case, had two balconies to choose from. The room was beautiful and well maintained - great bedding! Every single person we encountered at this hotel (staff) couldn't have been more pleasant or accommodating. Housekeeping, security, concierge, bar, beach hands, towel keepers, casino workers - everyone is obviously so well trained in hospitality. We were impressed. The beach here is small and if you are one to lounge all day, you will have to position yourself way to the left of the hotel in the morning, so that when the sun hits the hotel around noon, you are not caught in the shade. Being on the Atlantic side, the sand is not the usual Caribbean white powder, rather a grainy yellow. Not that this is a problem, just a heads up. Same with the pool area - while lovely, it is shaded by the hotel and trees. The surf can be wild, and the undertow is something to take seriously. You will not find the calm and gentle waves of the Caribbean on this beach. That said, I think it is a positive.The restaurants in Condado are fabulous. We loved Tijuana's close by. The food is authentic and delicious with great service. The La Mama margarita makes it worth the visit and I'll leave it at that! We also found Budatai to be fantastic, very chic. The whole Condado area has changed a great deal since the last time we visited. The shopping is world class - Christian Dior, Cartier, Ferragamo and Miu Miu are a stone's throw away from the Marriott.Old San Juan is not too far, about a two mile walk, and the restaurants there are worth looking into. We went to Marmalade one night and have to say it is one of the finest restaurants we have ever come across. New York style dining, but reasonably priced - at least consistent with other dining in the area.For those that are concerned about safety in San Juan, I will say that we were both very impressed with the level of security. Clearly, this area is growing and the tourism department is going to ensure that visitors are comfortable, and that the area is secure and well maintained. All in all, I can't wait to return to San Juan. I'd return to the Marriott in a heartbeat. If you are a business traveler, don't give it a second thought. You won't be disappointed.
