{"text":"Fantastic at The Conrad Just returned from another excellent holiday in Bali. This time we chose to book a 2 centre between Nusa Dua and Sanur as we had been in Sanur before.The Conrad was truly a 5 star hotel and excellent in every way imaginable. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room we had was a Club room as being a Hilton Honors member, and these rooms were great and could be purchased by non-members at a small premium. The upgrade is worthwhile as it will give you access to the Club Lounge for free cooked breakfast, soft drinks, coffee etc all day, afternoon pastries and then cocktails for 2 hours from 17.30hrs to 19.30hrs and the cocktails are fabulous and served with canapes etc.Free internet access is available in the lounge. The hotel grounds are fantastic and all based on a water them with water falls, lagoon pools etc. Pools are great and plenty of free sunbeds, water and cooling spray provided poolside along with towels and free of charge. Hotel is pricy for food and drink, for example a beer can be bought outside in a bar\/restaurant for 15000 rupiah incl tax and 45000 in the hotel plus tax. There is approx 17000 to the UK pound.Food and drink in the hotel are similar to hotel prices in the UK. Nothing much to do outside the hotel other than a few bars. For real shopping and nightlife you need to go into Kuta which is about 20 mins by taxi and costs about √ä√£¬¢3-√ä√£¬¢4 as taxis are very reasonable. Most of the resorts and hotels are very quiet and the locals put this down to the previous troubles, but as always the people are so friendly and need the tourists on the island. In short an excellent hotel and a bit pricy but you get what you pay for, as the other hotel we stayed at in Sanur was the Inna Grand Bali Beach and although good and much cheaper it does not compare to the Conrad, although the Grand Bali is supposedly a 5 star but more likely to be a 3 star. Don't let this detract you from the Grand Bali because it is excellent value or $65 incl taxes for a tower room and they are very nice with a balcony overlooking the Indian Ocean. This price includes breakfast and the website is www.innagrandbalibeach.comStopped off in Singapore for shopping as the huge sale season in Singapore is May-July and well worth it. Singapore Airlines are excellent and the best long haul carrier I have used after many years of travelling. Cabin crew attentive and genuine, with a smile on their faces for the full 13 hour flight from London to Singapore and then again for the 2 hour flight to Bali. Singapore Airlines are excellent. I booked the holiday independently and only cost √ä√£¬¢510 for the flight, √ä√£¬¢32 per night at the Grand Bali for 2 people, and √ä√£¬¢65 a night for 2 people at the Conrad.Oh one last bit was a rip off in Singapore when I bought a mobile phone and was supplied an out of date model. Went back to the shop 30 mins later and they wouldn't change the phone unless I gave them another $125. It was intimidating as the shop suddenly filled up with 'managers'. I had no choice other than to pay up or be left with a rubbish phone. Got home and the phone was found to be second hand and had a picture taken of the owner on it, plus accessories missing. If in Singapore avoid Singapore Connect Trading, 304 Orchard Road and 220 Orchard Road as they are not the nicest people to deal with if you have a problem. Stick to the reputable stores which is what I should have done.
