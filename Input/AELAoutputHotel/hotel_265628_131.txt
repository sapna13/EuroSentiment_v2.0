{"text":"Great service, friendly staff! We went with Apple vacations which I highly recommend. Met 2 different parites with Sunquest out of Canada that made it to the hotel only to find they didn't have a room and they had to go to another hotel for part of their stay!!It is indeed an hour from the hotel to the resort over extremely bumpy roads, take a dramamine! It was nice to look around though some of the scenery was not as scenic as you might imagine.Be careful and don't lock yourself out on the balcony! Couldn't get the door to lock when we were in the room but it sure locked us out easy enough! Our neighbors let us scale the dividor after no one answered at the front desk so we could go up and get a key!Check in was easy, room was adequate, clean and quiet--we stayed in the L building. We ate at the buffet for breakfast, it was more than adequate, omelette line, smoothie line plus cereal, breads, etc--look out for the rude Europeans who will push you out of line and jump the que! We ate the beach BBQ for lunch, hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken and made friends with Yael and Daniel at the beach bar. Traveling with Apple Vacations gets you a free safe, free room service and the ability to block 3-4 nights of special dinner reservations without waiting in line, yea! We ate at the Mexican restaurant one night--extremely slow, food ok; the steakhouse, good service but the food was only ok (my friend had chicken which she said was good but my tenderloin was some unknown cut of beef), then then Japanese restaurant which didn't follow the menu at all but which was very good---they have appetizers in the center of the room so you get what you want and then they cook up beef, chicken, calamari and shrimp on the grill in front of you and you get a little of everything.Antonio on the beach was great at getting people as involved as they wanted to be with dance lessons, beach games.We did not go to any of the shows, the disco nor the casino though people we heard talking seemed to like the shows.We went around to some beach shops near the property and were practically attacked as we crossed the invisible line---we quickly left and did not return, detest aggressive selling.Shops on both sides leading up to the hotel didn't have a lot--bring your own sunscreen, they sell it for $18 a bottle!So, people and service great, room fine, drinks great, food ok, would go again!
