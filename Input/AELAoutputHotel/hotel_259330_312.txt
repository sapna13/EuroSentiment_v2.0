{"text":"Wonderful Holiday ! We traveled to The Grand Paradise Bavaro from March 21-28. This was a Wednesday to Wednesday stay, and everything went smoothly. The airports are not as busy midweek, and check-in at the resort took no time at all.The resort is beautiful, and very clean. We travelled with another couple and requested rooms close by, not a problem. The room (Bldg 1) was very clean, and had a nice balcony. We did not request ocean view, but if you cranked your head over the balcony, there was the ocean! Bonus. Ask for 2 room keys. You need a key to run the electricity (air conditioner etc). We left one key in the slot all the time and our room was always cool. There was always purified water and soft drinks in the fridge. We tipped the maid daily with little gifts (earrings,nail polish, and several US dollars), leave on the pillow. I would suggest you take a small digital clock radio especially if you want to know the time in the middle of the night.There are plenty of lounge chairs both on the beach and around the pools. However if you want a specific location, get up early and place towels on the chairs. We spent several days under the cabanas at the beach as well as days around the quiet pool...and it was quiet. The other pool and kids pool were more active if that's your style. We packed a couple of pool noodles and they sure came in handy if you want to float around the pool. They sold inflatable rafts in the gift shop, or you could bring your own if you wish.There are plenty of bars, and they are busy all the time,but service is fast. Take a couple of Keg type thermos. They are happy to fill them with beer or whatever. It stays cold longer, and you can drink it from the keg or pour into a glass. If you enjoy wine, it is available all day long. It is light and quite pallitable.Every night we went to the Piano Bar for drinks before dinner. You can get the regular all inclusive drinks here, and for an extra cost they also have international drinks such as Johnny Walker Scotches etc.No complaints about the food. The buffet restaurant always had lots of choices, and each night had a different theme. We booked 3 a la carte restaurants, Italian,Steak House, and the best was our dinner at The Club....a short trolly ride to the sister resort. All the a la carte meals were gourmet, and the service was excellent. A suggestion would be to book your a la cartes as soon as you arrive and get your room number, even if your room is not ready, ask for the number. The reservations girl is at the top of the grand staircase in the lobby. We also enjoyed the no smoking rules in most of the restaurants!We also took insulated coffee mugs, filled them at the buffet and enjoyed our coffee on the beach or around the pool. If you like peanut butter on your toast...bring your own from home.Spend at least one afternoon at The Club. You can take the trolley or walk. They have a wonderful swim-up bar there.We have no complaints about Grand Paradise Resort. The service was great, and the staff were very friendly. Just remember, this is a 24 hour all inclusive resort, and some people party well into the night. If you are not one of them, take ear plugs!PS Hats off to Nolitours, they did a great job and the rep was very helpful...especially when our flight time was changed for the trip home. Good communications!
