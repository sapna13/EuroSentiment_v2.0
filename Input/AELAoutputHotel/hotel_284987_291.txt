{"text":"Absolutely Beautiful and Had a BLAST! After reading all the negative reviews here, I was a bit worried about my vacation at the Paradisus, but I've realized most of these folks just complain about EVERYTHING. I traveled with a group of 10 to the Paradisus on 7\/31 for a 5 night stay, and must say that we had an awesome time. Our shuttle bus pickup from the airport was prompt and our driver did not drive like a lunatic. I was actually surprised that the bus was a real shuttle bus operated by Paradisus, vs. a van that most tour operators use. Check in took literally 10 mins for us, as we had FREE upgrades to Royal Service. There is a different area for Royal Service Guests. RS will give you vip concierge service, your private butler, snacks mid day, and access to the RS pool, where there are no children allowed. If you do decide to purchase RS, its actually only 25.00 per person per night. We did have a tiny problem with one of the rooms smelling very moldy\/musty with damp bedding. However, that problem was resolved immediately. I must say that the rooms (we had an oceanfront RS room) are well decorated, spacious, and comfy. We also did not have a problem getting reservations to the restaurants. We were able to get reservations to every ala carte restaurant for a group of 10. The beach is really non existent, but the RS pool was so great that we didn't budge. Also folks, keep in mind that Paradisus i located about 45 mins from San Juan, so if you plan your day trips to old san juan\/san juan ahead. We ended up renting two sport utes for an entire day at about 110.00\/sport ute. I would definitely stay at the Paradisus again. ","annotations":[]}
