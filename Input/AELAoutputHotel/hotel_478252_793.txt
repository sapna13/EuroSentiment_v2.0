{"text":"Just returned from Punat Cana Gran Bahia !!!!!!! I just returned from a stay at the gran bahia March13-21st I booked from there web site through the Miami office. I had a minor problem that they did not handle and could not get them to return my call after my trip. We booked Golden club which I dont feel was worth the extra $200. WE did get a room close to the beach the room was very clean and nice. The maid was very helpful and considerate I tipped her every day. Our first day we discovered that in order to get a lounger at the beach or pool you have to wake up very early or late at night to reserve. This is not relaxing!!!!!!!! we leave the traffic at home.......that really was a negative. The beach is pretty warm water with sandy bottom very nice. Very loud music is played in the main beach area which I didnt like. I guess if you are young it isnt that bad!!!! The food is very good and the waitstaff are excellent. Very good bar drinks as well. If going with kids take walkie talkies. Im my opinion this hotel is not romantic way to crowded and noisy. Some peple like that. The spa is nice but they charge to use the water spa which I thought a rip off. They also should have some exercise classes and yoga at the spa indoors. They do have you as a captured audience so iron out all details befor you go if possible. Golden Club didnt provide really any services...... they were polite. I think the only way you can get a room close to the beach is going with Golden however there is a tram to all areas away from the beach. There is a casino, disco great shows and happy staff. The teens could have used more structured programs to meet eachother. I hope this is helpful to anyone planning a trip. THere were a lot of Canadians and Europeans which was very nice .Bon Voyage!
