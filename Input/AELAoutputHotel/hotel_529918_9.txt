{"text":"Great little gem in Paris I found the Hotel Plessis to be a fabulous find in Paris. I was a little sceptical as it was only √ä√£¬¢50 per night and a 2 star but i needant have worried. The hotel was very clean, with a decent sized room and the staff were very friendly and helpfull. There is also a good selection of maps etc at the reception that you can help yourself to inorder to get around Paris with ease.Our room also had a balcony but i am not sure if this is the case with every room. The bathroom was pretty small but had everything you needed, including a hair dryer and the shower had really good water pressure. I did not sample the breakfast in the hotel as there were plenty of places nearby but i did hear from other guests that it was good value for money (6 euro 50).The area in which the hotel is situated is very Parisian which is what i was looking for. There are plenty of resturants and bars nearby and i always felt safe in this part of town.The closest metro to the hotel is the Oberkampf which is roughly about 100 meters, howver the republic which is about a 5 minute walk is better to get around the city. This was my first time in Paris and i did manage to see most of the city and i thought the area in which the Plessis was in was by far a better choice and i have no doubt that when i come back i will definatley stay at this hotel again.
