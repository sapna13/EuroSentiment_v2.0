{"text":"Nice resort If you like being in a big resort with lovely grounds, nice air conditioned and spacious rooms, and a beautiful white sand beach, this is the place for you. If you enjoy an atmosphere where lots of folks are moseying up to the various buffets, bars and restaurants while being stuffed like Thanksgiving turkeys, this is the place for you. If you like to lay out by the large, inviting and beautiful pool, or on a lounge chair on the white sand beach while being blasted with loud music from one or two different places, this is the place for you. Basically, if you have no interest in the Dominican culture, people, or historical sights and just want to have a nice beach vacation at a reasonable price with all the amenities, this is the place for you. The Punta Cana\/Bavaro area in general is populated with one big mega resort after another, like several very large, landlocked cruise ships side by side. The down side of this resort is, of course, those pesky timeshare folks. We had to turn down our opportunity for a timeshare presentation 3 times, but they did take no for an answer a lot more quickly than other places we've been. If you relish the thought of overeating, the restaurants and buffets are numerous and the food plentiful. We found the large buffet mediocre, but there was always plenty of fresh fruit and many other choices. Some of it sits out a little too long, but no one in our group suffered from GI upset. The restaurants are pretty good, we found we liked the Japanese and French the best. Service is spotty, we found that we received both excellent and terrible service from different places at different points in our stay. Inconsistent service would probably be the best way to describe it. We also paid a premium price to access the internet with our wireless notebook  found that it was very, very, very slow  kicked us off at various times. Had we not paid a premium for the internet minutes, we would've just shrugged our shoulders and said, well, we're in the Dominican Republic, but having paid for a service that wasn't easy to use made us less forgiving. Fortunately, we had a car as we'd driven to the resort from Santo Domingo. We were able to explore the area. We generally found that, for us, the area overall lacked the charm and culture of other places we'd visited in the Dominican Republic.
