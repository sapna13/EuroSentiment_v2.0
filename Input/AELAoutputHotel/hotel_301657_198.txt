{"text":"Wonderful hotel! Great hotel in a perfect location! We stayed here 3 nights.The JR station is only about a 10 min walk, only the first time it's a little bit hard to find,but then it's easy. I disagree that the Tokyo metro is confusing. It's one of the easiest metro systems to use. We come from Helsinki with only 1 metro line and we didn't get lost one single time. Also we took a taxi from and to the Tokyo station (because of the luggage we had) and the bill was only about 1000 yen, which is really cheap. Overall we found Japanese taxi prices to be quite cheap in comparision to Finland. In general we haven't found Tokyo or Japan to be very expensive.There are many great restaurants near the hotel. The service was very good and the room perfect.We had a double room on the 34.floor (last floor) with a view of the Tokyo tower. The room was big enough and so was the bed (normal European size bed) and the bathroom (plenty of space for one person). Both hubby and I are medium built, and we had plenty of space in the bed. One would really need to be quite large to fall out of the bed or not to find enough space in the bathroom.Also the room wasnt noisy at all. The view is really spectacular and it's worth spending a few yen more to get a room with Tokyo tower view.Internet surfing is free. Also,all the hotel stuff spoke good English.Even using the hotel phone (which we had to do before our rented mobile arrived) wasn't too expensive.The area is within walking distance of Ginza.Ah yes,one receives also a free newspaper (in English) every morning. For those who like to watch tv even while on vacation, forget about it, everything is in Japanese. But there is plenty to see and do in Tokyo, so you won't have much time for it anyway.The Tokyo tower could be reached on foot from the hotel,it's only about 2-3 km away, but best is to get there with the metro.
