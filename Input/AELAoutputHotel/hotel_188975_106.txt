{"text":"Ultimate Luxury Hotel in Paris My wife and I and another couple stayed at this magnificent hotel for 3 nights in April 2007. It's certainly one of the nicest hotels I have ever seen. The physical environment is impressive. Gorgeous lobby in marble and luxury finishings. The flowers in the hotel lobby and restaurants alone must cost them thousands per day. The room was large by Paris standards, with a walk-in closet, large, lovely bathroom, and the bedroom was decorated beautifully with the most tasteful, lovely decor imaginable. We were in a back courtyard with trees, so the view was not special, but it was also very quiet. The location is superb. Near the Champs-Elysees and great shopping. Convenient to 2 Metro stations. They were always able to get us taxis, which is sometimes a problem in Paris. The service is over-the-top, typical for a Four Seasons. We only had breakfast in the restaurant, although they are supposed to be one of the best dining experiences in Paris. Thank goodness we had a special deal which included breakfast because otherwise it was 35 Euros per person for a continental breakfast! We did not have time to check out the spa\/exercise facilities, although I'm sure they were great. The concierges handled all our requests very competently. They seemd to be busy 24\/7 with their high maintenance guests. The guests themselves were quite the well-heeled sort, well-dressed, good-looking, wealthy types, etc. That may or may not suit you. And that brings me to my last point. If money is no object, why would you not stay at this hotel? However, if you either care about your wallet, or feel that it's important to get ultimate value for your dollar (or euro), you may ask yourself whether it's really necessary to spend this kind of money for a hotel room in Paris. Most tourists who come here are probably busy vsiting museums, sites, shopping, and doing all the things that Paris has to offer. So, like New York, how much time are you actually spending in the hotel anyway? Furthermore, there are really a lot of other choices in Paris Hotels where you can have a very nice experience for half the cost. So, ultimately, although this was a once in a lifetime experience, I would stay somewhere else next time I am in Paris. Not to detract from what was a very special trip.
