{"text":"Great Value! My wife and I, as well as two of our friends just returned from a two week trip to Bali. We found the Pelangi on line and checked out reviews on trip advisor. Our agent had never put together a package with this hotel before, preferring to place people in the quieter Nusa Dua or Benoa areas. We were encouraged by the predominantly positive reviews and booked for the two weeks, at what we thought was a very good rate. It was as good as we had hoped! The place is very clean, the staff very friendly and attentive. Our room was on the second floor and as nice as you would expect a  3 star  hotel to be. The air conditioning worked perfectly [ a must at these temperatures!] , and the room was cleaned daily and the towels and bedding changed daily if you wished. You can just have the bed remade and hang the towels to help reduce water consumption etc. an option that we chose immediately. There was a nice clean pool, plenty of towels, and loungers. Breakfasts were included and while not fantastic, there were lots to choose from and plenty of it. [ Sweet girls at the  egg station  ].The beach frontage is a bit busy with  hawkers  but they are not allowed past the front wall to the grounds. The surf is rather big and so it isn`t great for swimming here, so the pool is welcome. Seminyak is not as busy as Kuta but it is still too busy for many, so we chose to take a couple of 2 day trips to other areas. [ Got to see the real Bali that way! ]. There are plenty of restaurants to check out up the road behind the hotel as well as Gado Gado down the beach about 100 metres. [ excellent food and ambiance, especially at night. ] Lucky Day and Gateway to India were both good, as well as reasonably priced. [Even the warungs on the beach were ok] .We enjoyed our stay at the Pelangi, and would recommend it for those not expecting a 4 or 5 star experience. It was a great location and a bargain for the price! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":923,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":919}]}
