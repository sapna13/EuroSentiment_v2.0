{"text":"Not Grand, but very good My husband and I stayed at the Grand Oasis from March 24 - March 29, 2008. We stayed in Room 10209 in room block 10. Overall this was an above average hotel and experience but there were a few problems\/issues. If you are expecting perfection at this resort, you will not find it. But if you are looking for a good overall vacation this resort will be great for you.A few of the issues  - the resort is still finishing room block 10 and adding on. That means that part of the hotel is quite loud with construction noise. - if you want shade on the beach you must set your alarm for 6am and be prepared to defend your seats. We saw a big disturbance between some Europeans over shade and chairs - the rooms are not perfect: there is water damage from the shower leaking into the rooms, the air conditioning does not keep up making rooms damp and a little smelly.A few things that make this resort GREAT - the pools - the friendly staff - the Aqua rest. for breakfast - the beautiful ocean and beach - the cleaning staff - the friendliness of other vacationers - the outside main bar in the eveningsWe want to send a special thanks out to staff who made this vacation even better - Wander and Sandra in the American Grill, Martha in the main bar, Lebron in Aqua and the Apple Reps Sandy and Angel were absolutely terrific!We would go back to this resort but would probably venture onto another destination if available too.To compare - the Ocean Blue is much nicer and the Jack Tar in Puerta Plata is much worse. Grand Oasis is going to fall in the middle.We got a deal on this place - about $800US including tax and flight. For the money this was worth it.Resort pictures on not deceiving - it is a picture perfect place. ","annotations":[]}
