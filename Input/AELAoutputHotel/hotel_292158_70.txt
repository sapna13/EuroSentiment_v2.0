{"text":"Dream Holiday Became Reality Amazing My boyfriend and I stayed at the Grand Palladium Punta Cana from 5th June - 19th June and had the most amazing time. I really can not understand the bad reviews this hotel really does not deserve it. All I can say is the people writing bad reviews must have unrealistic expectations. We met lots of English and Americans and the staff treat everyone the same. Check in: Quick, friendly and yes they do speak very good english. We even asked for an upgrade but we were told we could at a cheap price but our room was very nice anyway! Could of easily got more money from us but did not. Very honest and helpfulRoom: Amazing, Jacuzzi, King size bed, separate shower and toilet, Clean, Comfortable beds and pillows, NO musty smell, No bugs. Face clothes provided, clean towels every day, Mini bar stocked daily. Maids: Fantastic, Friendly, Towel arrangements and flowers left daily. Pools: Very good, lots of sun beds and shade, pool side service. Pool was a little dirty one day after a tropical storm but was soon cleaned. Beach: Amazing, lots of beds, we had no problem finding shade. Very safe water. Food: I am a very fussy eater but both the buffet and ala cartes served very good food. Lots to choose from and very well cooked. Staff: Many people have said they do not speak English! We do not speak any spanish at all yet we had no problems having conversations will ALL of the staff. They were even teaching us Spanish!Drinks: Very generous with the alcohol! Excursions: Plenty to do. We did the helicopter flight, Bavaro Splash, Carribean Fetsival and the best was the Buggies by Exreme Adventure. Would return in a heart beat, do not worry just go! ","annotations":[]}
