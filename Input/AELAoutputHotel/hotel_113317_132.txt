{"text":"Awesome hotel! My wife and I stayed at the Casablanca from May 18 to May 24. We had an awesome stay. The staff was friendly and professional and went out of their ways to make our stay a pleasant one. This being our first time in NYC, we had to rely a lot on their suggestions and knowledge of the city and they never steered us wrong. The location of the hotel is great since we were virtually 30 seconds from the heart of Times Square. I was a bit worried about the noise before booking but I found, once there, that our room was nice and quiet.We loved the Rick's Cafe on the second floor. It was expertly staffed, the breakfast selection was good and the coffee was excellent. However, the friendly atmosphere fostered by the decor really took the cake. The seating arrangement promoted conversation amongst the various guest and this made for a very warm and friendly atmosphere. We don't drink so we did not take advantage of the complimentary wine in the early evening but we were told by other guests that it was in keeping with the Casablanca standards, which are first class all the way.The only downside was that we got a queen instead of a king size bed. However, they never promised a king. We were told at the time of booking that it would depend on availability.All in all, the Casablanca will be our hotel of choice for future stays in New York and I recommend it to all.
