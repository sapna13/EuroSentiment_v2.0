{"text":"Great Position, Very Clean Our room was not brilliant - next to the lift, which was not a problem in itself, but smaller because of this, and with a window that looked out onto a concrete wall! If your room number ends in '01', you will have one of these rooms! Decorated the same as all the others, though, and spotlessly clean. Bathroom big enough with all you needed and fresh towels everyday. Even a small fridge for you to use. Breakfast ok - plenty there - but only the British truly know how to cook bacon and sausage! Scrambled and boiled eggs, cereals, bread for toast, rolls, jam,butter,cold meats, cheese, wine!, juices, tea and coffee. Ate in the cafe when we got there - ok if you are too tired to go elsewhere. Staff friendly enough, chap on reception quite helpful when I got my purse stolen - take care - even if you are sure you are being careful, as I was, they still get you.Do use the Bus Touristic - fab value and take you everywhere you need.Also ate at the Hard Rock Cafe - brilliant all round. Good value, good service, great food, and great place.Had a good time, despite my purse being stolen, which could have ruined it, as it was my birthday money!Great position for hotel, as just off Las Ramblas which is absolutley packed all the time, so being just round the corner is ideal. Also with Cataluyna Sqaure being at the end of the road this is useful as all the bus routes stop here, including the Bus Touristic.If you do choose this hotel, you should not be disappointed - not luxurious, but very clean, food ok, staff pleasant, and free internet access from 7am to 11pm.
