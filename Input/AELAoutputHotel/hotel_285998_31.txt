{"text":"Romantic and stylish stay Like many other hotels in Spain, this hotel was accommodated in an old building. It was a lovely small hotel. We stayed three nights there, two nights in a junior suite and one night in a standard room. Originally we planned to stay all the three nights in the junior suite but it was already full for the final night when I made the reservation (almost one month ahead already). So, make the reservation earlier.LocationThe hotel was situated in the heart of the Barri Gotic. Very close to the plaza (within 2 mins walk) where the Correfoc and the Castellers show were during the biannual festival. The hotel was not located right on the major road, not easy to find. Ask the hotel to pick you up at the plaza or the metro station.RoomBoth the standar room and the junior suite were fantastic. Tastefully appointed, plasma TV, beautiful and good quality toiletries, mood lighting...... All made you feel being pampered. I really liked the room and the bathroom. It was not difficult to note that they used high quality materials \/ accessories to decorate the room. Worth the little extra for the junior suite. If you can't book a suite, a standard room is still good enough.ServiceWarm and friendly. We were taken care of all the time by the staff. They offered a welcome drink made from rose petals, it was romatic but tasted a bit strange (like drinking liquid soap). Nothing was too much trouble. Similing face on every staff.FoodWe tried a breakfast there. Lots of food and presented in a special way. Not good value but worth a try. It was a playful experience.FacilitiesThis was the weakest aspect of the hotel if you compared it with big five star hotels. There was a small library on the G\/F and bikes for rental. I like this hotel very much. It was my favorite in my whole journey in Spain. It was a lovely and stylish boutique hotel embraced with culture and history. ","annotations":[]}
