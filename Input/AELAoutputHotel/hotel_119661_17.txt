{"text":"Great Value, Great Room, Great Experience! We had a marvelous stay at this motel the first week of March 2008. We are former San Franciscans so we are familiar with the neighborhoods and upon each visit want an experience that will allow us to simply live comfortably in this city we still love. The Broadway Manor Inn did just that. Thanks to a hotels.com coupon, my hubby and I were able were able to secure a large, clean deluxe King room for seven nights at a scandalously low rate. The room was extra large with a very, very comfortable bed. We also had no trouble securing the extra pillows we like.The wireless internet worked extremely well in our room (210), although we were told that it was somewhat spotty in rooms above the 2nd floor.The room fridge  microwave got quite a work out from us, though there aren't supermarkets too near, so it's a trek to fill up that fridge, unless you make good use of Zipcar as we did. We didn't use the room coffee maker, since the coffee downstairs at Peter D's diner was soooooooo delicious and easy to get each morning.Most of the time we used public transportation, since the hotel is central to several convenient bus lines. This location is also one block away from many delicious options for food on Polk St.Negatives: 1. The housekeeping service knocked on our door, despite our Do Not Disturb sign, to clean our room on a day when I was planning to catch up on sleep. This wasn't a big deal, but it did interrupt my rest.2. The ice machine was broken the entire time we were there. Again, not a serious problem.3.There was a problem with the card key machine midway through our stay, so for the rest of the week, we had to get someone from the desk to open our room door. However, this wasn't anyone's fault and with pleasant staff present 24 hours, this really wasn't a major difficulty. Overall, we would highly recommend this property to anyone looking for an inexpensive stay in one of the world's most beautiful cities. However, if you need that beauty to follow you into your hotel room this is not the place for you.
