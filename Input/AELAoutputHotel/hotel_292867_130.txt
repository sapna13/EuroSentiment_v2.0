{"text":"very pleasant After reading many of the reviews here, I was very nervous about going, but shouldn't have been. First, I should say, that we've only been to one other resort, and don't usually go on the type of vacation, where you just stay around the hotel. Nevertheless, our goal was to just have a few relaxing days with our 4 year old at the pool and beach, and we had just that! I guess going in with low expectations helped us. Even though our room wasn't supposed to be ready until 3, it was ready when we arrived at 2, just when our daughter was melting down from fatigue. Our room, (the supersaver standard size) was much bigger than I expected, with a sunken seating area extending past the beds. Everything was clean, but the pillows were quite lumpy, as if stuffed with cotton balls. We had one instance, where the maid forgot to refresh our towels and water, but as soon as we called, it was sent to us. I enjoyed the fact, that it was an international clientele, not just Americans, although some of the Europeans didn't even try to speak Spanish with the staff, which irked me. I speak very limited Spanish, but everyone can say gracias, right? I agree with everyone else, that the pools and beach were lovely, although seeing the pool strewn with used straws and cups, is not a pleasant sight. We found the staff to be always attentive and super friendly. The buffet was always satisfactory and provided something for every taste. We also dined at the Dominican and Brazilian restaurants, which were very pleasant experiences, both due to the service and the food. Another suggestion to the hotel would be to provide drink menus at the bar, so that one could explore something beyond the standard pina colada. In summary, I think because we did not arrive expecting a full luxury perfect resort, we had a great time and would recommend it to another family with the same expectations. ","annotations":[]}
