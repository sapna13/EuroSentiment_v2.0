{"text":"Lush, friendly environment, good memories to be had I work within a travel agency and every now and then we get really good deals on staff specials with air and taxes included it came to a total of 580$ CAD. While reading the review on this resort, I became really discouraged, it seemed that most people had a lot more negative things to say then positive. but I figured I was getting an awesome deal, and I would make the best out of it anyways.We arrived late at night the service was fast and organized, when we got to our room there were 3 beds, and there was only the two of us. the next morning we brought this to the attention of the front desk, which they were more then happy to change our room. when we got the key and check out the room we decided to stay in our original room (662) due to the fact that I found it more spacious. The third bed that was in the room, I ended up putting it outside and sleeping out there, to my surprise there were not a lot of bugs.on the days to follow I explored the place, it was very lush with visible banana, coconut and even grape trees, the beaches had white sand, and TONS of coral to go snorkeling, there was no need to worry about waking up real early in order to grabbed a beach chair. There were paddle boats, little canoes and sailboats you could rent, free of charge. if you walked along the shore you would find a marketplace that you could bargain with them, but if you aren't in the mood, you can head off to the market strip where there are a dozen different shops, but mostly sell the same things. many people had many complaints about the food in their reviews, may I mention that I am a vegetarian and had no problem filling my little tummy, the fries were awesome and so where the nachos... Yummy... but if you are looking for luxury this is not the place for you, if you want a fun or relaxing time at an affordable price this could not be more of a better place to be. there are also two other rius you can visit and have lunch or diner at, which pretty much has the same food as the RIU taino, but if your looking for a different scenery, why not give it a try. (except that there or no outsiders allowed on the Riu Palace). if you do end up that way you can get a better look at the ship stranded within the coral, its been there for 36 years, it got stuck there from a hurricane, or so I was told. I was also told that the entertainment there was good, not that I ever went to see it, now... wishing I had.On my last night there I was at the disco I had stayed there until late into the night, or should I say early morning, when I had gotten back to the room I notice the sun was beginning to rise, I rushed to put on my bathing suite, grabbed a few beer and towels, we headed down to the beach and watched the sunrise, over the calm water, I took a swim into the ocean, the water at that time was perfect!!!! I must say it was a once in a life time experience, or maybe it was because I was still drunk from the night before...? However it is defiantly worth getting up early or staying up late to watch the sunrise over the water!something that I failed to read in any of the reviews were anyone mentioning that it was mostly Spanish speaking people visiting the resort, there were very few other English speaking people, however we managed to meet a others that were on the same flight as us on the way in, and from the states.so in short this place can be as great or as horrible as you will... and if you tip the cleaners ladies they will always leave a beautiful decorative surprise upon your return to your room.
