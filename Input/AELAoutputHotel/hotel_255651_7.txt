{"text":"There was good. There was Bad. Mostly Bad. Booked into this hotel for work for 3 nights whilst I was on a training course near the airport. I could stay there again if I had to √à√\u2020\u2022?but next time I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° rather stay at the Holiday Inn if I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ after a Airport Hotel.The good:Room was fresh, clean and modern looking. All facilities worked well. I found the bed rather hard, but then I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ a person who likes my beds on the softer side √à√\u2020\u2022?so it may suit others. The amenities were nice and I appreciated having the iron and ironing board. Room was quite large too.The Bad:The rooms are paper thin. I could hear the guy in the room next to me speaking to his girlfriend on the phone. I could even hear HER telling him how much she loved him.The Hotel is located out near the international terminal. There is nothing around in terms of shops and restaurants so you are limited to eating in-house. I suffer from food allergies from heavily processed foods √à√\u2020\u2022?I was sick each time I ate in the hotel, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ obvious the food they are producing is coming from packets. Feeling ill from bad food, one night I just wanted some simple soup from room service and what I got was so obviously a packet of French onion soup that they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even add any cheese or garnish to in order to disguise it. It was revolting.Dinner in the restaurant was a bit of a debacle on the first night. Note √à√\u2020\u2022?if you plan to eat there you need a reservation unless you come very early. I witnessed very tired guests who had travelled internationally being turned away as there was no room for them to have dinner. It is also VERY expensive. You have the option paying for 2 or 3 courses. I chose 2 and had a soft drink and it cost me more than $60 for an √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¥k√à√\u2020\u2022?meal.Breakfast in the morning (full and continental buffet) was far better.Also note √à√\u2020\u2022?the shuttle bus to the airport fills up quite quickly. Again I witnessed people having to book cabs to go to the airport.The internet access is a utter rip off. $11 for 1 hour, or $24 for 24 hours. I chose the 1 hour option and tried to get all my work done in a short space of time√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>Staff are friendly √à√\u2020\u2022?but aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ all that sure of themselves it seems. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ guessing they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe had a recent influx of new employees who are just finding their feet.In all √à√\u2020\u2022?I think there are better choices, but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ an OK hotel if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ plan to eat there and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ only for a couple of nights.
