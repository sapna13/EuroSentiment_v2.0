{"text":"Great Place to Stay for the Price I booked this hotel based on reviews at tripadvisor.com and I was not disappointed. The rooms are a bit outdated, but they are very large and clean. Through the web site, we requested extra pillows and a refrigerator (for a $5 a day charge) and both were in place when we arrived. A big draw for us was the free parking which was great.We stayed two nights at the beginning of our California vacation and two nights at the end of the vacation. On the first visit, we were on the Lombard St. side of the hotel, and it was pretty noisy, but there is a partially obstructed view of the GG Bridge, so that was kind of nice. The noise wasn't horrible (compared to some places I have stayed in NYC) but it might bother sensitive people. On the second visit, we were on the back side of the hotel, on Moulton St., and it was a bit quieter. There was still a little noise, but it was much better.The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and there was plenty of hot water and water pressure in the shower. The front desk staff was very friendly and offered suggestions on places to eat and things to see. The hotel is close to public transportation and there are plenty of places to eat in the neighborhood. The best place that we found for dinner was Silver Clouds. It appears to be a bar, but we had a very nice meal there. The early bird special (before 7:30) was $10.95 and included salad, entree (such as grilled salmon or osso buco), pasta, veggies, and dessert. There are also lots of neighborhood restaurants\/bars and unique shops on Union Street (not Union Square) which is a couple of blocks away.Security seems good. You must use a room key to access the elevator from the parking garage or lobby levels. If you have a car, park in the garage on the lobby level when you arrive since you won't have a key for the elevator.Wireless internet access was free and worked well from the room.There was no free breakfast and no microwave available, but other than that, everything was great. Also, there was no pool, but it was too cool to swim outdoors while we were there anyway.
