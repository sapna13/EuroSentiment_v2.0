{"text":"Afordable Luxury The hotel will fall short of expectations for those who are used to Ritz and Four Season styled luxuries of this world. For others, including us (husband, wife  our 18 month old son), this is a perfect choice. Why? Because it is affordable luxury at its best. Here is a sumary of our 4 night experience at the IC:Bookings:Got an excellent rate through Asia Best Hotel website. Reconfirmed the booking status with the hotel directly through e-mail. Since we had a child, couple of extra services were needed (especially for bottle sterlization). Hotel reply was positive. Made couple of routine requests to the hotel directly through e-mail. We were informed that at the time of check-in hotel staff will try to fullfill these requests. The hotel replied to our queries promptly, even though we did not book our room direclty with the them.Check-in  check-out:It was quite efficient. At check-in I was asked to produce the booking voucher sent to me by the Asia Best Hotel. All our requests were granted. Got a king bed at a higher floor. Even an early check-in was granted (we were there before 1 pm). Reception staff were friendly and smiling. Some of the hotel reviews mention a bad check-in experience. To avoid such an experience I have this habbit of exchanging some e-mails direclty with the hotel, even if I have used hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ own website. It solves lots of problems. A bad experience can ruin the holidays. Check-out was even more smooth. Lift:Yes it is an issue. Hotel check-in staff don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ drop any hint on how to us the elevators. Basically when in the lift look for a slot to insert your room key (it is located beneath the floor numbers). Take out the room key from the slot and press the floor button. This basically is a security feature to restrict the movement of Non-hotel guests .Hotel  Rooms:It is a lovely hotel. The aroma of Lemon Grass circulates in the main areas on the hotel. Rooms are impressive. Fairly large at 33 sqm. Nicely decorated. King size bed is very comfortable. Rooms are sound proof. Plasma or LCD TV is in the room. Airconditioing system is very good. Guests can increase or decrease the temperature settings to their comfort. Bathroom is luxurious with a sperate tub and a shower closet. Water pressure in the shower closet is nice.Breakfast:We had breakfast in the hotel only once. Why? Because we overslept the other days. In nutshell it was delicious and with plennty of options. Not to be missed. We did not have dinner or lunch at the hotelStaff:I think where this hotel falls short of Ritz  Four Seasons is the lack of personalized touch. But otherwise the staff was always helpful. They would sterlize the feeding bottles for our baby, however, they would not take down the complete instructions first. Twice we had to re-send the bottles back. Due to excesive shopping we needed a carton. Hotel arranged two within a few hours. Given the size our luggae, hotel also called a mini-van to take us to the airport.Taxi:At times there was a small queue at the hotel for Taxis. But the wait was tolerable. Never more than a few minutes. AT other places Taxi is an issue. We had to wait for 20 minutes at shopping malls for example. Easy way out is to call the cab. They charge a few dollars more.Location:As a tourist, I loved the location. Close to everything. There is a 24 hours small store across the hotel. Covered shoppoing mall adjacent to the hotel is very nice. The one across this mall is good as well. I would suggest to check out these two places before heading for the orchid road. For lunch try the resturant in the covered shoppng mall (I think it is call Terra). Excellent deal (Singapore $ 12). Loved the thai seafood noddles.
