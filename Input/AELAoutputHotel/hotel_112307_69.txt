{"text":"Great boutique experience My wife and I have had great experiences at Hotel Vitale, another Joie de Vivre property. When I received a third night free offer from JDV, I had to check it out. I was traveling to the Bay Area on business in early December and wanted to stay in the city. Hotel Rex looked great online, so I made reservations. After some serious flight delays, I arrived at the hotel (which is conveniently located in the Union Square area). Bonnie welcomed me at the front desk. (I think she's a famous actress, but moonlights on the night shift at the hotel due to insomnia.) I roamed around the large lobby, taking in the original art works, books and historic architecture. The literary theme was fun, manifested in quotes by famous writers just outside of the elevator entrances on each floor. My room was spacious, modern and quiet. The restaurant the next morning was excellent, as was the service. I was headed north that morning to Petaluma, and south the next morning to Palo Alto, so the location was perfect. Complimentary wine in the evening pulled some interesting people from their rooms and walking tours. We had conversations about books under their arms, and chatted about our home towns. The front desk had great restaurant suggestions that evening. I ended up taking a short walk up the street to a Pan-Asian restaurant that was really great. Best of all, the hotel was a great value. Valet parking was an extra charge, but very easy if you planned ahead. If you like boutiques, I highly recommend Hotel Rex. ","annotations":[]}
