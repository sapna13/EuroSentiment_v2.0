{"text":"Fantastic but Beware of the Mosquitoes We traveled to this resort from 9-17 February 2008 and absolutely loved it. We want to go back next year for 2 weeks. Hope this review helps you make your decision.Resort: The resort is basically 3 hotel-resorts in 1. There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the BP Ambar on the left which is adults only and then there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ 2 exact resorts which are mirror images of themselves: the BP Bavaro and the BP Punta Cana to the right of the Ambar. The resort compound is huge and you can walk freely between the 3 resorts. There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ also a trolley that takes you from the reception of each of the 3 hotel to the beach and back. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ about a 10 min. walk from either reception lobby to the beach. The grounds are maintained beautifully.Beach: The beach is stunning. We loved the fact that it was really wide and long with lots of mature palm trees on the beach and lots of palapas (the huts for shading). There are enough palapas to go around that you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to play cut-throat and leave your towel at night to reserve one. We would get to the beach around 8-10am and there were always available palapas to choose from.Food: The food was amazing. We both put on 5 lbs during our 1-week stay and that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ despite being active (we ran\/walked 40 km during the week!). Each hotel resort has it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ own buffet restaurant so you are not over crowded at the restaurant. Every night is a different food theme and there are many types of meat, fish, vegetables and starches to choose from. The salad, cold-cuts and cheese table is very good with fresh produce to choose from. They even had sushi rolls on a few evenings and it was delicious! (watch out for the wasabi√à√\u2020\u2022?it is very spicy!). You can also make up to 3 reservations at the a la carte restaurants. Because it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ such a huge complex, you have about 10 restaurants to choose from. We went to the seafood restaurant √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¨l Pescador√à√\u2020\u2022?(lobster is extra if you want it √à√\u2020\u2022?20$ US) which was good, the French restaurant √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºe Gourmet√à√\u2020\u2022?which was outstanding (best fillet mignon with 5 pepper sauce I ever had!) and the Japanese restaurant √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢aiko√à√\u2020\u2022?which was really good and an enjoyable culinary experience as the chef cooks the food in front of you on the hot plate. The nice thing about the a la carte restaurants is that you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to stand in line everyday to reserve it√à√\u2020\u2022?you can make all your reservations (all 3 of them) at one time so you are done for the week.Service: We found the service to be very good. We typically left $1 US to the maid every day on the pillow, $1 US at the buffet restaurants (at breakfast, lunch and dinner), and on those nights that we went to the a la carte, we left $5 US. We also always had courteous and speedy service at the numerous bars on the resorts.Accommodations: We stayed in villa 28 and it was beautiful. The room was always well cleaned and turned over by the maid who left us daily works of art made out of towels. The room was well ventilated and there was not that typical √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢umid smell√à√\u2020\u2022?you often experience in rooms when you travel to the Caribbean. Granite bathroom counter tops and a whirlpool bathtub completed the ensuite.Entertainment: We can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really comment as we did not partake in the beach activities nor attend the evening shows. The nice thing is though, the animation crew doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ come and bug people on the beach to participate in their activities.Mosquitoes: Beware, there are lots of mosquitoes in the evening! Punta Cana is also identified as a location prone to Malaria so make sure you get your shots before you leave√à√\u2020\u2022? We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ and are hoping we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get infected by those damn stingers!Miscellaneous: There is construction going on at the far end of the resort behind the Ambar. The cost of the safe is $30 US for the week and reading other reviews, it is highly recommended that you get it. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have any incidents with stolen articles. There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ an internet caf√ã√\u2022√ñ in the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√üueblo Principe√à√\u2020\u2022?where you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l get 60 minutes for $12 US (good for 5 days and expires at noon on the 5th day.). The resort is overbooked (but we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have issues) and they are promoting other BP resorts in La Samana area (the Cayo Levantado and the Cayacoa). They say they will give $200 US per room per night for people who will agree to leave Punta Cana and go try their other resorts.
