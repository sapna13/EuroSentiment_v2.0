{"text":"Another excellent visit This was our second time in Boston and second time at Jurys. Check-in staff and porters were as friendly, polite and helpful as we'd remembered them and the room (deluxe doubles, 9th floor) was spot on. I like this hotel because there is very little (if any) noise from adjoining rooms. However, here was a fair amount of noise from the street on this visit (commencing around 8am and continuing until tea time) because of a big building project going on just along Stuart St. If you are staying in the next few weeks I'd advise that you ask for a room that does not face onto Stuart Street.Some free tourist stuff for you: Fort Independance (South Boston),open at weekends only and easy to reach by T and bus #9. Historic fort with great tours, pleasant beach and views of harbour.USS Constitution is also free to visit and easy to get to. If you have a week saver T ticket it is also valid for the boat trip from Long Wharf to Charlestown Navy Yard at no cost. A great way to arrive. This is easily combined with a climb up the Bunker Hill Monument.My husband highly recommends the Samuel Adams Brewery Tour (few dollars donation requested). Trip round the brewery and a generous sampling session with souvenir glass (word of warning - children are admitted on the tour but not allowed in the bar where the sampling goes on). T to Stony Brook and a couple of minutes walk at most.
