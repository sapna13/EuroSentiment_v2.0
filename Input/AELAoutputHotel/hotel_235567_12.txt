{"text":"25th anniversary choice The Keppler is as advertised. We arrived, jet-lagged and shown to an executive room which smelled of smoke. Not the greatest of introductions, but the hotel made it right. They put us in a suite that night but then had to move the next day (sad - the suite was really nice. Even had a view of the Eiffel Tower). As it was our 25th anniversary, a nice bottle of bubbly was chilling in our room when we arrived.We ended up in an Executive Room on the 3rd floor. It faced the courtyard which is actually quite pleasant. Without exaggeration, it was THE QUIETEST room I've ever stayed in. I can say that because I travel with a mini recording studio and microphone. The air-conditioning seeps through an unobtrusive vent above the bed and doesn't make a sound either.A real bonus for me and my midnight recording session hookups back to the States.The staff was fabulous. Especially Phillipe. You might think this strange, but we never even looked at the breakfast room. Its not that I'm cheap. Well, okay, so I'm a little cheap... but I really prefer eating the way the locals do. We walked down the street to a cafe for the BEST croissants I've ever had. So much so that I actually preferred the plain to the chocolate! Oops- sidetracked. I just couldn't bring myself to spend 22 Euros PER PERSON for breakie... Oh, and maybe some of that is because if you need internet which I did - it's expensive too. 88 Euros for 5 days or 22 per day (ouch).Despite this the stay was fantastic and I highly recommend this hotel. The fabrics, decor and cleanliness where stellar. And this is coming from an EXTREMELY picky hotel guest. Strange thing - the street is RUE KEPLER, but the hotel is spelled KEPPLER (two P's). Strange indeed.PS - just down the street is VELIB the Paris bike rental system. DO IT. It's really fun and easy.PPS - Try a Parisian macaroon. anywhere. Two places I can highly recommend for them are PAULS (multiple locations) and the mother of macaroon shops on the Champs, LADUREE. WOW.
