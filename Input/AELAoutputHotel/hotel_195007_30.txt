{"text":"Faultless In Florence I arrived 30 minutes before check in time but was warmly greeted at Reception. A first - the person who checked me in then took me to my room. I had been upgraded to a WorkOut Room. This is very modern with running machine (not used) and weights and a complimentary bottle of Chianti for me (used!) I was offered an alternative if I wished, but although different it was lovely -on a split level with 3 high level windows overlooking the rooftops of Florence. The Heavenly King Bed was just that - heavenly! It was very quiet and akin to having my own apartment in Florence (this room is not typical I would imagine - others appear more traditional though equally special).I had a two course meal on room service which at 45 Euros including all service charges I thought was reasonable (the quality was excellent).Breakfast isn't cheap (but I reserved in advance at 27 Euros). There is a huge choice though at the buffet. As I was returning to Pisa airport on the day of a train strike the person checking me in obtained all details of an alternative Terravision 'bus service which the conciege could sort out.I could continue but suffice to say I have never received such personal service from a large hotel. From check in to check out I felt I was in an oasis of calm and friendliness. The hotel is around a 5 minute walk to the train and 'bus station and around the same to the main sites (though longer if you stop for delicious ice cream en route!)
