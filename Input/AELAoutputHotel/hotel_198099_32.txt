{"text":"Loved the place My travel agent recommended this hotel and what a treasure it turned out to be. We stayed from 6-12 October in room 404.The room is of moderate size, smaller than an american style room and larger than european style rooms. Our 4 suticases fitted in the room with no problem. The bathrooms are granite and new with good strong water pressure from the shower and a huge tub for soaking your weary bones in.The staff all speak very good english and are ever so helpful. The subway is a 2 minute walk in front of the opera and a 5 minute walk to the huge department stores Galleries Lafayette.There are many restaurants in the area, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Italian and around the corner is a great litte Lebanese restaurant called Tyrz and the owner is charming and speaks great english.Over the main road on Avenue L'Opera on DuMarche is a little town square with several restaurants that are fantastic.On Rue Monsigny there is a coin operated laundry for those who need to do laundry and the girl there also speaks english.This is a great hotel, great staff, European breakfast was included in the rate with an option for scrambled eggs at $4.00Euros extra for those who wish.I became very ill and the staff called in the doctor and I was in bed for last 2 days and the staff could not do enough to make my stay better. On the last day they allowed me to stay in the room til 4pm until my flight left to help me recover.I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay again next year when I return.
