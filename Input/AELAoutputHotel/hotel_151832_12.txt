{"text":"Wonderful My bf and I went to Acacia after we took the southern caribbean cruise and we LOVED it!! Upon walking in, i was pleasently surprised as to how much nicer it was than what i had expected. The people we nice and very helpful. I booked a room with one king bed and ended up with a room that had 2 and was right in front of thier pool size jacuzzi!!! It was very affordable and clean-- very spacious. We also had a big flat screen in our room which was nice. I loved this more than a big hotel because it is more intimate and you get the real feel of san juan. You really are steps from the beach and can see the ocean from the jacuzzi. I was happy. The only complaint that I have was that there was construction going on outside of out bathroom window on the street ---------and with a very thin window, you could hear the jackhammer but, it wasnt that bad because they started around 9 am. Those things have to be done sometome...You shouldnt even be in your room that much cause it is such a cool place! I would def stay there again. FYI-- Acacia is newer and nicer than At wind chimes (thier sister hotel). THe bar at At Wind Chimes is nice and the barteders were great. ALSO--- the food at Niche is excellent.... considered one of the best in condado\/san juan area. Be prepared to spend at least $12-15 for cabs to old san juan area---- you will be spending a good amount of time in that area becuase that is where all the cool shops\/bars etc are. I def suggest going to old san juan. I will add pics and comments soon. EES ","annotations":[]}
