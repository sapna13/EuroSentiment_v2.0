{"text":"Hotel Perseo - a Returned Guest We have stayed at Hotel Perseo before the renovations - and what a make-over it has been! Modern appointments in the room from cable TV to 5-Star bathroom fitouts, to modern bedside lights to airconditioning to a delightful re-fit of the compact but well appointed bar \/ breakfast room with a typical modern italian makeoverThe bed was great, the room was big (for a European 3 star hotel room), the bathroom was espicially a delight, compared to other hotels we have stayed at with the same star rating. Everything was new, clean, visually pleasing and worked!We found out whilst we were there that the co-owner, Louise Monk, an ex-pat Australian and married to her architect  designer husband, Giacinto has incorporated features and a design aspect that we would normally associate with the upmarket American  Asian hotels, not the squashy \/ couldn't swing a cat in the place aesthetics normally associated with this level of European hotel.A delight to stay in and because it is right smack in the middle of Florence, (step out the front door and throw a stone and you will hit the front doors of the Duomo) it is great value across so many aspects.A definite winner and well worth experiencing the quaintness of Europe by finding the reception on Level 3 of this building - it feels like you have somehow found a hiden treasure, that you want to keep secret from the rest of the tourist world, in case the word gets out and you can't get a bed there when next in town.8 out of 10Paul ConnellyManaging DirectorSareen StoneSydney, Australia ","annotations":[{"endOffset":465,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":458},{"endOffset":465,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":458},{"endOffset":465,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":458},{"endOffset":984,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":984,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":984,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":984,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":984,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":977}]}
