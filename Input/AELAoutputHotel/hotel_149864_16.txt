{"text":"In depth information on Punta Cana Taking a cab in any new part of the world is always a challenging experience. You usually get a little feeling of how it will be while still inside the airport but even the most travelled of travellers won''t know until he gets in whatever is available local transportation. Our experience is not much different from others so we''re wondering will we get there safely and how much will we be ripped off. Many countries don''t use a meter and charge the ride √ã√ë√∏ la t√à√Æ√∂te du client. So on Monday morning we got into our taxi and with a clear ''Ola, al Club Med por favor'' we were on our way.Not quite sure whether it would take us 10 minutes or the whole morning to get there we sat back and enjoyed the scenery and the driver''s skills to make this trip feel like a roller coaster ride. 30 minutes later we''re almost there and I am ready to have my holiday money drastically reduced by a now over excited cabdriver. He takes out his little book which looks like the reader''s digest on how to get money from tourists to em, flips to page 30 something and goes 35 daollars por favor. Strange, that''s what they told me at the hotel too when we left but they weren''t sure. Guess what, they have fixed rates from A to B and it is all in the little pocketbook, so I actually didn''t need to worry about. He''s happy and we''re even more happy that we don''t have to appreciate his driving skills anymore.
