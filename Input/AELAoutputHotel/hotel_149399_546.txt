{"text":"The worst stay away This was the worst vacation experience I have ever had. Please search for  read the negative reviews for this hotel - pay attention to them. I do not know why they seem to be from long ago, but believe me this place is hideous. I have been all around the world and this is inexcusable.First you need to know the food is inedible. Totally inedible. In the 20 hours we spent there, the only thing we could find to eat that was safe were 2 bags of peanut MM's from the store, and an omelet from breakfast. Lunch and dinner were surprisingly hideous. The smell of the food was bad enough, but I knew once I tasted it to not swallow. We ran into SEVERAL people who were violently ill. One group had 6 out of 8 hospitalized. They had NO doubt as did I that it was due to the food. I have read many of the negative reviews on this site (hard to locate, but just search by negatives) - there are SO many reports of horrible food -- Please do NOT disregard these!We paid for first class plane upgrades to get out of there as fast as possible in case we were going to get sick as we wanted to be in an American Hospital.The hotel is pretty to look at, but huge and disorganized. You can NOT FIND your room. The signs are horrid, and the staff is NOT helpful. They are disinterested and point you in the wrong direction. Many people are wandering around lost.Our room was totally musty smelling and they changed us (but it took hours), and the next room while better was still hideous. This was the worst vacation experience in my life, and it was totally due to the hotel. Soup to nuts it was hideous.
