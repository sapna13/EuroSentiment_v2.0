{"text":"A nice Marriott! We have recently stayed at this hotel- first time visitors to this particular Marriott -and found it most impressive. One thing that immediately struck - this is a LARGE hotel- much more so that suggested by websites etc. Whilst we were there - mid June - it was busy throughout, and seemed to have a mixture of business and leisure guests, although it was obvious that it is heavily used and promoted for business users. Rooms were very pleasant - all had balconies - and nicely decorated, if just a little lacking in table\/ storage space -no drawers of any consequence, and one large table. A minor matter that caused no inconvienience tho. The bed was superb - extremely comfortable. Bathroom amenities\/ turndown service\/ housekeeping all of high standard. The pool areas, as discussed within this forum, are without doubt, the highlight of the property. No problems in finding lounger space- even tho the hotel was full. We only ate at tthe Blue Sage for breakfast, and had no complaints there. As seems to be common with a lot of Marriott properties, there is the usual time-share \/ condo sell, with representatives and desks evident - even messages left on the phone to come down and see us ! As stated - this is a large hotel, as a consequence, lots of car parking space required - be aware, it is a good 5-10 minute walk from parking the car to getting in the hotel, although there were some eager valets available should you wish.Overall- I was more than happy to have chosen Desert Ridge, with no substantial complaints at all.
