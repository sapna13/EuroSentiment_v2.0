{"text":"Honeymoon from Hell First off, I was surprised to see that this hotel had reviews that were way different than mine. This hotel was horrible.I recently came back from my honeymoon which we stayed for 7nights @ The Ilikai. We were expecting a 4star hotel where we could relax and have a good time in Waikiki. BIG MISTAKE1. The first two days we stayed at the hotel, we were rudely awakened at 830am by an emergency alarm system that went off for over 10 minutes. When we called the front desk, the worker said, Yeah, we know. We're working on it. No apology for the inconvenience or explanation as to what was going on.2. Upon looking over the TV guide, we noticed there were movies out that could be purchased. (typical at a hotel). But to our dismay, no movies could be ordered at that time due to some maintenance they were doing to their system.3. They had a tiny pool with no jacuzzi. What's a honeymoon without some leisure time in the spa??4. The hotel desk said they made a manager's decision to eliminate room service at the hotel. So the only options were to go to their overpriced restaurant that did not offer delivery.5. Housekeeping failed to clean our room 3 out of 7 days we stayed there. We had to call the front desk to send someone to our room so it could be clean.6. At checkout time when we got our bill, there was an outrageous $400 phone charge for calls that were never made from our room. I admitted to the concierge that on a few occasions, I tried to reach my husband on his cellphone, only to reach an error message and a dial tone. The manager agreed to look into it. She then called me back to tell me she could not take off the charges, but she would cut it in half. When I told her that it was crazy for her to charge me for calls I didnt make, she said I'm sorry, but we have top-of-the-line phone system and you must have made the calls. So not only did they charge me, she accused me of making 30-something long-distance calls!!I would NEVER recommend using this hotel when staying in Waikiki. There were several other hotels on Ala Moana that we could have stayed at, at a much better price and with more accommodations. Our honeymoon was ruined and our wallets were badly hurt by THE HORRIBLE ILIKAI HOTEL!!
