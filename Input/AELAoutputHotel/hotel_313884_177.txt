{"text":"Very relaxing and beautiful We've recently returned from a 7 night stay at The Punta Cana Princess (PCP). There were 3 couples ages from late 30's to late 50's in my group. Five out of six of us had stayed at other all inclusives so we had something to compare the PCP to. We all had the VIP package so after a quick check in, we went right to the VIP desk to pick up our information. I highly recommend the VIP package. It was well worth it.We went to our rooms and had our luggage about 5 minutes later. The rooms were a nice size and perfectly clean.  The grounds were amazing. They were well taken care of and spotless. The pool was the perfect size for a small resort and also spotless. The pool bar was a fun and friendly atmosphere. The beach was beautiful. The waves were big enough to have fun in yet small enough to just float around. The water was a pretty blue. Having the VIP package allowed us to use the beach beds and gave us bar service on the beach. That in itself was worth getting the VIP package. We also did the 1 hour boat ride that was included in the VIP. It was a lot of fun. The mini spa was perfect for our complimentary 20 minute massage (vip package). Having a massage while hearing the waves break behind you was so relaxing. The entertainment staff kept people having a good time with volleyball, aerobics, softball... but I was just there to relax so I chose not to participate in the daily activities. The nightly entertainment was silly but again, I wasn't there to be entertained. We enjoyed the music and the cocktails. We met a lot of nice people and had lots of fun with the bartenders and cocktail staff. By 12:00 am things got pretty quiet but you could always hang at the beautiful beach bar 24 hours per day. The food... Here's where my review will get more negative. As a self proclaimed foodie, I thought the buffet food was mediocre at best. There was always something that I liked but it was just ok. The a la carte restaurants were better (except the Asian place, it was awful).La Cava (also included with VIP) was amazing. The atmosphere was great and the food was even better. The Italian and the fondue restaurants were also good. The Dominican beach party was very nice. Don't forget, men must wear long pants to the al a carte restaurants. We saw a lot of people get turned away in shorts. If you are going on vacation for gourmet food, this may not be the place for you. I would highly recommend The Punta Cana Princess for anyone that wants a quiet and relaxing vacation. We had a great time and can't wait to go back again.Debbie from NJ ","annotations":[{"endOffset":527,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":523},{"endOffset":527,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":523},{"endOffset":527,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":523},{"endOffset":527,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":523},{"endOffset":1577,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1573},{"endOffset":1577,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1573}]}
