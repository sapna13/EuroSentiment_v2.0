{"text":"Excellent hotel in a great location (ignore the American reviews) We've just had a week at this great Hotel. We arrived from the railway station via taxi which dropped us directly to the door. On entry the reception area is cool and atmospheric, classic 18th century with swathes of fabric and paintings on the walls and on easels in the number of reception rooms. We found the staff friendly, attentive and happy to give advice and assistance as per our requests - providing restaurant advice, booking tables and taxis etc. Shona was particularly great with a number of enquiries and requests that we made with regard to the booking of reserved entry to the local galleries - Uffizi and Accademia. The hotel itself is 3 star which through experience has lead us not to expect too high a standard in Spain  Italy, however the Cellai Hotel was excellent. The rooms are not huge, but they have everything you need for your stay, with compact with superbly clean and ensuite facilities with fitted hairdryers. There are shutters on the windows which you need to keep the heat of the sun out, but there are cords on either side of the windows, should you wish to open the shutters outside. The rooms are air conditioned and we found this to be adequate. Each room had direct line telephone, tv and small fridges. The streets outside are quite noisy in the early morning but not to the point where it disturbed me after the first night.Breakfast is a typical European selection of beautifully fresh bread rolls and croissants, cereals, fresh fruit - pears, apricots, apples, plums etc, fruit juices, cheeses, hams and yoghurt. Coffee or tea were served at your table as per your preference. There is a great roof terrace with a range of comfortable furniture which offers views over the rooftops and makes a lovely end to your day whilst you have drinks in the cooler evening weather. We used the free internet service on a couple of occasions and understand from hotel staff that WiFi is in the process of being installed. I am confident that this hotel will reach a 3* superior or higher rating in future, but what I find hard to understand is the American tourists reviews of this and other places that we've been to. I really am at a loss to know what they expect to find - Hotels in many European cities are often hundreds of years old, which does mean they are not the brand new shiny, characterless buildings of many American cities. Anyway, back to my review - the Cellai Hotel offers a number of services including limousine service to local designer outlets - Prada and Gucci to name just a couple. They also arrange visits to outlying villages on request for those wishing to see the 'real' Tuscany. The hotel doesn't offer a laundry service on site but recommended a same day service in the street just a few yards away. The Hotel has a number of courtesy bicycles which you can book free of charge to get you around the city - such a simple but great idea and highly popular with guests at the Hotel.In retropect the Hotel would benefit from a safe being fitted in each room, however they do offer a perfectly serviceable 24hour safe deposit box in reception. This is the only thing that I can think of and I can't find fault with this great hotel. I'd suggest you take more notice of the European reviews than the Americans as I feel that many of them really have little idea of what it is to travel in Europe and stay in some of these fabulous cities.
