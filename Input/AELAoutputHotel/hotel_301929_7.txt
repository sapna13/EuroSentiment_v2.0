{"text":"Nice location but several buts.... I stopped at the Nikko from 19th-25th Aug 2008 with my Thai girlfriend. I had spent 5 days in the fantastic Dusit Thani in Phuket two weeks earlier and frankly this hotel nearly spoilt my first visit to Bali ( I have been back since and rented a private villa in Seminyak - for less than stopping at the Nikko - which was an altogether better experience)Whilst there are things to commend about the hotel - beautiful grounds\/ pools, excellent rooms, fantastic Sushi in the Japansese restaurant - there were several things I found to be quite\/seriously annoying that I feel I should make potential guests aware of. I'm a bit of an Anorak and, sadly, tend to read the In-House 'Brochure'. In the Nikko it seems water is an issue. Whilst making a point that the tap water meets WHO quality levels they somehow recommend that you don't drink it. And then explain that they provide 2 bottles of mineral water a day and any additional water should be ordered and paid for from guest services. And there is me thinking that the WHO states fresh potable water is a basic human right. Let alone in a 4* hotel.Next is the statement that (I paraphrase) 'No food or drink bought from outside the Hotel is permitted on the Hotel premises'. This is clearly nonsense of the first order and not something I chose to any notice of, but, I think says something of the mentality of the place.Now, given that you aren't allowed to bring food in (and the Brochure makes a point of saying that contravention of rules may end in eviction), you would expect that you wouldn't want for comfort whilst there. Wrong. Despite doing everything to discourage people leaving the hotel grounds or even accepting that there is a Bali outside of Nusa-Dua they didn't actually have enough sunbeds for the number of guests they have. And they explained this away as 'we are busy this week' and 'its sunny so everyone wants a sunbed'. I'm not in the Hotel business but as far as I can discern Bali is busy every week, and pretty sunny year-round.Penultimately the food. The Japanese restaurant apart it would best be described as 'average'. And I'm afraid to say that having spent 6 months in Singapore and having had the good fortune to visit Thailand twice, Malaysia, Bintan, and Bali twice, 'average' just doesn't cut it in this part of the world. Especially when you are paying 'Western City' prices in a country that has good food at bargain prices (though buying it might get you thrown out of the Nikko of course)One last gripe. My girlfriend and I wanted to hire a car with a driver for a day. The hotel quoted $125 for 8 hrs. Thankfully my girlfriend had picked up a flyer at the airport with an offer of 12hrs for $45. To be fair the hotel booked this alternate supplier for us without complaint, and we were fortunate enough to get a driver who spoke great English, had a story to tell about Bali - both historical and present - and took us on a fantastic tour. So good in fact we booked him for another full day. Ultimately I gave most of the difference between his companies price and the hotel price to him as a tip. And I felt good about it.
