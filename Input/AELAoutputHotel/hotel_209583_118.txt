{"text":"loved it! When i read the previous reviews, I have to admit that I wanted to cancel the trip. I felt that i had made a mistake by booking this trip. But I decided to go anyways and quite frankly, i loved it. It was the best experience of my life. I am not really sure what people want when they go to a resort, i mean, if what you want is a waiter that it's standing in the sun inside the beach while you you are in it, with drinkswaiting at your every command, then my friend you are wrong, what you need is a servant! I mean, it is all inclusive, you have several places that you can go to grab a bite! The drinks, well, if you go there to drink only then go to a bar in your town and save yourself all that money and other expenses. This is a place to have a romantic getaway or to relax. I mean, the beach it's the cleanest and most beautiful beach that you have ever seen. There it's even a bar inside the swimming pool. I don't know why people are so picky and say so many negative things. I have traveled a lot, and still i loved this place. The people are nice, and sincere, but even if they were not, i hope that people do not go there to make a best friend, you go there to enjoy and that can be done. People speak English, most of them, and i had a great time. I went with my husband of three years to our second honeymoon, it was great. The room was very romantic, with view to the beach and the buffets and restaurants were good too. I mean, everyone has a different taste, but no less than 4 stars i will give to this hotel. If you want inmmediate attention when you go there, and people after you all the time to clean after you and to serve you 24\/7 then i don't recommend it! ","annotations":[]}
