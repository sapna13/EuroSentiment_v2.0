{"text":"Great Value for Money 2 Couples went to Punta Cana from Friday May 11 thru Friday May 18th. We booked thru Nancy at Liberty Travel but did an Apple vacation. The plane ride was smooth no problems coming and going on USA3000. The movies were terrible. Our plane landed a little after 1000 and we were on the beach by noon. The complex was very large. We did upgrade to the Platinum. I did think it was worth it..... The lounge was nice.....They had a cappucino machine there....you could get ice from the attendent....they had sandwiches and lots of drinks( they ran out of Amaretto , which is what I drink). Anna was very attentive at night to all our needs.Having the platinum upgrade ...we were pretty close to the beach. Our friends room was ready so we went to their suite. The bathroom could do for upgrading. We did have hot water, but it was sometimes just trickles. It was nice to have a coffemaker and a refridgerator. Also with the platinum, you could make your reservations in the lounge at any time. I heard one woman ( who did not upgrade) went to the Apple tour guide and stood in line around noon for a half an hour and was told to come back at 530pm. ( she probably didn't attend the orientation)I also had the 40 minute massage. Both people have to go together or if one person shows up ...they get the 40 minutes.We also went into the jacuzzis in the spa. The water was not that hot. The hottest water was in the spa showers. They were delightful.We did the Outback Safari......We had Sammy and Ramon. They were very funny and infomative.Our friends did the snorkeling . They said it was the best snorkling they had done.The food was okay. Remember you don't come here for the food. We went to the fondue place at Punta Cana Princessand it was fun. We ate at Lichey (free with the upgrade). The filet mignon with the pepper sauce was delicious. The only problem with this restaurant was they were slow. Also we ordered coffee with dessert......never got the coffee.We went to a Tex Mex restaurant , I think at the Punta Cana Princess......they brought us complimentary frozen marghettas ( the made it just like home) the food there was above average.We also ate at El Gaucho. We had the Argenitine steak, which was quite tasty. The nice thing about the platinum upgrade was that you could go to other resorts......They picked us up at the platinum lounge and brought us back about 2 hrs later.The casino ( outside the hotel) was not worth it. It was not Atlantic City or Vegas. The shows were in Spanish at the main Lobby .We went to one show only. Never did go back.....They started at 1000pm ( I thought it was a little late). The TV were big in the rooms. I was surprised at all the American stations you could get. I especially enjoyed the swim up bar. The internet at the platinum lounge was broken ( they had 2 terminals). When I contacted the Apple representive both were fixed the next day. That was nice you could check your email free.We also went to one of the resorts to play mini-golf. Don't waste your time.....It is a very old 9 hole course.Apple vacations did give you a beach party. They did go thru a lot of trouble.....It rained after we had eaten and we ran back to the room in the rain.All in all....we did have a good time. Just watch what you eat and drink and you will be fine.Everyone here was very friendly. I never met a rude person the whole time we were there.
