{"text":"Service zero; suite was nice We stayed at the Suites on One King during the Caribana week end and got the worst service we have ever had in a 4-star hotel. We booked on a gift certificate we had received - perhaps this is why the staff would not even look at us. We had booked well in advance and requested a high floor and an early check in. When we arrived at noon, we were told there would be no rooms available before 3 (which is inderstandable), so we ensured they had noted the high floor request. We came back at one AM to find out they had assigned us a room on the 7th floor (out of 49) with a view on the inside courtyard. Everyone at the front desk kept looking at their screen while talking to us. The only one clerk that kind of made an effort gave us the wrong directions for the LCBO and ensured us it closes at 7 when, in fact, we found out it had closed at 5 when we actually found the place. We experienced two fire alarms on Sunday afternoon, but there were no apologies or mention of it upon check out. In fact, they did not even asked us how are stay was, which is the reason why we decided to write down a review here.Both spas were out of order during our visit. Room was nice, but air conditioning was really noisy. The breakfast lady was really nice, the only one that smiled in this entire hotel. Location is good, close to Union station and Yonge St. If you need a suite, it could be a great hotel, but just don't expect any service from that place.
