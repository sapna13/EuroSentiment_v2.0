{"text":"Nice business hotel with a good location I stayed just a night at this hotel and will definitely book it for my future stays in Frankfurt. Pluses - excellent location, quiet, newly renovated rooms with good hardware, decent service and including breakfast all for 130 Euros per night (this is a company rate). This hotel is located about 3 mins walk round the corner from the main railway station. It's also only ~20 mins by cab from the airport (cost ~25 Euros). And it's an easy 15-20 min walk to the Zeil, the main shopping district of Frankfurt. But it's nice and quiet thanks to being tucked away in a corner.Rooms - I had a larger-than-usual room (Starwood Platinum upgrade?) in the newly renovated wing with a skyline view - which means it faces away from the street. It was spacious with a modern decor, equipped with ironing board, trouser press and a large flat screen TV mounted to rotate round on a slim vertical pillar in the middle of the room. The in-room aircon thermostat worked well. And the broadband internet connection worked first time, fuss free.Service - fast check in. The non-smoking room I was allocated smelt of cigarette smoke and when I returned to the front desk to ask for a change, they handled this courteously and quickly. Within 5 mins of being in the new room, housekeeping had transferred the fruit plate and bathrobe to the new room. The food served in the restaurant is both good and reasonably priced - I ate there for both breakfast and dinner. The buffet breakfast includes a good selection of fruits, cold meats and breads as well as the usual sausages and bacon, plus a manned egg station. Dinner courses range from about 12 to 25 Euros (pastas starting at 12+, and meat courses at 20 odd)Minuses - prettty minor. Fitness centre closed on Sundays and public holidays (often the case in Europe). No wireless broadband. On my checkout day the housekeeping staff knocked on my door twice in the morning, even though I told them I would be leaving at noon the first time - maybe a problem understanding English. The only significant minus in my book is the beds having foam mattresses - rather surprising given the broad move by many hotel chains to put in super comfy beds. They were OK, but not great.
