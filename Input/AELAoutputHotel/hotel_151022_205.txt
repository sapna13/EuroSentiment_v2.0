{"text":"Very Nice Trip. I just got back from Punta Cana and man was it a vacation of stress fun and relaxation. We had originally stayed at the Allegro just down the beach of Natura Park. The Allegro was a definite NO! It was rated a 4 by Apple Tours but when we asked the front desk we found out it was a 3 star, so i guess that explains the ants in the rooms the celling falling and no reservations. Our Apple Rep helped us alot and was always there for us, he helped us move to Natura Park which for the minimal price difference was worth it. It felt much more like a resort. The pool didn't feel like pee like the Allegro but very refreshing. Reservations at Natura werern't any better for the a la carte resturants as the Allegro but the hotel is much nicer. Satellite TV was a nice feature. Also the buffet and the Snack bar were much better and more Americanized at Natura if you know what I mean. One night they had a Dominican Market come in and it was very fun barganing with these guys. They told me that a shirt and a necklace was $48 but when I walked away from him he immediatly shouted Sir what is your price! I said $15 and he said ok so dont be afraid of barganing these guys. The shows at both place weren't bad one night at Natura they had a pagent. Miss Natura Park. It was very fun and exciting. In one part of it i had my shirt ripped off by a contestant but for the game. Natura Park was a nice 4 star hotel. I would maybe go back but just not so soon. And one other thing to add Natura had a nice swim in swim out pool bar. Enjoy your stay and I hope I help. If you experience anything thing as I did like Ms.Natura Park Let me Know.
