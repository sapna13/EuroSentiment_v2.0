{"text":"Tropical Paradise Went on vacation to celebrate a 20 year friendship. We had a great time. The staff was ver friendly. Always saying Hola as you passed them by. The hotel was very clean. Some of the nicest landscaping I have ever seen. The room was spacious, and beautiful. We had plenty of room to put all of our belongings and plenty of room in the bathrooms for all of the toiletries two women would bring. Make sure you get extra towels. There weren't enough. The bathroom door was not very sound proof. It was a metal slat door that really gave no privacy. The food was very good and they gave you way too many choices. The alacarte restaurants were great. The staff was very attentive. The only complaint I had was, they only allowed maybe 8 parites or less in at a time. Had way too many empty seats for all of the people that were there. Maybe that was a way they saved money. Only allowing a certain number or reservations at a time. The pool was clean and a great temperature. Which made it great for cooling off. It was very hot! The drinks were always good and never short on alcohol. The evening entertainment was just ok. I found that the shows were boring and not very entertaining at all. I think they need some more rehearsal time. All in all it was a good trip. Very relaxing. If you are looking for nightlife stay somewhere else. I think everyone was in bed by 11:00pm.
