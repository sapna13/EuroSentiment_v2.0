{"text":"Really, just another hotel The hotel itself is in a very nice neighborhood. There is little to do surrounding the hotel, however, it's extremely safe. There are some little bakeries and some limited restaruants (Pizza Express) nearby.I stayed in a City Inn Club Room which only seemed bigger than the standard rooms because of the floor to ceiling windows. The City Club rooms appear to be on every floor situated in the corners of the hotel. It is not worth the price upgrade.The hotel offered a rate gaurantee which they did honor and then subtracted an additional 10% off the rate of 299 pounds per night for the first night. Becuase the hotel is located in a financial\/government district, the rates are much cheaper on the weekends. A bit of advice, if you do plan on staying midweek and also the weekend, do book two different reservations on their website because it's a LOT LESS expensive and breakfast is included on weekend rates.The service is very good. There were a few minor problems and the hotel staff immediately responded to my concerns.The lounge area serves excellent drinks, yet expensive. The food is also very good.The breakfast was good as well.However, overall, it's just another hotel with some VIP ammenities such as bottled water replaced daily and some other non-useful things such as fruit upon arrival.I had brought the wrong electrical adapter and the front desk immediately provided an electrical adaptor and an ethernet cable without a charge. Upon returning to London, I might stay there again if the price was right because it's much nicer than the tourist hotels. The nearest tube station is about a 10 minute walk which is very pleasant and flat.
