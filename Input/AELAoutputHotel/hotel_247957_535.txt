{"text":"Loved It, Loved It, Loved It Just got back a couple weeks ago from the Occidental Grand Flamenco in Punta Cana and had a great time! The resort was beautiful!!! This is not my first time to Punta Cana and I have been to other places staying in all inclusive resorts and I have never seen a resort as beautiful as this! The grounds were huge and very well kept. The beach was beautiful, no seaweed, white sands and lots of good spots to sit.The food was amazing, I couldn't believe how much variety there was and the restaurants were awesome too! The activity staff were so much fun!!!!!!! They got me and my friends doing all the activities whether we wanted to or not but once we were up doing them we had a great time! Say hi to Magnolia and Danny! They made our trip! They are so cool!The nightly entertainment was unreal. The staff worked so hard for the shows. My friends and I went to every show before heading out to Mangu, the nightclub on the resort. The nightclub is a lot of fun but a lot of the locals go so just watch out if you are a young girl because the guys can get pretty aggresive. The upstairs is better for that, you can have more space. We went there 4 times in the week and had so much fun, there were always cool things going on like fire shows and different attractions at the club. Mangu stays open till 6 or 7 am. so you can party pretty hard while staying on the resort.I strongly recommend this resort. It was the time of my life and I know my friends that I travelled with can say the same. Best week of our lives!!!!!!!!! It was paradise!
