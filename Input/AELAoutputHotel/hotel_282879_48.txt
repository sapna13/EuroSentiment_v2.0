{"text":"A Very Special Place I first found this hotel several years ago surfing the web, and booked a room for three nights. From the moment I entered the courtyard, I knew I had discovered something very special. Every aspect of my visit then, and every time I've visited since, has been infused with serenity. The staff is superbly professional and discrete, yet warm and friendly. Beatrix, Bita, Sultan, Valentine, and Mr. Pommier are people that I have come to know and look forward to seeing every year. The rooms are of varying sizes and kept immaculate. The neighborhood is quiet and centrally located to all the sites one comes to Paris to see. After a long day of visiting Paris, it is lovely to come back to Hotel de Varenne and rest in the courtyard or the salon. If you want to keep abreast of the world you left behind, there is an ample supply of daily newspapers, including the International Herald Examiner, or, of course, CNN or BBC World on the flat screen television in your room. Each time I have been to Hotel de Varenne I request, and receive, a room on the First Floor facing the courtyard. I love the large casement windows. When I first went to Paris I was told to stay in a chain hotel, which I did for the first couple of times because I didn't know any better. After having discovered Hotel de Varenne I can't conceive of staying elsewhere. It has become part of the entire Parsian experience for me. As long as Mr. Pommier is the proprietor, and as long as Beatrix is assisting him, I know I will not stay elsewhere. I would recommend to anyone going to Paris to stay at Hotel de Varenne. You will not be disappointed. ","annotations":[]}
