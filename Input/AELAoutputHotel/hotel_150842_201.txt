{"text":"Our good experience I just returned from a 7 night stay at the Iberostar Dominicana. We had eight in our party. After booking this trip thru Apple vacations I began to read reviews about the resort. The reviews painted a grim picture of the Iberostars in Punta Cana. We found them, to be for the most part, unfounded.#1 Water -They must have told us 10 times not to drink or brush your teeth with tap water; if you do drink it, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ your fault, you were told. There is lots of bottled water around. The ice and water that they serve is okay.#2 Food √à√\u2020\u2022?There is plenty of food and they are constantly bringing out fresh platters. I always found lots to eat. I think people get sick there because you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat like that at home. The food is rich, fatty and good. I think people over eat just because of the variety, you always see something better then you have on your plate. Some of the food is over cooked but that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ because if it were not it would go bad very fast. As it is, they through out more food then the people eat.#3 Chairs √à√\u2020\u2022?We had no problem getting chairs in the shade no mater what time we got down to the beach or pool. There were always open chairs. #4 Restaurants - We made reservations as soon as we got settled in our room. We got the reservations we wanted at the times we wanted. The reason people go by these restaurants and find them half full is because they set up the whole place at once and do not reset tables after people are done eating.#5 Towels √à√\u2020\u2022?you get a fresh beach towel each day so don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bring them from home unless you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stand to be apart from it. Save the weight in your luggage for things to bring home.THINGS TO BRING:Insolated cup.  Bring them. People saw ours and wanted to buy them from us. I could have sold a dozen. 2 way radio (if you have them). I got up at 6:30 every morning; my wife would sleep as late as 9:30. We would meet at the beach. I had to keep going to the beach to see if she was there. With 2 way radios she could have called me when she got up. Dollars. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ believe in paying for service there bet I do reward for it. Dollars work great. I brought $100 and that took me through the week with some coming home with me.Binoculars. Lots to look at in the ocean and on the beach.The entire staff was great and kept things moving in the resort. The entertainment needed some work but over all, not bad. The beach bar stays open √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√òil 11:00 pm and it was beautiful at night down there. We talked to a lot of people and no one had any problems. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ sure if you did your Apple Rep. will take care of it.In closing we all had a great vacation and will definitely go back. ","annotations":[]}
