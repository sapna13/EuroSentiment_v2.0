{"text":"Incredible stay as always!! From the minute you arrive the service is amazing, check in is a breeze with great service and a special check in area if you are a SPG member, i would join if you are not already! the rewards program i great!. The location of the hotel is only a 5 minute walk down to the opera house positioned right on the city doorstep and opposite lovely Hyde Park, public transport trains are right across the road and buses out the front. The Circular Quay ferry terminal is only a short 5-10 walk and takes you anywhere around the bay. The rooms at the sheraton are huge, all with lovely big open bathrooms, there are views opposite Hyde Park or the City,most rooms now have black out blinds all electronically operated from the bed side.If you have the chance dont miss the buffet breakfast a trade mark of the sheraton with an great array of food and service. Oxoford Street (Sydneys main gay area) is also a close walk through Hyde Park in less then 5 minutes. With great nightlife. The hotel is what you would expect, you pay for the privilage but the rewards are worth it, also on the top floor is a great spa, sauna gym and rooftop pool with views through the city.I have no problems in recommending this hotel, if you are arriving from the airport consider a cheaper option of the underground train network its about 12$AUD and takes you almost to the hotel. If you are going to catch a taxi and its off peak (late at night or very early morning) consider avoiding the toll ways they can be quick but at that time s are alternative routes that you dont need to pay for!
