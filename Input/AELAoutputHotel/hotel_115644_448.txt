{"text":"great location, great price, but thin walls the chancellor hotel is in an ideal location! cool old building. right across from union square, right on the cable car line, bus stops are a block over. plus there is a borders bookstore right next door and sears fine dining on the other side, which by the way, has a great breakfast! the sweet lady at the hotel's mini convenience store was very helpful and found us a nice tour.our room was small, bathroom super small, but we only paid $111\/nt which included valet parking. so we got what we paid for. it was clean but things were old. there were black stains on our towels, but they happily gave us new ones. our only issue really was how thin the walls were. we stayed 3 nights and thankfully we had different neighbors each night. the first and last were tolerable. the 2nd night though, was maddening! there was one lady, who sounded like 20! she wouldn't stop talking on the phone until after midnight! we know all about her special diet, her kids, etc... anyways, we didn't get much sleep because she was at it again early in the morning. we were going to change rooms if it happened the next night but luckily, the next guy was much quieter. it's hard to blame the hotel for being next to a loud mouth, but really the walls were pretty thin!we would stay there again, but would pay more for a nicer room.
