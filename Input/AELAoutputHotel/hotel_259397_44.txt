{"text":"SoHo - Great Location, Great Hotel I stayed in the SoHo while on a business trip as they were having a special that made it cheaper than the Royal York (where I usually stay when in town).The SoHo is one block north of Front Street on the western side of the downtown core. It was a nice 10 minute walk to get to Bay and Yonge where my meetings were (as opposed to a 3 or 4 minute walk from the Royal York). What I love about the SoHo however, is that it is a smallish hotel, no where near the size of the Royal York and because of that there was much more personalized attention. After I checked in, I went across the street to Wayne Gretzky's bar to have a beer while I watched the hockey game and when I came back the concierge greeted me by name - which is the sort of personalized touch that is so great with a boutique hotel.The restaurant in the hotel (Senses?) was very good if not a bit pricey, especially if you are not on an expense account. The mix of people in the hotel seemed to be business travellers, youngish hipsters and Europeans (met a nice guy from Paris who was in town with his girlfriend on business). No kids evident.The rooms were larger than I would expect and the bathrooms were amazing, so far above Royal York level I couldn't even compare them - huge walk-in with a heated floor and top notch toiletries. The bed linen was great (easily compares to Westin\/Hyatt level of beds) and I liked the novelty of the auto-blinds.As has been noted in previous reviews, my view (I was on the 6th floor I think) was of a building under-construction, but which appeared to be close to completion - looks like a condo. I was never bothered by any noise. This area is a very trendy with lots of high end condos around. There is a parking lot adjacent as well. Reading through the reviews, I am surprised to see no one commented on the great night-time views of the big building lights. I quite liked that.Also, it was one block away from King St (lots of restaurants and theatres) and about 3 blocks from Queen St (lots of shops). One block from the Rogers Centre (Blue Jays games) and two blocks from the CN Tower. You are right smack in the middle of the downtown hustle and bustle, don't expect a stunning view of the lake and you will not be disappointed. I really liked the area and will be returning when I come back to Toronto on business.
