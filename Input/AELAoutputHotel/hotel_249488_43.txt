{"text":"Beautiful place to visit! On short notice we decided to take a trip to Puerto Rico and found Las Casitas. We were not sure what to expect since we can be particular when it comes to hotels. When we arived here - we were very surprised by how beautiful it was. First, someone met us outside of the lobby, put our bags on a golf cart and drove us to our room - it was so easy!The view was amazing -- we looked right out over the water - which was shades of blue and green - truly beautiful. We loved waking up in the morning and looking right out over the water. We enjoyed going over to the private island on the boat - we have friends that use our pictures of the water as their screensaver. Although waiting for the funicular (sp?) could be a little frustrating. We decided we made the right choice to stay in Las Casitas and have access to the rest of the hotel. That way, we had could go to the less crowded pools (great infinity pool!!), but still could go to the restaurants at the resort, which were surprisingly good. The room was nice and open with lots of open space. The only complaint was the cleanliness was lacking a bit and there was broken glass on the patio. The kitchen in the room was dated, but may have come in handy if you bring kids. However, I am anti-cooking on vacation, but we used the fridge to store some bottled water, etc. We rented a car at the hotel and went to the rainforest and San Juan - both were definitely worth seeing. We would come back here or elsewhere in Puerto Rico -- we loved it! ","annotations":[]}
