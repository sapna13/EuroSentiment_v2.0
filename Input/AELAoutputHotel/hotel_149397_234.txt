{"text":"Never again I got back yesterday after spending a week at the bavaro princess.This trip was a big disappointment. First of all, we had no hot water for 3 days. Not so bad for me to take a cold shower, but terrible for my 5 yr old daughter. the water pressure is terrible too. Food was pretty bad and I was sick just about everyday. Staff was rude and it was VERY hard to find anyone that spoke much English at all. I sometimes got the feeling that they understood what i was saying but chose to play dumb! The Disco opens at 12 and closes at 2 which is ridiculous. Most of the young people were going to a club in the hotel next door. Also not much for the little ones to do. They have a kids club but with limited hours and limited activities. The game room for older kids is a joke. it is a tiny room with a couple of pool tables in it. not very inviting. The resort is huge. You have to take a trolley everywhere and it can be hard to find one depending on the time of day. Luckily I was a platinum guest and my room was near the beach and pool as well as one of the buffets. I feel sorry for anyone getting stuck in one of the rooms in the hotel. it is basically at the enterance to the resort and near nothing! I would not reccomend this resort to any one and would never go back. if you are looking for a nice, big all inclusive resort that is inexpensive, try Moon Palace in Mexico near cancun. I had a much better experience there. There is always food and drink around the pool, the people are nice and it is a pleasant experience. At the Princess, no one comes around taking drink orders atthe pool. And the drinks are the pits! They do not have cranberry juice for some reason. That was a real pain since almost all the drinks i wanted required Cranberry Juice! The only good thing i can say about the Princess is that the beach is beatiful and they do keep the grounds nice. Mexicos beaches are a little rough. All in all, stay away from this hotel. it just isnt worth it!! 5 stars it is NOT. Not even close!!!
