{"text":"Love and sweet We just return from a week at the Bahia Principe Resort. It's very beautiful. The Beach was nice and we always able to find a nice seat. The food was fantastic and Fresh.If the last minute price was right, you must stay and select the Diamond Club. Diamond Club give us an extra night of fine dining. Also If you just want to stay at the pool and Diamond club have their private pool which was never crowd. Also We can choose to have Lunch at the Italian Dining which was locate at the Diamond section (shot walk).As soon as you arrived, you need to book and reserve all your Night dinning. Some restaurant only open on the select day.We booked the following Restaurant : Janpanes Dining - It was Good and fun.Sea food Dining - It was Good the Fresh.Paris Dining - It was Good but they only let you choose 1 appetizeItalian Dinning - It's Ok but I would rather try the Steak House which was Full (Unable to book it).My wife was very Clean person. The Hotel was very neat and Clean but sometime we do find some small ant.The bath room was spotless.The Hotel people was very Friendly and alway smile. Only problems was they do not speak much English. Due to our Return Flight was at 21:30, After we cheked out, we found out they did not have secure storeage. They only have a store room for everyone to put the luggage in. So we have to keep our valueable things with us all time. Overall, it's Good Resort, worth while to stay there.
