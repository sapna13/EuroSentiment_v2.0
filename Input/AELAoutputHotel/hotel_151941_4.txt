{"text":"Great stay for cruisers My girlfriend and I stayed in the Holiday Inn Express on Condado for two nights after our cruise. The location; although kind of hidden in a side-street, it's attached to a main road which is a 75 cents bus ride to old San Juan. If you bump into a bunch of tourists at the bus stop, you can all probably split the cost of a $12 (fixed-cost) taxi ride to Old San Juan.The hotel was very accommodating to our needs. We arrived at 10 in the morning; we were not allowed to check in because our rooms were not ready but they held our luggage for us and provided useful brochures of the nearby area.We toured Old San Juan and came back in the late afternoon to check in. They were apologetic for not allowing us to check in earlier (even though it was not their fault!) and also gave us a nice room. We got a room on the 7th floor in the corner of the building - with a nice view to the ocean and beach, and a tall roof. The room was also very spacious and the a\/c cooled us from the blazing Caribbean temperatures.The front desk were informative and provided us a recommendation to the local shops and restaurants. They provided us information on transportation to various locations on the island and on other activities.I recommend this hotel to anyone who's joining the cruise as its location is convenient and its staff is very professional and helpful.
