{"text":"Nice and Clean, But it Stops There My Wife and I stayed at the Bahia Principe Punta Cana from March 28 to April 04 2007. Upon arrival we were let off the bus practically on a mangrove bush and handed a red glass of something that most guests discarded after tasting it. I then followed their lead and discarded mine without tasting it. As our flight time was moved up 2 hrs in Toronto we arrived early at the resort. Most rooms were not ready ,however ours was. We were told that this was because we were Gold Club members(this is not worth the upgrade, as you get the exact same as a regular guest, other then a separate check in and checkout area in which you have to wait longer then a regular guest because it is not staffed adequately) . We were told that we had express checkin. This is to say that we were given a bracelet on the bus and some information packages. then we were rushed off to our room without given the opportunity to get our safe or book our al a carte restaurants, the safe cost us $28.00us extra, I thought this was a rip off. This may sound trivial, but i can tell you that it is not. This resort is so big, that if you have to make a trip to the lobby you will be a minimum of 1 hour, and be prepared to get lost during this hour at least once (it took us 2.5 hours to get it all done). You have to see it to believe it!!! ROOMSOn a good note the rooms were appointed very nicely. We were suppose to get turn down service, but this did not happen until 5 days into our stay( i really dont care about that sort off stuff, but it was promised). Seemingly corresponding to a mass in flux of guests from Europe. I can say that I personally noticed a difference in service when the europeons arrived. Up to this point there were no beach waiters, But there was after the europeon in flux. FOODI found the buffet to be a better option then any of the a la carte restaurants. The food at the mexican restaurant was absolutely horrendous and also at the Mederteranian. The italian restaurant was OK but was the most entertaining. The portion sizes at the a la cartes was somewhat smaller then you normally see at a gourmet restaurant. If you dont like it you can go to the buffet afterwards, its open til 10:30 pm.BeachThe beach is phenomenol!!!!!! you can walk for hours and you will have to has you will be unable to find a chair unless you are up and at the beach at 6:30 am. The only beach that i have found that compares is on the Isle of Kauaii, Hawaii.I personally would not recommend this resort to my friends or family. It is too big and I wasted too much time looking for stuff. I did not find the food good, in fact both my wife and i became ill at the end of the week, and are still sick two days after arriving home. We did not get the services that were promised in the brochures and in general I felt like i was treated like a head in a herd of cattle.DC MillsOntario, Canada ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0}]}
