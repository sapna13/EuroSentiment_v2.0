{"text":"Do not stay at this hotel and beware of Expedia.com poor customer svc I was on a business trip to Honolulu and booked my stay at Aqua Waikiki Marina through Expedia.com. Very disappointing - stayed 2.5 days, decided to check out due to the following:1] Room interior is dirty, carpeting  furniture are old and unkept, smelly - poor housekeeping service 2] undesirable residents [looks like 'prof' men\/women] hanging around the hotel's lobby\/entrance area - since this hotel shares w\/tenant residency - definately would not recommend taking children\/family 3] If I'm not in - the telephone message stated that the room is unoccupied instead of voicemail svc. for caller to leave messages - operator will not take msg from callers - misses several important business calls. Expedia.com misrepresented this hotel and once reservation is booked ... it's a night mare process to change hotel regardless if the hotel condition is very poor [misrepresented]. Expedia's representative not very helpful in assisting w\/change - spent almost 2 hours on the phone. Once changed hotel - full charges for both hotels [old and new] are billed to credit card though only partial stay on 'dirty' hotel. It took me another 3 hour call [includes several call backs only to escalate to supervisor] to resolve the overcharging issue. Expedia neither apologize nor accept responsibility on this matter [especially double billing] - I had to theaten to dispute my AMEX transaction prior to supervisor accepted the escalation. Poor service from Expedia - this would be my last w\/Expedia.com. Customer be aware ... once you booked your reservation ... you are pretty much stuck w\/it ... regardless if the property is misrepresented in Expedia site [pictures display not the same as actual].
