{"text":"Great Hotel in a great location. Century Southern HotelGreat Hotel in a great location.I've been to Tokyo 4 times for business and\/or leisure and all 4 times I've stayed at this hotel for at least 1 day. This hotel is a fantastic hotel with fantastic service located in the heart of Shinjuku. The hotel is minutes walk from Shinjuku train station; and the views from the 20th floor lobby is absolutely breath taking.Location:To get to this hotel from Narita airport - take the Narita Express (do not take a taxi - a taxi will take almost 2 hrs and will cost close to $300 USD) to Shinjuku station. The Narita Express costs about $31 USD\/person one way and is fast and efficient. It'll take about 1hr 25 minutes. Get off at Shinjuku station, get out at the Southern Terrace exit or South Main Exit. Look up and head for the tall white building - past the Starbucks and directly adjacent to the relatively new Krispy Kreme store. Take the elevator to the 20th floor lobby. The hotel is minutes walk to the Shinjuku business district and the electrifying retail night life. Major dept stores as well as numerous retail shops and restaurants are all within minutes walk. A citibank ATM can be found in the builing behind the hotel on the street level. Service:Overall service and the concierge is exceptional. Go to the restrooms in the lobby floor and get a great view of Shinjuku and the Takashimaya Dept store. This hotel has a gym and offers free in-room high speed internet free wi-fi access in the lobby area - bring a Cat5 cable with you or purchase one at the front desk. Hotel rates are reasonable for this class hotel (less than $200\/night). I highly recommend this hotel for first timers to Tokyo.
