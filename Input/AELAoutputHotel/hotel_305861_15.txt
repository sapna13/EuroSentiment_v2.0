{"text":"Exceptionally cheerful service We just spent nine delightful nights here and we can't recommend the place highly enough. Definitely spend the extra bucks for the view over Victoria Park sports fields out to the harbor -- it's especially lovely at night. The rooms are big enough, if short on storage, with unusually comfortable beds for China. While the bathrooms don't have tubs, the showers are more than large enough for two (very nice!). The in-desk vanity is a lovely touch my wife really liked, the place is spotlessly clean, and the AC works great, which is crucial in the steamy climate. But what makes this Metropark special is the enthusiasm of the young staff -- tremendous hustle and nonstop smiles all around. You can see from their interplay with each other that they really enjoy what they're doing. The assistant managers, especially Carmen Chu, will go the extra mile to make your stay pleasurable. The buffet breakfast is fine (skip the omelets), but we can't comment on the dinners, because it's only a 20-minute walk through the park to the fabulous and much less expensive local Chinese restaurants on Lockhart Road and Jaffe Road, and that's where we went every night. Going farther afield is a cinch thanks to the Tin Hau MTR station around the corner -- just a few minutes to the Admiralty and Central transfer stations -- and the Causeway Road trolley, which cruises conveniently down Hennessey Road. (We found the cabs and buses, while cheap and comfortable, tended to bog down in the Wan Chai traffic.)And a word about that beautiful Metropark rooftop pool -- it's not only a great spot to cool off while watching a smoggy sunset, but it's a fabulous vantage point to watch the Chinese New Year or National Day fireworks over the harbor if you're lucky enough to be there at those times. This year's National Day show blew our minds. We've stayed on both the Kowloon and HK sides on previous trips, and this is far and away the best value we've found.
