{"text":"Truly, a home away from home What a wonderful hotel ! We arrived on the first day of a major heatwave without our luggage which was left behind in Paris by Air France. Miriam was such a gracious host. Since we were exhausted and hot, she provided a triple room before the normal checkin time. The room was large with high ceilings with large beds. The only negative was that the air conditioning didn't work. So , after a nap, we changed rooms to one of the newly renovated room a floor above. Miriam was welcoming and let us move to the new room. Thankfully, the air conditioning was new and fantastic. the view from the window was of a backyard garden and parking area with the duomo in the background, birds flying all around. Flat screen TV and wireless made the entry into Florence easy.Miriam's husband and her father Gassim are exceptional Hoteliers. They speak english perfectly and are very helpful and guide guests to some of the best places in Florence.Miriam called Air france for me and our bags appeared late the first day. According to her, we were the first in many years to get our bags the first day.Breakfasts are fine. An espresso machine that makes great Capuccino, fruit, yogurts, pastries, boiled eggs, cold cuts and cheese make it easy to get energized for the day. The hotel is right around the corner from the Accademia and Michelangelo's David, two blocks from the Duomo and two blocks from the Central market - a must see in florence. We can recommend a few places to eat- ZaZa in the central market square where i had some of the best pasta with clams and a tuscan rosato at a reasonable price. Da Mario, next door to ZaZa is only open for lunch and is one of the few old style florentine restaurants. You sit at a table with others, the waiter comes by and tells you what is left on the menu and you eat amazing fresh food in a friendly convivial atmosphere. Get there early or there won't be much left on the menu. I can't give the Hotel Europa a higher review and thanks. they made our stay in Florence like staying with friends.
