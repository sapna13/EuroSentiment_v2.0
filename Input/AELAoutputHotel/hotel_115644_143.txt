{"text":"Great Hotel in a great city! After much deliberation and going through the reviews on TA we decided upon the Chancellor and glad to say we weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ disappointed. We decided that the Union square area was more suited to us as there was only myself and girlfriend travelling. The Chancellor exceeded our expectations within 10 seconds of check in as we were upgraded for free to a suite, which had two full separate bathrooms, separate living room, fridge, and the all important tea and coffee making facilities. We had requested a room on a high floor with a nice view if possible our suite didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a view so perhaps they we unable to give us a normal room with a view so they bumped us up to the suite? This was just my thinking anyhow and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° have taken the suite over a view anyhow!! We have very little interaction with hotel staff in general unless we have a problem-we had no problems in the Chancellor so our interactions were limited although all the staff were warm and friendly from the cleaners to the front desk staff. We booked our wine country tour via the tour desk in the lobby and our return transport to the airport she was very helpful. With our upgrade I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ offer insight into the normal rooms but the suite was probably decorated as the un-refurbished rooms from the website my girlfriend preferred the look of the older rooms anyhow. There isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really allot I can add from previous reviews-the location is excellent with plenty of dinning options and everything you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° need in and about Union Square. To me the only problems people seem to have with the Chancellor are caused by them not doing their research! The Chancellor is a charming well presented Boutique hotel with great service, it doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ pretend to be luxurious or fancy and their rates reflect this! It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a shame that the Chancellor and San Francisco are on the other side of the world from us otherwise we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° return sooner rather than later! Great hotel that I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hesitate recommending to anyone.
