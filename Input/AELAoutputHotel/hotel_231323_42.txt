{"text":"typical European chain hotel well, actually, I stayed at this hotel in NOV 2001 not NOV 2002, and it was during a 5 week trip around Europe by train. You need to read my review of Notel Winston in AMS as well to understand this one better. My original plan for hotel stays was to avoid all American and European hotel chains like Hilton, Best Western, or Ibis, especially asit was right after US 9\/11 attacks. Plus, I booked only locally owned hotels to help the citizens and economy of each place. Things turned bad in AMS: read the other review. I am making an exception for this city....For a single traveler on a budget who does not plan to spend his\/her entire stay in AMS stoned the whole time, I recommend this hotel really above others. At the time I paid 100 euros a night. If you are paying under 100 euro a night in AMS, you will be in a druggie dump in the red light district. I liked everything about Ibis. The location was perfect right by the train station. Yet even though it was in sight of the red light district, it was totally safe and secure. Only a one minute walk away, literally, you are in the center of the action that is AMS.  The room was clean and nicely furnished. As for size, I thought most hotel rooms in Europe are small, and so i dont understand others criticism of the size. i found them adequate. I guess if you are a light sleeper I would request a high floor facing away from the train station, but i had a room overlooking the train tracks ....never had trouble sleeping. marijuana\/cannabis IS legal and so even in IBIS the waft of the distictive smoky odor was present here and there .....I went from small hotels with small breakfast service to Ibis and its breakfast buffet in its restaurant. I LOVED it - immensely - as it was the largest breakfast service that i had had. The selection was fine and the staff was great. it was included in the price for me. You gotta verify EVERY detail before you book. I did not eat in the restaurant for dinner as hotel restaurant prices always tend to be more expensive. There are scores of good restaurants just a couple minutes walk, including a pub\/restaurant across from the station that serves traditional dutch style crepes and belgian waffles at a good price. Again, i would recommend this hotel to the cheap tourist type like me. The price may not say budget but in the case of AMS, the extra money spent is worth it.
