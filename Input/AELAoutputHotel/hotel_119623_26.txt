{"text":"Great Price, Great Location, Home Away from Home We read reviews on Cow Hollow Inn, and was about to book there, when we found this sister property on their website, only a block away. The price was cheaper and we thought perhaps the quality of the rooms were not as good. We were pleasantly surprised when we walked into our room. We stayed for 5 nights on the third floor corner room facing Lombard Street. The traffic was not bad at all, and we found the room to be extra spacious (corner rooms are a bit wider). The bedding was excellent, furniture was quaint and classic (not an old feeling at all). The bathroom was marble and its counter had lots of room for toiletries, the shower was very comfortable. Now the location. This place is located right on Fillmore and Lombard. There is a shopping area on Union Street just a few blocks away. A line of shops just one block away on Chestnut Street. There is a Walgreens very close to the hotel and Fillmore itself is quite busy. The area felt very safe in the evening also. We were about a good 20 minute walk to the Wharf, 10 minutes to the Marina. Driving wise, it is very close to the Golden Gate Bridge and parking is free. The lobby is separate from the entrance to the building, so after we checked in the first day, it was pretty much like we were going back to our apartment each night. The cleaning lady was very nice and she does a wonderful job. Overall, we felt like we got the best value for what we paid for. ","annotations":[]}
