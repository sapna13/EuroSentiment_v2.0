{"text":"What is the problem? I thought the resort was excellent. I was concerned about staying a full week but when it came time to leave, I was sad.  I had read the reviews before I left. When I arrived I promptly asked for block 5. Apparently, this is a very popular block as is was filled and remained filled the whole week. No problem (as all of the Domincan people would say) the room we had was spacious, had good water pressure and great air conditioning. By the way I was in block 10. It was further away from the beach but the room was nicer than the other rooms that were closer. The food in the buffet areas were okay. They are catered towards the Europeans. As Americans we did not find the food very flavorful. I made reservations for the restaurants every night. Each restaurant was excellent in its own way. It was my sister's birthday and we celebrated twice, once at the Italian and once at the Japanese restaurant. Le Cafe' (the coffee shop) and the Sports bar were excellent. When I became a little homesick I visted there. It is very americanized.The staff is great. Very eager to communicate. I learned quite a bit about spanish and the Dominican culture. The entertainment was very good. I CAN NOT EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE HOW EXCELLENT THE SAX PLAYER IS! Every night I sat at the coffee shop, got my cup of tea and listened to the sax player and the pianist. It was Kenny G quality. Make sure you catch it at least one night you are there.I am really outgoing and I enjoyed the archery and tennis. I like to work out and the Spa is awesome! The sauna after a workout was a bonus. The view and breeze from the top open floor of the spa was to die for. Make sure you visit the spa!Of course I got a beach massage. For thirty dollars I received an hour massage. (cheapy, cheapy!)Overall it was a great vacation and I am very pleased with the resort. I really don't have a bad thing to say about it. The Apple rep's (Apple Vacation is who I booked thru) are helpful and knowledgable. Especially Rafael. He booked an excursion for us and he was well versed in five languages! As was much of the staff.Some tips I have are bring a raft, the ocean has alot of seaweed and its a little cumbersome to swim in. The big mugs worked out well, I used my mostly for water but there were occasions when I filled it up with beer! A great drink I discovered while I was there is the dominican champagne it is 7-up with dominican rum, yummy! It gave me a good buzz without a hangover. Also, if you are looking for things to bring, I was told that the local school children needed shoes, school supplies, hair ties etc. Consumable goods are very expensive here. A baseball or toy car will go alot further than a buck for a tip.No matter what happens, remember you are on vacation! If you are having a hard time with something try one of the american places or the spa I mentioned. It will help put things back into perspective.
