{"text":"Hotel Was Nice, Price was a Different Issue Okay, upon arriving at this hotel, i was nicely greeted by the doorman who took my luggage to the bell stand and then was handed off to another bellman who took me up to the 19th floor to the Lobby.Upon getting to the lobby, i was greeted by the front desk manager and was able to check in about 3 hours early.I was given a corner room on the 39th floor that faced Times Square itself.Very nice views of downtown and of the area.However here is where the concern comes in.The next morning, i went downstairs to the restaurant to get breakfast.I waited at the stand for a few minutes, and since no one was at the desk to sit anyone i just got a seat for myself.Since, i was only really thristy and wanted some fruit, i was asked if i had the breakfast voucher. I handed the guy the voucher and then was on my way.Upon drinking my juice and banana i recieved a bill by the guy.I looked in it, that so called juice and banana i had would of ordinarily cost me $20.50. Then there was a hand stamp on here saying (Gratuity not included) What gratuity, all i had was some juice and a banana.I'd feel sorry for some other person with no voucher who wanted a bowl of cereal and some juice and had to pay $20.50.Then, upon getting my bill, i noticed that the supposed $13.99 for the internet had actually turned into $15.70 with taxes included.So you get the my sense of where i'm going with this.I was just concerned with the price for a juice\/banana and internet for one day would of ordinarily cost me over $35.00.So just beware when staying at the hotel about the breakfast price and internet.The fitness center is actually in a make-shift meeting room.There are a couple of pieces of equipment to use but it would be a little embrassing in your workout clothes and have 100 people for a meeting outside the door talking and watching you workout.
