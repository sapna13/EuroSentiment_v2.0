{"text":"Can't complain about much... I was just at this resort (July 2007). As many of you have said, the check in process is HORRIBLE!!! My family and I were already tired from our trip. We had woken up at 4 o clock that morning. Our flight was 8 am. Our flight was delayed. We didn't get to Punta Cana till about 1:30pm. We didn't get to the hotel until about 2:30-3:00 pm. We waited on line to check in for literally 2 hours. We were starving and tired and cranky. This is the last thing we wanted to do. At least there were plenty of seats in the lobby for my family to sit though. The lobby is pretty by the way. They could use some new seat cushions though, but that's besides the point. We finally got the key to our room. Yaayyy!!!The room was pretty nice, and clean. Our room could have used a little more lighting though. There were a couple of lamps and a light or two on the wall...but nothing on the ceiling. Thank GOD the AC worked because boy was it hot and humid outside. The AC worked so well that the first thing I did was pee in the morning because I was so cold. I loved it. The room itself was nice, but I hated the bathroom. The tub needed some updating. It needed new caulking because the old one was not white lol. We ate at the buffet everynight because we kept on forgetting to make reservations at the restaurants. We actually enjoyed the food here though. There was a big variety, and everything tasted good. I loved the crepes! They make them for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Yum! This guy makes them right in front of you on this cool crepe machine. He makes it amusing and makes hearts and flowers with the filling. So sweet. The cleaning ladies were SOOOOOOOOOOOO sweettt. All the waiters and waitresses were SOOOOOOOO sweet. I can't say anything bad about the staff because they were all very nice (besides the bartenders...I didn't like them much). The beach was beautiful. The temperature of the water was perfect. The waves were fun! There werent rocks in the water to hurt your feet. The sun was strong, so that's great for your tan!Oh...you get ripped off with the souvenirs. You have to really push with them to get a fair price. If you don't, you'll be ripped off. I understand why the souvenirs are over priced though...these people are very poor, and they really need the money. I was really sad at one point of my trip...I was on the beach with my mom and there were people going up and down the beach selling jewelry and other souvenirs. My mom and I bought some necklaces, bracelets and rings from this one guy. After he gave us a fair price on everything, we paid him. He then asked us in a nice way if we could go and get him some water because it was VERYYYYY hot and he had been working all day. The poor guy couldve dehydrated. He wasn't allowed to get water from the resort, so my mom and I got it for him. It just made me sad...I dont know why =\/Overall, our stay was great.
