{"text":"Excellent place, but noisy neighborhood Room was clean and adequate, though small. In-room fridge is a real plus. Bathrooms down hall are separated into WC and shower, to minimize delays. Not too many rooms share, so waiting is not a problem. The owners and other desk staff are first-rate, friendly, very helpful. One carried my heavy bag up the flights of tricky stairs. And the night guy even accompanied me with bags all the way to the tram stop when I left early in the morning (and refused a tip). . . The big problem with this hotel is also its biggest plus--its location. In the midst of gay bars and saunas, and half-a-block from a major thoroughfare with clanging trams, it is the NOISIEST place I have stayed anywhere. With the help of my iPod's music or plain earplugs, I slept OK, but with windows open all night there can be quite a din, and at any and all hours. . . Also, they run an internet cafe out of the DR from 1 p.m. to midnight, which makes it impossible to use the only community space as a relaxed place to hang out with fellow guests. At a gay guesthouse in Barcelona, the DR table was a major gathering place at any hour of the day or night, whenever there were two or three guys who happened to be around, and it was a great opportunity to meet people from all over. . . I would shut it down and tell the guests that this is their space, to use and to share. So many people travel now with their own computers, it would be a great place to set up and pass the time not being spent touring, toking, and tubbing. ","annotations":[]}
