{"text":"Some must be hard to Please We a family of 4 (kids 11 13) had a great time at this resort. From march 5-12 07The flight from T.O. on Skyservice was cramped but we expexted that. Once we arrived we were through customs on the bus and at the resort in 40 minutes or less(that has to be some kind of record) i almost didn't have time to get a beer for the 20 min trip lol. The check in was busy, we decided that my wife would head to check us in while i grabed the luggage with the kids. good thing as she as first in line and were done in 10 minutes. We were not able to get our room until 3pm but that was ok as we had put bathing suits in our carry ons and changed in the rest room. We were in block #2 not to far away from anything. Blocks 1-3 must have been the last ones built as they didn't seem that old compared to the coments i have read here about the condition of rooms. Blocks 4-5 seem to have the younger university people as were heard comments of alot of noise until 3-4 am everynight were we didn't hear a thingand we were up till midnight most nights Now if your looking for great food and great rooms plan your vacation in the US or Canada this is a third world country and they don't have the kinds of things we do. The food selection was great at the buffets and if you found something to complain about your just a complainer and can't be happy with anything. There was something for eveyone to eat my picky 11 yearold boy loved the pasta cooking sections and by mid week the cook had a plate ready for him when he seen him in line. The ala carts were ok but would not recomend the Mexican. we just ate the chips on the table left our meal and went to the buffet instead. This is what great no reservations and if you don't like the ala cart you could head to the buffet. Our favorate was the steakhouse because of thje variety ( pork ribs were great) and then the itailan. We didn't try the others as there was no need to. The steakhouse menu is the same at lunch as it is for dinner the chicken nuggets are really chicken strips and the kidds loved them but the servings were huge. The shows are like any shows you see at resorts the annimation crew work long hours. i think the best shows while we were there were the ones that involved the crowd. The big show at the Casino were you had to make reservations is not worth going too, You have to buy your drinks there and my daughters dance studio puts on a better show, but if you have nothing to do go for it your on vacation and it cost you nothing but what you drink. The beach is great and the pool at the Caribe is a bit bigger than the Beach but at the beach you ahve a beach bar as well as the pool bar close buy as well as the Pizza shack and steakhouse on the beach. We go on alot of all inclusives and don't take many offsite trips but we did the Outback Saffari and would recommend this to everyone. From drinks on the truck while moving and winning the bet we could drink it dry before we got back to the hotel ( we are now known as the alcoholic Canadians, wellsome of us and we know who we are right 8 guys and 3 girls lol) you go to a local familys home to see how they live drink some coffee and mammawana (sp) see them make cigars have a chance to buy a few things ,eat a trditional meal then do some boarding at the beach. What a blast. Go with an open mind and you'll have a blast, we did.
