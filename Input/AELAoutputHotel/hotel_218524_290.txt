{"text":"Excellence is Almost Excellente The Excellence Punta Cana√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ property including the beach and pools is excellent. It is a beautiful setting, well maintained and spacious enough that you never feel crowded. It is an adult oriented resort which means that there are no kids which leads to a quieter, more laid back ambiance. The rooms however, are well worn and could use updating. They were really just average. Though the air conditioning worked fine and we had no bugs, there was rust and significant wear in the bathroom and sink area. When the toilet wouldn't flush, they fixed it within an hour; however, they had to come back three times to get the fix to work. Be prepared for mosquitoes, especially in the theater and lobby bars in the evening. We brought Off and it worked fine. The food was excellent. The restaurants have their unique styles and dishes and we never had a bad meal and some exceptional ones. For dinner we thought that Chez Isabell and Spice were best, but Agave and the Grill were also very good. We never had a bad meal.Service was prompt, courteous and attentive. The only problem was that the restaurants are small and if you want to eat after 7:30PM you will likely have to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. For breakfast or lunch, there was Toscano which was buffet style and excellent and one other restaurant which served a more limited menu, but still very good. Overall the beef was great which shouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be a surprise since it appears that ranching in a major industry in the DR. The fish was also excellent which was surprising since only red snapper and grouper are typically caught in the Caribbean. Most days they have a barbeque on the beach for lunch which we felt was exactly what we wanted when we did not want to clean up or change for lunch . They also had a traditional Dominican dinner on the beach one night which included whole roasted pig and roasted goat, if you want local flavor.The beverages at the bars and restaurants were excellent, except for some of the wines. Some of the Chilean whites were good, but some of the Argentinean reds were not. You can purchase wine, but at an all inclusive resort you really should not have to. The mixed drinks were good and the bartenders had no problem making you anything you wanted. However, some had not mastered making a Manhattan or a dry Martini. Entertainment was a mixed bag. The standout was Domingo, a saxman who played most nights in the Martini bar or with a band outside of the theater on the plaza. His covers of popular tunes are excellent and his original pieces are outstanding. We never got tired of listening to him play. I bought a couple of his CDs and they are a good way to remember the trip. He deserves to be one of the main shows. The other evening entertainment was various shows. The Michael Jackson tribute and the Circ de Sole imitation were very good. However, the Dominican folklore show needed someone to narrate and add interest. After a couple of folk dances it all stated to look the same. Service outside of the restaurants was very good. Reception went smoothly and bags were delivered quickly. Problems were resolved quickly and without any hassle or fuss. Some days there were several people cruising the pool asking to get you drinks or bring you a pizza and some days it seemed there was no one around. There is supposed to be no tipping, but many people do tip which may tempt the staff to provide good service to some and not to others. Overall, I would return to Excellence for a relaxing vacation.
