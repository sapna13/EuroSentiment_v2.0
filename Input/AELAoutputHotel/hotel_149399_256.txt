{"text":"Had a fabulous time A group of 16 of us just got back from a week at the melia CaribeI know many have written some pretty bad reviews about this place - trust me - not sure where they stayed because we had a great time. the area of rooms we stayed in was building 27 we were 5 minute walk from the beach - and a 10 minute walk to the restaurants. Some hints When you get there if you have a large party make group dinner reservations early - The Dominican restaurant was excellent -and is open most of the night for a late night snack. Make reservations each day early in the morning 900am dial 6313. You must make reservations a day ahead . They will not take them for a full week. All the restaurants are decorated beautifully and food is wonderful. If you just want to grab a quick bite the Market Place is very good and so is the Touray restaurant on the beach - we had breakfast there most mornings. To make sure you get a nice shaded hut on the beach go out at 730am put a book and towel out. We did this most mornings to secure spot in the sun and then have some shade under the hut. Rooms were cleaned everyday - fresh beach towels on the way to the beach or pool - staff were very friendlly and helpful - each room comes with iron board, iron, blowdryer umbrella for rain days and a safe. There are so many beautiful places to sit relax and have a drink. Not alot of places to shop - they do have 2 stores on premises has all basic needs. Take lots of pictures the grounds are amazing. No need for Royal service - overated ! Look for Sven the Norweigan waiter on the beach he is fabulous~~ ","annotations":[{"endOffset":932,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":928}]}
