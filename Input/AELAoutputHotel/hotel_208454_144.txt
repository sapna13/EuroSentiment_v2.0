{"text":"Loved every minute of our stay! My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel, New York to celebrate my birthday for 4 nights on 22 February. We have never been to New York before and the Sofitel was part of what made it so special. We were upgraded to a higher floor (16th) on our arrival and were pleasantly surprised on the size of the room and bathroom. The bed and pillows were so comfortable and there was hardly any street noise so we always had a really good nights sleep. We made use of the hotel's bar every evening after a full days sightseeing\/shopping and found it a lovely way to finish the evening. The staff were efficient, helpful and polite so no complaints there. As it was a special occasion I had done some extensive research before booking the Sofitel and it ticked all the boxes. We didn't eat in the restaurant as we were out all day so can't comment but would recommend The Red Flame Diner for breakfast, just a couple of doors down. I would also recommend going to New York this time of year as we managed to visit The Empire State and the Top of the Rock with no queues at all and that was great!! If you like shopping make sure you visit Woodbury Common as well as 5th Avenue as there are great bargains to be had!All in all, we had an amazing time and would not wish to stay anywhere else next time we are in New York!
