{"text":"well worth the money some people expect way too much. Myself and my boyfriend stayed here from 24th September til the 8th October. We had prepared ourselves for the worst but were suprised when we got there as to how lovely the resort really was. Check-in went smoothly and quickly, the staff were very friendly, and as other guests have done we emailed the hotel and asked for building 5 and thats what we got. Our room was massive, a huge kingsize bed, tv with more than enough english channels so if we wanted to watch it we could. We also had a pull out sofa bed which we didnt need but used as a sitting area. The maid came in daily and cleaned as well as refilling our fridge with 2 cokes 2 sprites and 2 large bottles of water. The hotel gardens were kept immaculate and the beach was only a 30 second walk from our room. The beach has extremely white sand and clear warm waters. My boyfriend went out and fed the fish bread as did many other people, he was surrounded by hundreds of them - you only have to gout into waist high water. The hotels pool wasnt as clean as we would of liked as we often found bugs in the pool but only after there had been a storm over night and by afternoon someone would of cleaned it out anyway. The main buffet resturant had more than enough choice, with a pasta station, chinese station etc where you pick what you want and the chef cooks it in front of you. Also there is the same sort of thing at breakfast with omlettes. We didnt try the seafood a la carte but we did try the italian which was really nice. We went there about 8 times in the 2 weeks we were there, the lasagne is gorgeous. They also do a seafood night at the beach on fridays where they make it look all romantic it looks lovely but we dont like fish so didnt bother. You have to try a bananamama cocktail, and also their pina coladas are good. Also go to the lobby and meet felix behind the information desk - he will initially just laugh at you but it is so funny to watch, we stood talking to him for hours, although some americans got offended he doesnt mean any harm. Michael Jackson show is really good the best of the evening entertainment. Recommend Saona island and quad biking, also the tropicana nightclub for those 18-30 if you want a strange but good nite out in a club in an underground cave (the more of you that go on one booking the less they will charge pp). Me neither my boyfriend got ill, only with a hangover, so anyone who did was probably a hypochondriac, or just being picky. The staff make you feel welcome and do not expect tips, but it is nice to give them as they genuinely appreciate even one dollar. We paid √ä√£¬¢700 pp for our holiday and it was worth every penny. I really dont understand so many negative reviews from the americans.
