{"text":"Wow!!!!!! I have recently come back home after staying at the Argonaut and all I can say is WOW!!!!!!I was greeted by John and escorted to the desk and introduced. I arrived early from a very long international flight but the room was ready. Through my stay, 10 days I was referred to by name and always greated by a smile. The staff were always willing to offer suggestions where to eat what to do and were not into promoting certain resteraunts along the wharf. The whole exprience was fantastic. Yes the area has tourist written all over it but that gave the stay a great vibe. You could do tourist and I did or do low key you have the option at your finger tips. The cable cars were very close also the F line which will take you into Market st the shopping area and all the way out to Castro.The wine hour is lovely way to unwind and meet other guests and their furry friend (They are a pet friendly hotel), just Wow!!!!My tips: 1. If you are in the city for a while invest in a MUNI 7 of 3 day pass (7 day US$24.00, 3 day $18) especially if you plan to local transport The trams, bus, cable car.2. If you are an international traveller, Macy's Department store (Union square) go to the visitor area floor 6 or 7 and get a visitor pass, you can get 11% of your purchases. Bring a drivers licence\/ passport.3. The biggest treat. If you are a foodie Gary Danko is just up the road, the food is worth the price (Fixed Menu starts at $61) it is just out of this world, ever morsel. ","annotations":[]}
