{"text":"diet before you go girls a party of 7 of us stayed at the ocean beach in sept-oct 2008 age range was 15-45. dont really know where to start, guess the obvious choice was the check-in. brilliant system, you go to check-in they give you a slip which you pass to the bell-boys and they take your luggage to your room while you go and explore. first impressions (10:00pm at night after a 5 hr delay and a 9 hr flight)- yeah looks okay!what an understatement the place was bloody lovely! One of the nicest all-inclusive resorts we have have stayed in and we have stayed in quite a few. The hotel grounds are well cared for and a pleasure to walk around. the beach was fantastic clean white sand and clear blue water, staff at the beach buffet were pleasant enough and hovering, waiting to get you drinks etc. bar staff at the beach buffet a little ignorant but didnt let it bother us, the staff at the actual beach bar were great, but be warned when they ask you if you want alcohol in your drink - if you say yes then thats what you get, alcohol and plenty of it but who cares when all you got to do is lie on the beach and doze it off.for the first few days our 15 yr old son was a litle bored (he was the only minor in our party and we did travel out of the school holiday time) but he met 4 girls 3 days in and that was that, we didnt see much of him for the rest of the holiday!!!!!! The food was good, if a little repetative but you expect that when your there for 2 weeks. Didnt eat anything that made me want to ask for the recipe but didnt eat anything repulsive either. Mike's coffee shop, what can i say, this is the jewel in the ocean sands crown, we loved it and thats the reason you girls need to diet before you go!!!!! Any coffee you want with cakes to die for and as many as you want for as long as you want, we headed up there after a day on the beach most days and on numerous occassions we were still there at 7-8pm. the staff in there were really pleasant (in fact one of the men in our party fell head over heels for one of the girls - to her embarrassment) and to his wifes amusement!!!every holiday has a negative and yes we had a couple of minor gripes, the restaurants were rather hard to get into unless you were ready to dine at 6.30pm (come on, we were on holiday) and most of them shut at 10pm. but the main buffet was good and plenty of variety. the pool areas are rather large and i prefer a more intimate scene (like to be able to look up from my book and spot my child) couldnt do that here as the pools were so big but i knew that before i came and if im honest the beach was so lovely i prefered that anyway especially as there was more of a breeze. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would be happy to reccomend it to anybody who wants to have a relaxed holiday with decent food. drink-a-plenty in pleasant surroundings. But unless you want to put 11lb on in 2 weeks stay away from Mikes coffe shop dont say you havnt been warned!!!!!!!!!!
