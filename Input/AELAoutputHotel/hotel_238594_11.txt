{"text":"Great hotel in a superb location The Montecarlo is in a fantastic location. Its right on the Ramblas, at the top end, so is convenient for pretty well everything that you could want. If you are getting the bus in from the airport (and thats the best way) then its only a couple of minutes walk from the Plaza Catalunya terminus.We would only add to the recommendations of the hotel, so we wont bother. Its great, and so is the breakfast!.Let me suggest a couple of things to do. Firstly, DO VISIT THE MARKET !. Its only 5 minutes down the Ramblas (towards the harbour, on the right). I have never seen such a fantastic market anywhere. Fruit, fish, veg are all set out in spectacular displays. The prices are lower when you get away from the main way in - but just go to see all the fantastic displays.Also, we really enjoyed a day trip out to Montserrat. Its an easy train trip from Barcelona ( even if there are a lot of stops). The monastery was interesting ( try to get there for the singing at 1pm) but best of all was taking the St Joan funicular up to the top of the mountain, and then walking back (get a leaflet from the information centre). We did route 5 - a bit rough, so wear strong shoes, and it takes a couple of hours ... but stupendous scenery.All in all, the Montecarlo is a really recommended base for a break in Barcelona.
