{"text":"not bad I LL be short and two the point.The trip there we got stuck in the airport and had to sleep in the airport ok not the resorts problem.Once we got to the front desk ,well not very helpful,my grandmother moves faster .The rooms are nice alot of room (we had 4 people 2 kids 2 adults) .Tip the maid first day she will love you.Get your room near the pool or you will walk alot .At the pool it is beautiful .If you want good ,not great service you must tip the bartender.The beach is beautiful no waves .Food at the buffit ,breakfast is great,lunch is good, dinner the same. Dinner you have a Mexican place it was very good. If you like to drink you must bring a thermal cup something big the cups there are very small.Also drinking the beer it was coid the mix drinks are not very good .The soda is flat the juices taste funny.We had kids with us from 5 to17 yrs old .The 17 yr old ok at night the11 12 13yrs olds were board at night.They have a teen club,very small no A C .The kids spent most of the time walking around.I known i am all over the place with my review sorry.If you do go you must go on the boat snorkling you get to swim with sharks yes sharks! That was cool $78 a adult kids under 12 free.if you have a kid 13 14 or looks 12 tell them he or she is 12 they don t check save some money.So in closing the good THE POOL THE BEACH THE ROOM THE BAD THE SEVICE THE DRINKS THE NIGHT LIFE ","annotations":[{"endOffset":242,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":238},{"endOffset":800,"mention":"soda","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saltine_cracker"],"startOffset":796},{"endOffset":800,"mention":"soda","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saltine_cracker"],"startOffset":796}]}
