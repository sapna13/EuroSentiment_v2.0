{"text":"Any Thing But Excellent My husband and I along with 2 other couples stayed at the excellence from september 13th-21st. After a very long flight we were surprised to hear we still had a 1 1\/2 hour bus ride to the resort. The roads to te resort were bumpy and at times we only went 30 miles per hour and many of us were feeling sick by the time we got to the hotel. The staff was very nice and we were greeted with champagne when we arrived. When we got to our rooms we were surprised that they smelled very old and musty. We tried to air them out but that did not help. We called the front desk but nothing was done. The smell stayed with us for our entire stay. We had trouble with our safe staying locked and had to have it fixed. our air conditioner was leaking and we had it fixed. Our power went out quite a few times and we had to keep setting the fuse box. In the restaurants we had a hard time getting a table for 6 even though there were empty tables. We were served dirty glasses and had bad service in one of the restaurants. My husband was sick for 3 days and could not eat or drink any thing. I also experienced stomach problems but not as bad as his. Three others in our party had stomach problems as well. The bugs were so bad you could not sit out at night without your bug spray. We did however enjoy the beach, pool ,the entertainment and some very nice people we met. The grounds were also kept very well. This not a 4 1\/2 star hotel it should be a 3 star at most. The 6 of us will not be returning to the Excellence. ","annotations":[]}
