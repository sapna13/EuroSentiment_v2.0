{"text":"Fabulous stay at the Jazz Hotel Jazz, Barcelona 8th Oct -12th Oct 2007I chose the Hotel Jazz through reading good reviews on trip advisor  they did not let me down.You won't be disappointed to spend time in Barcelona  use The Hotel Jazz for your stay.Myself ,My wife  our 2 grown up daughter  son spent 4 days to celebrate my 50th birthday  we had a fantastic time.This modern hotel is situated perfectly in a lovely safe area of Catalunia, an 8 minute walk north west off the Ramblas  within easy reach of the best shops (north) the old town(South east). We also used alot of the tube 1.25 euros per trip to get to  from the different sites of Barcelona. We visited Park Guell, Familiar Sagrada Church, Olympic stadium  surrounding area inc the beautiful art museum  famous waterfalls (allthough not switched on).the scenic views of Barca from Park Guell in north  the cable car in the south west were incredible. We used the bus for transport 11.15pm from Barcelona airport to the Hotel (14euros for 4 people).after a short discussion of using a taxi (Quoted 45 Euros)The hotel staff were excellent  were able to speak english.The breakfast (7-11am)was fantastic.You could not wish for a better selection of food  filled you up for most of the day.The rooms with ensuite were modern  excellent.The outdoor pool on roof was brilliant  the hotel supply the towels for use.Long shorts  tee shirts forTemperature 21-24C for October was brilliant.We did hear a rumbling of the tube but mostly at breakfast on the 1st floor but this will not spoil a great time in a great Hotel. Barcelona is a great city  the Hotel Jazz is a fabulous 3+ star hotel well recommended. ","annotations":[]}
