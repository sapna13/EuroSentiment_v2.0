{"text":"Nice attention to detail After Christmas, we took a spur-of-the-moment trip to New York City, and booked a night at the Benjamin through Hotwire. We use Hotwire fairly often, and you never really know what sort of hotel you'll get, but we were quite satisfied with the Benjamin and it's attention to detail.The location is just north of Grand Central, which made it convenient for us to get to from the Metro North trains. It was a cold December day, so we were especially pleased to have hot cider in the lobby -- and this wasn't your typical instant cider -- it was actually quite good. That attention to detail aligned with our other experiences with the hotel and the staff.The Benjamin's pillow menu was enjoyable -- my husband and I (and my parents in the next room) all picked different pillows, which were delivered while we were at dinner. Each time the staff serviced our room, they turned on the Bose radio, creating a welcoming feeling when we arrived back. The bed was quite comfortable with perfectly soft sheets. Our room was quiet, facing an alleyway. Since it was so quiet, I didn' t mind too much that there was no view and no sunlight at all. My parents had a room across the hall, and it was also quiet and without a view, but oddly enough, their room must have been near the room service kitchen, since they were awakened in the middle of the night by the smells of breakfast cooking (yeah, I like a nice breakfast as much as anybody, but I don't like smelling it at 3am!).The bathroom was fairly well-appointed, but I wished for more water pressure and hotter temperatures in the shower. More counter space would have helped, too, since there was hardly room to set a toothbrush\/etc.The elevators were far too small and therefore always crowded (and usually crowded with the large carts the valets used -- apparently there wasn't a service elevator for them). That was too bad, since I don't particularly enjoy waiting for an elevator, especially not when it finally arrives and is full of the hotel's staff.We didn't make use of the in-room printer, microwave, fridge, etc., but I'm sure that would be a nice feature for business travelers. I understand the hotel is also dog-friendly -- but they must clean well since I noticed no sings of that (which is good for me!).
