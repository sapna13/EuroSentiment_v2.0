{"text":"We loved the Pulitzer! A friend highly recommended the Pulitzer, so my husband and I made reservations for 4 nights, requesting no smoking room with a canal view. We checked in at 8 AM (after a transatlantic flight) and planned to check our luggage and walk around until our room was ready (check out is at noon). The friendly, helpful, reception staff recommended walking routes and nearby locations and cafes. We returned from our walk at 11 AM and our room was ready for us with everything we had requested.  Our room was very big, well-appointed and comfortable, with large french windows that opened onto the canal. The location of the hotel could not be better - around the corner from Ann Frank House and a tram stop that will take you directly to the art museums, the train station, or anywhere else. You can request a coffee and tea maker to be brought to your room at no charge. The hotel provides coffee and an assortments of teas, which we highly enjoyed.  The hotel had two concierges on duty at different shifts while we were there - one was a bit distant and cold. The other was fabulous. We had many , many questions and he was consistently very helpful and friendly.  As other reviewers have noted, the street\/canal sounds through the hotel windows can be a bit noisy, especially on the weekend nights. However, the noises of small motor boats going down the canal and pedestrians talking outside our windows didn't bother us. We slept very well. If you want quiet, consider not staying in central Amsterdam. Some friends stayed in nearby Haarlem and took the 15-minute train ride into Amsterdam each day to see the sights and enjoyed that. We liked staying in Central Amsterdam and the Pulitzer is in the Jordaan, a lovely walking area very convenient to many of the sites.  We rented bikes from nearby Bike City (recommended by the friendly concierge) and enjoyed bicycling around Amsterdam and out along the Amstel River to a nearby village of OuderKerk., about 4 km outside Amsterdam. We passed old-timey windmills and lovely flower gardens. Then we rode back along the opposite side of the Amstel, and, after returning our bikes, enjoyed a good meal at a cafe across from the Westerkerk, just around the corner from the Pulitzer., ready to fall into our comfortable bed.  I would recommend the Pulitzer to my friends. Next time, though, I will ask about getting a rate that includes breakfast. The free internet in the lobby is a big plus.
