{"text":"Great getaway, needs a little more service I went to the Copamarina for my honeymoon. This is a great estate, situated on a really remote portion of Puerto Rico (a 2 1\/2 hour drive from San Juan International Airport). The landscaping and scenery are second to none, my new wife and I loved all of the beautiful scenery and the laid back atmosphere. However, we did feel a few crucial pieces were missing to give this resort a better grade. First there is NO room service, so do not plan on taking a morning off and just relaxing in the room. You must go down to one of the two restaurants to get your meals. Another drawback was there is no honor bar or wet bar. So, you cannot continue a party back in your room or enjoy a nightcap before bed without going down to the bar and grabbing another drink, which is quite a walk I might add, especially if you're on the second floor of building three. These are minor drawbacks, but when you pay that much money for an all - inclusive package, I expect some of these extras to be there, and when they are not it is disappointing. All in all we had a good time. We had a set back with the snorkeling trip to Gilligan√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ island. We went into the surf shop to book a trip for the morning, and we were told that, the boat was being worked on, so there are no trips. This was fine, what are you going to do? The man also added, It wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have mattered anyway, you need a minimum of 6 passengers for them to make the trip. It just so happened that the resort was VERY secluded this particular week, (which I enjoyed). So we cut our losses woke up and rented a double kayak and paddled around all morning instead. When we returned we went up to our room, changed, and then went down to eat at the Las Palmas Cafe. While we were sitting there enjoying our lunch and drinking pina colada's we saw a couple walking out on the dock with snorkel gear. Then, a snorkel boat floated over from the other docks, picked up the TWO passengers and headed off, all this while we sat and watched infuriated at the scene, and of course we weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ in our swimming gear so running out and stopping them wasn't an option. So they did take as little as two people on the boat, and obviously it wasn't broken. I went in the shop to figure out how this miscommunication could have happened, and of course the guy that fed us the line of B.S. wasn't working that day, and we were leaving the following morning.  So all in all the service is sub-par. A lot of the staff is friendly and a handful of them tend to look at you as a pain more than a customer. The resort is unbelievably beautiful. I have been to the Bahamas and Cancun, and this is as good or better in terms of quality landscaping. Nobody had written about the lack of services for the prices you pay to stay here, and that would have been a factor in my decision to stay here if I would have read that prior to booking this trip. Great getaway location, but the service needs an update.-RAJ, NH ","annotations":[]}
