{"text":"Good and satisfying stay We stayed at the Nine Zero Hotel to attend a commencement ceremony in Boston. The hotel is a few steps away from the subway (Park St station, Red and Green line), and close to Boston Commons. Area is also safe (we came back late at around 10-11pm every night).About the hotel : we reserved our room through the hotel website, which gave a much cheaper rate than if you called the hotel directly. On the website, it asked whether you want 'higher floor, or lower', and whether you want 'feather pillows or foam'. We asked for a room on the higher floor, and feather pillows, and both requests were accommodated when we arrived. We were given a room on the 18th floor, with a beautiful view of the State House. Pillows and bed are very comfortable. Sheets are very clean. Hotel has a chic feel, smells nice as soon as you walk in. The interior decor of the room and the hotel can be interpreted as either stylish or tacky, but these are not major issues for me as I much prefer hotel to be clean, which the Nine Zero is. We also used the hotel gym, and although it is rather on the small side, it is functional, clean, doesn't smell, and it has good equipment. One thing we really liked was the in-room safe which is designed to accommodate laptop computers. We put our two laptop computers in it everytime we went out. Some issues : 1) housekeeping didn't replenish the body soap when they cleaned our room. We wondered whether they forgot about it. No big deal. When we came back from walking around Boston that night, we just stopped at the front desk to ask for soap, and they readily accommodated us, and even asked whether they should call housekeeping to replenish us with more. Very professional and accommodating.2) Second issue : On the brochure in the room itself, it stated that there's 'complimentary coffee' somewhere in the hotel (I forgot where, lobby perhaps), but when I called front desk to inquire about it, they said they don't have complimentary coffee, but coffee could be bought at the hotel restaurant. Hmmm. If you don't have it, then don't say it on the brochure ! Probably they changed the policy, which is fine, but the info given to customers in the brochures should be updated as well. Oh, by the way, room doesn't come with coffee maker or coffee, but they do have margarita mix !All in all, it was a very good and very satisfying stay. Staff is professional and friendly. Nine Zero tends to be on the expensive side (we paid around $375 per night for our room), but the hotel is nice, clean, with comfortable bed and pillows, clean towels, crisp sheets, very close to subway. There's Dunkin Donuts and Finagle Bagel a block away for your morning coffee and breakfast. We would definitely stay here again.
