{"text":"Location? We stayed at this hotel for the weekend and enjoyed it very much. Since we had a car, the location was not of too big importance to us. The hotel has its own parking lot, they charge EUR 12.-- per day. However, there are plenty of public parking spots on the side of the street free of charge, and it seems a reasonably safe area, so we parked there, no problem.But I must say, the area is not attractive at all. No restaurants nearby, to walk to the centre it is quite a way, more convenient is the bus. The hotel has no restaurant! However, you can ask for menues at the reception from restaurants that will deliver the food, that is a nice idea, you can eat the food that they bring at the breakfast restaurant.Breakfast was fine, very nice selection, and, it is free of charge, like at all the express by Holiday Inn. The room was fine too, nothing to complain. The queensize beds are on the small side, though, for 2 adults.The closest highway exit is Frankfurt-Westhafen, it takes you directly into Gutleutstrasse where the hotel is located. However, this exit is only accessible from\/to the North! If you come from the South, you drive past the Westhafen, make a u-turn at Frankfurt Westkreuz, and head South again. The hotel is not really near the Messe. I find the name a bit mis-leading.The hotel was definitely worth the price we paid. I would definitely stay there again.
