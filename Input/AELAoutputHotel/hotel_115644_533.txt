{"text":"Very Nice Stay at the Chancellor We recently spent Sept 26-28, at the Chancellor. The posted room photos (Sept 29) mirrors our room exactly. The rooms are clean, small, but not too small, and the walls a little thin. Nice size closet and great tub! There are free newspapers and coffee in the lobby which was nice. The hotel staff is great. The first night we made the mistake of leaving the window open and the street noise was a little bothersome√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√áut as one reviewer said, the hotel IS right in the city and on a trolley line√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√∂hich is part of its charm and the location the reason we stayed there in the first place. Subsequent nights we left the window closed and turned the fan on and slept very comfortably. Even the others in our party, who usually would not stay at a hotel without air conditioning, slept comfortably with windows closed and fan going. The hotel is very central. The free wi-fi made it very easy to plan our sightseeing. We went everywhere by bus√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√≥sed the trip planner on the Metropolitan Transit√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ 511 transit website to plan our bus route and bus number# (---). The hotel was full during our stay and a large group of Japanese students filled the restaurant in the morning. Not a problem -- we just went next door to Sears Fine Food. We had very good service and the really enjoyed the small Swedish pancakes (get there early or you will have to wait in line). We had a very nice stay at the Chancellor and will definitely stay there again on our next visit.
