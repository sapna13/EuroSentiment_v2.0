{"text":"Not for Light Sleepers, but Good Overall I stayed here for 3 weeks for a business trip. I specifically asked my travel agent for a hotel close to Embarcadero Center with a kitchenette and that's what I got. The location is really great, and I was able to eat somewhat normally during my stay thanks to the Safeway a couple blocks away. The hotel is adjoined to Elephant  Castle though for those Strongbow and Shepherd's Pie cravings. And this Seattlite was thrilled about the Starbucks on the corner for my morning fix on the way into the office.The room was kept clean yet complied with common-sense environmental concerns (sheets\/towels not changed daily). I really liked that they had water bottle refill stations on the floors to minimize plastic in the landfills.The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, and didn't judge me when I asked for that extra complimentary box of delicious cookies. :)I really only have two issues:1.) Considering the length of my stay I was disappointed that I wasn't given a better standard room (like one with a decent exterior window) or even perhaps a free upgrade. To be fair I didn't ask, but I would think some system to recognize long stays would be in place as part of a standard client-service program.2.) The walls are ridiculously thin. The weeknights weren't too much of a problem since the hotel mainly caters to business travelers. But I could literally hear the conversations of the people in the next room just as though they were in *my* room and that was a problem one weekend night at about 2:30 am when my neighbors got home from the club.
