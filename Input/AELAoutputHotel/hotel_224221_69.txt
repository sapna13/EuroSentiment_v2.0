{"text":"Excellent choice We had 3 nights at The Library at the end of June. The hotel is 5 minutes√à√\u2020\u2022?walk from Grand Central Station and the Public Library 1 block away. We had rooms on the 10th floor away from the lifts (as requested on booking). The rooms were clean, nicely decorated and comfortable with plenty of towels and toiletries. The rooms also have a safe and complimentary bottled water is provided. We were shown to our rooms and given lots of information about the facilities and also warned about the mini bars which are electronically sensitive √à√\u2020\u2022?so if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want an item don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ touch it! We slept soundly √à√\u2020\u2022?it was remarkably quiet. A good continental breakfast is served until 11.00 in a pleasant lounge on the 2nd floor which has wall to wall book cases and a piano! Everything was plentiful and topped up regularly by staff. Complimentary hot drinks and cookies\/pastries are available in the lounge all day plus wine with cheese  biscuits are served between 5-8pm which - a great way to start the evening or end an afternoon√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ sightseeing! The hotel has a nice rooftop bar which is open to the public (think from 5pm) √à√\u2020\u2022?but is a relaxing place to sit out during the day in comfortable surroundings if you are tired from trekking around the city. Both on the Friday and Saturday nights we were there the bar was entertaining private parties, though on the night we visited for a nightcap the waitress managed to find seats for us in the open air area which was greatly appreciated. (We had lunch in the adjoining ground floor restaurant Madison  Vine which was excellent - not sure if it is connected to the hotel or not). The best thing about the hotel is the service √à√\u2020\u2022?without exception every member of staff we encountered was friendly, cheerful and helpful. We had some great tips for bars and restaurants. The best service we have experienced in a long time. In summary the hotel made our weekend for us √à√\u2020\u2022?loved it loved it loved it and if we ever make it back to New York would be our 1st choice of hotel.
