{"text":"Absolutely Flawless Had some trepidation about the Intercon since I wanted the best hotel in the city for this trip and have been disappointed by some Intercons in the past (they can be hit or miss). But this Intercontinental is ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS! Do not let any past negative Intercontinental experience deter you from booking this hotel! I'm so glad I trusted TripAdvisor and stayed at the Hong Kong Intercontinental!From the moment we arrived, the staff got every detail correct. We were met at the car and taken directly to our room. The woman who checked us in took care of every detail and showed us all the features of the room. She even made a dinner reservation for us right from the room. Within minutes the bellhop arrived with our bags and placed them in the closet. We had a Deluxe Harbour View Room that was stunning...what a view!!! I could have spent the entire stay in the room just looking out the window! The layout of the room was excellent with a very large and private bathroom and it was so quiet I never heard a peep from another room, or guest, or anyone in the hall.Moments later the housekeeper arrived to turn down our beds and ask if there was anything else she could do for us. I said the iPod adapter wasn't playing my iPod (touch model) through the Bose surround sound system in the room. She made a call and moments later an engineer arrived to adjust the system to work with my new iPod Touch. Wow!Any time I passed any employee in the hotel they greeted us, even stopping in their tracks (if they were walking the other way) and bowing and greeting me, before continuing on their way. WOW.At the pool, moments after I chose a lounger to sit in, an attendant arrived with a welcome tray containing a cold towel, an orchid, a little motorized (hand-held) fan, and a pool services guide with a do not disturb sign. Very nice touch... I decided a few minutes later I wanted to move to the jacuzzi area and started to move my things, when the attendant hurried over and offered to carry my things for me. We had booked the hotel's Bentley to take us to the airport at 17:30 and had asked for a bellhop to pick up our bags at 16:00. The bellhop arrived at 15:59. I wasn't ready so I said I needed 5 more minutes. He graciously disappeared and reappeared exactly 5 minutes later...wow. Upon departure I decided to leave my camera (which had broken on the plane) in the room to see how the hotel would handle it. After vacating the room, we went to the lobby for afternoon tea. As we were walking from the lobby to the car for departure, the waiter came running over and said we had forgotten our camera in the room and would we please pick it up at the desk. Nice. We then were escorted to the Bentley for departure and no less than 4 staff member including the manager were there in a line to thank us for staying and to wave goodbye. If that wasn't enough, when we arrived at the airport a uniformed Intercontinental agent met us as we pulled up, loaded our bags onto a cart and escorted us to the airline check-in counter and waited there with us until we finished checking-in. I have to say that I honestly can't think of anything wrong with this hotel...it was excellent and I will definitely stay here next time I'm in Hong Kong. I wish every hotel stay was this exceptional. This hotel is defiitely one of the world's very best. It deserves a higher ranking than I can even give it!
