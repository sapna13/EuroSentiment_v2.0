{"text":"Great vacation! Had a great week Feb 16-23 at the Riu Bambu. Last year we stayed at the Riu Taino - part of the same compex - but decided to try the Bambu this year and preferred it to Taino. Beautiful grounds, adequate accommodations, superbly friendly staff. It paid to find a section in the dining room (non-smoking for us) to return to each day and get to know the waiters and waitresses who would greet you warmly like old friends. Food was wonderful. Loved the breakfasts at the buffet restaurant. We usually grabbed some delicious pizza or something else at the Mamajuana outdoor cafe for lunch. The specialty restaurants were nice to try for something a bit different if you are staying for a whole week but the method for reservations was a major pain in the butt. The reservation line formed outside of the dining room before 6:30 am. I arrived at 6:45 and was lucky to get a 9pm reservation. There has to be a better method for those of us who don't want to get up at the crack of dawn on vacation. The tennis courts are in need of repair and upkeep. They have some black mold which was slippery and dangerous. The beach is breathtakingly beautiful with plenty of chairs available and enough shade with the abundance of palm trees. The pool was lovely but we opted for the beach every day. The Riu should have replaced their beach towels last year when they were worn and old and they were worse this year. If you get stuck in the rain and your towel gets wet, you are out of luck if you want a dry one for later on in the day - they won't replace it! I think that's a crummy policy for a beach resort. The bars were well staffed and you never had to wait for a drink. I loved being told, 'Salud as i was handed my drink. Tipping is not expected but certainly appreciated for housekeeping, waiters, bartenders. If you have a birthday or a celebration just let the dining room staff know in the morning and you will not only get a cake but the table will be adorned with those beautiful red flowers that decorate the towels throughout the complex. It was a great vacation at a lovely resort for a wonderful price. We will definitely return but I did write to management with some of my concerns so I can only hope that things may be better!
