{"text":"A delightful small Hotel We stayed at the HLP for 3 nights for our Honeymoon choosing this Hotel because of the location and reviews from previous guests.We were not disappointed, after a short walk from the Metro we were greeted by the friendly receptionist who after check in took our case to the room. The room was large and beautifully furnished with a marble bathroom, a nice touch was the complimentary gift of an ornamental French Bulldog and on the 2nd night there was another gift of a perfume room spray which is exclusive to the Hotel. The toiletries were very nice but maybe a little to masculine for some, but I personally liked the fragrance.The room had double aspect windows, one overlooking a limited view of the gardens and one onto the side street. We slept with the windows open and there was hardly any noise until around 6am but that was still acceptable. We booked the extras of a bottle of Champagne and flowers for our arrival and although not in the room for check in were delivered within 30 minutes.We made use of the welcoming, cosy bar area which was tended by a charming gentleman. Breakfast was better than we had anticipated with plenty of choice of pastries, ham, cheese, fruit, yogurts etc. Tea\/coffee was served at the table along with a large glass of fruit juice. There was also the choice of bacon and eggs cooked to your requirements at a very reasonable supplement on 2.50 Euros.Most of the time we spoke in phrase book French with the staff repying in excellent English, which was nice, we did feel that our attempts to speak French was well received.The location of the Hotel was good being just a walk away from some of the major attractions, cafe's and restaurants. The are 2 metro's within 5-10 mins walk but we found that the RER line slightly closer walking through the gardens.All in all, we would highly recommend this Hotel and hope to return one day soon.
