{"text":"Awesome Vacation!!! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe for 7 days at the end of October. The weather was beautiful everyday - hot and sunny. We experienced two small rainfalls that lasted only minutes, otherwise the weather was perfect. Check-in was fairly quick and since we had spare time before we could get into our room, we were able to relax in the lobby and enjoy some delicious drinks and eat at the buffet. The grounds were BEAUTIFUL and garbage free all week long. Our room (junior suite), was situated in a villa and was quite large and clean. Everyday the mini-fridge was refilled with juice, pop and water. Every room has its own balcony. We chose to eat at the Mexican Restaurant, Garden Grill and Italian Restaurant. The Mexican restaurant was by far the best restaurant. The atmosphere was fun - the staff were extremely friendly and the food was delicious! The Garden Grill was also very good but we found the atmosphere at both the Italian and Garden Grill restuarant to be not as enjoyable as the Mexican restuarant.We also ate at the buffet and snack bar which we found to have good food. The beach was gorgeous - sandy white beaches and torquoise water. There were plenty of lounge chairs for everyone. There is a bar located on the beach and the snack bar is also located near the beach. The pools were also very fun - alot of daily activities and music. The staff, for the most part, were very friendly. Overall, we had a lovely vacation. The weather was fabulous, the food was great, the beach was beautiful. We could not have asked for a better vacation! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1163,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1158}]}
