{"text":"So-So The hotel was beautiful. There are 3 pools and so many bars. We stayed right outside the main pool area with the pool bar. The room was great except for issues with ants in the toilet and sink area. We complained about it several times, however nothing was done about it. Another issue was that the cleaning maids came to pick up every single towel in the hotel room at 8am. No towels were given back to us until 5pm. The presented a problem if we woke up late or needed to go to the bathroom. The toilet and shower areas are a little see through..however it wasn't a big deal. There are no channels in English, so if you are looking to watch some tv since there is nothing else to do in the evening, then good luck with that. The food was the biggest issue. We went to the Mexican restaurant the first night, and the food smelled spoiled. It must have been sitting out for hours. I ordered a drink and that was warm. Never went there again! We did go to the oriental place, and loved their food..and continued to go there every single night of our trip since the other food in the hotel was horrible. At the buffets, there was flies in the dressings, and at one point we saw a bird just sitting there and snacking on the food, and no one did anything about it. The water was good, since no one got sick from it. We ended up having the same meal every day: bread for breakfast (with water), pizza and fries (with soda), and oriental food (with other drinks). The service of the hotel was overall pretty good. People barely spoke English but we were able to get around pretty easily. The beaches were gorgeous, but get ready for ScubaCaribe to hassle you for money. They come up to you at every possible moment for you to sign up with them to do activities. If you are interested in that, that's great, but we were there just to lay on the beach and relax and when people are constantly hassling you, it's annoying. We did venture out to the other beaches during the day, and guys hassled us there, as well. We were 3 young women, but still be careful when venturing off your resort. Never do it at night, and stay in groups. There is a market and also internet cafe where you can go on the internet for a reasonable price and also make calls to America if needed. The hotel also had buses that allowed you to go to the casino and shopping center. We didn't want to venture on that since we weren't interested in either, but both a good option if getting bored on the resort. Some things to always bring: lots of sunscreen, bug spray (my friend got 35 bug bites within the first couple days we were there), something to do in the evening to keep yourself entertained. They do provide bottled water in the refrigerators in the room. There is a downside about that because electricity only works when your room key is inserted in a slot when you are in your room. You only get one room key so when you leave the room with that key, everything turns off - all lights, air conditioning, and refrigerator. We did get a safe key for a reasonable price, as well. Overall, I wouldn't come back to this hotel, because of the food. The only things to do at this resort was eat\/drink and lay on the beach...and if you are left with only one option, you are gonna end up baking in the sun starving to death. I would def try another resort after talking to other people at the airport and hearing about their food options.
