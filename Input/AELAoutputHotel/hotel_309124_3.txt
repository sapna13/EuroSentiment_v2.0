{"text":"Loved It! When we arrived at the airport our driver was there waiting for us we had him organised by the Jayakarta he told us a little bit about Bali and some of the activities we could do. When we arrived the workers outside the hotel came and opened the doors for us. We got froms next to our familys luckily because the hotel was nearly booked out. We went to regerstration and asked for our key but the room wasn't ready we were transfered to another part of the hotel our rooms were very shabby and in our friends room the air-conditioning didnt work one leaked and the other didnt turn on. As we were staying the hotel for two weeks we could not stand the rooms and as promised we were changes as soon as possible. We got 4 rooms as there was two familys on our holiday we got 2 joining next to each other and 2 near each other on the other side of the hotel which over looked the pool they were very nice and I would recomend asking for the rooms from 216 - 252. Every morning there was a buffet breakfast there was a wide choice to choose from but after 2 weeks we had tried everything because they had the same thing everyday. The pools were amazing and looked beautiful they were a bit warm but that cant be helped the deep plunge pool was a bit of a disapointment because you could hardly plunge into it was only about half a metre deep, the infinity pool was great and we ha fun lying around the pool on the day beds. The sunset bar is nice to sit and have a coke and just outside the hotel is legian beach. The culture night was nice with all of the balinesse dancers. If you ever stay at the Jayakarta Hotel the best resturant close to the hotel is the Zanibar just outside the hotel infront of legian beach. I would highly recomend staying at the Jayakata Hotel and I would definitly stay ther again ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1475,"mention":"coke","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola"],"startOffset":1471},{"endOffset":1475,"mention":"coke","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola"],"startOffset":1471},{"endOffset":1475,"mention":"coke","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola"],"startOffset":1471}]}
