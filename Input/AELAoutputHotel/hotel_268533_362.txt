{"text":"WOW! What a nice Hotel Family vacation with kids and brother-in-law in tow. I was looking for a nice Hotel in the Wharf area. I showed my wife my three choices and she naturally picked the most expensive one. I agreed, but only if she could get a better deal then on-line prices.She called the Klimpton booking phone number and they told her about the Discovery Awaits package. This package included an upgrade to a Deluxe room, free valet parking (normally $51.00 for mini van) and two free breakfasts at the attached Blue Mermaid Cafe and two Muni passes (good for buses and cablecars). It was only $50.00 more then the on-line rates.Once we pulled up to the valet area, I knew we made the right decision. The staff was friendly and helpful without looking for a handout. The lobby was bathed in cool blue lights with overstuffed chairs and color shifting sailboats.The rooms where surprizingly large by San Francisco terms. The decor was nautical and whimsical. The lepord robes where an instant hit with the two kids, they felt like royalty.I would agree with all of the nice comments that other posters had to say. The hosted wine hour was a nice way to meet other people and get tips for the next days adventures.I had few complaints. The walls and ceilings are a little thin. The beds are a little short and the bottom sheets are folded even shorter , so I kept ending up jumbled in the sheets every morning. Other then that, a great experience was had by everyone in my party.I would highly recommend that Hotel for your next stay down by the Wharf area ","annotations":[{"endOffset":16,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":12},{"endOffset":100,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":96},{"endOffset":1079,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1075},{"endOffset":1151,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1147},{"endOffset":1151,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1147}]}
