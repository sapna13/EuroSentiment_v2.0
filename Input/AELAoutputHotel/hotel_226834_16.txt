{"text":"Wonderful Budget Hotel This hotel was great - exactly as expected! We stayed four nights in late April\/early May, after two nights at a more expensive hotel, and liked the Grant better.The room had a very comfortable bed, good tv with clear reception, and we found the staff very friendly and enthusiastic to talk about San Francisco and make recomendations. We had muffins from the continental breakfast every morning, and pizza from Uncle Vito's across the street three times. We used the Internet on the lobby computers several times and the wait was never long. We were back in the room before 8pm every night, just chilling out. It was always clean and warm and comfortable.The location was absolutly perfect - great restaurants nearby (other than Uncle Vitos, we also went to the sushi place on that street and Lori's Diner down Powell), easy walk to the cable car, the street car and the BART - we bought a CityPass and only used transit throughout the trip, no cabs whatsoever. There was also a WalGreens down the street where we bought Cherry Coke (unavailable in Canada), trail mix, and discount Ghirardelli chocolate bars, which we kept in the room fridge. The Grant was a little farther from the sketchy part of town than expected - we were asked for money a lot less staying at the Grant then down the road at Parc55.Yes, the window looked out at a wall, but on the upside there was absolutly no noise. The smell people talked about was barely noticible - if I hadn't been looking for it, I wouldn't have noticed. The only other problem we had was that our bathroom door did not fully shut, and the staff didn't seem too bothered about it when we reported it. We didn't care, but others might. ON the supbjet of the bathroom, the bathtub was roomy and there was plenty of hot water.We got the room through Expedia and got a rate of $58 per night. Having stayed there once, I'd go as high as $90 before I paid for a more expensive hotel again. This was our first vacation in two years and thanks to the Grant, everything was perfect.
