{"text":"Very nice time I was very impressed with the Marriott San Juan..we were there for Christmas week so there was a lot of festivity and it never felt overcrowded. The pool area was very nice as was the small beach. It'snot the most picturesque beach in the world and there are properties on either side that are vacant or undergoing construction but frankly I didn't find this distracting but I'm more of a pool person anyway. The surf there is rough with undercurrents so don't expect to lie there on an air mattress and float. The food there was quite good and I had quite few meals at La Vista. Didn't check out Tuscany...I'm Italian and would be disappointed with any Italian restaurant in Puerto Rico I think.The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and pleasant 24\/7, much moreso than other hotels where I've stayed. The hotel itself is in the middle of the Condado district where it seems that most of the wealthier Puerto Rican community resides. There are lots of good restaurants within walking distance, and it's right across from Starbucks, Walgreens and Haagen Daas. For the ladies, there is entire block of high end stores: Gucci, Cartier, Ferragamo, etc and my wife and daugther were overjoyed with this. (I wasn't) For my first time experience in PR, I found this hotel and it's location to be perfect.Next visit, I would like to rent a car and explore a little of the island and maybe stay in a different town for a couple of days.
