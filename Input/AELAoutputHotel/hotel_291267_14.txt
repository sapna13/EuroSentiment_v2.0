{"text":"Not bad for the price My husband and I ended up spending a night here completely unplanned, when my car broke down on the Turnpike. For the price, I was pleased with what we got. It is true that there was a long wait for the unhelpful, unapologetic front desk, but the rooms were clean and the hotel amenities are nice. We liked the restaurant, the gift shop was a lifesaver in an unplanned stay like ours, and the hotel food quality was good for such a low price! The walls were thin enough that I could hear the t.v., faucets, and guests whistling\/talking in the next room. That being said, maybe we lucked out, but even with a hotel full of children and wedding guests it was still surprisingly quiet at night. They put us on the 3rd floor, DIRECTLY above the night club and yet I couldn't hear any noise coming from there. Looking out the window, we could see an accident on the freeway (had to shut the blinds to keep out the flashing lights) and yet could never hear the sirens. Nor did the traffic from the very busy road outside the window create enough noise to bother us. We live in a quiet, rural area at home, so unlike some past reviewers we are not desensitized to city noise. Room service showed a lot of patience over the phone and did get our breakfast order correct despite english not being their first language. It's Miami, 66% of the population is Latino! The equally Hispanic restaurant staff also got our dinner order correct without any problem. However, I WAS a bit frustrated that they don't have a menu to look at when ordering room service. The hotel is in a convenient location. Several car rental places are nearby (one is directly across the street) and there is straightforward access to the turnpike and I-75. The hotel was unapologetic about it being after the hours of their mall shuttle service, but we were still able to walk to the mall very quickly. All and all, it was quiet enough, and a clean, convenient hotel to stay in. I feel we got our money's worth and would recommend it.
