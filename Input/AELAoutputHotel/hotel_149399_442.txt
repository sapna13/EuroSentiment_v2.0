{"text":"penalty for an overbooked hotel... who pays ? The guest Just to show that I am not a rookie at traveling I have to say that this was my 4th trip to the Dominican Republic and I have been traveling to other islands for about 10 years. Once we were settled in our rooms we had a great time and the rooms, service and grounds are spectacular. The problem came at the beginning. Our vacation was to run Friday 4\/13 to Friday 4\/20 but the hotel was overbooked and we lost a full frustrating day.  We booked the trip on 11\/06\/06 but 10 days before departure we were told the hotel was overbooked and we would have to spend the first day at another hotel. When airlines overbook there is always a penalty to be paid but the hotel said they would upgrade us to royal service but without a room upgrade. Then they put our room as far away from the royal service area as possible. This property is so huge that a train is needed to get anywhere. Our second problem came when we actually got to the hotel and our room was not ready. Buses were unloading and people were happily going to their rooms as we had to sit and wait till 5:30 PM before we got our room key. THEN when we took the train trip to our room we found the bed stripped and the maid washing the floor as though the previous guests had just left. It took 3 phone calls before I gave up trying to reach the front desk manager and one more call to the hotel manager who said he's get back to me. He did... at 6:30 PM and of course the room was ready then. He offered to move us closer to the royal service area but not till late the next day. Lose another day ? I don't think so. The next day we found a bottle of champaign (which I left for the maid) and a warm plate of cold cuts and cheese (no idea how long these had been sitting in the room while we were at the beach). Once we were settled we enjoyed the hotel but if airlines have to pay for overbooking who's going to make the hotel pay SOMETHING. An extra day or something like that wont work because you can't change vacation plans or air tickets but the hotel shoul be forced to do SOMETHING. I have included my entire story in emails to my travel agent (Liberty Travel), the tour company (TNT) and the hotel chain. Both TNT and Liberty Travel have contacted me and said they plan to follow up and get back to me. we'll see......
