{"text":"Vermin! This is the second time my partner and I have stayed at the Victoria and I have to say things have gone down hill dramatically since our last stay. This trip we spent 2 nights (Wednesday to Friday morning) but we now have no intention of ever returning. We checked in on a hot sticky August day helping ourselves to a nice cool complimentary bottle of water whilst the trainee receptionist tried to book us into our room. WRONG not complimentary we were charged for it as we booked out!After finding our way over the bridge and along the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëirty√à√\u2020\u2022?corridor to our hotel room we were disappointed to discover our room musty and moldy and the bathroom still had long hairs belonging to the previous occupant in the shower. My partner and I had just finished a camping trip and this was supposed to be our little bit of luxury after it - this place is supposed to be 4 stars! We made do with the room and the noise from outside our window being thankful it was warm and dry however the final straw came during the night when I was awoken by a rustling noise from the dresser. When I got up I discovered the culprit was mice raiding our bag of sweeties (candy) we had brought over as a gift for our friends kids. I informed the receptionist and she was to say the least unconcerned √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬®es we get that a lot, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ because we are close to the canals√à√\u2020\u2022? √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??hat can we do we don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like them but they like us√à√\u2020\u2022? With that laid back attitude to vermin I dread to think what the kitchens are like! Perhaps a hotel cat or mouse trap or two? There was no evidence of any pest control anywhere in the hotel as far as we could see certainly not in our room or anywhere along the corridor.There are worse hotels in Amsterdam and the Victoria does have a great location but at the moment that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ about all it has going for it look elsewhere!
