{"text":"fairly expensive but totally worth it! I was in New York for work, and stay at the Palace for 3 nights. Wonderful hotel. It is a bit more expensive than most, but totally worth it in my opinion. First - the location. My room had a view of St Patricks Cathedral, which was sunny and lovely every morning. That you can walk out onto 5th avenue and enjoy the best shopping in NYC is amazing! And it is a short walk to central park up 5th avenue. The room itself is well-appointed - large flat screen TV, the most comfortable bed you have ever slept in, and turn-down service with relaxing music and slippers next to your bed. A great touch! Rooms are quiet and you can't hear your neighbors, which is important. I reall enjoy having drinks at the bar there, since it is comfortable and the service is great. Check-in was quick and efficient, and the people helping with luggage are great to point out how to work all the amenities in the room. My room rate included breakfast, which you can order as room service at no extra charge which most people do not know. Breakfast was GREAT - toast and pastries, eggs, coffee, fresh juices, etc. When room service delivered they even opened my curtains so I could enjoy the sun. I know a deli is cheaper, but it is really luxurious to eat breakfast in bed after a long day! I highly recmommend the spa there as well.As for restaurants within walking distance - I really enjoy BLT steakhouse. And for drinks in a younger and more lively atmosphere with music, try the W hotel. The hotel is definitely close enough to walk to times square if you want to catch a broadway show, but if you are wearing heels like I do it is a quick and easy cab ride - the hotel does a great job of keeping a long que of taxis at your beck and call. Try the Palace!
