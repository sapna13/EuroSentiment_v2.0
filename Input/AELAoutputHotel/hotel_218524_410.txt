{"text":"I hate it Let me start by saying that the resort it self was beautiful it was very clean. Lets start with the long ride from airport to resort it was long about 1 hour and a half, the driver almost kill a dozen people riding in there mopeds on the way to the resort. We then got greeted in the hotel lobby with cheap champaing. The room was nice but full of bugs and the main problem I had of the room was the mini bar I call 3 times cause it was not working the drinks were hot, when i finally got someone to check it out I was told the mini bar was suppose to keep the drink in room temperature. ( how the hell someone is gonna have a beer in room temp) I complained a thousand times to the General manager Mr Montanez problem never got fixed. The food was horrible, room service was the worse I rather eat White castle hamburgers. If you pick this resort for the Lobster House like I did don't is the worsed restaurant in the resort. The only restaurant that's good is the Spice, and the grill. By the way if you wanna eat at the Agave keep waiting every night it was full so you really eat at 2 of the 8 restaurant. the service was horrible in the restaurant it takes about 15 min to 30 min to get your order if you are lucky. And the service by the pool or through out the resort is also horrible I think this resort is under staff. I use the word horrible a lot cause thats the only word that can described my experience in the resort. If you are a beach lover (once again like my self) don't waste the money go some were else the water are rough that they do not let you in the water 1 out of 6 days i spend there i got in the water. But wait it gets better the sand had this animals call sand flies they will eat you up even if you have bug spray and they itch like hell and it last for 6 days. VERY IMPORTANT DO NOT TRUST JHONNY HE SELLS THE EXTRA ACTIVITIES in the resort he's from Prieto tours he is a crook. I got charged on my credit card more then I wast told I'm stil disputing the matter. I bought a trip to Saona from him and when I went on it the people in charge from prieto tours are all crooks they will push you to buy things example don't buy the mamajuana. bring your own towels you will never find any. this resort is not worth the money I pay it should not be call the excellence it should be call the Horrible punta cana ","annotations":[{"endOffset":814,"mention":"White","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":809},{"endOffset":832,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":822}]}
