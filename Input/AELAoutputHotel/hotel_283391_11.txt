{"text":"Nice hotel...beautiful beach...but would not stay again! This was my first visit to Punta Cana and I expected a lot more of the Dominican vibe. I'm from New York and needless to say, my area has more of the ambience I was expecting.I chose this hotel based on the reviews from other travelers on tripadvisor.Pros: Beach, hands down was amazing!!! The hotel is next to the Royal Suites, actually very quiet part of the beach and it was a great area to relax in. The staff was very friendly and great service!! We were upgraded to a room with a loft and jacuzzi bath tub.Cons: I'm hispanic but the Spaniards or European Hispanics were truly not nice people!! They were just not friendly nor interested in having conversations with other guests. I noticed they kept very much to themselves or their kind. That's pretty sad since we are all Latinos!! Anyway, we met people from the states that were very nice but felt the same way!  I expected the hotel to have more ambience, a bit more of a party mood, instead we had to listen to the same 3 songs play over and over again during the week. The band in the lobby played slow, depressing music...and the people were just BORING! I was there to relax but come on people, just a little more excitement! Dominican Republic is known for merengue and great music! Food: It was just ok! Everything was bland! (ketchup, fruit, meats, etc.) I know true Dominican cuisine (and no I am not of Dominican descent) and it does not taste like this! I was so surprised by the food. I was NOT expecting 5-star but most of it was just bad buffet, at best and that's including the a la carte restaurants.Room: The beds were hard (I know its just for sleep but they need an upgrade), the floor in the loft area was indented (shaky boards), we were afraid to sleep up there! Hotel: Has 4 hotels and it is enormous. The only way to get around is by the trolleys and most of the time they were full to capacity!  I stayed a week and was happy to come back home to my bed and good home cooking! I do miss the beautiful beach!! Would not stay there again!! I am looking to find another resort with better food and better ambience in the near future.
