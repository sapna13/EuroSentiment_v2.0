{"text":"For the money...this is a great little hotel The Banys Oriental Hotel was, for central Barcelona, very reasonably priced. For this price range, I thought the hotel was wonderful. The location is great - within walking distance of the Cathedral, the Santa Maria del Mar, the harbor, the Ramblas, and great shopping. Metro and bus are also close by. I would note that the street noise can be a bit loud at night (particularly since locals keep later hours than the average Brit, American or German). This did not bother me at all, but I can see that if you were a light sleeper, you might find the level of activity at 1 a.m. to be bothersome. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The restaurant next door had good food and I would recommend making a reservation for dinner there. The breakfast was expensive (10 Euro per day), but the variety of items was excellent. We only had breakfast in the hotel twice and of course, it was a European breakfast ( a lot of different rolls, breads, croissants), cheeses, meats, cereals, soft boiled eggs, and fruit. There were a lot of options and the quality was good. If you just want coffee and a croissant or a panini, I would recommend skipping the hotel breakfast and heading out to a local cafe (considerably less expensive).The hotel also has computers that you can use on the second floor to check your e-mail or surf the Web. This is free of charge and I found it to be a nice service in terms of checking in with home.The rooms themselves are very nice ...contemporary design and very clean. The hotel provides slippers, shampoo, bath gel, lotion, a hairbrush, comb, sponge, toothbrush, showercap, etc. to guests. This was a nice perk. For this class of hotel, I really only expected soap and perhaps shampoo, so I was pleasantly surprised at all the other toiletries. The bathroom was also nice, if small. The only thing that I really didn't like about the room was that the bathroom had no ventilation...fan or otherwise. As a result, there was always a lingering mildew smell in the bathroom. Finally, the hotel provided a refrigerator full of bottled water, available to guests on the floor. I thought this was a very nice amenity, given that restaurants and shops will charge you 1 or 2 Euros for the same bottle of water.In short, if you want to be in the center of the action and you want good value for your money, this hotel comes highly recommended.
