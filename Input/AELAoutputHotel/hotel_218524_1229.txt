{"text":"Dream Vacation at Excellence Punta Cana My daughter and I stayed at Excellence Punta Cana from March 8 th to March 23rd. Which was the best 2 weeks I can ever remember having. I've been back home for 2 days and I want to go back now. We had one incredible vacation there!! The resort more than lives up to its name. The landscaping, resort, pool, beach, ambiance is just breathtaking. We were treated like princesses there by one and all of the staff. We ate at most of the restaurants , we missed a few due to the fact that we were having such a good time that we forgot to go eat ,haha. All the restaurants we went to had exemplary food and wait staff. There were NO misquitos, like so many reviews warned about. Our room was always cleaned and refreshed with flower arrangements, fruit, fresh towels, liquor restocked etc. seemed like a twice daily basis. And if we ran out of anything or requested additional service it was at our door within 20 mins at the max.I took past reviewers advice and shopped strictly at Nancy's shop. Incredibly nice and friendly woman ! besides the fact that she has the best prices and items. The only draw back for me was that there are no ATM machines at the resort and it is a little difficult to get extra cash if needed. I do love to shop ,haha..The resort is beautiful, the atmosphere is spectacular but the one thing I feel that puts the icing on the cake for a memorable vacation to want to return is the staff interaction with the vacationers. My daughter and I spent a lot of time with the activities\/entertainment team. We enjoy learning new cultures and truly love being around happy honest outgoing people. The activities\/entertainment team at Excellence Punta Cana is the BEST bar none. Specifically , Ricardo , Franklin, Ines, Wendy, Chichi and I can't forget Francisco ,haha..Francisco if you read this notice I didn't write down the nickname Candice and I called you ,hahaha. This team of GREAT people work 16 hour days to ensure that our vacation is the best it can be. They are constantly smiling, upbeat, happy, and always there to help or just to laugh and talk with you. How many of us can work those many hours a day with a continuous smile and happy attitude, haha.. These people won our hearts and have become close friends to us.In closing I just want to let the management know that because of your excellent activities\/entertainment team I will most definitely be making Excellence Punta Cana my continuous vacation spot and will be recommending your resort to all my fellow coworkers and friends.And to the team if you read this. I will be back like I promised. I miss you guys (smiles).Sue LaRocheFort McMurray, AlbertaCanada ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1048,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1044},{"endOffset":1396,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1392}]}
