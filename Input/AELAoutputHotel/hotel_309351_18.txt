{"text":"Loved Damai... Paradise in north Bali My husband and I are currently staying in Damai. (We came here on July 2nd and will be leaving on July 6th.) This is the last part of our Bali vacation and we are so pleased with our choice in accomodation. Damai is a wonderful place for a bit of √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºplurging√à√\u2020\u2022?in Bali. Actually, for $165 USD\/night [+ tax\/service charge = ~ $185 USD\/night], the price is very reasonable for what you get. Included with the accomodation is a fabulous breakfast [with a wide variety of choice between Continental, American or Indonesian food). The hotel has 8 detached villa-type rooms (each consisting of a bedroom with a sitting\/dining area, and a washroom with an outdoor shower and jacuzzi tub). There is a spa onsite, a beautiful pool, and wireless internet access at a fee [with option to use a hotel laptop in your villa]. The hotel is also well-known in the area for its fantastic restaurant (check out photos on their webpage). Service in the restaurant is comparable to a fine dining establishment in any cosmopolitan city.The design of the villas and hotel grounds is gorgeous. It is a wonderful showcase of Balinese\/Asian design (interior and exterior). The staff are fantastic √à√\u2020\u2022?professional, hospitable and friendly. A lot of thought has been put into making sure each guest√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ experience is the best (ie: fabulous welcome drink, a welcome flower arrangement, the personal note in the room, and a small library of books\/videos and board games at reception). The hotel has its own organic garden (growing much of its own vegetables\/fruits and herbs). Every morning, the hotel provides a rotating variety of fruit grown in Bali for guests to sample in their rooms (with complete description of the fruit and how to eat it). In the interest of complete safety, all water used in the hotel (ie: for ice, food and drink preparations and for washing vegetables\/fruits\/salads) come from bottled water. This is an added bonus since we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe always refrained from eating raw fruits\/vegetables in Asia because of the water! Damai is located up on the mountain (with a beautiful view over the hill and of the ocean). It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ about a 5 minute drive down to Lovina (a smaller, quiet seaside village compared to Kuta\/Seminyak and Ubud). The hotel provides free transport to Lovina\/the beach, and also offers a variety of activities for guests (at various prices). Activities include excursions to various villages and areas of interest, as well as water activities (ie: snorkelling, diving) and sport (ie: golf, trekking) activities. With any activities arranged through the hotel, the hotel ensures guests are provided with the BEST service and are √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢aken care of√à√\u2020\u2022?professionally throughout the entire experience. For example, my husband and I arranged a dolphin viewing experience in Lovina Bay on a traditional boat in the early hours of the morning (~ 6 am) today. The hotel arranged for us to have coffee and biscuits 15 minutes before our departure. We were driven down to the beach and arrangements were made for us to be on a traditional boat (owned by Damai). This would be a great place for a lovely honeymoon [or just a nice quiet opportunity to enjoy each other√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ company and relax in a great environment]. Currently, the hotel is in the midst of expanding. There are 6 new villas being added (with their own private pools). They said the villas will be ready in 2008. The only thing to make note of is that all prices listed through the hotel is in USD. (Prices are comparable to North America and Europe.) I feel confident recommending this hotel to all travellers considering a high end hotel in the northern part of Bali. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ just sad I will be leaving in 2 days. :( ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2978,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2972},{"endOffset":3204,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3200},{"endOffset":3204,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3200}]}
