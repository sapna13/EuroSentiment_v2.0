{"text":"Fabulous Affiinia!! We JUST got back from our stay at the Affinia Dumont  I have to write about it! This was the perfect hotel for a visit to NYC. I am no stranger to NYC (used to live there) and have certainly had my share of stays in 5 star hotels. The Affinia may have the occasional flaw - a crack on the ceiling, etc. But they really do provide a higher-end experience (especially amazing considering the price!) Friendly staff - one guest told me the doorman ran 4 blocks in the rain to find her a cab. I'm 5 months pregnant and was still getting over a bad sinus infection, after an early am flight I was desperate for a bed. The staff was able to accomodate my early check in within about an hour of my request (just enough time to have breakfast around the corner!) Comfortable beds with wonderfully soft, cotton sheets and down pillows - you also have the choice of 4 other types of pillows just a phone call away - housekeeping had my extra pillows in my hands (cases were still warm from pressing!) within 5 minutes! We were supposed to stay at the Roosevelt during my husband's conference, but after reading all the bad reviews we quickly switched. For a few dollars more than the discounted conference rate at the Roosevelt, we got a king 1BR suite. Can we say huge? Our place was bigger than any apartment I or my friends have ever had in the city. The neighborhood is just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Herald Square, but there's plenty nearby - grocery store (Gristide's), gourmet markets, cafes and diners - try the one at 33rd  3rd for breakfast!). The internet fee really is insignificant when you realize the going rate at the kinko's on 33rd and park is 30 cents per minute.)In a nutshell, the best way to feel at home while away from home!
