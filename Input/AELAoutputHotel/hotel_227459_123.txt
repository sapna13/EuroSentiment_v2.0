{"text":"Good Hotel if you get the right room I was travelling for working purposes in Juli\/August, low season for Madrid, and therefore was able to take advantage of a good internet rate. (I still wonder how the high normal rate can be afforded by normal people).I agree with other reviewers that the location is perfect. Just aross the street from Metro Callao, you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l get anywhere in town in a snap (I recommend the metro  bus flatrate tickets for cheap and unlimited travelling on all metro and bus lines in the city).The hotel itself is a mixed bag: Staff is friendly and helpful, everything spotlessly clean, the view from the rooftop terrace was gorgeous. My room, though, was small and dark, like all the rooms not facing outwards, so make sure you get one facing Gran Via!Well. for THAT room I would give no more than three stars, grudgingly. The view and location are five stars, definetely.The Internet connection, though present, is awfully slow - I needed it urgently to upload work related data and finally had to go an Internet caf√ã√\u2022√ñ outside (Staff agreed that something has to be done about that since they suffer themselves from the inconvenience).A small thing last, not anybody might agree: I hate the elevator style music in the 9th floor Bar, an endless loop - I thought it would eat up half of my brain cells while sitting there, so I finally fled from the comfortable sofa to my dark little room...The breakfast I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ try since I was on a tight time schedule, so I preferred grabbing my coffee and bocadillo on the way to my daily tasks. But the place on the 1st floor overlooking busy Gran Via where breakfast is served is spacious and pleasantly furnished.In total, as long as I get a better room for a good rate I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be back...
