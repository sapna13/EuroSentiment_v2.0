{"text":"Perfect holiday We arrived at the Hyatt after a total journey of approx 24 hours to be met with smiles, flower garlands, a refreshing cool drink and cool towels. They also took our photo (after that long a journey what did we look like!!!). Our ocean view Regency Club room was not quite ready so they gave us a temporary room for a couple of hours. When we did arrive in our room it was wonderful with brilliant sea views. The Regency Club was worth the extra cost, if only for the peace and tranquility it provided. It was so relaxing to have breakfast in there and complementary early evening drinks with finger foods. The staff address you by name and are so attentive without being in your face. The whole of the Bali Hyatt was beautiful. The grounds are kept immaculate and so beautiful. We ate in the Italian Restaurant next to the beach and also the restaurant next to the pool (sorry cannot remember their names), both were very good. Drinks in the Hyatt are cheaper than at home but are more expensive than out in Sanur or around Bali. The Bali Hyatt is also in a very good position in Sanur, with shops, bars and restaurants on either side of its entrance but far enough away not to cause a disturbance.Shortly after our arrival we had a jet lag massage int he hotel spa. It was quite expensive but worth every penny - we slept like babies that night. We had booked this before our arrival at the Hyatt. We hired a driver recommended by a friend and he was amazing . We went out with him for 3 full days and we saw the real Bali. He speaks perfect English and my husband and he were great mates by the end of the first day talking about rock music whilst travelling around Bali. On another day we went to the far north of Bali to see the little girl that we sponsor - what an emotional experience that was but very rewarding.Sanur is a very good place to stay. It is not as hectic as Kuta but there are still lot and lots of restaurants and bars along the main street. There is also the beach path which runs the length of Sanur, just be aware of the sellers that follow you. There are no time share touts as there are in Kuta.All in all we had a brilliant holiday and cannot wait until we can return, hope fully not in the too distant future. We would definite stay at the Bali Hyatt again.
