{"text":"Nice hotel in a bad part of town I guess when you look to spend less than $200 in Boston, you should expect to make some sacrifices in your accommodations. However, this hotel is very new, and is the anchor of a small shopping center near the Roxbury\/Newmarket (Industrial) section of Boston. It is close to downtown, but it is still a 2 mile drive, as well as being close to the Longwood Medical area. Parking is in an adjacent garage, and costs $25 a night. I had a rental vehicle that someone attempted to break into my first night there (left paint damage\/dents). The hotel is directly behind (south side) Boston Medical (city hospital), so expect sirens every several minutes all night\/morning long. I was later advised by several people not to walk around the area at night, though I did with little trouble, you certainly would be best to walk in groups, and I wouldn't take children with you.The staff was adequately courteous, but the security guard inside the lobby was a little disarming. The rooms are typical of a new Hampton; clean and serving my basic needs. The breakfast is also typical Hampton, with a very large dining room area, so you shouldn't have to fight for a seat as you might at other Hampton properties.Ultimately, if you want to order food in, and are looking for a new hotel that is inexpensive, and sightseeing is not in your plans, this hotel may fit the bill. I would suggest a taxi vs. having a vehicle at this site.
