{"text":"Perfect for a Private Getaway I have been relying on Tripadvisor reviews for a long time, but I have never written a review... until now. I feel that this hotel deserves recognition for the fantastic stay that we had. My husband and I stayed in a 1-bedroom villa for my 30th birthday. The villa was outstanding in every way. The first day that we arrived, we just hung out in the villa all day, swimming and listening to the music that the hotel provides in the CD player. They have wine and other drinks\/food stocked, and they are surprisingly very reasonably priced. I am a big planner, but this trip was a surprise from my husband so we had no real set plans regarding places to eat and go. We relied solely on the hotel for recommendations, and they never lead us astray for romantic dinner locations or shopping areas in Bali. They promptly called cabs whenever we needed them, and if our cab didn't arrive w\/in 5 minutes, the hotel drove us in their private car to our destination. The villa itself is gorgeous, and if total privacy is your goal...this is the place to stay. You can open up all the doors to the villa to really get the feel of the beautiful nature of Bali. Make sure to bring mosquito repellant though. The hotel also provides a mosquito repellant candle-like thing that I didn't see until we were on our way out. The breakfasts were great ~ just the right size. We tried a different one everyday. I am always leery of the water, so I didn't drink the coffee or juice until the last day. I was fine as it seems they use the big purified water jug provided in the villa to make these drinks. We also got services at the spa. My husband got a traditional relaxing massage and was very pleased. I wanted to be a little adventurous, so I opted for the hot and cold stones. Never again! The cold stones were freezing and would shock me out of submission and relaxation. One last note... we enjoyed the music that the Villa provided in the CD players so much that we were tempted to buy the CD from the hotel. They sell it for around $17 USD in the lobby (and even higher at the spa), but I was able to buy the entire CD on itunes when we returned home for $9.99.
