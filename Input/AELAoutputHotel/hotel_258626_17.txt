{"text":"Excellent Hotel, Best breakfast buffet, will definitely stay there again. Everything about this hotel was wonderful, the room was comfortable and extremely clean, it has everything you need  wish for, the bed was extremely comfortable, not the typical hotel room bed. Pillows were the best. The bathroom is very elegant, the toiletries are brand name, even the facial soap was great. They give you plenty of towels, not enough hangers but we called and 4 more hangers were delivered within a couple of minutes. The best breakfast buffet I have ever had. Whoever says Prava Suites' breakfast is not the best is flat out lying. In fact I would go back to this hotel just for their breakfast. The service was excellent, very friendly staff. Yes, you do have to pay for parking and at first I was a little mad because I'm not used to paying for parking at any hotel if it's not valet, but take my word for it, it's well worth it. We did have some problems with the room keys but were given new ones right away. Pool was good, water was a little cold but we told the front desk personnel and they immediately warmed it up. They do charge for local calls so don't be alarmed when you see a .75 charge per local call on your bill. Overall I'm very satisfied with the hotel, I'd have to say that 3.5 stars is too low for this hotel, I've stayed at 4  5 star hotels that do not offer a 3rd of the ammenities found at Prava Suites.
