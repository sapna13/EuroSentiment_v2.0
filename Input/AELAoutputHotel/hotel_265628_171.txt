{"text":"Wonderful Vacation My husband and I stayed at the Sirenis Aug.12-19, 2007. It is a huge property consisting of many 2 and 3 story buildings. The Tropical side, where we stayed, consisted of suites. Although the property is not new, our suite was cleaned daily and drinks in the frig were replenished daily. The ocean was fantastic-no rocks, seaweed, jelly fish or other unwanted things. The water was warm and quite calm. Not the best for boogie-boarding, but great for swimming. Every type of water craft was available. Beach palapas (straw umbrellas) had to be reserved early, as a general rule. The pool is gigantic, divided into several sections and that is where all the activities take place. The animation team is good and tries hard to get the guests involoved in many games.There are 9 restaurants on site, available by reservation on the same day you want to go, as well as 2 buffet restaurants, and a snack bar by the pool. The food is fine, not great, and we did not get sick from it. There is something for everyone, including vegetarian and kid's menu. We did not eat out of the property, as it is at least 35 minutes to the nearest small town and we chose not to do that. The property is quite isolated; it's not near any other hotels within walking distance, or even any shops. You have to take a taxi anywhere you want to go off the site.The property has beautiful gardens, trees and walkways. As it is very spread out, there is a tremendous amount of walking, the only drawback. It is not ideal for handicapped people, or those who do not like to walk, especially in the blazing sun (most days were 40 degrees including heat factor),The shows were so-so. We went to three and declined the rest. It is very hot in the theatre and the shows start at 10:00 p.m., by which time I was tired and wanted to sleep. e did not go to the disco, so I have no idea what it's like.There are many bars on site, including in the pool. We would sit in the gigantic lobby after supper and the waitresses would serve you whatever you wanted. They have many exotic drinks which we sampled, including the usual beverages you find in these type of resorts.As we have been to Punta Cana before and did side trips then, we did not do any trips this time. There are many things to visit, but some of the trips are quite costly (i.e.$100 plus US\/ person).As we went during the rainy season, we were quite lucky to have only one day of rain, the tail end of Hurricane Dean. It did rain like the end of the world on our second to last day and was very windy. But when you go to the trop8ics in the summer, you takle your chances, hoping to be lucky.All in all, a very enjoyable vacation.
