{"text":"Why do people love this hotel? I just don't understand why people love this hotel. My husband and I stayed here for two nights (we were supposed to stay for 5!) in January 2006. When we arrived, our room was supposed to be ready but they made us wait an hour! When we finally got up to the room, they gave us a room that hadn't even been cleaned!! We went back downstairs, they gave us another key and we ended up in a room with cheap, walmart-esque furniture and absolutely no view. We were highly disappointed- we'd booked this hotel based on all these great reviews on tripadvisor.com! After the second night I just couldn't stand it, afterall, this was our honeymoon trip! My husband and I were walking down George St. that night, the main drag in sydney, and stumbled upon the Saville 2 Bond Street hotel. We walked in and asked how much the rooms were and the manager offered to take us up and show us one! She was so nice. When we got up there, it was a studio with a travertine shower, washer and dryer, kitchen with dishwasher, microwave and granite countertops! At the time, the room worked out to be about $200 US a night! We were in heaven! We immediately walked back to the Rendevous, called hotes.como and canceled our resrevation and the next day finally switched hotels. I highly recommend the Saville 2 Bond Street hotel. It's literally a 5 minute walk to Circular Quay and the rocks and a block away from the Wynyard train station. The staff was extremely nice and accomodating and were totally sympathetic with our bad experience at the Rendevous. Don't stay at this hotel, stay at the Saville!! ","annotations":[]}
