{"text":"In a really nice area We have stayed in Paris on 2 previous occasions and were not impressed with the standard of hotel. In fact the first time we stayed there, we moved hotel after 15mins. We moved to the nice but completely overpriced Hotel Ambassador on Boulevard Haussmann. I cannot remember the name of the hotel we stayed in the second time that we were in Paris but the room was so small that we had trouble even walking around the bed.This time we used Trip Advisor to find a hotel. We came across Hotel Foch and liked the reviews. Some of the reviews mentioned Nelly and yes she is as good as they all say. She makes you feel so welcome. She wasn't there when we arrived on 23rd of December but the gentleman who greeted us was excellent. They have this lovely habit of coming out in front of the desk to talk to you when you walk in the door. We had our 11 month old son with us and Nelly just loved him.We were given the only room on the top (7th floor). The room was nice. It was very clean but looked a little shabby in places(e.g. worn carpet). The lift only went to the 6th floor so carrying baby and buggy up the 3 flights of stairs from there to get to our room was getting a bit tiresome after a few days. We brought our computer with us and really appreciated the free wifi access. We had a big deep bath and it was lovely to soak in after a long day of walking around Paris. It is a 10 min walk to the L'arc de triomph and 20mins to Eiffel Tour. The area around the hotel is very quiet and feels very safe to walk in.The hotel booked a restaurant for us to eat at on Christmas night and it was spectacular! In fact there were lots of restaurants nearby and almost all looked really good. We ate breakfast in the hotel one morning and while it was nice, we felt it was completely overpriced at 12euro per person. The other mornings we went to nearby cafes and ate plenty for a lot less money.When we go to Paris next time, we will stay here again. It's not perfect and at √à√\u2020√ü?60 per night for room only, it's not cheap. However having experienced other hotels in Paris, this one is as good as you'll get for the money!! To get a really nice hotel in the centre of Paris, one would have to pay far more.Again, nicer staff you will not find anywhere in France or beyond!!
