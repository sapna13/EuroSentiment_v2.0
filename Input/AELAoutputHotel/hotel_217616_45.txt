{"text":"Run run far away!!! I was so disappointed I couldn't let others have the same miserable stay, so I thought I would write my review. We booked this hotel through Priceline for a girl friend getaway. Priceline couldn't guarantee room type, so I called the hotel to see if we could get a room with two double beds. I was told that it wouldn't be a problem. Upon arriving front desk said he didn't have any doubles clean, could i come back in an hour? We came back in an hour and the same clerk informed us that they were sold out of doubles but he could give us a king suite with a fold out couch. (he lied to us on arrival???) Of course the King Suite was a nice room but the pull out bed is uncomfortable- as they all are. To top this off there is a major construction site going on BEHIND THE HOTEL. The reviews I read all suggested requesting a room in the back for peace and quiet. This is not an option!!! Construction starts bright and early at 6:30am. AAARGH!! The staff seemed genuinely concerned of our difficulties but couldn't do anything for us. Since we booked on Priceline we were stuck. We requested tickets from the concierge twice and both times had to call several times to confirm- would have been easier to have handled myself. To top it all off, the day before we left, housekeeping removed all of our newspapers. I know it sounds silly but we were saving the paper for the dates as a scrapbook souvenir. They were folded neatly on the desk- what housekeeper takes anything out of your room but what is in the trashcan??!!?? Again, informing the manager got us a shrug and an apology but no results. The only bright spot on our visit was Wilmore who helped us with our luggage and hailing cabs. What a sweet gentleman!
