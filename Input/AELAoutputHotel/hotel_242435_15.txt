{"text":"great great hotel My husband and I LOVED this hotel overall. I will list why we loved it and some things we didn't like. We liked it because...1. It's in the heart of everything. Right across the street is the Waikiki beach. It's also on the road with all the shops and street entertainment. You won't be bored. On the other hand, if you're in your room or in the hotel outdoor pool area, you won't hear much street noise.2. People are super helpful and nice. We told the front desk that we were on our special anniv. trip and asked if they can give us an upgrade and we got it! Floor 27, beautiful view of the beach... awesome. Also the concierge is really helpful. Specifically Jim (I think that's his name--a japanese gentleman with glasses...) was SO helpful. He also gave us tips on local restaurants that are known for good food that are not touristy. 3. Beautiful! The lobby is open air and gorgeous. The rooms (I got a corner room which is bigger) are beautiful. Nice decor, flat screen tv, clean. The 3rd floor pool\/bar area is really nice. It's super clean and they really take care of you. You can rent out towels which they will lay on the chairs for you and you can just lay there and relax after a day full of activities with a book and a drink. They also let you borrow towels and chairs for the beach outside the hotel, which is nice. We also took advantage of the indoor workout area which is great but i wasn't on vacation to work out so i only did it once. it's there if u want it tho. :) We didn't like it because...1. We rented a car (which i totally recommend bc we spent half the time up in the north shore of the island which is about 1-1.5 hrs drive) and the parking cost us just as much as renting the car. I think it was 20-25 bucks a day. and to park is a hassle because the lot is really small and squeezed so after a long day of doing stuff, you don't wanna get your car out to go out for dinner again. 2. They charge money on local phone calls! It's a buck for a call. We didn't know and were making calls to restaurants to make reservations and such and turns out we were charged a buck for each call. If you're from the mainland, just use your cell phone. 3. Internet costs. They also charge $$ for wireless internet. But that turned out OK bc it made us not think about our life back at home and just enjoy our trip. :)Some other things we loved about honolulu:Good asian food! There was a Thai restaurant 5 minute drive away from the hotel called Puckett Thai (sp??). Excellent!!! This is one of those places tourists won't know about. Seoul Jung 2 minute walk away had excellent korean bbq. Alan Wongs was 5 minute drive away. Really expensive but if you wanna end your last night with a great dinner, this is the place to go. You'll spend between 60-100 bucks per person but it's well worth it and i'm not even that rich! Dukes is right on the waikiki beach and we had dinner our first night there. Great food and ambiance. ABC convenient store had really good japanese pastries and their to go japanese noodles and rolls weren't that bad either! Mr. Musubi (spam+rice+egg wrapped with seaweed) was actually really good too. if you're on the go, i'd totally recommend it. Keonis is a thai restaurant just around the corner from the hotel but they serve good and cheap breakfast. Pancakes are really good there.Good activities! We went surfing at the Fire Hawaii surfing school. They are firefighters who are really great teachers. I am NOT athletic mid 20s female and I got to stand up and ride the wave for about 30 seconds! it was exhilarating. Definitely worth it cuz when are you going to surf if not here?? We went Snorkeling at Hanauma bay. The water feels kind of hazy at first but if you go out a bit more, even tho it's not that deep, you'll see LOTS of fish. It was GREAT. Northshore beach-we went to Waimea bay or something like that. There's limited parking but if you get a spot, it's SO spacious and clean there. we went back multiple times to come here. We even saw sea turtles here!!! Diamond head was nice. I'd hike it if you haven't done that yet.
