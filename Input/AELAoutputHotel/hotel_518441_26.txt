{"text":"Villas in the padi fields Found out about the Chedi Club at Tanah Gajah through tripadvisor and through a friend who had rave reviews of the Chedi at Phuket. Thought I'd give it a try, and boy, it was quite a find!Chedi Club is located at Tanah Gajah (land of the elephants), in Ubud. It's set in a padi field, which incidentally belongs to Chedi itself (yes, they grow their own rice and vegetables, apparently!). I stayed in a spa villa, which comes with its own spa facilities (small sauna, dip pool and private spa room with 2 massage beds). It was a little pricey, but good for a first experience.My review shall be in point form, so it's easier on the eyes:Good:- Rooms are big, cosy and clean- Open air rain shower- Efficient and friendly butler service- Complimentary mini bar, gin, vodka, whisky- Restaurant set in a beautiful padi field, very nice when the weather is good- Saw fireflies at night over the padi fields (for a guy who grew up in the city, it was definitely a magical moment)- Complimentary shuttle service to and from anywhere within Ubud- Free internet access (wired) within the room- Complimentary laundry. Great for regenrating your dirty clothes mid-trip!- Bose sound system in the living area and shower- Little thoughtful things like citronella spray and incense coils (for the mosquitos), torchlights and umbrellas within the room- Basically I felt that everything was taken care of! :DBAD:- Pillows are too soft (it's down, but my wife and i need good firm support pillows)If I need to complain about the pillows, I guess that this place is pretty good eh?It's definitely worth a try, especially if you like seclusion and quiet. If you are looking for action and nightlife, then this place is definitely not for you!
