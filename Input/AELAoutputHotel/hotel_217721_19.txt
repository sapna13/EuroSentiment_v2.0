{"text":"An elegant hotel with a great location This is an elegant hotel in a fantastic location, and it's become one of my favorite places to stay when I travel for work. It feels more like a boutique hotel than a typical Hilton, with elegant decor and attentive service. The hotel gym was being renovated when I visited, so I was given a free pass to Gold's Gym (about a block away), along with a hotel towel to use for my workout and a lock for the gym's lockers. I visited the hotel bar to watch some football, and the bartenders were all very good. The food was excellent -- a pleasant surprise for a hotel bar. I highly recommend the house salad, which comes with beets. Delicious! The concierge level snacks and breakfast items were better than most Hilton hotels' offerings.The turndown service is a nice surprise -- chocolates left on my pillow, along with the next day's weather forecast. The room's radio was on and tuned to classical music, and I found ice and two complimentary bottles of water provided each day. The hotel is right in the thick of some good shopping and restaurants. I grabbed lunch at Pei Wei (an Asian diner\/bistro with low prices and quick service) and sincerely enjoyed that. Within a short walk are CVS, Ross, and Marshall's. The only complaint I have is that the hotel internet service (which is around $9 a day, if I remember correctly), was SLOW, SLOW, SLOW. Other than the slow Internet service, this hotel visit was a homerun.
