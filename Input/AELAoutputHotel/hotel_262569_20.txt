{"text":"Most beautiful Club Lounge I have ever seen I am a big fan of Sofitel in Asia and the US so it was natural for me to consider this property while spending 7 nights in Sydney recently. The Hotel was built in the 1960's and can be considered a landmark in the city. It is a nice walk to the harbour and next to great shopping and restaurants. The hotel was completely renovated recently and the rooms (I stayed in a suite) are tastfully furnished although I am not a big fan of blond wood finishes. The fabrics and linens are excellent. The bathroom is a bit too small.The highlight of the hotel is Le Club lounge, which is available to guests at an extra cost. The finish and design of this lounge is absolutely beautiful. It is spacious and has a side array of snacks and drinks throughout the day, including champagne and fine wines. It has many different kinds of seating, so it was enjoyable at breakfast (with big flatscreens tuned to the local news and plenty of newspapers) and superb coffee. The staff is no doubt a notch above the rest of the hotel in this venue. I visited several othe hotels while I was in Sydney for various meetings and the selection is excellent. None of the other properties have this kind of experience, however.The reason why I rate this hotel only at 4 is because it had a poor selection of tv channels and $29\/day internet. Do you believe that BBC and CNN are not available? I watched local news for a week and got international news off my blackberry and online. Of course, I paid the $29\/day for the internet (on top of my $550 room rate), but I think this is a bit over the top. Maybe this is severe to complain about but I like many frequesnt travellers are fed up with this fee and go nuts when it is so extreme.
