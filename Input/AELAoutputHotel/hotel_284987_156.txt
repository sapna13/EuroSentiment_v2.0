{"text":"Huge New Year Disappointment My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in a Royal Suite room. We paid a supplement as we liked the concept of a separate 'adult only ' pool, newer room furnishings and separate business\/cocktail 'lounge' area. In a large hotel we thought this would make the experience more for couples.We didn't use the pool as the staff did nothing about the children in the so-called adult pool (even though we mentioned it) and there were children in the lounge on the computers a lot of the time when the weather wasnt so good and they were bored.The New Year's Eve buffet was the worst we have had in a hotel - underwhelming and no desserts unless you paid extra - as posted on a sign on the counter only to be discovered when you had finished your entrees!! The atmosphere was like a bad cafeteria and no special decorations to make it feel like New Year's Eve.Actually all the hotel food was very poor overall- the new Asian has the best flavours but the service is terrible - . One night we ate off- site in desperation at a restaurant the concierge recommended called 'Bambu' - but be warned the food here is also poor and they operate a system of menus with different prices - we had one of each so obviously agreed to order from the lower priced-version!On the plus side the Royal Suite room is good with new mattress and is very comfortable - but the hotel need to sort out the other issues before they can justify the higher rate for this 'not-so-royal' experience.
