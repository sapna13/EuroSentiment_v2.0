{"text":"Is this the greatest hotel in the world? Yes and no! This is certainly one of my favourite places to stay and I would return to this hotel every time I travel to Barcelona, that is of course, if I could afford it. Let's start with the negative points. The hotel is way overpriced for what it offers. The rooms are basic and maintenance is a real issue. What was bright and shiny before does not remain so for long without excellent cleaning and good maintenance, both of which were not in attendence. The corners of the rooms do not look like they have been cleaned in months and there's very obvious wear and tear on the fittings in the room. There are some special offers that make the hotel more attractive but overall for the facilities it offers, it is definitely overpriced. That said, this *is* certainly the best thought-through and considered hotels I have ever stayed at. The location is great, in a very nice part of town, minutes from the metro and the Aerobus stop coming from the Airport (get off at Unversitat\/Universidad). The staff are all superb, nothing is ever too much trouble and they are always eager to help out. It is thoroughly refreshing to stay in a gay-oriented hotel, right down to the free packs of condoms in the bathrooms. The beds are extremely comfortable and the free water in the hallways very welcome, although it might be more environmentally beneficial to offer larger bottles to save wastage. I chose not to eat breakfast in the hotel, there's a cafe across the street that offers croissant and cafe solo for EUR2.35 and one further down that is even cheaper. The roof is superb and the jacuzzi open 24 hours a day. Yes, the Axel has problems, and there is no way I could justify paying their rates to stay here on every visit to Barcelona, with lower rates available occasionally through their website, this is a great place to stay.
