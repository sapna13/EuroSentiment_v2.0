{"text":"Would not go back We are big fans of all inclusive resorts and have stayed in all inclusives in Cancun, Mexico 1\/2 dozen times. Those resorts were consderred 5-6 stars. So when you read this review, keep in mind what our frame of reference is.PROPERTY: The property is very nice with a nice private beach area. Depending on where your room is, you could be in for a lot of walking. The walkway between hotels is covered, but at the time of year we went, it made no difference as it was hot and humid. The beach is on one end of the hotel and most of the dining\/activity is on the other end of the hotel. Its like a big rectangular layout with a meanering pool running the length of the layout. There are no elevators at the individual buildings that house the hotel rooms. ROOMS: We had a deluxe junior suite. The rooms are tiny. The smallest I have ever seen! Additionally, the air conditioning would barely keep the room cool, even if you ran it 24\/7 IN CONJUNCTION with running the ceiling fan on high speed. The air conditioning intake filter was packed with about 1\/2 inch of dirt\/lint, etc. Apparently, it was not just our room that was like this and maintenance seems to replace the filters only when its brought to their attention. We were in a group of 14 people and everyone's rooms had the same air conditioning issues, some worse than others depending on the floor of the building. When you are out in the blazing heat all day and cannot even come to your room for a break, its quite disappointing. We also had a red ant infestation that seemed to have been created by the sugar near the coffee maker (either prior guests or room not properly cleaned).SERVICE: The service here was deplorable. From the rooms, the bars, to the pool side service to the diniing rooms (buffet or non buffet). A few examples....At the main pool cabana where towels are given out, at 9:45 a.m. one morning, they had no towels! In the rooms, we often were left with no floor towel, without ANY face towels, less bath towels, etc. At the bars (ANY of them and we frequented ALL of them), they are understaffed and unfriendly, unattentive and very slow. It seemed that unless you were greasing the staff with wads of cash, in advance of receiving your drink, service was not forthcoming. In the dining rooms, silverware would often be missing and take forever to get. Asking for a drink or a refill of water was another issue. We are used to the staff somethering us asking if we need something and here, you ask and ask and ask and finally get what you need when the meal is over. They seem to be able to habdle the buffet breakfast best. Pool side- there is usually 1 person covering a very large area and as a result, your drink will take 10-15 minutes if its early and if its peak time, figure 1\/2 hour.DINING\/FOOD: Food was acceptable. The variety was not impressive over a 6 day stay and the quality was so-so. One plus is that if you want to eat at a fancier restaurant, you do not need to make reservations unless you are in a large group. We went to the 4 out of the 5 restaurants and would recommend the French and Japanese ones the most. One issue is that you are expected to wear pants in most of the dining areas for the evening (with a proper shirt). While this is not a problem, in and of itself, its a big issue when its still hot as heck outside and the A\/C is barely effective or on in the dining areas. Especially in the Japanese restaurant where there are open grills giving off heat.The staff do not seem well trained and do not have the right attiudes either. Also, not all of them speak sufficient English so be forewarned.
