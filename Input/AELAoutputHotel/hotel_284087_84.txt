{"text":"Not at all what I expected at ALL Wow. What a disappointment. I was thouroughly looking forward to my stay at Il Bargellino, it came highly rated by Rick Steves and Carmel was nothing but wonderful during correspondence and helping with museum reservations. I was probably the most excited about this hotel over any other we were planning on staying in in Italy. The room was OK, i thought it was cute but my husband did not like it. Our room opened onto the Terrace, which Im sure is beautiful in the late Spring\/Summer. Carmel was in Boston visiting family, and her husband Pino spoke little English, but was very kind. There was also another man there who was from Boston, and he was nice as well. The small issues were the supplies (only one towel in the bathroom, no bathmat, location was not ideal, blah blah). The huge issue was at night. For our two night stay, we honestly slept about 4 hours each night. This was due to parties being thrown in the common room (or owner's quarters) located immediately next to our room. I had requested a room away from the owners home, due to my readings of other complaints on trip advisor, but I was assured that this would not be a problem. Boy was I mislead. We stayed in Florence for a Sunday and Monday night, two nights not usually considered your party nights. Both nights, the owners and miscellaneous friends, other guests, and who knows who else, gathered and drank and ate and talked and talked and talked and as the hours wore on, their voices grew louder and louder and louder. It was way past the level even of complete rudeness. The first night, we tried for many many hours to go to sleep, and the party eventually died down around 12am. The second night, however, it was around 2 when my husband finally got out of bed, walked over, and asked them all to be quiet. The party settled down a little bit, but it was still some time before everyone packed up and went to bed. We at first felt rude ourselves even thinking to go ask the owners to quiet down, since they were in their own house persay. However we soon got over this and realized it is one thing to do as you wish since you own the place, but it is a completely different thing to carry on which such volume and complete disregard for the guests who are PAYING to stay at your hotel. The professionalism of this hotel is terribly lacking, and I have a feeling (or at least I am still trying to see some good in this hotel) that this would not have happened id Carmel was in town. My husband and I were not going to pay for our second night, and actually request we receive full refund since the entire point in us staying there (having somewhere to SLEEP) was negated completely, but upon leaving Pino was at the desk and we both didnt want to mess with trying to explain ourselves when there was a language barrier. I would not reccommend this place to anyone, and am again incredibly disappointed in Il Bargellino and their idea of quality service to their customers.
