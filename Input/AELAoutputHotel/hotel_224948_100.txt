{"text":"The Omni went above and beyond My best friend and I went to San Francisco for a girls weekend and had the best time. The hotel was fantastic. From greeting us with roses and first class service upon checking in, to our beautifully appointed room.  It was a deluxe room with two double beds, marble bathroom, with no real views but very comfortable. We are wary of hotels but felt right at home at the Omni, as everything was clean and comfortable. I have stayed in Fairmonts and nicer hotels, and I would say that this hotel was at par with a 4+ star, it was great. My girlfriend celebrated a birthday during our stay and we only mentioned it to the front desk clerk when asked why in town, after dinner one night they sent up a bottle of champagne, two small birthday cakes and a personalized card. It was perfect! The gym was great, tv's on all the equipment and was never full, or even half full. Get your water there as there is complimentary water, and the bottle in your room is $6. Oh and there is also fresh fruit in the gym, which might be a nice snack as the mini bar and room service are quite pricey. Which isn't too much of a problem since the Omni is near alot of nice cafes, restaurants etc. (right beside the Omni there is a cafe which has everything and makes delicious panini's.... which are worth the trip back to San Francisco). We never ordered anything from the hotel.... except a bagel and fruitplate in the morning.... and it wasn't outrageous. No pool, no views, but what the hotel lacks in those areas, it completely compensates for in friendly helpful staff. It is close to China town, Union square, North beach and across the street from the Carmelian room which has amazing views while you dine. Become an Omni select guest member (free online) and you can get a complimentary morning beverage and paper, turn down service and upgrade after so many stays. Being on California street, alongside the cable cars, the Omni makes it easy to get around without a rental car. I would actually say avoid renting one if possible as parking in San Francisco is expensive and hard to come by. The hotel charges $45 I believe. So we rented one to drive up to win country, and returned it the same day, just to save us the hassle of paying for parking and returning it the next day.  San Francisco is a fantastic city and the hospitality extends far beyond the hotels and tourist areas. Everyone is so nice and made our trip so enjoyable. The Omni is a great hotel in a great location. We will return and as soon as we can.
