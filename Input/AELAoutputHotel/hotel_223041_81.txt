{"text":"Thanks for a wonderful time! I was looking for a fairly inexpensive but decent place to stay in LA for 4 days. After reading loads of reviews about crabby and skanky hotels in LA, I was at a wits end until I chanced upon the reviews of Hotel Elan on Tripadvisor. Based on the raving reviews, we booked 3 rooms in Oct and were totally glad we trusted Tripadvisor.com once again! The Hotel Elan is a shining beacon in a sea of really expensive hotels and really crabby motels in LA. It may be a higher-end budget place or as some term it a boutique hotel, however what sealed our wonderful experience here was really the staff at reception. Practically everyone at reception was super helpful, friendly and took obvious pride in their work. They took pains to ask us each day where we intended to go, and unprompted, printed driving maps for us and gave us very clear directions - really helpful for us as we were used to driving on the other side of the road! We felt really welcome here and got great advice from the staff about places to go, restaurants and night spots. The rooms are nicely appointed, although on the small side. And as this used to be an old folk's home before it was given new life as a hotel, the hallways still retain an old folks home feeling. We had 3 rooms - 2 were small and faced the inner courtyard, 1 was at the end of the corridor and was distinctly larger. If you prefer more space for your rooms, ask for the rooms at the end of the corridors. The location was convenient as well, close to Sunset and Santa Monica Blvds, and it was easy getting to the major freeways. I loved the fact that I could walk to Beverly Center shopping mall, which was useful since I had a free day by myself whilst my friends went to Magic Mountain. I spent an entire day at the mall and walked back by myself after dark - it was quite safe. The free continental breakfast that comes with the room was more than adequate. The lobby area does get quite crowded during peak breakfast time, and like another reviewer pointed out, it gets really hot with the sun streaming in. We tried to get back in time for the free wine reception but alas, the sights of LA beckoned and we never did made it in time. Was a nice thought though. Overnight parking for our car was $14 in an underground garage - it was great to have a valet park it and bring it around in the morning. On our second day, the guy at reception recognised us and before we could request for our car, it was driven out whilst we were having breakfast - great service! Overall, we loved the Hotel Elan! I was especially relieved as I was i\/c of booking the hotel for our party of 6. Thanks once again TripAdvisor! I never leave home anymore without checking out the reviews here!
