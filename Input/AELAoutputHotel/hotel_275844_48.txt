{"text":"Great Value, Location, and Very Helpful Hotel Columba turned out perfect for our family of 3: we had a large, clean room and stayed for 9 nights. We never felt claustrophobic.Breakfasts were fine- offering standard continental fare. All of us eat differently in the morning, and the combination of cereals, yogurt, fruit and rolls and cheese and prosciutto served all of our needs and were delicious. And our hosts served any hot beverages you wanted, along with great juices.Its location was excellent- close to the markets of San Lorenzo and the train station, it is also only a block an a half from the Duomo, the Accademia, and San Marco. Via Cavour is a fairly commercial street, but the rooms were very quiet.We were a little concerned that the prices, less than half that of the corporate owned hotels, implied a lower quality experience, but this was not the case. Although this is not a luxury hotel with lots of frills and many staff members, Hotel Columba was a great family run hotel which made our entire family feel very comfortable and supported in our first long trip in Italy. With the dollar so weak right now, everything is extremely expensive in Florence. We were very happy with the choice we made and felt that Hotel Columba offered great value for the money.But the greatest value was all the assistance, advice, and suggestions offered by Roseanna and her family members along with Sabine. Until we felt settled, they were more than willing to make restaurant and taxi reservations, etc. They were always eager to answer the million questions we had. They sent us to good shops to buy chocolates for people at home where the prices were better. It truly was like visiting friends overseas.
