{"text":"A relaxing family experience. My two young children and I were accompanying my husband on a business trip.We opted for this hotel because there was no availability at the San Juan Marriott and I wanted a hotel on the beach.This has a really great beach front with surprisingly good hammocks.We booked a corner suite and the connecting king room.Both had balconies and faced the ocean.The suite was very large and had a decent sized kitchen with a full sized fridge\/freezer.Apart from some cups and glasses from the bathroom,there are no utensils,plates or cutlery of any kind.We had a rental car and ended up buying plastic plates etc.bottled water and some cereal from a local Walgreens.The rooms were clean and the bathrooms adequate.This is not a luxury hotel by any means,but having a large(clean) space for the four of us to spend a week in was paramount.Not to mention the spectacular view from our balconies.The air conditioning worked well,although in the evenings my husband and I would switch ours off and open the sliding doors and sleep with the sound of the ocean.Because of the humidity everything gets very damp.Not too big a deal though.We found the staff to be helpful and polite,especially Tijuana at the front desk.If you have any problems at all with booking your rooms,ask for Tijuana,she's a miracle worker!Unfortunately,the one place where this hotel really needs improvement is in it's restaurants.The food is not acceptable and overpriced.We drove in to Old San Juan almost every evening and had some fabulous(be prepared however,pretty costly)meals.AquaViva is an absolute must for seafood lovers.It is located on one of the side streets off of the Plaza de Colon in Old San Juan.Nearby is the Parrot Club(same owners as AquaViva)another great place.All in all we found the Courtyard Isla Verde to be great value for the money.The staff were very accomodating and the Assistant Manager arranged day passes at the Ritz Carlton(2 hotels up the beach)for us when the Coutyard decided to drain and clean their pool.Have to say the Ritz Carlton Pool really is fabulous if one gets a chance to visit.It was fairly quiet when we were there,I could see that perhaps it wouldn't be quite as good during peak season.Only worth staying here if you can get a room with a view of the ocean,helps to make up for some of the things that aren't quite up to par.Definitely not a business hotel nor a hotel for young people out for a good time in PR.Just so that I won't be the only reviewer that doesn't mention the planes......outside they are pretty loud,but somehow that wasn't really a problem for us.The glass sliding doors in the rooms shut out the noise pretty successfully.Once again,because we weren't in PR during peak season,maybe there were less planes flying in and out.Certainly pretty handy getting to and from the airport.
