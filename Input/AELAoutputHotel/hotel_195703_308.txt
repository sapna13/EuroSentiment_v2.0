{"text":"Favorite Place to Stay! I just went to Italy for a week and stayed in 3 different hotels. I would say that the Casci was definitely my favorite. I stayed at the Casci for 2 nights in a single, and I paid 120 Euros per night (high season). It was totally worth it. I absolutely loved this place.I arrived early and they let me use the internet and then held my luggage for me while I went and walked around the town. The hotel is in a great location: it's only a few doors down from the Palazzo Medici Riccardi, literally around the corner from the Galleria dell'Accademia, and a few blocks away from Museo di San Marco. My room was really cozy, spacious, and clean, and it had a little refrigerator and a safe. The window was huge and let in the sweet night air. The church bells ring at 7am, and they are loud enough to wake you - but I like that sort of thing. Breakfast was great - they had croissants, eggs, toast, coffee and tea, yogurt, cereal, and cheese. You can have as much as you want, as long as you don't try to smuggle anything back to your room.(There is a supermarket around the corner. Walk out of the hotel and go left. Cross the street, and turn right at the Piazza S. Marco, then take the first right. You'll see the supermarket on the corner (almost across from the Accademia).The front desk staff was wonderful - they gave me suggestions for restaurants and clubs, and were really welcoming and friendly. They also gave me the card of a good travel agent in Florence (no fee) who booked my train tickets to Rome for me. The best tip I got was to climb the duomo early on a Saturday morning - while the party-goers are still sleeping off their hangovers :). I got there at 9am and there were only 5 people in front of me. I got up to the top really fast and there was a ton of room to move around and take photos. I only wish I had stayed at the Casci a bit longer. I will definitely return.
