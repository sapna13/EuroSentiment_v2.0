{"text":"Satisfied customer I was in Boston for 5 days to attend a conference at the Omni Parker but I didn't make a reservation in time to get a conference discount. So I ended up at John Hancock Hotel and I'm glad I stayed there.1) The hotel is only a block from Back Bay T station (orange line). 2) It's safe. I walked alone from the T station around 11:30 but nothing happened.3) The price. You can't beat the price. Mine was a standard Queen size room. I paid less than $100. Seriously. 4) In case you need a rent a car to go to suburbs of Boston. Avis (? I may be wrong about the name) is only one block away and the road leading to I-90 is just down the street. (Mind you. It's really hard to find I-90 exists in Boston. This is a HUGE plus for the hotel.)5) Breakfast included. For this price, I wouldn't complain about the choices. But there are cereals,muffins, bagels,fruits, croissants, coffee, juice etc. 6) The room is rather a tiny side but it's clean. Likewise, the bathroom is small, too. But it's OK.7) Reasonably nice front desk staffs,8) Free Internet connection, and computers in a business room right in front of the front desk.Downside:1) There's no room service or in-room dining unless you order from some restaurants (menus available.)2) Different from other hotels, cabs aren't waiting for you when you check out. You have to ask the front desk to arrange it.I'd recommend this hotel to budget travelers. Basically, I was there just to sleep and was out almost all day. The price was right!
