{"text":"Glad we chose this hotel............... We flew to Canada from Scotland, stayed a week, then my husband and I travelled down from Canada by car to stay for a few days before flying down to a wedding in Las Vegas.We stayed here because my husband had a whole load of Marriott points as he travelled a great deal with his work in 2007 and had stayed in various Marriotts throughout the US. We were thrilled to have chosen such a super place to stay. The apartment was lovely, clean and the view of lake Union was grand. The staff were very helpful and we would stay here again in a heartbeat. We sampled two nearby restaurants and they are within a short walk of the hotel. You can't go wrong with Outback and other one was twice the price but not twice as good!The breakfast was nice, no porridge oats but hey, when in Rome!I'm sorry ,grits are no substitute but when any of you reading this visit Scotland and are pining for grits, please try our porridge because you will love it! There was a good selection of food and drinks, we are just not big on breakfast so we did not sample that much.I always wanted to visit Seattle because A) I love Frasier . B) The cleverest people in the US live in Seattle and C) I wanted to see the home of Starbucks. Shopping was really good, you have lovely department stores, Pike Street was super and it was a sunny day which made it more enjoyable. We went to a home exhibition which was on at the same time as a big game for the Seahawks and the parking guy gave us a great deal when we told him we were leaving before the game started! We are returning to Seattle next year to see more. Can't wait.
