{"text":"Beautiful Pan Pacific Singapore We delightfully stayed at the beautiful Pan Pacific hotel (Panoramic room) 4 nights for our Christmas Holiday.From the moment we entered the hotel on Xmas day, we were kindly welcomed and immediately directed to check-in desk. Check-in officer recorded passport details. Registration was completed in a kind  efficient manner (took few minutes not long at all). Our bags were brought up promptly by helpful staff to our room on time.Bubble lifts (matrix space-age looking): Clean glass with user-friendly lit buttons. The speed of lifts were appropriate to observe the atrium and amazing views of the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ interior. In the lifts on our 3rd day, a staff member kindly greeted us and pronounced our surnames correctly. Very polite and accurate! Panoramic Room: Looked brilliant and felt luxurious to stay in. Clean, neat  spacious. Fitted bedding for 3. Plenty of room for 3 large suitcases and shopping bags (which grew larger with each mall visited). Room nicely furnished. Electronic blinds, shades and LCD TV were easy to use. Air-conditioner worked well to our temperature liking. Received free bottles of water each morning plus newspapers. Slippers and robes were also supplied. Mini bar was stocked with goodies (extra charges for eg bottled water from mini bar $4 SGD) and there was also room to store our chocolates in the mini bar. Room was on level 18 and we did not experience any distractions\/loud noise. This room had a balcony with beautiful views of Singapore City (Esplanade, Merlion and Marina Bay). Bathroom: Immaculate, neat and polished. Fluffy towels, well-positioned mirrors and nicely accessorised with cute little bottles of shampoos, conditioners, bath gels and bath salts. Hair dryer was handy.Beds: Clean, comfortable and spotless white sheets and pillows. We all slept peacefully well.Swimming Pool: We were busy shopping and left little time to swim at the pool. Nonetheless, on our last night there, we did relax on the seats next to pool and observed the beautiful mini garden scene. Hotel: Magnificent! Check-in and check-out was completed by courteous and polite staff. Check out was prompt and there were no delays to our next destination. Before leaving the hotel room, I had postcards to send back home and staff also helped mail this out within a telephone call. Excellent customer service! Concierge staff were excellent too for taking our luggage out the entrance while we shortly waited there for our driver to pick us up. The door man kindly took a photo for us. Hotel staff are approachable and willing to help. All staff greeted and smiled at us gracefully throughout our stay.Location: Easy access (by taxi or walk) to Marina Square Mall, Suntec City and Esplanade Theatre. Taxi to Orchard Road (5 minutes around $7). Taxi to Sentosa Island around 12-15 minutes (depending on traffic flow).Buffet breakfast @ The Global Kitchen:Delicious and nicely presented food from both Western and Eastern cultures. Courteous staff. Food ranged from prawn dumplings, grilled fish, smoked salmon, stir-fried noodles, scrambled eggs, toast, has browns, mini muffins, dragon fruit, melons, yoghurt, jelly and much more ($35 SGD).Thank you note: ( we have not included our feedback comments on the hotel's online form, instead we will write it here).It was our great pleasure to stay at Pan Pacific Singapore.
