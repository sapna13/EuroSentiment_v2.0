{"text":"good for spending time in hawaii cheap, but not good as a vacation spot It was on the border of OK and not OK . While the price was great. the people were really nice. The place felt pretty safe. The room didn't have mold in it .  The paint job looked so old. According to other sites they said they had done improvements on it I didnt see much unless they were talking about the bathroom( which was the only good part of the whole room). The bed definitely looked slept in . It just had a very old damp look about it, from the paint job to the sheets. Not really vacation spot. It more like a cheap safe motel stay and see hawaii. The bed was the worst part. If I had to give it a rating from 1-5 I would give it a raring of 1. The bed took up atleast 1\/2 room ( not including the bathroom area) . I could go on on about how the bed ruined this ok room. But it is a short distance from many great beaches. It's a walk to the resort next door with all it's cool stuff. The bathrooms I heard before weren't all that great. I thought the bathrooms were the best part. clean with what seemed to be new granite counter tops I gve it a 5 out of 5. Dont expect eggs in your free breakfast b\/c there are no eggs. It's a cheap, ok place, near some cool expensive places u can go see and enjoy.And it over looks the nicer resort which is so expensive but super cool. You cant really see the beach and this is from the 11th floor thats the toppest floor,right below pent house.  But all the places in the sorrunding areas seem really expensive to eat in . but not really most of the places seem to give you large portions of food. So if you order for 10 bucks most places will give you food for 2 so it's like ordering at 5 dollars a plate. And even the pizza was great. especially in th resort next door. The toppings were fresh and and loaded on, was really good pizza.
