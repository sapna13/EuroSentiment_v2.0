{"text":"Saved by the Knutsford Steps! Stayed in the Stanford Hillview hotel with my sister on the first leg of a three destination holiday during August. The weather in Hong Kong was very hot and humid but the air conditioning in our room was a god send. The hotel was very clean and our room was quite spacious. We had a five night stay and our bed linen and towels were changed every day. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Even though breakfast was not included in our booking we used the buffet style breakfast a few mornings. The buffet selection was mind blowing with all kinds of conceivable goodies to whet your appetite and certainly keep you going for a good part of the day. Having made our hotel reservation based on the reviews by other tripadvisor users, the most helpful tip was how to avoid that steep hill. If you go into the Miramar shopping centre on Nathan road (and avail of the air conditioning!!), take the escalator for Knnutsford Steps passing by a pleasant cafe called Foccacino and turn left at Starbucks,through the double doors and up a short flight of steps and all the restaurants beside the hotel are on your left. Being able to take the lift to our room from the basement was also a help in getting some cool air.I thought the Stanford Hillview hotel was very pleasant and we certainly enjoyed our stay there. I would recommend it to anyone intending to stay in Hong Kong for pleasure purposes. ","annotations":[]}
