{"text":"Terrible hotel. This february we stayed at the NH Doelen hotel in Amsterdam. On the NH website the hotel is described as a wonderful four star hotel. Because of this and some good reviews we read on tripadvisor we decided to stay at this hotel. When we arrived at the hotel we were immedaitely dissapointed. The lobby is extremely small and there is just one (very small) elevator. When you arrive with a couple of suitcases you might have a problem taking them all up to your room at once. The staff was overall friendly, but not very proffesional. They couldn't even be bothered to greet you in the morning. The room was plain awful. It was an extremely small room (don't go there if you suffer from claustrofobia). There was a spiderweb (with a spider) in the corner of our room. The wallpaper was peeling of off the walls, the bathroom (with mildew at no extra charge) dated from back in the eighties. The minibar was covered with a layer of dust. I probably missed the wonderful breakfast other people wrote about on tripadvisor, because the breakfast I went to didn't impress me at all. The breakfast starts at 7 AM. We arrived at 715 AM. By that time the eggs and pancakes were already cold (how is this possible). Two bowls of yoghurt, a couple of dutch boterhammen and cold eggs next to a bottle of cheap champagne just don't do it for me. Just as everything else in this hotel the roomservice was very poor as well. I ordered an overpriced lasagna (16 euro's or $21) which was served lukewarm (pretty disgusting). Yet another big disappointment. The only positive note is that there are ear plugs available in the room which you will need because the rooms are very noisy. You can hear the TV and conversations of your neighbours and the constant slamming of doors in the hotel.If this is considered a four star hotel in The Netherlands then I do not want to know what a 3 or 2 star hotels in The Netherlands might look like. This is an absolute disgrace. My advice: if you visit Amsterdam avoid this hotel.
