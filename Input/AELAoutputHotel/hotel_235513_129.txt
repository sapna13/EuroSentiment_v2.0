{"text":"Good location for public transportation, lovely hotel We just returned from a three-night stay at the Sofitel. The hotel is really lovely and the staff is terrific. The location is excellent if you're using public transportation (the Metro is a block away) - this is the first time we took public transportation to a city from the airport and it was very easy.It's a very quiet area on the weekends and at night, so if you're looking for somewhere with some nightlife, this may not be your first choice. We did have dinner reservations at Georgia Brown's and Old Ebbitt Grill; both were an easy walk from the hotel, but those were pretty much our only options except for the steak place across the street, but my husband's a vegetarian so we don't usually go to those.There is no wireless Internet in the rooms, but rather than spring for the T-mobile service we just used the computers off the lobby. There's even a printer so you can print your boarding passes for the return flight home.There is no coffee maker in the room, but there is coffee in the bar until 10:00. We packed our Starbucks mugs so we could easily grab it in the morning.We are Sofitel members but were not offered any upgrade or free drinks upon checking in. We were, however, able to get into our room at 10:00 am when we got in, and were given a late check out of 4:00 pm, which was really wonderful. The room was pretty much your standard hotel room size with a king bed and a chair, a mini-bar that charges your account as soon as you move an item (so we opened it, looked in it, shut it and never opened it again), etc. Our room was on the 12th floor so we had nice light, even though the view was of the office building next door (we don't care about views for three-night stays). The most surprising thing about the room was that there was a really nice quantity of electrical outlets. We usually travel with a surge protector so that we can charge the laptop, iPods, cell phones, cameras, etc., but we had no need for it at the Sofitel.We only had two occasions to call the desk. Once was when we got into our room and realized that there was no robe (which I do use so I don't have to pack one). We called and they sent two up immediately. The other time was when we noticed that there was no little shelf in the shower for toiletries. It had obviously been broken off. We called and they sent someone up to take a look but it wasn't repaired during our stay (and we were never called again to let us know what was going on). It was actually a nuisance not having anywhere to put the shampoo, etc. while showering and my husband has a bad back so I didn't want him bending down repeatedly to get the shampoo, soap, etc. I took care of it by taking one of the laundry bags they provide, tying a knot in it and hanging it from the shower door knob, but one shouldn't have to do that in a 4-star hotel.The only other complaint that I would have is that the bed had to be the hardest mattress I've ever encountered. The linens were excellent, the pillows were fine, but that mattress was awful.All-in-all we enjoyed our stay for what we paid (which was significantly less than the rate that's quoted on their website - we booked through Expedia). If you aren't someone who wants to walk to clubs and bars at night you will probably enjoy staying there.
