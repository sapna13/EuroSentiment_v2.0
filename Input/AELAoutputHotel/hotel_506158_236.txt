{"text":"I'll be back!!! We went to Barca a couple of years back and had our stay spoilt by an overrated shabby hotel. Needless to say, our experience prompted us to be a bit more thorough in our hotel research since then and it was time to return to what has now become our favourite short break destination.Our research led us to this gem of a hotel situated as near as can be to the centre of Barcelona and unlike our previous hotel encounter in this magnificent city, this hotel did live up to the hype.From the friendly helpful concierge who greeted us at the door we knew we were in for a good stay. The staff were always falling over backwards to help, and when I wasn't too sure of my skills with the Spanish language, most of the staff spoke good English and were always polite and welcoming.The room was very well appointent with a large double bed, lcd tv on the wall, good sized bathroom with power shower and small balcony. Although as expected in the middle of the city, the views were of other buildings, this was a welcome touch. The rooms were very clean and toiletries and mini bar were well stocked.Unfortunately it was a bit cold in December to test out the rooftop pool so I am unable to comment on that but would expect that if it is in keeping with the rest of the hotel, then it would be just as good.It is in a great location for shopping, site seeing and eating out.I no longer need to look for a suitable hotel for when I return to Barcelona as I will be staying at Hotel 1898 every time.
