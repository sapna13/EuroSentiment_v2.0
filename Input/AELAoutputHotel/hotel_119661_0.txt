{"text":"Not for the peace seeking We got stuck overnight, unexpectedly, in San Francisco. We were pleased to find any room at all, and the fact that it was inexpensive was a pleasant surprise. However... At about 3 am we were awakened by a fist fight outside our room, somewhere below. Someone was screaming. Eventually it quieted down, I assume management broke it up. The next morning, around 8 am, the desk called as we were showering and packing to leave. They wanted to know if we would be leaving today or staying another night. We said leaving, and they reminded us that check out time was noon. Okay, no problem. I've never been called like that before, but that was fine. 15 minutes later, they called again. They wanted to know if we could possibly check out early, because someone else was there and they were going to be in our room, and they wanted to check in early. Check in time is 2 pm. We informed them that we would be checking out early, but we were still packing up and dressing our 2 kids, so no, I did not know exactly when we'd be finished. Not 20 minutes later we got an Are you nearly done? call. Now, I try to be a patient, polite, and accommodating person. But never before, and not since, have I been pestered by the front desk to hurry up and get out of a room I paid for. Especially 3 hours before check out time. So they get a 2 for rudeness, pushiness, and annoyance. ","annotations":[]}
