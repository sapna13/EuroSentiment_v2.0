{"text":"Could be better We booked through Thomas Cook, This was to be a special holiday for 9 of us as it was my 50th Birthday. Sadly we were disappointed. The hotel is average but nearly everyone we spoke to had some probelm with their room, whether it be the air con not working, leaking toilet, TV not working etc. Each had something wrong.The hotel either has insufficient staff or bad management as every evening when we sat at a table by a bar we had to clear it up ourselves first. I have never stayed in a hotel where they dont clear tables. Guest were also using the plastic glasses to put their cigarette end out, which then meant you could be drinking from that same plastic glass at any time.They have a piano bar which only opened once the whole 2 weeks were were there dispute this being the only bar inside and we were there when the hurricane was passing by so we had several evenings of VERY heavy rain and wind with no where to go but your room.There is a large stage outside where there was supposed to be evening entertainment. This was very poor and was repeated weekly so you saw everything badly twice. There is nowhere to go outside the hotel, just one small shop about 5 mins away if you dared to walk there which sell snacks\/drinks etc.Over all we were all very disappointed with Thomas Cook for giving the rating they gave this hotel. The Rep took no interest what so ever in our comments. So our advice would be to stay away. ","annotations":[]}
