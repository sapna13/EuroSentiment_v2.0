{"text":"Beautiful beach Jan. 9, 2007My family and I wanted to treat ourselves to a Christmas trip so we researched Punta Cana as much as possible. It was a choice between the Princess Bavaro and another - Grande Bahia Principe. We had heard great things about both. In the end, we picked the Princess. We went from Dec. 16 -23.We have been to many other resorts and always go for the 5 star variety. We were leary of the comments on the food. We read so many reviews, but everyone has their own level of expectation and they varied too much.We knew that we would be very picky as Canadians, we have come to expect a certain standard. Although the resort offered several restaurants and buffets, we were disappointed with the food overall. There was a tremendous selection at the main buffet and eventually we found items we could live with, many dishes were unrecognizable and tasted weird. the bread selection was great and tasted good, so did the French fries, burgers are not the greatest but okay.The resort itself was lovely, our rooms were clean and the marble bathrooms were impressive. On closer inspection, our bath drain worked poorly and we had a small leak in the corner that the maid would address each day by leaving a towel rolled up in the corner.I would greatly advise buying the upgrade to the Platinum pkg. This allowed us our own check in\/out service, computer access and premium brand drinks wherever we went. We had our own lounge area that we could access drinks and some pastries, buns, cold breakfast, coffee and tea. It was great. There was also a large screen TV that showed American movies so you could sit in there if you wanted to. We were also able to check out of our rooms and then come back and use a shower before our late night flight home.The beach is gorgeous, no worries of stepping on something in the water -it is absolutely clear with no debris (except for a bit of seaweed that would roll in at times with the waves)Boogie boarding is great, the waves were not too high, but enough to give you a good ride. the pool was okay. Grounds were spotless and well looked after. We left a dollar or two every morning for the maid along with some small treats such as crayons\/books, Christmas books, candies etc.As careful as we were not to drink the tap water or over-induldge, we all ended up with Turista, meaning we were scrambling to the bathrooms a few times a day. It was annoying but not enough to ruin the vacation. Make sure to bring as much Immodium etc. as you can.Entertainment: each evening was not great, sometimes downright hokey. The best night was the disco beach party. There was a disco at the entrance by the casino but we never made it as we were too tired by eleven o'clock and most of the discos didn't open until midnight. Our 22 year old complained that the entertainment wasn't great, but he ended up going to bed before midnight because the days were so hot and long.Although we have been critical of the food, we realize that our standards are very high, so do not go expecting to get the same quality you are used to at home. On the other hand, for us, food makes the holiday, so although we gave it an above average rating because the place really was nice, I doubt we'd go back.
