{"text":"ok nothing great I have to say that the bavaro to me was just average...it wasnt' terrible but it certainly wasnt fabulous. To me it had more cons then pro's.The first thing that everyone considering going here should know is that it is not very child friendly. If you have a small child this is not a good place. From the unsafe walkways, slippery bathroom floors and useless steps in the rooms a parent with a toddler will not have a minute to relax.All the walkways and pool area are increte which is a painted cement with a design etched in it . when it is wet, which is almost all the time because of the frequent rain storms throughout the day and night , it is very dangerous. One afternoon after a rain storm i watched 2 ADULTS slip and fall. Both were injured. And there are signs everywhere about the slippery surfaces...SO IF THERE KNOW THEY ARE DANGEROUS...GET RID OF THEM. It goes without saying how many children i saw by the pool go down, including my own from just walking and hitting a wet spot.The room was also a hazard. though it was very pretty, the floors were all marble. Mix that with a shower door that is not water tight and once again you have a very dangerous situation for a child. My one year old slammed his head on the floor our first day there when he walked into the bathroom. My 5 year old niece did the same thing a few days later. then there the steps. A 4 foot wide 2 step down which is impossibe to block off.The food was also alitlle lacking. not thay i had anything bad there just wasnt anything that i felt i needed to have again. The buffet was small and didnt offer much of a variety. The menu wasnt child friendly either. If you have picky eaters make sure you bring some stuff from home for them to eat. there were not very many healthy choices either. the veggie choices were lacking but there was alot of unknown fried objects.There wasn't even whole wheat bread at breakfast. and if you ordered room service thy would not bring you a beverage. one night me and my husband wanted a cup of coffee so we called room service..they told us they dont deliver beverages. With 2 small children sleeping it wasn't like we could walk(and i do mean walk) to the buffet to get some.the place is alot of buildings. Its large but it doesnt really have much to offer. The size is mainly due to all of the bungalows.the bavaro has the 5 or 6 resturants, the pool, a few shops and a theater. Which by the way does not have profesional entertainers. it was all audience particpants if that sort of thing matters toyou.The shows are hosted by the same group that does the 20 minutes of pool games in the afternoon. After that there really isnt much more entertainment than that.If you want internet access , the casino, the disco, the doctor, the kids club and mostly everything else you might need on your vacation you need to walk to the next hotel ( think that one was the domincana)the pool was warm enough to actually swim in which was nice. But once again vey slippery for young chidren. There is a large fountain in the middle that when it is windy you get hit with the spray from the fountain. (very annoying).The high point of the bavaro is the beach. Powdery soft sand and a beautiful ocean. Warm and a little wavey. It was mine and my childrens favorite part of the trip. Very nice.To sum this up because of know i am rambling..... the bavaro is lacking considering its 5 star rating. I am not a travel snob i am just honest. I have been to other resorts in the dr and found them to be more enjoyable. Ok for 1 time ..wouldnt go backWould go back to sunscape in Laromona..smaller and alot nicer of a vacation ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1809,"mention":"veggie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Veggie_burger"],"startOffset":1803},{"endOffset":1809,"mention":"veggie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Veggie_burger"],"startOffset":1803},{"endOffset":1809,"mention":"veggie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Veggie_burger"],"startOffset":1803},{"endOffset":1910,"mention":"whole wheat bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Whole_wheat_bread"],"startOffset":1893},{"endOffset":2043,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2037},{"endOffset":2786,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2782},{"endOffset":2786,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2782}]}
