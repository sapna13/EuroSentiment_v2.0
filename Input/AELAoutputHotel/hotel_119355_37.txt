{"text":"AP shuttle every 30 mins and inexpensive food in the bar! Airport shuttle  cheap parking $6 bucks a day!! Not only was this a great hotel the airport shuttle runs 24 hours a day 7 days a week every 30 minutes. PLUS you can leave your car at this hotel for a mere $6 a day and its COVERED PARKING. We had early flights to leave out for NJ. We drove into this lovely hotel the night before from CA (4 hour ride) and found superb service after a long ride needing to get up early. The greeter at the front counter was a nice touch. She introduced herself and the hotel asked if we had reservations and had nice little hot and cold appetizers. Not your usual junk. The bar crew was super fun. We relaxed with a drink and had an INEXPENSIVE meal at the bar. Anytime you can get a hotel meal for $7.99 you are doing fantastic! This is a seperate menu from the formal dining room and it was great. More than we could eat and at a fantastic price. The room is classic Crown Plaza Resort fine touches. The CD I love and you get to keep for free (and I lost last year) of relaxation sounds and tension relief exercises you do in bed (I always fall asleep before the end). lavender spray for your sheets, super deluxe mattress and pillows, eye pads (all this stuff in a cute little bag sitting on your bed) OH and the hotel had its own little gift bag on the desk! STUFFED with flavored pop corn, candies ect .....from local merchants, very cute! FORGET about the construction around the hotel it is not a big deal. All the amenities out way the difference. This is a fine pick for a airport hotel.
