{"text":"Fantastic!!!!!! We have just returned from a 3 night stay at Hotel 1898 and have to say that the hotel lived up to all of our expectations after reading the reviews.It was most definitely more 5 star than 4 star with the rooftop pool and day beds being a very luxurious feature and the views from there- WOW! and at 165euros a night was a bargain!The room was spacious ( we stayed in room 308) and although a little dark ( it being a coutyard view room) it was very quiet and pleasant- peace and tranquility away from the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas.The bathroom was fabulous with a great shower ( the biggest shower head I have ever seen) and plenty of towels, bathrobes, slippers and complementary toiletries.The bed was huge and comfortable and the different lighting very relaxing after a hard days sightseeing,eating and drinking.The only criticism I have is that we requested an iron but were advised that they only offer a laundry service.The indoor pool, gym and steam room\/sauna were more than adequate.We chose not to eat in the hotel instead opting for the many resaurants\/ Tapas bars and market nearby.Breakfast - the market for its choice of fresh fruit and a very handy starbucks next door.Dinner- Dont eat til late -10pm earliest. We tried many restauarants but one of our favourites was 'set portes- passeig d'isabel ll 14'. Its been there since 1836 and has queues out the door so you have to book. The paella was delicious.Will definitely stay again at the 1898 - a real treat!
