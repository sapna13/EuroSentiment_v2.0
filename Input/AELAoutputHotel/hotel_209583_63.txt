{"text":"Bacelo Palace Need Tweaking Returned Friday Nov 30. Property has alot going for it but misses the mark on a few issues. This was trip number 10 for us and the the 8th hotel. First, do not go to Puna Cana for the food. You will not starve, but it's not the USA. And forget the beef, it's tough no matter how they serve it. However, stick with local dishes and fish and you will be fine. Go to Punta Cana if you love the beach and want to relax. If you are tour people, be prepared for a pricey time away from the resort you paid dearly for. Be patient with the staff, not rude. This resort is a Spanish brand and the majority of visitors recognise this and therefore the resort has a minority of US citizens. The staff work 11 days in a row, with 4 days off. They work long hours, and yes we would have liked to see more eye contact or smiles. They were there, just not in abundance. In other words, compared to the other hotels we have stayed, this property just lacked staff personality. That combined with a horrible check in left a bad first impression. It did start to grow on us once we located the beach bar and Las Brisas for the lobster. Won a little at the slots, weather was perfect, met some new friends. Can't ask for much more. Having only CNN as free tv left us a bit annoyed but, again, so tired after day in the sun, tv was not important. Remembering this hotel begain it's life in the late 80's will give you clue to it's condition. Would I go back? Yes, the value is there. But don't kid yourself, stay at the PALACE not the other properties if you want more food selection. There was a difference!Hope this helps.
