{"text":"Loved it!! Every October we travel from Birmingham to London to celebrate both of our birthdays and whilst looking for hotels that 'ticked' all the boxes (safe in room, close to tourist sites  party we were attending) we came across the LBH. Our only concern was parking as we always drive down but we found an NCP just 5mins walk away. From the outside it looks quite plain but once inside we were greeted by extremely helpful concierge  reception staff and very tasteful decor. We had our room upgraded and stayed on the 1st floor overlooking the front of the hotel (no noise from traffic etc). The room was spacious and very comfortable everything worked! The large flat screen tv in front of the lovely queen size bed was great. The large desk was great for 'putting my face on' and the slippers and dressing gown were very welcome and saved me taking my own! Breakfast is taken in a small but bright and beautifully arranged downstairs breakfast room. Their was a large choice of food (plenty for me being a veggie!) and drinks which were lovely and there were plenty of waiting staff to look after your every need. LB train  tube station are very close by and so are plenty of nice bars and restaurants. We ordered room service on our 2nd night and the omelette  chips were on time and Fantastic, especially after a hard days sight seeing! I completed the hotel questionnaire upon returning home and received a personal reply just 2 wks later (postal strikes and all). We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to London - which will hopefully be before Oct 08!
