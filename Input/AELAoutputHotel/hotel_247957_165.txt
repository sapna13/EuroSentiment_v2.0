{"text":"loved the Occidental Grand, Awesome!!!!!!!!!!! We stayed from March 9th- 16th. It was really supposed to be Sunday morning at 6:30 that our plane was to leave; but we were on that flight that was delayed until 11:30 p.m. that night. So, we lost one day of sunshine., because our plane wasn't available to leave halifax. That was our only problem. We loved everything about our vacation. My husband and I and our three children made the trip. We had perfect rooms . We were with premium club and I think all the rooms are excellent with premium club. we were in building 24, rooms 306 and 307. it was so nice waking up to sunshine and palm trees. it was like a dream, the whole week. our maid was so kind. one day, i accidentally left money from my wallet on the bed. When I realized this, i was worried that the maid might think that was her tip; but she was honest and left it there. My daughter left her purse under a palapa near the pool one day. We didn't realize it until the next morning. she had left her ipod, and nintendo DS in it, and a small amount of cash. We couldn;'t believe that everything was there went we went back in the morning. The staff and everyone were so kind and honest and were there to make our stay enjoyable. we alternated between the beach and the pool. we never had trouble getting chairs at either. The food was great. It doesn't taste like the food back home; but we knew that before leaving and adjusted our taste buds a bit for the week. I was worried about our nine year old as he is a picky eater; but he loves pancakes and they did a great job of those at the buffets. He was able to find fruit and other foods he liked each day too, and we could always go to the homerun bar for fries, if not.Our whole family did the parasailing and were able to get a good rate from julio on the beach. our girls are volleyball players and they were able to get a game in almost every day. the rest of the time we relaxed , swam , and relaxed some more.we ordered the brick oven pizza a couple of nights and it was soooooo good. we watched some of the entertainment at night and that was very well done too. It was funny when they'd get people from the audience into the shows. Nova Scotia and Newfoundland seemed to get the most cheers. haha loved every minute of it. can't wait to go back next year.
