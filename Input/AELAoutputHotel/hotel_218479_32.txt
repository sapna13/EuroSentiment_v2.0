{"text":"Awesome vacation! We just got home from a week at Barcelo Bavaro Caribe in Punta Cana. Before booking our trip we checked out this site several times to find a good resort. The reviews on this one were mixed, but the pics looked great and the price was tempting so we went with it. I was not for one second disappointed. The motto I think they use at this resort is if it aint broke dont fix it For example there is one fountain that had two flood lights pointed at it. One of the flood lights are missing, does the fountain still get illuminated at night? Yes. Does it work yes, so there is no rush in fixing it. There might be the odd cracked tile in the floor here or there. Is it bad enough to trip over? No. Things like this are present in some places on the resort. But it is ok with me. Everything is functional but not perfect. This might be why this resort at the moment has a lower rating. The room (#6225)Located on the second floor a very short walk to the beach and pool. The view was nice, palm trees with just a bit of ocean peaking through. Kind of damp feeling, the air conditioning worked but not good enough to get rid of the dampness. There were mosquitoes due to the patio doors that wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ quite close with out cracks big enough for them to enter but nothing we couldn't handle. At one point my patio door was jammed but they were very quick to fix it. It was fixed about 10 minutes after the complaint call.The FoodNot a single complaint. We ate everything and anything we could get our hands on and it was all good. No one had any serious tummy troubles or anxious trips to the washroom. We mostly ate at the many buffets but did try the Steak House (amazing) and the Italian Restaurant (also amazing).The StaffEveryone was amazing! They tried to speak English for us and if they couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ understand they took the time to find someone who could. They were friendly all the time and always smiling, singing and dancing. I have never seen such a group of happy workers. If you are nice to them they are nice to you.The ResortYes this is a big resort but there was a train that went by every 10 mins so getting around isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a problem. Everything is in walking distance so the train is not a necessity. I loved the fact that we could go from one hotel to another for a change of scenery and feel. Every hotel was clean and all the staff were friendly. The food was great at all of the restaurants.The PoolsI have never seen such clean pools. The water was a good temperature and no heavy chlorine smell. One thing I should mention is that the only swim up bar is at the Palace. We were really looking forward to the swim up bar only to find out we could not use it, very disappointing. No night swimming which was a bummer but oh well, there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ an ocean a few feet away.The BeachVery nice view and palm trees and almost white sand. Really nice.Most people don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ clean up after themselves but there were always men cleaning the beach. It is hard to keep up sometimes. But on the most part clean..The CasinoNolitours was where we booked our vacation and they said it came with $40 worth of casino chips. In actuality you get 4 vouchers for a $10 bet. To use the voucher you need to place 1 $10 bet along with the voucher and if you win you get whatever the odds were on the chip bet and only get the $10 from the voucher. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ a little peeved about this but its not the casino at fault. Other than that the casino wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bad.The Day\/Night EntertainmentActivities\/shows at every hotel night and day which are fun. The MC at our resort BirdMan as we liked to call him was very funny WOOOW and AAAWH AAAAWH is his trademark, nice guy. If you want to be pampered like a King\/Queen then this isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ the place to go. If you want good value, food, drinks, people then I recommend it. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know what else to say. We loved our vacation and would go back in a heartbeat. I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ wait to take my kids next time.
