{"text":"Generally an Excellent Hotel I enjoyed my stay at the Harbour Plaza Hong Kong - over the new year period. Certainly a popular hotel - we were there 6 days and each day there was a wedding! It was great to see the grand staircase get decorated each day. We had a lovely corner room with great views over the harbour (or look below and see the locals doing tai chi each day). Lovely outdoor pool area at the top of the hotel with great views.Staff were great, very friendly and attentive. The hotel was spotless. Food - one meal through room service was great, the other was awful. The breakfast buffet had a fantastic range and the food was great, though the usual hotel prices. The hotel wasn't quite in the centre so we did use the free shuttle frequently. Several times it was full but taxis were very cheap, so not an issue. It is worth checking out the timetable for the nearby ferry as it is only a few mins away and quick and easy to get to Hong Kong Island. We found the shuttle from the airport to the hotel was a bit lengthly - waiting for the next one to depart. Also, we were the last hotel for drop offs, so from arriving at airport, took almost 2 hours to reach hotel. Leaving was fine, very efficient. Definitely agree with other reviews about getting an octopus card at the airport, then you can use all the transport including star ferry. Overall, would recommend the hotel, we enjoyed our stay and I would return. ","annotations":[]}
