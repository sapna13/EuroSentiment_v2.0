{"text":"Hard beds and very little English at the Red Wall Okay, so we booked this hotel through a travel agency and checked it out online. The pictures looked okay, so we said that it was fine. When we got to Beijing, no one knew where the hotel was so we walked around for an hour before finding someone who took us there. We saw the hotel and immediately it looked different than the pictures on the internet. We thought, okay, so what? Then we got to our room and saw how tiny it was. The bathroom is barely big enough for one person and the beds are the hardest thing I have ever slept on in my entire life. It literally felt like sleeping on concrete or plywood. The breakfast buffet in the mornings is not bad at all but the drink seletion is terrible. Also one thing that is pretty bothersome is the fact that so little people that work at this hotel speak good english. In fact we only found one. The other people who speak english cannot really understand any questions you ask. The tours that you book at the hotel are pretty good. They take you to a lot of places but everything is pretty business oriented. They pretty much want you to buy stuff on the tours and if you don't the travel guides tend to get annoyed. I think they make a commission. One really good thing about the hotel that I can say is this, it is in a great location. It's a ten minute walk to the forbidden city and it is located next to this great little miimart where everything is dirt cheap and the people who work there are very sweet. You can buy anything from a 6 pack of decorated chopsticks to a bottle of water. ","annotations":[]}
