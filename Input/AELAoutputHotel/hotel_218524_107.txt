{"text":"Great resort We decided to ignore the few negative reviews and spent Oct 18-26 at the Excellence. Here are my random comments and suggestions that may not have been mentioned by others:Don't worry about the ride from the airport.Mosquitoes are not a problem. Bring one can of spray for when you plan to explore the gardens or enjoy the Dominican Day dinner on the beach.The food is excellent. We skipped the Lobster House and Oregano. The others were great. Never had to wait. Never had a need for Room Service. There's also a daily cookout on the beach, and sandwiches and fruit at some of the bars.Can't say enough about the booze.Don't miss the Michael Jackson show. Get there 1 hr early. Sit near the middle because the stage lighting fixtures obscure some of 'Michael's' awesome footwork. Also see the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âouples√à√\u2020\u2022?show with guest participation - ours was hilarious.After every show, the cast is available for photos.We didn't go for the Excellence Club package. I suggest you don't book it in advance. When you check in, have them explain exactly what you would get if you upgrade, and for how much. If interested, you may be able to bargain.Sign up for the free horseback ride early; if it gets canceled by rain you can still make another one later in the week.We left $2 daily for the maid, even though service was erratic (I think this is due to the layout of the buildings; they can't keep checking rooms to find ones that are empty). Since we asked for diet soda (Coke Light) in the room fridge, we twice left a $2 tip next to it for the refiller person. There's a 3-piece roving band at two of the restaurants; gave them $3 total each time; I suspect they get little or nothing from the hotel. Occasional $1 to those who brought us drinks during the show at the theater. The only other tip we gave was $25 on our final day to Alta, the waitress who brought us endless drinks on the beach. There was never any pressure to tipBring a refrigerator magnet. It may trick the sensor on the balcony door so that you don't have to keep closing it to keep the AC on.Wireless Internet access worked okay in the room and on the beach, but was slow. Internet access ($5 for 20 min.) is available a short walk from the rooms.The grounds are beautiful. Ponds, fountains, statues, birds of all types including parrots, one of which plucked a button from my shirt (they also like eyeglasses). Once we even saw a peacock in the lobby.Lots of exercise equipment at the rec center. There's 4 TV's. If there's no attendant available, you can change channels with the control hidden on the right side.It you'd like to use a laptop or other AC-powered appliance on the balcony, bring an extension cord of 12 feet or longer. Also, all of the outlets are taken up by lamps, TV, etc. Bring one of those 1-to-3 adapter thingamajigs. American plugs work fine. Snorkeling at the hotel beach and the neighboring beach is poor due to the waves and swirling sand. Don't bother to bring your own gear unless you plan to take an off-premise excursion.We had two short power outages at night, and one loss of water pressure. No big thing. Use a battery-powered alarm clock or watch if you need to get up early. As always when traveling, clear out the room safe on the night before departure so that you won't have a major problem if there's no electricity in the morning.There's a small duty-free shop at the airport. If you have to change planes, remember that bottles of liquid cannot be taken through security.Don't climb on the lifeguard stand to get a good photo. I broke a step and almost killed myself. Totally my fault.It can be difficult to get a float at the pools. Selfish people tend to grab one early and stash it with their stuff all day. I wish the hotel would adopt a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëo not remove from water√à√\u2020\u2022?policy.Some also hoard those beds on the beach, but since it's hard to read while lying on one, we didn't use them even when available.Final suggestion: go, eat, drink, relax, enjoy.
