{"text":"Great staff, great hotel First off, this review is written bearing in mind the fact I paid √ä√£¬¢308 (should have been about √ä√£¬¢340 on hotelopia.co.uk but I found a discount code) for 5 nights in a double room with my girlfriend at the Atenea. I think people should state how much they pay on here, not to brag, but because what you pay dictates what you expect and therefore how you review. The room was clean and a decent size, but don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect an apartment, ours was more like a bed-sit, but this is not a criticism. Small kitchen, adequate bathroom, sofa, very large double bed, TV, everything you need. The other reviewers who criticize the lack of cutlery, crockery and pans etc just needed to ask at reception for whatever they needed as they were more then happy to have plates and cutlery sent up to our room.The food in the restaurant was ok. The gastronomic menu was fairly good value at around 23 euros each, nice tapas and then main and postres. The staff were very friendly with good english and the bar waitress makes great sangria.The location is 15 mins walk from Nou camp, which was good for us as we went to a match. It's also only a couple of minutes walk from Les Corts metro station. We were a little worried about safety on the metro but found it to be very good. ATMs near by too.The Mussols restaurant near by was nice enough, but other than that you probably need to get a taxi to eat out. All in all we really enjoyed our stay at the Atenea. The hotel was fantastic considering the amount I paid and would have been good even if it had cost more.Just a note on pick pockets in Barcelona: I carried a bag across both shoulders and kept it on my hip in front of me, and we had no problem. Stick to the main streets, dont wear a bag on one shoulder, be aware of who is around you (particularly on La Rambla) and you will be fine ","annotations":[{"endOffset":938,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":934},{"endOffset":944,"mention":"tapas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tapas"],"startOffset":939},{"endOffset":938,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":934},{"endOffset":944,"mention":"tapas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tapas"],"startOffset":939}]}
