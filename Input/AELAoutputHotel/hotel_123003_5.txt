{"text":"Great Place to Stay We recently spent 5 nights at this hotel and loved every minute of it. The staff is excellent and very helpful. The room was large and comfy, hot breakfast was very good and the dining area large with a big window for views outside.The evening reception (mid week only) was good with nice wines and a local microbrew on tap. An ok entre was also served each night so if you wanted to save on dinner, that was also an option.It's a short walk...but mainly uphill...to the Space Needle. A long walk to the heart of downtown but buses stop right across the street that will take you there easily. If you add the bus stop around the corner, at least four lines travel by the hotel - it's very easy to do without a car (we also use a wheelchair so that's saying something right there). We also noticed that the Seattle bus drivers are among the most friendly we've come across.Buckley's pub is just around the corner with an excellent happy hour and the best onion rings around. For a good, reasonably priced dinner try their bacon mac 'n cheese. A small mini-mart with a surly counter person is across the street.The hotel is right on the southwestern edge of the Queen Anne neighborhood so it's also in a good area.While all of Seattle is expensive, and this place is no exception, we were able to get a nice suite with a meal (sometimes two) and drinks included for about $40 -50 less than other hotels nearby.
