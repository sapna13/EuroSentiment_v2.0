{"text":"Too big, Go only for Royal Service category If you do not stay in the Royal Service category, you will not get good service\/attention. Also must upgrade to the Master Suite-Royal Service if you want the luxury of ordering room service. Check In is much faster in RS than regular check-in . Your bags are brought right along with you to your room. Regular check in can take 1-2 hours. Your bags can arrive to your room 1-2 hours after that. In the RS section, you can wait along the sidewalk for a golf cart to pick you up and bring you around the resort. It is so big, you cannot walk to too many things yourself. There is a train\/shuttle that continually circles the resort for those that want to go to the beach or back to the front lobby (and other stops along the way). RS side has it's own Gabi Club and pool. Only for RS members. The food and service there was great. In the RS section you are assigned a butler. This person is suppose to come and transport you anywhere you want to go on the resort. Called him 3 times - only came once - when we actually checked out of the room. La Pagoda (Thai restaurant) was o.k. (at best). El Guardo Rest. food was better than the Thai. Making reservations at any of the restaurants (if you are not an RS member) is tough\/if at all possible. As usual with the Caribbean, there is no urgency or rush to assist you in getting something done. It is extremely humid there all the time. Never a good hair day! Shuttles from the airport to the hotel are very slow. Take a taxi for $30 to the resort. You will get to the resort much faster. Beautiful resort - too big though.
