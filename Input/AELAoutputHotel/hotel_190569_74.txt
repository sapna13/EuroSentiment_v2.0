{"text":"Mediocre I am a fan of Starwood hotels and all its brands. I am also a seasoned traveler and have experienced many, many, Starwood hotels in my life. I am a Starwood Gold member.From this view point I have to say that the Westin Palace in Madrid does not reach the Standard that Starwood has for all their hotels.I will start with the positive: Nice Lobby, great hallways,great location...feels like a Grand Hotel when you enter.Now my experience:My reservation made many months in advance was not found (reservation with starwood points) even though I had the confirmation in my hand and the points were deducted from my account. After more than 45 minutes waiting and several phone calls, my reservation was found. I was given a smoking room (reserved non smoking). Then I was moved to a non smoking room after complaining. The room was very standard. No heavenly bed or linens and just a small Queen Bed (felt more like a large full). After asking at the front desk I was told that this hotel does not have King beds (????), that they were remodeling the hotel because many americans request them, and only the executive floor has them. The mattress was outdated, pillows were terrible, and I was promised a change of room the next day. After no one called me with the answer, I talked to the chief of front desk after my second night. He wrote down the issues I mentioned and promised a change of room for the third night. I am still waiting for his phone call.That night we needed a Taxi. Every hotel of this category that I have been to, has Taxis waiting outside or they can be easily called. I was told by the doorman to not even try to wait for a Taxi there, that it was better to walk to the near neptuno square and get one there. (great service, no?).So in general, the hotel is nice outside, average once you open the door of your room and not up to the Starwood standards, and mediocre in regarding to customer service. They just don't care.
