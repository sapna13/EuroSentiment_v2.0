{"text":"More Holiday Inn than luxury My wife and I just returned from a 4 day stay on the executive level of the Conrad Hong Kong. Perhaps our biggest mistake was to stay in the Intercontinental in Kowloon immediately beforehand. The comparison between the level of service and ambiance was stark.Pros and cons:Pro:- Room was large with a great bathroom (separate shower and bath, two sinks, etc.) and lots of closet space. Excellent harbor view.- Great location in a high end shopping mall Con:- The executive lounge was more similar to a something in a cheap long term stay hotel (such as Residence Inn) than a luxury hotel. It consisted of what looked to be a couple of gutted guest rooms packed with small tables and a few couches. Since the executive level benefits did not include free internet in your guest room (unlike the Intercontinental) the lounge was constantly packed with business people checking email and conducting phone meetings - not a pleasant environment. The executive level check in\/out and concierge was also located at a small desk within this space, further compounding the general scrum of activity continuously going on. - The staff seemed more intent on pushing for a tip than on providing service. The staff in the lobby bar (a grim and dismal place) was particularly nasty.- The on site high-end Italian restaurant Nicholini's was very good however the staff was relentless in pushing the more expensive menu item (Wagyu beef, lobster, etc.). Needless to say even if you resist the pressure expect to pay US$400+ for 2.Perhaps if we had not had the contrasting experience at the Intercontinental this place may have seemed better.
