{"text":"My new home in NYC I just finished my first stay in NYC at the Sofitel (two nights, Sunday and Monday). Over the years, I have probably stayed at 20 hotels in NYC. Many are just mediocre and the city itself seems to take a toll on hotels.The Sofitel is a great experience for midtown Manhattan. The room is larger than a closet, and homey in feel, which puts it at about the top 2 in NYC hotel experiences out of 20. The bed was comfortable and the room generally well-appointed. I loved the views of the Chrysler Building, and the rooms are on the 20th floor and above so there is no street noise.The bathroom was clean and modern with a separate shower area distinct from the tub. Room service was prompt and the food very good. Room service is a tricky thing to pull off in NYC. I ate three meals in my room no complaints at all, and the food was better than restaurant quality food at many NYC locations. A plus on room service.Front desk and general service were excellent. My only B-level marks were for housekeeping which did, I thought, a B-plus job. All other services aspects were A or A plus.The fitness center is nice and they provide headphones and wipes for wiping down the equipment. (It amazes me how many hotels blow the fitness center.) I'd love for them to expand the fitness center, but I didn't have to wait for a treadmill.The lobby is small, so if you like to hang out in the lobby, try another hotel. And if you need six stars rather than five stars, try the St. Regis (and be prepared to pay for it). If you want a terrific homey, quiet NYC experience the Sofitel is it.
