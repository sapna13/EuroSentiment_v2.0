{"text":"Temple of Paradise We stayed at this Hotel as part of our Honeymoon, we hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ planned to stay here this was a last minute decision as the Hotel we booked had construction work been done close by, which we hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ been told about! We called this call the two days before we wanted to arrive and there was no problem, they where so helpful, the arranged for us to be collected from other Hotel, where they arrived on time, with cool towels  bottled water. So off we headed to Le Meridien Nirwana√à√\u2020\u2022? We arrived at the entrance and took the stunning drive up the Hotel as the golf course and paddi fields align the drive up. We checked in which was very quick and no hassle, we where taken to our room that is in the Hotel, which I have to say we where very disappointed with, it was clean and was an ok size but it was just very old and if I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ to be honest the hotel rooms need a big make over! We asked the lady if it was possible for up to be upgraded to another room, so she very kindly showed us two of the villas onsite, and they are very nice and have a Balinese style, this room is a good size room with a plunge pool and a good outside relaxing area with a bale. This upgraded came at a small additional cost but well worth ever penny. So the next morning we where moved to one of the nicest Villas they had right on the ocean (703). In the Villa you also have the choice of breakfast in the Hotel or you can have breakfast delivered to your room, we done both and both where just a good, in the afternoon we where also brought a little snack each day along with a news paper, a kind little touch. Regards Restaurants in the Hotel there are four which are all reasonable priced considering you are in a 5 star hotel, and each one will have a themed night for example, one will have a fish BBQ one night and the next night there will be a magic wok night, this I thought was a great idea as there isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really any restaurants out side the hotel so it is a taxi ride away, However the Hotel does offer a shuttle bus to Kuta, Ubud and Seminyak on varied days\/evenings of the week. When we made the booking for this Hotel we took a package that was offered, which included 3 rounds of golf and 3 spa treatments. My husband took us the Golf offer and was very happy; this also included a buggy and caddie so it was a very excellent offer. I on the other hand took up the spa offer and was deeply disappointed, the treatment it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ self was good but the ambience was really awful, there was a air conditioning unit over my head that was blasting out cold air and was very loud when I asked for this to be turned off I was told that it was centralised, also the d√ã√\u2022√ñcor of the room was very poor and again was need of a make over. I decided I would give it one more try and go for a pedicure, this was ok till be got the polish and I asked for a French polish and the girl had no idea what I was asking for! Which isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ very good for someone that is working in a five star hotel and doing pedicures! I think a little training would be a good idea. In saying all the above the Hotel lobby and the grounds of the hotel and stunning the gardens are so well manicured and the view and the Tanta lot is just amazing at sunset and the Hotel offer guided walks at sunset to the temple and they are all well informed on any questions you might have. There is also a village cycle that is also a guided tour which we done on morning, this brings you around the local area and through the paddi fields. The pool areas is well kept and have a really pleasant relaxing feeling to it, there is two water slides that are well hidden and you would hardly know they where there, for the kids, however us adults has just as much fun as the kids! Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel, there are a few points that I think would need to be addressed, how and ever the hotel is clean in a beautiful setting and the staff are very friendly and helpful.
