{"text":"Ehh... This hotel is not an upscale hotel, despite the description they write up on their webpage and on the front of the tripadvisor page here. There is nothing upscale about this place-- as someone just posted, it does feel like a flashback to the motor hotels so popular more than a while ago. However, the room was pretty clean, but worse for the wear. We didn't pay for breakfast at the hotel, so we can't tell you what that was like.We did have problems with noise, even though we were in room 404 at the rear of the property-- as we had been advised to request. When we went to bed around midnight both nights of our stay, things were relatively quiet. However, both nights we were awakened around 3 a.m. to blaring music from somewhere outside. I am not sure if you should ask for the rear or the front of this property either...When we left at 4:30 a.m. for our flight, we could still hear the thumping in our room. But, when we stepped out into the street to get into the taxi, it was quiet. Bizarre.The staff was largely aloof and wasn't effusively friendly.We also didn't care for the fact that two book-sized religious tracts had been placed in the room prominently by the owner of the hotel. A Bible put into a drawer is okay, but we felt that these books-- which you could buy if you wanted!-- overstepped that line. But of course, those are easily ignored.What is good about the hotel is the location in Old San Juan and there is a free public computer with Internet access and printer. ","annotations":[]}
