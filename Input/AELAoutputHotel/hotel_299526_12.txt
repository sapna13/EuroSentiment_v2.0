{"text":"Average to above average, good value. After reading a fair few reviews on this site and having decided I didnt want to pay for 5 star on this trip I settled for Rosedale on the Park which seemed to have pretty good reviews, compared to the hotel I had previously booked which didnt fayre too well.Anyone who has stayed in Hong Kong will know that the difference between 4 star bottom and 5 star top is very significant and in most cases you really do get what you pay for..With Rosedale, it is cheap, I compared it against 3-4 other 4 star hotels I knew of and it was about $70aus cheaper so thats a bonus. Rooms are small, but again, experience in Hong Kong tells you that you will get a small room in 4 star on a budget.I was upgraded to an exec room which is no different to a superior, but it is higher up, had a nice view and a double bed. The bed was fantastic, really comfortable with a big Duvet so I slept like a champion 3 nights in a row which is good for me when travelling.pro's and cons.pro's- good value compared to many other 4 star hotels- breakfast buffet was cheap, again, compared to other places but was probably of 3 star quality- location great, right on Victoria Park and C. Bay shops- quiet, didnt here a pin drop outside my room- staff very friendly and keen to assist - free internet in room, which was great, I used my laptop and the cable and it was really fastCons- Small room, i travelled alone and was fine, might struggle with 2 people for more than a few nights.- majority of staff get by on English, I had some communication issues with front desk and housekeeping (nb their English way better than my chineese tho, but not the point)- Not an issue for me, but this hotel was probably 95% occupied by Chineese tourists, if you are after a western hotel with lots of European travellers, this isnt the one for you.- Gym is tiny, one treadmill, one bike, some weights and a multi workout machine. More than 3 people in gym would be overcrowded and some of their marketing is a bit misleading, touting it as a room with treadmills in plural and much eqt.Overall, a good comfortable stay, it didnt exceed my expectations nor did under deliver. Would I stay here again? Probably not, but that is because there are so many hotels in HK and like to move around, not a reflection on the hotel itself.TIPS - The laundry costs are a joke, it costs about $60hk for one pair of jeans and $30Hk per pair of underpants. Youd spend $700HK on a load of washing (as much as a nights accomm). DONT DO IT, head right out of hotel and left down an alley about 50 metres from hotel and there is a laundry and the lady will do a whole bag of washing and drying for you for $30HK dollars which is about $4Aus.Same with minibar, you can go to the 24 hour servo and buy 4 cans of beer, 4 cans of diet coke and some noodles for the same price as a bottle of water and bottle of sprite in the mini bar.
