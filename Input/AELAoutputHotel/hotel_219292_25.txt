{"text":"There are better options! We spent 4 nights at the Wyland Waikiki. Two reasons we picked it were 1) it was very modern looking in the photos we had seen, 2) continental breakfast was included.Firstly, the continental breakfast was a pastry and juice from the little coffee shop downstairs with no decent place to sit and which only had a certain number available each day, so if you got there a little late, you missed out! (And after 4 days you were sick of bagels!)Secondly, we got absolutely no sleep the first night we were there due to excessive traffic noise coming from the main road. Doors and windows to the rooms did not close and\/or seal properly so the noise was like sitting on the side of the road. The air conditioning was definitely not new and was also very noisy.The next morning we asked to be moved to a room on the opposite side of the building away from the road. There was another guest at reception at the same time as us with exactly the same complaint.On the plus side, they did move us to another room in the adjacent building which was much quieter.The staff were all very friendly and rooms cleaned regularly. Common areas were very modern and included free internet (on Mac computers).On the map it does look like it's very close to the beach, but to get to the beach access it's actually a much longer walk. There are definitely other hotels much closer to the beach.We wouldn't stay here again, as we saw many other hotels in better locations that we thought would be worth the extra cost.
