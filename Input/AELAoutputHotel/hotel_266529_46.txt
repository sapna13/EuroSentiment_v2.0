{"text":"Excellent Value...Beautiful Hotel! Hotel Europa is located on the ever-busy Puerto del Sol; thank goodness for excellent sound-proofed doors as the Plaza never really sleeps.The hotel is a superb value; it's old-world charm and ambience at excellent prices. We paid √à√\u2020√ü?00\/night for a great room with a balcony right over the plaza. The beds were hard as is the norm, but were appointed well and the bathroom was gorgeous being all marble; best European bath we've seen in all of our travels.The Metro stop is located immediately in front of the hotel, but if you like a good walk, most major central attractions are within 20 minutes of the property. The staff is multi-lingual and very helpful. Bus tour tickets were available from the front desk, and they were able to arrange a nice and affordable shuttle back to the airport for us at the end of our visit.The Europa Cafe is attached and is a very popular place for good affordable breakfast, lunch, or just sipping a beverage and people watching at one of the many outside tables.One slight caveat; the room door card has to be inserted into a plate on the wall in the room for the lights and Air Conditioning to stay on. That's mostly not an issue, except that the room was always warm upon returning and didn't ever really cool down to a comfortable level for several hours; that made it hard to sleep a couple of nights.Overall though, Hotel Eurpopa is an extraordinarily good value and we'd highly recommend it.
