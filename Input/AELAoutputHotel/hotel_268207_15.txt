{"text":"Good location We stayed at the Inn for 9-27-29th for a concert. Honestly, I wasn't thrilled with staying here but the hotel was paid for so I wasn't expecting too much. I read reviews about the parking behind the hotel but did it anyway. Our car had an alarm which was a rented vehicle and I took the chance. I noticed the day we left there had been some window glass in the spot next to me so it appeared as though someone's window had been broken into.The location was great. This I cannot stress enough. Get a high floor room if you can. We aksed for a waterview but they were booked up. The room was clean and was big enough for us. I would think anymore than two people would be too cramped. The front desk was more than helpful and accomodating. They even printed out my boarding passes for me since I forgot. Bunker hill was a short walk from the Inn and beautiful. Breeder's Hill, the climb of 294 steps was worth it and the walk around the neighborhoods was great. We walked to the north end right over the bridge and ate Pizza Reggina(cash only) and a great atmosphere.We got to the Inn on Thursday, Friday went to concert in the evening and we really hustled to see everything. We accomplished quite a bit and my legs feel it for sure. When we have more time we will go back to Boston. It has a wonderful feel to the city with so much history and beauty.Cons: Granted it's not a hotel they could have had a better selection of late night room service. Room service ends at 9:30 p.m. The parking is a risk.Pro's: Great location. Good service. free breakfast with plenty to chose from. I would stay here again since the location was great and the people were nice.
