{"text":"Lots of pluses, a (very) few minuses This is the second time we stayed at the Caribe Hilton. The place is starting to show its age, but all in all, it's still worth it.We booked the room on Priceline, and when we arrived, got what I called the Priceline room --- overlooking an air conditioning system. That would have been okay. But the room (328) was a mess --- black scuff marks on the walls, mold in the bathtub tile and hair on the bathtub. I politely brought that to management's attention, and they quickly found another, extremely nice room. Hat's off to them for their effort.The Caribe Hilton has several nice pools, including a swim-up bar, a private beach, and decks that overlook the ocean. Beautiful. You can spend the day lounging around. Bar prices are typically ridiculous --- plan on $30, with tax and tip, for two alcoholic drinks, and $15 for a sandwich --- but we avoided that.One of the BIG cons is location. There's only one restaurant nearby, the over-rated Escambron, and I'd avoid it, even though it's just a 5-minute walk away. So you have to venture to Ashford Avenue or Old San Juan for an authentic meal. That means you either have to walk 30 minutes to a restaurant on Ashford or spend $12 to $15 each way for a cab. That makes eating out really pricey (during the day, you can take a bus to Ashford or Old San Juan, but I wouldn't recommend it at night).If you're not interested in authentic fare, the hotel has four restaurants, including a Morton's Steak House. Figure at least $125 for dnner two there, and at least $60 at the other restaurants (and that's without alcohol). Since I've been to San Juan many times I know how to get around and save a lot of money. If you're going to spend all of your time at the Hilton, it will cost you. But that's not any different from anywhere else in the area. The pools, best private beach in the area and outstanding service make it worth it.
