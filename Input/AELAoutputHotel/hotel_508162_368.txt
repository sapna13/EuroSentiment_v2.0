{"text":"One of the best Resorts in Punta Cana After reading some of the bad reviews, I'm certain that some people will complain no matter what.We (Me, My Wife and 16 year Old Son) stayed at Dreams Punta Cana from April 27th till May 04 2008. This was our 3rd trip to DR. We stayed at Iberostar Punta Cana and RIU Palace Macao before, and Dreams was by far nicest of 3.RIDE TO THE RESORTThis resort is at the very end of Bavaro Resort district so the ride is about an hour if you don't have to make any stops. Our bus stopped twice on the way, so it took us almost 1hr and 20min. Ride is very bumpy at times, but this was our 3rd time so we expected that.Iberostar and RIU is at least 40 minutes shorter ride.CHECK-INThere was a lot of people checking in at the time we arrived, so we had to wait for about 20minutes. I emailed the concierge with the room request (Building 1 close to the Beach), but we didn't get it. So that was little upsetting. But they gave us a new room next day so if you'll ask they will try to help you as much as they can.ROOMSWe stayed at 2nd floor Deluxe Room with pool view. Room is little on the small side, but not tiny as some people claimed. We had 2 double beds and pull out couch. Room, bathroom and all furnishing are in like new shape.BEACH AND POOLBeach is very wide. Cleaned everyday. With many chars and cabanas. But if you want nice shady spot, you have to get there before 8AM. There are many rocks in the water so you have to be careful.Now the pool is just huge, with tons of chairs and umbrellas, so even thou resort was full it never felt crowded.FOOD AND DRINKSDreams has 7 Restaurants (French, Mexican, Seafood, Steak House, Italian, Japanese and Chinese and Buffet) plus Beach Grill and Fruit Stand during the day. You don't have to make morning reservations to the restaurants, but if they full they give out beepers that work in a whole resort and they call you when your table is ready. I think it works great. We tried all the restaurants except Italian and Chinese and they were all very good.As for drinks you have many top shelf liqueurs to choose from plus many beers (like Heineken or Coors Lite).ENTERTAINMENT  STUFFAs with many other resorts you had plenty of games and entertainment during the day at the main pool and beach area.Plus nightly shows at 9:30PM, Disco at 10:30 and Casino until 3AMLots of very attending Stuff, waitresses waking on the beach taking drinks orders, plenty of pool bars etcIn summary, great resort with amazing pool and great beach. very good food and attending stuff.All in all we had an amazing vacation and would choose this resort again in a heartbeat.
