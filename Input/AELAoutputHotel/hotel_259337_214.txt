{"text":"Nice hotel, lots of sports My girlfriend and i stayed from nov 11 to nov 29th. The hotel was more or less perfect as you'll see below and we can really recommend it:4.0 RoomsWe had a junior suite with a jacuzzi in the bathroom. The room was spacey, we had two king size beds (average comfort), a couch and a table. There's a safe in the room and the stuff in it is insured with 500 $. We changed rooms after three days, cause our in-room coffee machine didn't work and the tv picture was all red (couple of american programms including espn, cbs, fox and one or more from almost every other country). The second room was perfect.4.5 ServicePretty good. At the bars perfect (tons of cocktails to chose from) and the guest relation was pretty helpful.5.0 ValueWe got a good deal (18 days, 1600 euros) and it was worth every penny.4.0 CleanlinessOnly minor complaints - the sheets had some stains on it, which didn't go away after washing. Couple of uninvited guests (small bugs), which didn't bother us at all and are common in every country with this climate.4.5 Pool and beachWe had to reserve our seats at the beach every day before breakfast, cause the hotel was pretty full during our stay. No problem for us. The beach itself is beautiful, but pretty crowded. You can find some shadow under the palm trees or under small roofs. The pools (4 overall in the three connecting hotels) were big and not really crowded. All had a swimup bar with fast service. Pools seemed to be clean.5.0 Food There are buffets with various themes (spanish, dominican, mexican, asian, american, gala, italian) changing every evening. in the morning and for dinner you can eat the buffets too. The dinner buffet always has a grill station, where u can get tuna, chicken, hamburger and other stuff from the grill. I never stood up hungry, but more often than not ate way too much.There are also 5 a-la-carte restaurants: dominican, international, asian, mexican, italian. We went to the mexican, which was pretty average, the asian (good) and the international (good steaks). The sports cafe had food (hamburger, pizza, snacks) and drinks 24\/7.5.0 SportsI regularly do some sports and u have tremendous opportunities here: Soccer ground with artifical turf (very good), 6 tennis courts, 4 beach volley ball courts, some paddle courts (played it never before, but we really liked it), table tennis, billard and lots more. You could find something to do every day and almost at any time. There were also some tournaments in the different sports.
