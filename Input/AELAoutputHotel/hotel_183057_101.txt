{"text":"Forgot to clean my room Stayed here as a result of the great reviews here. They were the cheapest room in the downtown area for when I was staying there, and a suite no less.I will say that the hotel is lovely, the room is very large, and the location can't be beat. We had continental breakfast delivered to our room right on time both mornings, by two smiling faces. In fact, I enjoyed everything about the hotel, except, that they forgot to make up my room on Saturday (we were there from Fri - Sun). We got back to our room at 3:30 pm from an afternoon of shopping, and our room was not made up. I called the front desk and told them of the situation; they said that they try to make up the incoming guests rooms first, which made sense to me. I told them we would be out until about 5, and to please have the room made up.We returned at 5:10, and the room was still not made up. I called the front desk again, and the clerk expressed surprise that the room still wasn't done. I told her to forget it, as we were there now getting ready for a play; but to please have the room turned down for the evening. We came back from our play and dinner, and indeed, the room was prepared for evening.Overall, except for that, our stay was fine; great location, great price, and the room was very, very spacious. Oh, and the bathroom and vanity area were wonderful and spacious. ","annotations":[]}
