{"text":"Very Expensive with Problems The Culebra Beach Villas Hotel is very expensive for what they offered. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ really a camping ground with beds and a\/c to sleep. The beds are as hard as a rock and the bedding used is probably 10 years old. Appliances are in good working condition but dirty. Be aware of the monster size flying √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âucarachas√à√\u2020\u2022?while you sleep.We experience a REALLY bad odor from cats and chickens\/roosters feces everywhere. We had to clean the porch with lavender cleaner in order to be outside. The unfreindly Management could only offer running water from 8am to 8pm. So, if you have to use the bathroom in the middle of the night√à√\u2020\u2022?too bad. In addition, they do not provide any towels, soap, toilette paper or dish soap for your stay. They DO NOT clean very well, because we found inside the bedroom closet and √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¥ld√à√\u2020\u2022?female underwear and several kids bathing suits under the beds. The Management is only available a few hours during the day, even though they live in one of the villas in the premises. The website clearly noted that in each villa an X number of guests are allowed. But several of the villas around us that only had beds for 2-4, but they had 8 to 9 guests√à√\u2020\u2022?making the noise and trash more noticeable. We reported certain issues to the Manager, his response √à√\u2020\u2022?he is only there to hand out and pick up the villas keys. What it is inside each the villa √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√\u2020ood√à√\u2020\u2022?or √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√áad√à√\u2020\u2022?or √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√£nsufficient√à√\u2020\u2022?is what the owner supplies and nothing else is provided. We do noticed that behind the Managers Office a storage room, with bath soap, rolls of paper towels, toilet paper, dish soap√à√\u2020\u2022?etc. we visited this room thinking it was the office and were surprise when Management told us that they DO NOT provide any of these items. Management was very upset that we visited the storage room....humm!Good Luck if you are thinking on renting at the Culebra Beach Villas. My advice --- please stay in the downtown √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°erry√à√\u2020\u2022?area hotels and take the $2.00 taxi to the free Public Flamenco Beach.
