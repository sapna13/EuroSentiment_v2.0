{"text":"Hit n Miss I loved the look of the place so we took the plunge and booked our lovely new year getaway. On arriving at the hotel, we had a lovely welcome and we taken to the most lovely room (108) over looking the canal. It was really high spec and I was blown away. Unfortunately, after about half an hour after settling in we were visited by who I assume was the duty manager. He told us we had to move as things in the room were not working properly and then that there was a mix up with the room. Perplexed but a little tired we were taken to our new room. It reminded me of a travel lodge room but with 12ft high windows and no tea facilities.The room was dated, tatty but clean and well in need of a refurb. After being moved from 108 we felt a little judged.Staff barring those on reception were lovely, friendly and normal. There were some nice touches such as the evening service with little chocolates and turning down of the beds.And oh, the beds, they were the best part of the stay. Really comfy with fresh egyptian cotton bedding (pillows too big though!) The place stunk of fish on the Tuesday and we could constantly hear the clattering in the kitchen.I would stay at this place if you had more money than sense as it may look really grand but is not quite what it makes its self out to be. Rooms definately not high standard. Must try harder.
