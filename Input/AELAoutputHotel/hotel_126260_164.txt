{"text":"A Magical Experience An absolute delight and class act. This hotel provides the quintessential Manhattan experience. I was originally booked at a very nice albeit less glitzy hotel (it's one block away on Lexington) but saw a similar price here and thought, why not go all the way and experience Manhattan the way it's intended to be experienced - to the nines! This is an excellent hotel for the firsttime visitor like myself, but I would also consider returning. The only other place probably to top this hotel could be The Plaza, though I don't know how it could top the Palace. There's no pool, but if you have the time and energy to swim in New York while on vacation, then you're not seeing enough of the city.The view was stunning - was on the 21st floor - massive St Pat's Cathedral. Did not see the Kennedys though.Sit in the lobby for 20 minutes - it's an experience - watching the people, observing the opulence of the place etc. Maid service twice a day - the first day I raced in and threw everything everywhere at 3:30 pm with only a few daylight hours left, took a shower (high pressure shower head, no low flow here!!!) then went to Saks, Rockefeller and returned around 9:00 pm to find my room cleaned, toothbrush and paste sitting on a facecloth on the counter, mints on bed etc etc. I had left my wallet thrown across the bed with (lots) of cash in it (forgetting about the maid service)- nothing was taken. Check out took about 14 seconds and I'm not joking. No line up even the day after New years. Try the room service once; skip the minibar - it's no fun paying $8 for a vitamin water. Go to The Food Emporium  buy yourself at the end of a day. Or don't - it's only money!Perfect balance between anonymity and personal service. Will try to return late in the Spring for another take.
