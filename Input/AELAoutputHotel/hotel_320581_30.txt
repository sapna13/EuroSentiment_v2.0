{"text":"Great stay in Tokyo. Will come back and stay again. Stayed in the Sunroute Plaza Shinjuku for seven nights for my first time in Tokyo. This hotel was a big reason for my trip being so great. All of the hotel staff were very helpful, polite, and professional and spoke good english. Had no problems with check in\/out. They gave me an umbrella to use when raining. The lounge on the second floor was very nice. It has a large TV, big sofas, free computers, free water, hot chocolate, tea and coffee, and many nice books and magazines. I didn't try any of the hotel restaraunts or bars (but they looked very good). Rooms were a little small, but had a super comfortable feel and very clean. Nice TV, kettle, tea, fridge, slippers. A big, very comfortable bed. The bathroom was the biggest surprise. It had the best shower of any hotel I have ever stayed in. A large fog free mirror in front of the sink. Toilet with bidet. Nice soap, shampoo, conditioner. Plus razors, q-tips, comb and brush, and toothbrush and toothpaste all in a basket on the counter.  The location is great, as noted in other reviews (especially for tokyo first timers). Shinjuku station is a short walk away. The Oeda and Shinjuku lines have a staion pretty much outside the hotel front doors. I used these two convieniant lines much of the time. I don't know how I got such a great deal on the hotel. This is probably the best deal you can get in Tokyo. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Tokyo. I enjoyed Tokyo so much I want to go as soon as possible. I 100% agree with an earlier review and say Just stay here ","annotations":[{"endOffset":480,"mention":"hot chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hot_chocolate"],"startOffset":467},{"endOffset":485,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":482},{"endOffset":496,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":490},{"endOffset":485,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":482},{"endOffset":496,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":490},{"endOffset":511,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":507},{"endOffset":692,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":688},{"endOffset":708,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":705},{"endOffset":924,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":920}]}
