{"text":"Definitely Worth the Money! Your going to read something bad about every hotel. Either someone gets sick somewhere (they could anywhere) or they're just too picky as some other reviews will agree.Our stay at the Ocean Sand Dec 11-18 was very relaxing and so different because we had never been anywhere all-inclusive before. Upon arriving, the Punta Cana airport is a breeze, and checkin at the hotel was quick. The only things we didnt think were that great: a few locals come on weekends to try and take over pool bars, the people selling things at the market on the beach are extremely pushy (just be aware if you walk up the beach), and I would suggest to everyone not to travel with Signiture Vacations. They will lie to you on the phone and then won't return e-mails.However, the things we enjoyed Far outweighed the things we didnt: almost every kind of alcohol you could want, lobby bar entertainment was good, buffets were good, and the variety was good too, a la cartes were a little better, the sports bar snacks really helped late at night, beach is beautiful and waves are fun however if you want shade on the beach you need to show up early, shows were good, we never went into the nite club, timeshare people weren't too pushy, we just kept walking by them every day, and did I mention every kind of alcohol, they'll mix them as strong as you want, their local Presidente beer is good too, and its worth while to get a couple pictures taken by one of the local photographers.Its very easy to meet people and if your having trouble just hang out at the pool bar (we did every day) We were very lucky, the people we met were great and helped make the trip so enjoyable. We had fun with people from Scotland, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and yes, even Timmons and Toronto.Will definitey go back to Punta Cana. Would we stay at this hotel again--yes, however we would also be willing to try another hotel too.
