{"text":"We loved Il Guelfo Bianco We spent 10 days in Florence and stayed at Il Guelfo Bianco. What a wonderful hotel! Our room was charming with tasteful decorations (especially the beautiful Italian tile in the bathroom). It was quiet at night, and the bed was very comfortable. We also enjoyed all of the interesting art work displayed throughout the hotel.Il Guelfo Bianco is in a great location. It's walking distance to everything.We LOVED the complementary breakfast offered every morning in the cheerful breakfast room. Excellent coffee was brought to our table, and we could choose from a wonderful assortment of fresh breakfast items. They offered the best yogurt I have ever tasted, fresh fruit, an assortment of fresh bakery items (loved the croissants and the tart), hard-boiled eggs, fresh juice, granola, and a lovely assortment of jams and honeys. I normally do not like the quality of complementary breakfasts in American hotels, but we looked forward to our Italian breakfast every morning. (I really miss Italian caffe and yogurt now that we are home.)The best thing about Il Guelfo Bianco is the wonderful staff. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. We were warmly greeted as we would come and go on our daily outings. They had great suggestions for restaurants to try. (Our favorite was Ristorante Cafaggi, just 2 blocks away. Their grilled calamari was exquisite!) I can't say enough good things about Il Guelfo Bianco. We really felt we were experiencing the best of Florence. Grazie mille to everyone at the hotel for all of your wonderful hospitality!! We hope we can return soon.Kathleen and Bob DedonSeattle, WA ","annotations":[{"endOffset":536,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":530},{"endOffset":536,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":530},{"endOffset":536,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":530},{"endOffset":756,"mention":"croissants","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Croissant"],"startOffset":746},{"endOffset":769,"mention":"tart","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tart"],"startOffset":765},{"endOffset":1040,"mention":"yogurt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Yogurt"],"startOffset":1034},{"endOffset":1040,"mention":"yogurt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Yogurt"],"startOffset":1034}]}
