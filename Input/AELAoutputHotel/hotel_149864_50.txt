{"text":"Family Treat If you have kids, this is your place!Having never been to a Club Med Resort, I have no basis of comparison, but we were extremely impressed with the quality of the kids' program. Our children are 51\/2 and 7 and they had a great time.The staff have an enthusiasm that is unbelievable! By day 2 they remembered both the children's names. The kids can join in to the club whenever they want during the day and you can sign them out when you want as well. The staff are very diligent about security, taking head counts all the time and making sure there are always staff in front and behind the group when they are heading off to activities.My only complaint with the program might be that at some of the activities, like the trapeze and archery, the kids were sitting for too long waiting for their turn. Also, they didn't ask about swimming skills and so my 5 1\/2 year old, who is a very good swimmer had to wear water wings because he was put in the 4\/5 group and that's what they do. But, we talked to them and it was no problem to put him in the older group.For my kids, who come from a city that is slowly becoming multicultural, it was a great opportunity to see that there are many different languages and cultures out there. All the G.O.'s were extremely friendly and attentive, and, I know this is shmarmy, but they make you feel like you're something special.
