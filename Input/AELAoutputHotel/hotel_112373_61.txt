{"text":"Loved the quaint hotel My father was stationed at Presidio back in the 80's  I fell in love w\/ San Francisco. My wife  I have returned many times over the 15 yrs we've been together. We were in Sonoma April 2007 for a sales conference  spent our last 2 days in the city before we left. Our friends we were travelling with had chosen this hotel  we absolutely loved it! It was definitely an older bldg in SF but that's what gives it character. I've read several of the reviews here  must agree w\/ almost all of them. I do however, take exception w\/ some of the reviews w\/ regard to a\/c, street level noise  small rooms .... People, this is a city botique hotel. Have you ever lived in the city -- people are up at all hours! Expect street noise -- try living in it  soon you'll realize its the same. We've stayed at other hotels in SF  found the same thing -- again, its called city living. A\/C in San Francisco -- its just not necessary! Open the windows  let some fresh air in. Last Sept '06 we stayed in the Van Ness \/ Geary Blvd area  experienced the same street noise so don't think it's just this hotel. Plus, in Sept it was gorgeous for the first few days as we hit the indian summer perfect then Saturday rolled around .... we were in a nice local pub w\/ shorts on  when we left a few hours later the temp had dropped 20 degrees to below 60 w\/ fog  all! I felt like I was living there again for a just a magical moment in time. Oh yeah, if you get the chance, travel a few blocks southwest  dine at Fluer De Lys -- 777 Sutter St. Chef Keller is magnifique!! If you get the chance, stay at this hotel -- but expect a city botique hotel built in the early 1900's!
