{"text":"Royal Peacock lost it's Feathers We have just returned from a trip to Thailand and Singapore. The Royal Peacock hotel in Singapore was disappointing to say the least. We booked the executive suite as we thought we would treat ourselves for 3 days in Singapore. The most disappointing thing was the price - nearly S$250 per night is absolutely outrageous for the poor quality of this hotel. To begin, there is no-one to take your bags and show you to your room, which I wouldn't mind if staying at a back packers or a budget hotel! We arrived at our room to find a queen bed with grubby pillowcases (clean, but permanently stained) and no blankets in sight - only a sheet and thin bedspread. We soon understood why as the aircon barely worked. We had two windows with wooden shutters, only when I went to open them, found that they opened onto views of large airconditioning fans, which seemed to be working - just not in our room! There was no minibar - only an empty fridge that was barely cold. When we went to bed at night, all we could hear and feel through the bed was the rumbling fans from outside our windows. The carpets were grubby, the room and bathroom smelled - not just the standard 'humid climate musty hotel room smell' either... the shower was barely warm and there was no hot water from the hand basin at all. No hand towels or face washer provided, only 2 threadbare bath towels and a bath mat. I've stayed in back packers better than this hotel for less than half the price. Extremely disappointing and would not stay here again.
