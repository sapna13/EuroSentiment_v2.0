{"text":"Call it Fair not Excellence We went to this resort during the week of October 11, 2008. We had reserved a Prestige limo service prior to our departure to bring us to the resort. Although expensive, the ride was worth it as it takes approximately 75 minutes to get to the resort from the airport. The ride can be quite bumpy at times as there are a lot of potholes on part of the road. Once we got to the resort, we were greeted with the cold towel and some bubbly wine and then directed to the excellence club. We were then brought to our room which was a junior suite swim up room. The room is spacious and provides good living space although the bathroom is fairly small and the shower space is quite limited.Overall the resort is well maintained and clean. The beach is huge and spectacular with lots of room to sit and enjoy the weather. As mentioned in other reviews, the sea is quite rough.The pool area has also a lot of room and is quite well maintained by the staff. The only bad issue is that people go out early in the morning and reserve chairs and floating mattresses preventing people to have access to those during the course of the day.Food wise, the menu is at best average. The only restaurant we did not eat at is the lobster house. We tried all the other ones and I would rate the food being fair at best. As far as I am concerned, I tried the steak in two places and both times, it was served almost raw and very bad tasting. The other plates were sometimes bland and tasted nothing. On the other hand, service was appropriate and charming.On the entertainment side, although the shows cannot be compared to Vegas, we thought they were quite good and quite entertaining. We mostly enjoyed the Jackson imitation and the circus. During the day, although we just witnessed it as we were at the other side of the resort, it seemed as well that staff were entertaining the guests in quite a dligent fashion.We think the excellence club was a good choice. Rather than going to the restaurants at lunch, we went to the club to pick up some pasta and cold meat and eat in our room or on the balcony. We though it was better than to get dressed and go out.The excellence club also serves a continental breakfast with a limited choice of hot food. Furthermore, the excellence club also provides you with a concierge service to book activities and to seek information.Overall, our experience was good except for the food. Mosquitoes were also a problem mostly at night and the were quite ferocious. Temperature was excellent and other than the first day, rain mostly happened at night. Tiles are rather slippery when wet so you have to be careful. Quite a pleasing experience but we would favor a buffet style dinner at one of the restaurants.Service from the staff is excellent overall. Tippng when you get superior service is well appreciated. We had to request the maid at various occasion to supply us with towels and washcloths.
