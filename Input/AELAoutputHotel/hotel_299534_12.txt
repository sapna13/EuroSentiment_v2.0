{"text":"A fantastic value for a hotel in HK As I write this, Hotel Jen is rated #52 out of 160. It deserves a higher rank.I was in HK for a conference in HKU. On the plane, I saw the ad in the inflight magazine and thought: I wish I could stay there. The ad showed a baywindow with a cushion stretched the entire length of the window. It could be a third bed. And the window overlooked the harbour. As it turned out, I was booked by the conference organisers into the hotel. All hotel rooms could take some tips from this hotel. The entire room is divided into two parts--the sleeping\/working area, and the toilet\/shower\/sink area. The way to imagine it is that one enters into the room via the toilet. Ok, that sounds crass but the toilet and shower are sealed off with frosted glass walls. When one steps out from the shower or the toilet, one is at the sink. Make a slight right and that is the door. Make a left and one is into the sleeping\/working area.There is a review saying that one cannot divide the two areas. Well, this is a chi-chi kind of hotel There is what appears to be a very stylish wooden frame but actually it is a sliding door. In other words, the room can be divided into the sleeping\/working area and the toilet\/shower\/sink area.The sleeping\/working area is bright and airy with the window. It is a bit tight to be sure because one had to lie in bed to watch tv.The breakfast area is somewhat workmanlike. Besides chairs, there are stools. And the breakfast is not the lavish kind one sees in 5-star Asian hotels. But I'm not complaining. Conferences leave plenty of food around.BTW, the space is so well used that there is a gym and swimming pool. I discovered them too late to use them.I would highly recommend this place. It's one the best hotels I've experienced, especially for the value it represents. ","annotations":[]}
