{"text":"Remember it fondly months later The City Inn is a spectacular hotel. Its modern design makes W properties feel slightly cheap and over the top. I requested a room with a view when checking in (late in the evening) and the staff informed me that I could have a suite with a GREAT view or I could try a room. I tried my booked Club room, and when getting there was completely stunned, with a view including river, skyscrapers, and the beautiful MI5 building in front. The full floor-to-ceiling windows were gorgeous but just the beginning of a room so stunning a friend, who had been busily telling me a story on the way there, just forgot what she was saying about and went Wow.I had a minor emergency one night: it was 10 PM, and a belt I had just bought was too loose. It was my only belt and I had to dress smart. I let Reception know and, right after I had finished my late dinner, my fixed belt was sitting in my room bed. Very impressive. Walking to the subway is a bit of a hassle (I even miss that though! the area is nice) but you quickly discover an Oxford St bus that also goes past the Houses of Parliament etc and leaves you one block away. It's a very scenic busride.The only thing I didn't like was the restaurant. I only got the end of a mediocre buffet breakfast and was a bit rushed. Dinner was little better. The menu sounded excellent but in the end I didn't feel compelled to finish my meal. My waitress was very enthusiastic but also very new, and spoke practically no English. She knew less of the complicated menu items than me, but in fairness did every effot she should. In general, however, the whole restaurant was quite disorganised, with waiters running around not coping, even with a half-full venue late night, and with everything taking AGES to arrive.All in all, the City Inn was such a nice stay I remember it fondly often. I will never forget sitting by the window my last night in London, after a night out, eating a plate of red fruits and a glass of champagne while looking out the window listening to a CD from their collection. I'll never pass a chance to stay there again, even if I dine elsewhere.
