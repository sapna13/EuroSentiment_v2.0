{"text":"Great Family Choice in Sydney My wife and I and two teenagers recently stayed at this suite hotel for a total of 7 nights. We stayed here for 3 nights and then left to tour other parts of Australia (conveniently leaving several pieces of luggage in storage at Quay West) returning for 4 nights.We were very pleased with our choice. First off, the location is excellent. Very well situated with walking distance to Circular Quay and the main shopping district. Secondly, it was a very convenient choice for a family such as ours. we had a two bed, two bath suite so we avoided having to get two separate rooms. It had a full kitchen, living room and laundry facilities which is great for extended stays and to prepare a simple breakfast. The buffet at the hotel is very nice, but expensive. If you prefer that, at least ask the front desk for vouchers, which reduce the cost from AUD 30 pp to about AUD 21 pp.The very best feature of the suite was our stunning view of the Opera House and Harbour. This alone was worth the price of admission. On the other hand, I'm not sure this is a great choice for a business person trip. Taxis aren't easy to come by, the internet service was down and even when working, not handy, etc. The service was friendly and good, but I would classify this property as a 4 star, not a 5 star. Still, for a family, this is a wonderful choice. ","annotations":[]}
