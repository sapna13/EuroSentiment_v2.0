{"text":"Best Beach We've Seen! We spent the week of Nov. 11- 18th in a Junior Suite within the Royal Club. This is by far the best way to go at this resort.The staff was exceptional, the food above average and the drinks were premium. Outside of the Royal Club the buffets and ala carte restaurants were not even close. We ate once at the Las Reses, and once at the Oriental but didn't like either.Over and over you read how beautiful the beach is, this is so very true, it is the most beautiful we've ever seen!We did the day trip to Saona Island, ($88 ea.). It's a long trip, leaving at 7 am and returning at 7 pm but we highly recommend it. The bus tour to the marina gives you a good view of the towns and way of life of the Dominican people. The 50+ ft. catamaran trip to the island was awash with rum, music and great views. The lunch on the island was above average and the scenery fantastic.Although the resort was undergoing several repairs, it had no impact on our stay. Having the main pool closed for resurfacing may bother some but with their beach and warm ocean, we could care less.The resort is situated within a 10 minute walk to a huge flea market. We ventured to the market for souvenirs but you need to haggle with the vendors on prices. It appeared you could purchase items for less then half of their starting price.The shop vendors get a little tiring after a bit vying to get you into their shops for cheapie cheapie prices, those who have traveled much know what I mean.For those who smoke, cigars are sold everywhere and smoking is tolerated even in the airport.All in all, it was a great time, more then what we expected. Let me emphasize once more...stay at the Royal Club for the best food and close proximity to the beach.
