{"text":"Loved Hampton Inn, Loved New York Stayed at the Hampton Inn Seaport the week of the 4th of July. It is a very nice place to stay at a reasonable price. The rooms are spotless, and I don't think I have ever seen a cleaner bathroom in a hotel. It was spotless!!! The staff was very courteous, always had a smile, and tried to help anyway they could with directions around town. The breakfast was great, with a great staff, cleaning staff wonderful. They had snacks in the afternoon which was nice, always had fruit available, and coffee. And the beds was the most comfortable I had every slept on. I wanted to take it home. And what can I say about New York, IT WAS WONDERFUL. The subway is just down the street, close to Little Italy, Chinatown, and right down the street is the Seaport with shops, places to eat, and things to do. I have always heard that people in New York are rude, BUT I NEVER RAN INTO THAT FIRST PERSON THAT WAS RUDE. I LOVE NEW YORK. I have always been a Yankees fan, and went to my first game at Yankee Stadium. Had a great time, and did all of the tourist things, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, WTC, Times Square. I wish I had time to cover the whole city. I especially loved Little Italy too!! Overall a great reasonable place to stay, good access to everywhere. Would give this place a thumbs up to anyone. Loved everything!!!!!! ONE LAST THING THE FIREWORKS WERE AWESOME!!!!!! THANK YOU HAMPTON INN, AND NEW YORK CITY FOR A GREAT VACATION I WON'T EVERY FORGET!!!!!
