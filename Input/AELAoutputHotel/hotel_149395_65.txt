{"text":"Would not Return We were disappointed at what we saw. The pictures online were totally different. The pictures online are pictures of The Reserve. We were greeted by a Vacation Concierge. The next day we found out what that meant. The day we arrived, we were checked in which was a smooth process, then had to sit in the lobby so the Vacation Concierge can go over a few things with us. Basically to explain how the Restaurants operate. Once that was done, off we went to our rooms. The rooms were okay but definitely not 4, 4 1\/2 or 5 star quality. Vacation Concierge tells you to meet him for a 90 minute presentation about the vacation club. The vacation club is The Reserve which is on the other side and is very nice. The Reserve are the pictures you see online. You have to be a member to stay on this side. We all went at different times and were quoted different prices ($56,000, $38,000, etc.). We did receive a $100 voucher for attending. The Restaurants - that was a joke. If you are a member at the Reserve, you are guaranteed a spot. If not a member, reservations go fast and you are stuck with eating at the buffet spot. Trying to get a good meal was a challenge and very frustrating. Perks and headaches - the first night after returning from dinner, we all received a note (except one couple) to pick up vouchers from the front desk. We all received vouchers for wine, dinner at Gabi (which is a very nice restaurant on the Reserve side), spa for 2 and casino vouchers. So the next morning, the ladies went to the front desk to obtain the same vouchers for the couple who did not receive them. They would not give them to us. I had to get real ugly trying to prove they were a part of our group. Luckily I brought the receipt with everyone's name and amount. Once I provided that, they took it in the back then came out realizing they messed up on our spa vouchers. It appears they are only keeping the Paradisus part open so they can trick folks into coming then try and sell them on the Reserve side. We were with a fun group so we made the best out of it and had a great time.
