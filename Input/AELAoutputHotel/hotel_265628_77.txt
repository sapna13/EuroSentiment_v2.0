{"text":"Excellent Resort for the price Four of us stayed at the Sirenis from April 13th to 20th. The drive to hotel is not bad at all like others have made it to be. There are potholes of course but I have experienced a lot worse here in the Maritimes. Unless you consider yourself a princess then the drive to the resort will be fine.The check in was quick and painless per say. I was surprised when they wanted a $50 deposit for the room safe key on top of the $3\/day rental fee. Keep it in mind when budgeting how much money you will need. My parents got a surprise when they got there. They were upgraded to a suite on the cocotal side which was very nice. It had a sunken jacquzzi tub, two showers, massive size room, bigger patio, and windows everywheres. I got to stick with my one bedroom suite on the tropical side which was very nice but not as nice as theirs. Our room was in the F building on the end which made it a bit bigger than the other suites. We went to a friends room and noticed immediately that our end unit room was bigger. The shower can make a bit of a mess because of the small glass wall instead of a shower curtain. I thought we didn't have hot water but we did, the hot water for the shower only comes on in a certain spot on the water dial.Grounds are amazing. Lots of care taken. Flamingos out front. Two peacocks walk around out front by the shops, be careful because they can scare the crap out of you if you don't see them but all of a sudden hear them. The pool is huge. One end is more quiet on the tropical side. The shallow end on the cocotal side has a bit more action. Chairs have to be reserved early in order to get a good spot with shade. The chair wars will never end i am afraid. Great cocktails. I loved the Miami Vice which is not on the menu but is half pina colada and half strawberry daiquiri. The Sirenis Especiale tastes like an orange creamsicle. The white russians are very good as well. Unless you are an apple vacations customer you don't get beer in the mini fridge only water and pop. Bring your own diet coke if thats what you drink because coke light tastes horrible, no diet coke there.The food was good. I loved the soft ice cream served during lunch by the pool. I brought my own root beer to make root beer floats. The nachos and cheese were good. Loved the mashed potatoes, tasted really creamy. The buffet was the same pretty much as any other buffet at any other resort. Same old, same old, omelette station, rice, fish, beef, pork, potatoes of some sort, fruites, no real salad. We ate at the steak house, japanese, and mexican ala cartes. Liked all three. Loved the Japanese one, best meal I have ever had. I have been to the Himachi restaurant here in Halifax and liked the japanese meal at the Sirenis much better. Had the beef tenderloin at the steak house, order it instead of the striploin and you will thank me. You only get 3 ribs if you order the ribs. The dessert selection is good everywheres at the resort.I brought my laptop because they offer free wireless internet in the lobby. Very good speed. Easy to connect to with a password they give you. I was able to receive emails but was not able to send them for some reason. Hotmail worked fine once I set it up. Kept up on the hockey scores for everyone.Beach is okay but not like Varadero, Cuba. It is fine biege sand. The ocean is rought here but still beautiful. Not good area to snorkel. Did the parasailing for $45 for single or $85 for pair. It was fun a decent amount of time. They take video and pictures to try and sell to you after. Each day some photographers come around the pool area with a monkey or parrots or lizard to get photos with. I beleive the cost was $7 USD. The sports bar was completely empty every day. It has ping pong table and pool tables. It has a bar with a bartender that I am sure is bored to death each evening. Entertainment is pretty good. The MC each night is really funny. Overall I would definately go back to this resort. I loved the set up of the resort. I loved the pool area and the lobby.
