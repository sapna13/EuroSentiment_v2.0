{"text":"Convenience is not cheap - Grocery Store A Hidden Gem The Frankfurt Airport Sheraton has never been a cheap hotel and with the U.S. dollar in the dumps, the price\/value of this hotel quickly follows. It is the only hotel I know of that you can walk from the gates\/terminal. There is no doubt that it is convenient, and if you have an international flight leaving at 8AM or earlier, this hotel does let you sleep a few extra minutes. For those interested in saving a bit of money, there is a fantastic airport grocery store in the basement of Terminal C. The store is called Tegut, and used to be in the basement of Terminal A but just moved from A to C in January 2008. You can find this grocery store by going into Terminal C and going down TWO floors -- one floor below the arrivals floor, and what the signs point to as P for parking. The Grocery Store Tegut is worth the trip if you need food, or staples, or misc items that you may have missed. A compact full service store, it has a full hot deli, cold sandwiches, breads, fruit, salads and drinks...all for a normal cost vs. airport pricing. Buried in the basement of the Frankfurt airport, this hidden gem has saved me a fair bit of money over the years. A bratwurst at 1.90 euros, a 1 liter coke for 0.89 euros and fresh fruit can make a great snack or meal for under 5 euros. Breakfast can be found here as well with yogurt, breads, fruits, muffins, and other items that can save you the cost of a hotel breakfast. If you can't find the store, as any information booth in the Airport and they can direct you.If you are lucky enough to be eligible for the lounge (Platinum Starwood or executive floor room) on the 9th floor, breakfast is well done with lots of selection and eggs cooked to order. Evening fare at the lounge is also excellent, and there is a wide selection of drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic) that are at no charge. I would never recommend that you buy up to the lounge level for the extra fee that Sheraton wants. It's good, but not worth the extra fee. As a Sheraton, this hotel doesn't leave one impressed but it isn't a dump either. In some respects, it is just blah. Nothing to write home about, and what one might expect from a high volume airport hotel -- an expensive airport hotel. Other than the price, this hotel does the job -- it is relatively clean, the staff does a fair job, and it is what one would normally expect from a Sheraton. For those potentially interested in another option, I used to stay at the Airport Steigenberger hotel. The Steigenberger has the only full sized bus as transport between the airport and the hotel giving you some idea as to the volume of business that it does. About 5 minutes away by airport bus, it is not as convenient, and historically has been (sometimes much) less expensive, although the last time I checked, it was about the same price as the Sheraton. Pricing at the Sheraton doesn't seem to vary much, but it does seem to vary at the Steigenberger so it does pay to check.
