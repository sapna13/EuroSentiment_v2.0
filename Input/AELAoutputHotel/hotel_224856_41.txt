{"text":"High standards maintained I stayed here last in 2005 (see earlier review) and I'm pleased to say the hotel has maintained its very high standards. Clean and comfortable throughout, however, the bed appeared a little softer than last time.I had a lake view room and I would suggest that you ask for this if possible, as the view of Beaver and Otter floatplanes on the Lake is superb.I was disappointed to learn that biscuits and gravy now off the breakfast menu - but better still burrito is on the menu instead !! The 24 hour market (a fridge and a shelf with munchies, snacks and drinks) is sensibly priced (compared to extortionate room service in some places) and a welcome innovation. The contributor who wanted wireless internet would have caused me major problems (my company does not allow wireless), so the I-Bahn wired connection was very welcome, easy to use and fast to read my UK emails. Hotel is totally non-smoking, there is a smoking area and bench round the corner from the entrance.I would suggest using a taxi from Sea-Tac airport rather than the Gray Line Airporter shuttle as the driver didn't have a clue at what hotel I should get off and change for the connection to Lake Union even after I bribed (sorry, tipped) him. In the event the bus waited 20mins to on-load a wheelchair passenger at the Sheraton. $34 vs. $12.75 - Taxi !!Great location and super property with very helpful staff, this is the best value place to stay in Seattle and it's always a pleasure to stay here.
