{"text":"The Good - The Bad - The Ugly Just returned from a week at the Catalonia Bavaro Resort. Let me start by saying that everyones feelings about this resort will vary upon what you're looking to do, your personal experiences, etc.That said, when we arrived at the resort we were impressed immediately by how lovely it was. We had a problem with check-in which may vary depending upon time you arrive, etc. There was only my wife and I checking in, and basically it took about half an hour to get checked in. Every time the gentleman processing us tried to do something he kept getting interrupted to do something else.Once we were checked in (nobody offered us a drink or even really welcomed us) we headed off to our room. Like other reviews said, they take your luggage and leave you to find your room on your own. ROOM \/ RESORTThe room was fine to us. Had a nice bathroom with shower and separate bathtub. The room had a refrigerator stocked with water, soda and beer. The balcony had a hammock and a couple of chairs and a table. Spent a lot of time out there enjoying cigars and the warm tropical breeze.The resort is beautiful with more than enough restaurants and bars to keep you fed and your glass full. Anybody who has been to an all inclusive before knows that you're not going to get five star meals, or top shelf alcohol. But, relax, there's a wide variety of food and enough rum and beer (Presidente) to keep most everyone happy.There are four specialty restaurants, try to book these early if you want to. The place to do this is behind the casino heading towards shops. Normally do this in morning and evening. Liked them all but the American...my wife was throughly disgusted by what they tried to pass off as Apple Pie...I liked the sundae though. BEACHBeautiful beach, lots of white sand, some seaweed, but wasn't really a problem. Not sure if it's normal, or just the time of year we were there, but the wind blew constantly on the beach. If you wanted to get a cabana to lie under when the sun was hot, you had to get there early and put a towel, or something to save your place. If you don't want to bother, later in the afternoon you shouldn't have a problem finding a cabana open, or a couple of chairs open to sit on.Read reviews about topless ladies, let me say it's all true. I haven't seen that many topless ladies since....actually, never did see that many before at any other resort.If you're looking for towels, take your card and head to the pool. Go behind the snack bar (where they have delicious pizza and chicken, hot dogs, hamburgers and nachos). They usually open at 8:30 and go to I believe 6:30. Keep this in mind as there are no directions where to get your towels, or what time they're open. DISLIKEDOne thing we were really disappointed about is the location of the resort. If you want to basically stay there, swim, eat, drink and relax this is the place for you. If you want to get away for an hour or two to shop, forget it. Most excursions were pricey (in my opinion) and usually took the best part (if not all) of a day to do. If you want to hit a few little local tourist shops. Walk out to the main gate, take a right and go about a mile or so and you can't miss some. Of course they tell you everything is cheap, cheap, practically free...but try to negotiate a price and you'll usually get it a lot cheaper than the price they first quote you.Every night a show started around 9:30 with something for the kids, then karaoke, then the show which usually wound down after 11 p.m. If you're watching the show, not a problem. If you're trying to sleep (at least where we were) forget it, until the shows over.Overall enjoyed the resort, weather was around 85 during the day and 76 at night. Only rained once or twice, and not an all day rain. If you're looking for a place to just relax, soak up the sun, then stop in at the Catalonia Bavaro Resort, pull up a chair near the pool and enjoy a Coco Loco.
