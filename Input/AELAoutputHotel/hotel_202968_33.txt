{"text":"Strengths and not-so-strong points My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Pierre for five nights after booking a package through Orbitz and reading the reviews of this site. Strengths:1) Location: like they say, centrally located, walking distance to all major Florence sights (and literally three minutes to the Duomo). The street feels safe, even late at night, and was quiet.2) Service: Their staff are extremely helpful and courteous, happy to answer questions and make reservations as needed. The included breakfast is quite good, with a variety of choices (I'm pregnant and my husband is a vegetarian, so that can make things difficult at times). We had no trouble selecting foods that fit our various needs. 3) Air conditioning still functioning!Neutral aspects:I can't call these things weaknesses per se, but details I was not as happy with.1) We booked a double room, and were lead to a room with twin beds. When we requested a queen size bed, we were assured it would be fixed the next day, but then found they had just pushed the two beds together. Not terrible, but not what I expected of a four star hotel (which is how they describe themselves, but I see this site has given them three).2) Our room would have been a large room for a twin bed, but became quite small with the second. 3) Bathroom had a shower stall instead of a tub...and when pounding Florence's pavement\/cobblestoned streets for six days, you're going to get sore feet and legs.4) No view from our window (except into the room of another Pierre guest).5) Not much of an issue, but the two restaurants recommended to us by the hotel (Il Parione and Il Porcellino) were our least favorites of the trip. Il Parione was good, but not great (and expensive for being not great). Il Porcellino is a good restaurant if you want an inventive, innovative spin on traditional dishes, but we wanted traditional Tuscan dishes. Trattoria Zaza, Trattoria Nella (my husband is still dreaming of their eggplant parmigiana), and Trattoria Boboli were our favorite dinners.Overally, I had wanted a nice, relaxing vacation for my husband, so he wouldn't have to worry about anything or feel like we weren't in a safe neighborhood. He was very pleased with our experience there, greatly appreciated the friendly nature of the staff, and I would say those wishes of mine were met. Because of these things, I gave this hotel a four rating here. However, I feel that for the price of the room, details were lacking that would have made for a four star, rather than three star, experience.
