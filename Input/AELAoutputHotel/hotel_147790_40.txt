{"text":"We'll be back This posting can't possibly express my esteem and admiration for what the folks at Hix Island House have put together, but I'll do my best. First off, it is georgeous. The architecture and layout of the place syncs with the stunning natural beauty of Vieques in a way that somehow suggests harmony over and above the obvious luxury. We'll be going back--I don't think we could stay away even if we wanted to.Regarding the service, I'll say this: If you want to feel completely alone, and not be bothered for any reason whatsoever, they'll accomodate you. However, if you need them for anything, they will be there in spades. We unwittingly booked a room on the busiest weekend of the year and couldn't find a rental car or a scooter or even a bike to get around the island. When we realized this might be a problem, we simply called them and I know they tried to track one down for us every day the week prior to our arrival and had pulled off the impossible by the time we landed.When it came time for us to leave the evening of Easter Sunday, a Hix cartaker came to our door two hours before we were to depart and told us our cab driver was getting soused on the beach and wasn't coming. So they drove us to the airport and refused payment!The folks at Hix don't seem to be about taking your money, though I know they're running a business. Instead, it seems that the quality of your experince, of your vacation, is what matters to them. Like I said, we can't wait to go back. ","annotations":[]}
