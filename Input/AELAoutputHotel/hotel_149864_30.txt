{"text":"Great family holiday, but take the mozzie nets Just to add my thoughts to the other reviews here.Travel: we flew Club Med's travel arrangements - Air France via Paris. Their plane was shabby, the cabin service indifferent, the seats uncomfortable. Next time we go somewhere like this we fly a decent airline to Florida, and get a connecting flight down from there.Airport: The airport is pretty, but chaotic. Don't forget your $10 per head tourist tax on arrival (fortunately we didn't). One long queue to pay for it, another queue so someone can take the ticket off you - doh - I just don't get these kind of arrangements! Also try to get a tourist entry document on the plane and pre-fill it, otherwise you join the hundred other people trying to fill it in. Again Air France failed us in this regard. The bored passport guy just stamped everything and I doubt he read anything. Try filling it in with Mickey Mouse or George W Bush, see if they notice.Resort was great - the rooms are a little dated but ours was okay. We were lucky and got a block near reception and kids club, so we didn't have the lots-of-walking issues, but I can understand why others found it an issue - bring a buggy or use a club med one if you have very small kids.Biggest problems: jet lag with a 3 and 4 year old, waking early and half-asleep in the evenings. We missed all the evening entertainments as a result - if we went again we'd fly via Florida and stop there two days to get over the jetlag.Mozzies: despite what others have said here, mozzies were a a big and annoying problem for us. Perhaps they went at better time of year. We were badly bitten on the first two nights despite applying sprays and having a plug-in insect repellant. TAKE MOSQUITO NETS!Also AVOID the toilets behind the main bar at the pool - this is mozzie central 24x7 - even at midday you'll have five or six little friends immediately attack you when you go there for your relief. Club Med needs to install a bug zapper or those curtains.We also found that the landward-side loungers next to the pool were mosquito plagued at about 4pm onward - we always picked the ones on the far side or on the beach.
