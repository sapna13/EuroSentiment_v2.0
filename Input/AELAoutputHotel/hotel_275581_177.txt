{"text":"Superb value Stayed 3 nights Dec 31st to 3rd Jan 2008 and what excellent value for the New Year in London. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly and checking in was a breeze.The room and bathroom was small but not too bad - it had everything we needed. Fridge had real milk and there was a good selction of quality beverages and biscuits. Iron  board and a powerful hairdryer were included as was a decent size safe. Bathroom had White Company goods and they were restocked eacjhday along with large fluffy towels.There was a CD and DVD Player with complimentary use of music and film library.We booked the VIP room which was well worth the small extra fee - we got a basket of fruit on arrival, large bottle of mineral water each day, maid service twice per day, 2 newspapers and best of all 2 vouchers each day of the stay worth √ä√£¬¢9.75 each towards drinks in the Millbank Lounge - we treat ourselves to 2 nice cocktails each night before going out.The public areas were lovely, very modern and spacious. The Millbank Lounge is lit by candles and has great little private booths that you can reserve. We didn't eat at the City Cafe Restaurant but it looked really nice - meals specials at quieter times of the year are about √ä√£¬¢17.50 for 3 courses (not at New Year though).The area is Westminster and short walks bring you to the Lambeth Bridge and Big Ben and Houses of Parliament - its lovely at night and felt quite safe as there were lots of policemen in this area because of security. Two tube stations but nearest is probably Pimlico about a good 5 minutes walk to the hotel but goes direct from Euston Station.You do have to leave immediate area to get to restaurants but there was a lovely Pizza Express on the corner of the City Inn Hotel - more upmarket than most PE I have seen - food was good and the wine is reasonable for London (√ä√£¬¢3 glass) and it had some very good wine on the menu. Staff were excellent too.Two final points - the NY Fireworks were spectacular and well worth a visit, but wrap up warm as you have to get onto the embankment by about 9pm so its a long wait - but atmosphere good and musci palying to keep the crowd happy. if you want food bring your own because there was only one place close selling food and the queues wer a mile long (no hamburger\/hotdog sellers were there). Toilet queues were also long. NY Day has a huge parade which is well worth seeing as well.Avoid Restaurant chain Grand India 1  2 near Trafalar Square - food is awful, staff is even worse. We got ripped off big time and the waiters were like salesmen trying to bump up what you order but were not interested after that.Any queries about London - just ask?
