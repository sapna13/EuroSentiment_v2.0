{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE! Do NOT stay here!!! This hotel is not worth the money! Do NOT STAY HERE! We paid extra for the Royal service which turned out to be the Royal Screw You Service! Very over-rated!! No One understands english and they play everything off that they don't understand what you say so they don't have to accomidate you. Our butler messed up our dinner reservations so bad one night, they almost refused to let us eat in a resturant that wasn't even 25% full. We have to find a manager that spoke english and that took over an hour then we were finally seated to eat! Shouldn't have been such a big deal- the resturant wasn't busy!!Our room in the Royal Service was nice but did see bugs from time to time.We asked for a late check out - (Check out is normally 12 and we wanted to check out at 1) they told us our room was promised to someone else for early check in and we had to be out by 12- funny when we arrived at the hotel originally they told us there was no early check in and then when we want late check out there magically is early check in for someone else. HORRIBLE HOTEL! No where near a 5 star hotel! We are a young couple with money to spend and they treated us like DIRT! I won $50 in the casino and the next morning I wanted them to break the $50 so I could go shopping in the local markets with 1's, 5's and 10's and they gave us the run around- NO ONE WOULD MAKE CHANGE! What kind of hotel doesn't accomidate when we want to spend money! Just blows my mind! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE THINK TWICE ABOUT STAYING HERE- DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE WE DID!
