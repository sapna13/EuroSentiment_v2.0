{"text":"Fantastic  Me and my fiancee victoria went to australia to visit some of her familiy in a small town called Appin located in the suburbs of sydney which was excellent. we also stayed in the holiday inn at darling harbour in the heart of sydney for 2 nights staff and guests alike where very friendly. the rooms where a good size with a fully stocked min bar TV and king size bed.we ate out on both nights by darling harbour nice and romantic for couples with candle lit dinners. there is a ton of restaurants that will cater for everyones tastes whether that be a nice big steak or lobster both which was very nice. its not to expensive either although in coparison to some places in sydney it is with a whole lobster costing $40. A typical meal for two on darling harbour including starter and drinks is a between $80 - $100 after the meal there are plenty of bars and clubs to visit with a glass of wine and a beer costing around $8 which is √ä√£¬¢4, cheap compared to english prices. there is also a casino near by that was very good and intersting.through the day there is loads of stuff to do. if you dont fancy going to far there is an aquarium and martime musem just a short walk from the hotel. if you like to shop there are hundreds of shops and centres to visit. also there are banks such as the hsbc that i used free of charge. if none of that works for you, you can take a ferry to manly and spend the day there it takes about 30 mins on the ferry or take a ferry to sydney zoo ro just take a water taxi around sydney and get an excellent view of the opera house and the harbour bridge as you pass by. two other attractions worth doing but only on a clear day is the harbour bridge walk. Walk over the top of the bridge with a guide the views are amazing, although it is quite expensive costing $180 per person very worth while. The other thing to do is sydney tower again wait until its clear this costs $20 per person but you get a view of the whole city and ona clear day manly and the surronding areas.definatly going again hopefully sooner rather thatn later, brilliant experience.
