{"text":"One of my favorite hotels ever My husband and I just returned from a stay at Hotel 1898. We couldn't have been happier with this hotel, and often had difficulty prying ourselves away from its confines to experience Barcelona. Some of the other reviews I read complained of poor service. We didn't experience anything like this. Everybody we met was extremely friendly and helpful. It wasn't like Four Seasons service where everybody is asking you every thirty seconds if you're okay, but if you express a need, it's seen to immediately.We booked a terrace room which will go down as one of my favorite hotel rooms of all time. We had an enormous private terrace, almost as large as the room, with beautiful plants, two spacious loungers, and a large table. We ate several meals out here and spent a lot of time relaxing. It faced a side street so noise from La Rambla was minimal.The room itself was decorated in black and white with rich wood floors. A\/C was extremely powerful and worked brilliantly. TV was great with many more English channels than most European hotels. Enormous closet with plenty of storage space to unpack completely. Free Wi-Fi. The only complaint we had about the room is that our King bed was quite literally two LARGE single beds. Not bound together in the traditional manner, but actually on rollers and easily separated. This is fairly common in Europe and didn't really bother us. Bathroom was nicely appointed and spotlessly clean. Fresh robes and slippers every day. Nice toiletries and included shaving and dental kits automatically. Mini-bar was a bit sparse, but we stored things that we bought in the Starbucks downstairs in there and they didn't seem to mind.Location-wise, it can't be beat. It's right on Las Ramblas, and a two minute walk to the nearest Metro stop. Restaurants, shops, and conveniences abound. The shopping district is pretty much across the street. La Bocaqueria, the most amazing food market in Europe, is three minutes walk. For a quick fix, there is a Starbucks in the same building as the hotel.Food in the hotel was very good. Definitely above average. Room service was delivered within 20 minutes every time and always hot and delicious. We tried the buffet breakfast and were very pleased with it. Lots of little luxuries like champagne were made available. We ate in the main restaurant one night and LOVED our food. Service was also good, and they let us take our time. We ate on the rooftop restaurant another night and besides the shockingly high price of drinks we had an immensely beautiful dinner. How can you beat the view from the rooftop cafe as the sun sets over all of Barcelona? It was a memorable experience.Pools were fantastic. The rooftop pool was small, but refreshing, and the lounge areas on the rooftop are just too much fun to relax on. We went for a rooftop swim as the sun was going down our last evening in Barcelona, and it was simultaneously fun and romantic. The pool down by the Spa is really fun-looking. The gym was small, but we weren't there to work-out. We didn't try any of the spa services, unfortunately.Overall, we found this hotel to be a really good fit for us. We are relaxed people who don't like to make a fuss, but we also like our luxuries when we're on vacation. This hotel epitomized that relaxed luxury, and combined it with jaw-dropping views and location. If we're lucky enough to go back to Barcelona, we won't dream of staying anywhere else.
