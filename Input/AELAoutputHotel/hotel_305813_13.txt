{"text":"Perfect start to a perfect honeymoon My husband and I stayed at the Langham Place for 2 nights at the start of our honeymoon. We could not have picked a better hotel!From the minute we arrived we felt so well looked after, the staff could not do enough to help us.We upgraded to a Club room which we were so pleased about-the facilities available helped make our stay so enjoyable. Drinks and snacks are available all day and they have champagne available in the evening. We chose to have breakfast in the main restaurant rather than in the Club room due to the huge choice available. There was everything you could imagine-fresh omlettes, hot Asian and Western choices, pastries, loads of fresh exotic fruit, meats, cheeses and loads more including a chocolate fountain! We especially loved the choices of fresh juice too.One of the reasons we loved the hotel so much was due to its location in what felt like 'real' HK-the streets surrounding it are really busy and lively, much different to the financial area which felt very Western. The Ladies Market is only a few streets away and is really interesting to wander round. The underground station is inside the shopping centre that the hotel is attached too which makes travelling around the city really easy.The hotels leisure facilities are also top notch, we used the gym and pool most days to relax and were not dissapointed. The rooftop pool in the evening is particularly lovely.Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone no matter what your reason for being in HK.
