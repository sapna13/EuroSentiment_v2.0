{"text":"It is...what it is..! Alright....I returned earlier in the week from an extended weekend in San Juan, staying at the Diamond Palace. It was a last minute deal through Expedia at $89 a night. (Which is about what you should pay for a room there.) I had been there before so I knew what I was getting into. (If you scroll back to 2005 you can read a rather candid review I gave of the place.) Speaking on my experience only; I had no problems with it the entire weekend. My room was in the north tower on the 4th floor. I had a king size bed and a small balcony with a partial view of the Ocean. True, the room obviously had not been made over in several years, but there was nothing gruesome, like mold or holes in the walls. (Nor was I mauled by roaches or bedbugs.) Check-in was surprisingly smooth. I didn't arrive til nearly 2am thanks to airline delays, but I checked in with them from JFK and kept them posted. When I arrived there was someone at the desk waiting, and I was upstairs rather quickly. All my light fixtures and power outlets worked, as did the TV and remote. Air conditioning was a thermostat, so it wasn't noisy at all and all the settings worked. I also had ample hot water...so all in all there was not much to complain about. If you are a youngish, single traveler looking for a budget place to crash for a weekend; I would say it's adequate..depending on the price. (I wouldn't spend over $100 a night for it though.) However..if this is your dream vacation; a family affair, or if you are the type of traveler who spends a lot of time within the hotel...this is probably not the place for you.
