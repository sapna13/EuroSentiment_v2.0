{"text":"1 star service for 5 star price never again The hotel lobby is aesthetically pleasing and thats the only good thing i can say about the hotel .I had booked my room well in advanced and when we arrived they were overbooked and i couldnt get the room that i booked,I had to settle for another room which they called and upgrade, It seemed like a down grade to me. It took me 5 times to complain to front desk to have the phone in my room fixed it was out of order when i finally got to actually get into the room almost 2 hours after check in time. The hotel has several beautiful pools and lounge chairs but people wake up at 6 am and place beach towels on the lounge chairs and hold onto the chairs all day and barely sit in them but nobody else can use them because they have their personnel belongings on them ,The hotel should not allow that. The pool bar does not have enough employees, it takes 4 ever to get someone to give you a menu and then the person is so overwhelmed they act like your bothering them .The pool bars close way to early and check in is way to late 4pm ,and on top of that we had to wait almost 2 hours after check in to get our room During my stay of 6 days 7 nights every time i went past the front desk in the main lobby there was always a line of people waiting and half the line was there to complain about something ,which after my first day and so far bad experience did not surprise me. I will never again stay at this hotel, not even if they paid me to stay there!!!! If your looking for a nice hotel 4 stars great service and no overcrowding RINCON OF THE SEAS GRAND CARIBBEAN HOTEL in rincon northwest side of the island . You can even get rice and beans at their hotel restaurant. You go to puerto rico to experience the latin experience and SAN JUAN has turned so commerical and tourist ridden you cant find traditional puertorrican cuisine maybe in only 2 restaurants in OLD SAN JUAN, but donot hold your breath about finding it in the EL SAN JUAN HOTEL  CASINO .Read my review and take my advice because im not a picky person but i have stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world and ive never been this dissapointed.
