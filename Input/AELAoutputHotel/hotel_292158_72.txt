{"text":"Not impressed one bit! I've been to many resorts all over the Caribbean and this by far was the most interesting. Being American, I've never felt unappreciated when traveling but I definitely did at the Grand Palladium. From the very beginning, I was a little leary but nonetheless optimistic; having read many of the reviews here but the scenery from the airport to the resort honestly...had me nervous. It was hard to imagine that an upscale resort would be smack in the middle of what looked like a war-stricken city. But low and behold after a 25 minute ride we arrived.The check-in process was extremely quick and easy and the desk staff all spoke English very well. But apparently...they were the only ones. Although I knew the native languare was Spanish, I guess I just expected too much. ROOMS: Our travel agent had already told us to bring air freshener because the rooms at the Grand Palladium were known to have a slight odor when you first open the door because of the high humidity and the type of HVAC system the resort had. Well slight odor was an understatement. The room smelled like sweatsocks and although it did dissipate after using Lysol, candles and buring insence; it never completely went away. I don't know about anyone else, but I don't want to spend the kind of money we did per night ever again and have to contend with sleeping in what smelled like an old gym. The other thing that really burned me was that everyday our room was cleaned, the housekeeping staff never left face cloths. So every evening we had to go through 3,4 sometimes 5 different people to get someone to understand what exactly we needed. After a long hot day in the sun, it was rather irritating to have to wait up to 90 minutes to be able to shower because we had to wait for someone to bring clean face cloths. By the third day, we just hid the used ones in our luggage so they wouldn't take them when they cleaned. The bathrooms in the rooms were a little yucky as well. I'm not sure if it was the color of the marble in the shower stall that made it seem dirty and mildewyor what but even after housekeeping was in there was no smell of disinfectant or anything so you didn't know if it had really been cleaned or not.BEACH: I was really bothered by the annoying, over aggressive vultures trying to sell you things on the beach. I was there to relax. If I was interested in shopping I would have gone to visit the shops at the other end of the beach. I really think there is something more that the management of the resort can do to prevent this on their section of beach and I strongly recommend that they do. FOOD: We ate in every restaurant at the resort while we were there...all 11; and although good, I would not say they were 5 NOT 5 star . The Behique was the better location for lunch with great service and smiling wait staff. Cantina Mariachi and Bamboo were the better a la carte restaurants for dinner. El Quijote wasn't bad either. Arrecife has a wonderful t-bone steak but you'd better not ask for it well-done because it just won't happen. Mare Nostrum's sauces were rather watery and the salad bar was skimpy. The Royal Gourmet and La Uva were very loud, stifling hot and the service was very slow.SHOWS: The acoutics in the amphitheaters was poor so it made it very difficult to understand what was being said, particularly when the emcee spoke in several different languages rapid fire. But the actual shows were awesome each night!POOLS: The pools needed to be emptied, cleaned and rechlorinated; especially the ones with swim up bars. There were straws and empty cups floating in the one near Behique each time we visited. EXCURSIONS: We booked our excursions through Apple Vacations. The ATV riding was a lot of fun and well worth the $85. The ride to the meeting spot was rather long and exciting, but the ride along the beach front was great! Manati Park was a bust though. Not worth $10 let alone $30. It billed as a tropical zoo...but it it's a 1\/4 acre dirt pad with 20 animals in the middle of nowhere with overpriced photographs and food. Overall, the Grand Palladium is overpriced because the little annoyances just added upt too quickly. I would visit the island again, but not this particular resort.
