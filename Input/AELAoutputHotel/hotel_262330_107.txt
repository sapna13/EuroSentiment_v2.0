{"text":"very good choice I and my partner stayed at the Hilton for four nights for a long weekend in New York. The hotel is in the downtown area but easily accessible with public transport and a taxi ride to midtown is about $ 17. We arrived after a transatlantic flight in the evening and were immediately whisked in with the luggage all taken care of. The receptionist (Angie I think her name was) was extremely helpful as our request were a smoking room and a high floor. She excelled at this and we were given a fantastic room on the 54th floor overlooking ground zero and the Brooklyn Bridge. The room was exceptionally large by New York standards and had all the amnesties you could wish for: good internet connection (for a very reasonable $12\/day), LCD TV, mini bar, large bathroom and excellent bed. The service overall was very efficient and friendly. The concierge helped us making restaurant reservations and taxis were flagged down very quickly.The only downside of the stay was the varying service in the bar next to the lobby. The prices for the very same drink orders seem to vary between staff and at one point the bar tender refused to allow us to take the drinks upstairs (his explanation was that they were short of that particular style of glasses, well then order some more).There are limited choices in the area for good food, but we tried Les Halles on 15 John St which was a good basic choice, 2 minutes from the hotel. Other than that you may have to travel a bit to get high quality restaurants. We loved Lever House Restaurant on 390Park Avenue.I can highly recommend the Millenium Hilton (even if the spelling annoys me) and considering the normally ridiculous room rates in New York the Hilton is definitely a bargain.
