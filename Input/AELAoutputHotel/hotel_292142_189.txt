{"text":"Nice BIG rooms We've just arrived back from a short trip to NY and stayed 3 nights at the Affinia Dumont.We selected the hotel based purely on TripAdvisor reviews and have not been let down. The location is very good (Lexington and 34th) so everything is quite close by and check in was painless (although it did look a little busy in the morning). We had 2 studio rooms (one with king bed and one with two queens) and the rooms were huge in comparison to a typical NY hotel. To my surprise they also had a fully functional kitchen which was great if you want to eat in for breakfast\/dinner.Admittedly the rooms did look a little dated (regualr TV vs plasma and a typical 'hotel' style carpet) but they were clean, the beds were very comfortable and there's a choice of 6 pillows! You even got mouthwash in the bathroom which was a first for me and a must after a big night out. Saying that if you are looking for a hotel with a wow factor I wouldn't say this is the one for you.The Affinia is billed as a fitness style hotel and I was able to order my yoga and running pack for working out. I believe you can get a free training session from monday to friday but I couldn't as it was the weekend. One word of advice- the hotel was listed as sold out on expedia so I called and booked direct and got a good rate.All in all a nice stay- I'd go back for sure. ","annotations":[]}
