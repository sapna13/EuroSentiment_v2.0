{"text":"Overrated and overpriced The Frankfurt Sheraton is so close to the terminal, a few yards along a walkway and down an escalator. and you are there, for this alone I am awarding the hotel a 3 stars, it was great for us as we were travelling with a lot of luggage and it avoided all the hassle of shuttle buses etc, but that is much the only positive thing to say about the hotel.For a standard price of √à√\u2020√ü?75 we got no breakfast and everything else was very expensive.Spotting the way in to the hotel in a car is nigh on impossible as the signage is non existent. We went round the ring road twice and then still missed the entrance to the hotel. Reception is very hard to spot, luckily a guy is on hand to help out. The barrier on the car park only lifts if the car is on one particular spot, minor inconveniences but can be irritating for tired travellers. The worlds friendliest bell boy carried our luggage up to our room and there and then arranged for his friend (another bell boy) to pick up our luggage the following day and help us into the terminal with it.I was reluctant to pay the √à√\u2020√ü? an hour internet charges as we had just been in a different hotel for a week with no charges, we are now in another hotel for a week with also no charges.Tired and hungry with no lunch we headed for the only restaurant serving at 5.30, and paid √à√\u2020√ü?20 for a dinner with no starters, no desserts, no coffee and no wine can you believe it!We had 2 steaks and a salad between us, a bottle of water and 2 gin and tonics, I am absolutely disgusted at the prices these hotels charge, you might say well you saw the prices, but actually we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ, the head waiter prior to giving us our menus said can I offer you a glass of wine or a gin and tonic. Little did we realise they were √à√\u2020√ü?5 each!!!! You can buy a bottle of gin for that. The food was generally OK but the staff took to using a small mechanical carpet sweeper every 2 minutes around our table as the restaurant was quiet. This was very irritating and spoilt a nice relaxing hour. This hotel is well geared up for expense accounts for the business traveller but for the holiday maker this hotel is much too expensive for what you get, all together it took over √à√\u2020√ü?00 out of our holiday allowance for one meal and a bed for the night√à√\u2020\u2022?what a total rip off.Save your money and make a pack up and eat it in your room if you decide to stay here for the convenience, or go into the airport 2 minutes away and don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get robbed.To add insult to injury the next day the bell boy turned up, picked up our luggage on the trolley walked with my husband the 200\/300 yards to the check in desk, unloaded it all and when given √à√\u2020√ü?0 by my husband rolled his eyes back in his head as if to say is that all and sulked off. My husband was furious.Not a hugely pleasant experience for our √à√\u2020√ü?00 but nevertheless we needed it for convenience and probably for that reason alone would use it again as Im sure 95% of its clientele do, its not somewhere I would choose to stay and having lived in Germany for the last 2 years not typical of the value for money living we have come to enjoy.
