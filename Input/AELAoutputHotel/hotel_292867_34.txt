{"text":"overall holiday was good We stayed in the resort from 28th april - 12th May 2008Overall the holiday was very good.The staff are very sincerly freindly, and very accommodating, especially in the bars and restaurants.I travelled from England with my wife and her parents and we all agreed that the resort had something for everybody.There are three pools of which one has a pool bar and is very lively, the other two are quiet so are idael for children or older people who require some peace and quiet to relax.The hotel caters for mulicultural tourists and we befriended quite a few people of which were mostly American and Canadian.There were a very small minority of ignorant guests but you get that in every hotel that you stay in no matter where you are.The beach is picture postcard quality, i would go as far to say that is the best beach i have ever seen.However there was an issue with the food,All the English (and others) i spoke to, all complained of stomach problems , which affected all four of us at some point in the two weeks we were there.I have to say that we found the alternative restraunts dissapointing ie chinese, mexican although the Italian was proberbly the best of a bad bunch.If you want a relaxing holiday with sunand sea then this is definately the place for you, but if you want to go on trips then i wouldnt recommend this resort.I dont think i would recomend this hotel to any of my freinds because in my opinion a jamaican 4 star hotel is a lot better than the caribe princess which is a 4 star+.
