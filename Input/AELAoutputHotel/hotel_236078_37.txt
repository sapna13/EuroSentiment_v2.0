{"text":"You can't go wrong! One of the best features of Seven Bridges is its location. Within about two blocks, you can find anything you need, from restaurants, to tram stops, to coffeeshops. It's especially nice for first-time visitors who will be roaming all over the city and need a centrally-located home base that's easy to get to from any of the main sights.The owners are very sweet and attentive. The complimentary breakfast (brought up to your room!) is wonderful, with juice, coffee, tea, meat, cheese, fruit, yogurt, and a variety of breads. We could never finish the whole thing, so we usually saved the bananas for eating while out exploring later in the day.The cleaning service was always great. Even the bathmat was changed daily, with a different color every day! Little touches like this made it clear that the owners really cared about what they were doing, adding to the overall charm of the place.The free wireless internet was a blessing. It was great being able to spend downtime over breakfast and before bed keeping in touch with friends and family and searching the internet for information about the next day's adventures in Amsterdam.We stayed five nights in room 10, the Garden Room, which was incredibly quiet. We were amazed at just how peaceful the room was. Even during Holland's string of wins in Euro 2008, with excited football fans in local bars just a block or two away, we were never disturbed. Some of the canal-view rooms might be a bit noisier just because they overlook the street, but the street always seemed very quiet, so noise is certainly not a problem in the hotel, and especially not in the Garden Room.The room itself was small, but not uncomfortably so. It's perfectly-sized for a single or couple who don't plan on spending all day in the room (which you shouldn't be doing in Amsterdam anyway!). There is a little nook for doing work out of sight of the bed, which came in very handy when one of us wanted to sleep while the other needed to use the computer.The only negatives are incredibly minor. The breakfast table in the room was too small for the huge breakfast, but using the bed as extra table space worked fine. As others have noted, and as is true for many hotels in Amsterdam, the staircase is very small and tightly spiraled. You will have a lot of difficulty if you bring bulky or heavy bags. Pack light, and you'll be much happier, both in this hotel and in general.Overall, this is a great hotel, well worth the expense. You won't regret staying here, and you'll want to stay again on your next visit.
