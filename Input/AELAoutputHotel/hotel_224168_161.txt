{"text":"Fun Hollywood hotel The Renaissance Hollywood Hotel is an excellent place to stay. I was there for 4 nights last week. It is not a sparkling new hotel, but is very clean  comfortable and the art-deco touches are nice. The service was top notch. My only real gripe would be the price of valet parking ($29) - don't do it! Just park in the parking garage attached to the hotel - it's only $10. That's where the valets take your car anyways. The Hollywood  Highland complex at the hotel was great to walk around - it was nice to be so close to places to eat and shop. And it's great that it's an outdoor complex b\/c you can walk around and enjoy the weather. Even more fun is the fact that you are right outside the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The best feature of the hotel for me though was all of the history associated with it - I have a couple friends who live in LA who filled me in on several events throughout the year that take place there (events for the Oscars, Grammy's etc.). I had room service for breakfast 2 mornings - the lemon souffle pancakes and the cinnamon roll french toast were tastey. The prices were what you would usually pay for room service - about $15 total. There is a French crepe eatery in the Highland complex that my friends and I went to the other 2 mornings, and that was great. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this hotel. It's expensive, but any nice hotel in LA is going to be pricey.
