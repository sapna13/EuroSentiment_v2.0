{"text":"Fantastic I stayed at Excellence Punta Cana for part of February vacation, and now I realize that five days isn't enough. The resort was fantastic. It was very clean, the staff was friendly, and the drinks were plentiful. I highly recommend the coco loco, which is served in a coconut. Overall, the food was good, and I consider myself to be a picky eater. The lobster place was my favorite. I spent most of my time sitting by the pool (the ocean was a bit rough for my taste) or lounging around inside if it was raining. I didn't take advantage of the horseback riding or the bike tour, but I heard that both were fun. I do recommend leaving the property and going out into the plaza if you have time. The shops had some fun souvenirs, and you can haggle with the vendors, which was a lot of fun. The only downside to leaving the property is that you have to take a taxi, which cost $35 each way. You do get a better idea of what the country is like from the taxi ride, though.My only complaint would be that there wasn't much of a night life. The Michael Jackson show was the best show that they had. The disco was fun, especially because there was staff on hand to get everyone dancing (you could take dance lessons in the afternoons). Also, I went on vacation with a friend, and when we arrived, it was obvious that this resort catered mainly to couples, which is not how it was advertized on the website. We had a hard time getting a room with two beds, but Nicolas was extremely helpful in the situation. Emilio, the concierge, was also friendly and informative, and of the entertainment crew, Isael was the best. ","annotations":[]}
