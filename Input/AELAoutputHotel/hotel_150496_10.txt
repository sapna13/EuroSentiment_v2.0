{"text":"Mold\/water leak in room, would try another hotel.... We choose this hotel when booking a cruise through our travel agent. We flew into SanJuan a day early expecting to have a great weekend and enjoy SanJuan prior to boarding our ship. However, we had much disappointment!CHECK IN\/ROOM:As for the hotel, check-in was very slow, our room was not ready, so went walked around the city for a bit. After a few hours, they notified us that we could check in. Upon arrival to the room, we noticed a terrible smell along with black mold growing on the ceiling and one of the walls was saturated with water, I'm guessing there was a leak somewhere. Now, to give the hotel some credit, it is VERY HUMID in SanJuan and therefore, the mold\/moisture issue is not all their fault. BUT, I called the front desk to complain and was told all of the rooms are full. So, I then requested a discount or refund as the room was seriously in bad shape. They told me that since I PREPAID for the room, I could not be discounted or refunded, Go figure, you pay as instructed and then are punished. Then, I continue to ask to speak with management and they state, there is not management on the weekend, interesting. At this point, I was calling the 1-800-sheraton phone# found in our room to complain, when the conceierge showed up and noticed we were unhappy, he was the ONLY person that went out of his way to make our stay more enjoyable. He quickly noticed how bad the room was and called downstairs immediately and got us a new room, which was ready in 10 minutes. As for our 2nd room, it was better, no mold\/water, but still not great, it was fine for the night, but thats about all I could have handled. It was still very humid and damp in the room, once again, due to the weather and not the hotels fault, but I dont think the A\/C could keep up w\/the humidity. LOCATION:It is very convenient to the pier if choosing this hotel for a cruise. And it is a great location in Old San Juan, walkding distance to the Forts, etc. HOTEL FOOD:We ate at a Burger place in the hotel which was actually pretty good, would recommend it, if you are in the mood for a burger\/fries, etc. We also had breakfast at the restraunt in the hotel and the food was average for a breakfast buffet, not terrible and not great, but definately edible!CASINO:We only used for about 15 minutes. It was a pretty nice casino, and lots of people in there, but we didn't use this facility much.OVERALL:Would not return to this hotel as the rooms need some updating and the staff was not helpful. Good luck.....we spoke with tons of other people that stayed in New San Juan prior to departure, and their experiences sounded much better and the location was still not very far from the ship's port! Oh yea, everything in San Juan is VERY EXPENSIVE!! So bring your $$!
