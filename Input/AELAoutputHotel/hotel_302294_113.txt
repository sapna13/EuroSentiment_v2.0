{"text":"Staff were on a totally different planet! My husband and I stayed in the Pan Pacific, Singapore for 1 night over the weekend to get away from everyone. I made the reservation online for the 'Restful Weekends' package the hotel is offering online. We stayed at room 29-13.I wanted to change some details and hence called the hotel for help. Bad idea because they didn't know about the package I booked and kept asking if I got the right hotel. After an exasperating 15 minutes on the phone to the hotel trying to explain that I booked through the online reservation form, I managed to resolve my issue through the hotel's website online without the phone staff's help.On the day when we checked in, we were informed that our reservation was cancelled, somehow, in a rather impolite manner. My husband is English and can't speak Mandarin. The hotel check-in staff started speaking to each other in Mandarin, totally disregarding my husband. I thought it was rather inconsiderate and that staff from a 5-star hotel in a MULTI-RACIAL country would be aware of such sensitivity. That's not all! After the hotel kindly reinstate our reservation, we found that they were not aware of what our package comes with. We had to remind the hotel staff and this happened all throughout our stay there. The only good thing was they upgraded our room from a Paranomic room to a Paranomic Balacony room. The room - it was typical of a 5-stars hotel with good amenities and comfy bed. Bathroom was sparkling clean but the shower was most difficult to figure out! We spent 10 minutes trying to read the instructions given! The balcony was the most boring and ugly balcony I have seen from all hotels. The view was good; excellent view of Singapore's skyline, particularly breath-taking at night. Room service was fast and efficient. Food was nice and the serving was big enough for us. At check-out, we were billed for things that were supposedly free (and came as part of the package). When we pointed them out to the check-out staff, she counter-offered her opinion to us forcefully (this was putting it very nicely!). In the end, we were made to feel that the hotel was doing us a goodwill by waiving all the charges even though the reservation printout we had stated otherwise. Generally, the hotel delivered. The staff did not. We felt that the staff were ill-informed and impolite.
