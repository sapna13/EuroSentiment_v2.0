{"text":"Great Beach! This was our third time staying at a Bahia Principe resort (we were a group of 7) - the first time in Punta Cana and we were not disappointed. We stayed at the Bavaro - Premier Club from April 19th to the 26th. Overall the weather was good - even when it was cloudy it was still nice and warm. This resort is huge - which may scare some people off but there is a great trolley system that runs all of the time - which was needed as we were travelling with two grandmas. At first we were disappointed to find that we were so far from the beach - a good 12 minute walk - however, we soon learned that our nice amenities in the Premier Club were a blessing. We spent some time at the main pool - but found it extremely busy....even our kids who are teenagers preferred the pool in the Premier section. (which was the blessing part) We also had our own Reception Club, buffet and snack bar - we appreciated being away from the crowds. The beach is AMAZING! We would walk from our resort in either direction for 30 minutes and still have lot's of beach to cover. The beach was clean and the water was also clean and clear....very little seaweed if any! It could get busy - one had to get there early to get chairs if it was really sunny out! Lot's of selection on the food and I would recommend trying the Chocolate monkey at the Premier club swim up bar. We had a slight problem with the flooding of our rooms late one afternoon - unusually hard rain for a couple of hours and we were on the main floor of our villa. We were quickly given new rooms and management had engineers coming in to rectify the problem to eliminate any future occurrences. We would definitely go back and would defintely recommend this resort to others.
