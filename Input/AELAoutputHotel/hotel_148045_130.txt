{"text":"Overpriced, Underserviced. Think Twice With Young Kids Stayed at the El Conquistador over the school winter break which is, admittedly, a very busy time to travel. We booked late. First off the positive: Our room (Las Brisas) was beautiful. Recently renovated, tasteful in a boutique hotel style and was quite spacious. The bed very comfortable. Our view was magnificent. Endless vista of the Caribbean Sea. The waterpark which opened 2 weeks ago was an absolute blast for all of us and at $12 for adults, $9 for kids, the biggest bargain.Now the flip side. We didn't know much about the resort and also didn't realize how spread out and large it is. We have young children, aged 3 and 5 so convenience is a premium for us. We were near the pool area and a number of restaurants, but there is no beach at the hotel. You need to take a fanicula down a cliff, then a catamaran to the beach on Palomino Island (which is beautiful). The boat leaves every 1\/2 hour, and though very punctual, if you forget something you can't just run back to your room to get it. My youngest got tired and wanted to go back to the room to rest. He had to wait a total of 45 minutes to get there. Around 4pm people start leaving the beach so the lines back can be long. Overall, expect a lot of standing in line to get places and a good bit of waiting in general. So if convenience is a premium, this is not the place for you.SERVICE: Mediocre at best. We needed a rollaway bed. After 2 days of calls we finally got one (don't even ask how long it took to get a blanket to go with it!). Most hotels, especially nice ones , provide you with moisturizer, cotton balls and Qtips. After 3 calls to housekeeping I finally gave up trying to get them. Lastly, we had to call twice to request robes (also something you expect at nice hotels). FOOD: Mediocre to awful. Completely overpriced. No matter where you go, from the burger hut at the beach to finer dining. Lunch was always $50, dinner near and over $100. And the service, terrible--the pace glacial no matter where you are which is a nightmare when you are with tired children at the end of the day. At one lunch my husband and I ordered the exact same thing and when 2 different meals showed up the waiter looked at his order form and insisted we were the ones who were wrong! Didn't even apologize or offer to fix it.The pool is also too cold.My final comment is that this is a 4 star resort with 5 star prices and 2 star service. The owners\/management (I hope they're reading) could really learn a thing or two from the folks at the Ritz Carlton, where we'll be returning next vacation. (The one in Montego Bay is fantastic!) I'll plan ahead next time.
