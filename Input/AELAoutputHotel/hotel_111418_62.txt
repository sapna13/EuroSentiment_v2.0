{"text":"Great Hotel I paid a fraction of the standard room price by booking through Priceline.Boston Park Plaza is the only hotel 3* that they have in the Boston Common area, so there was no risk of getting something that I didn't want when bidding through the website.I was a little concerned when reading other Trip Advisor reviews that mentioned budget rooms, that were of a lower standard but thankfully I have no complaints.The hotel has been refurbished and the three rooms that we booked were all of a very good standard.The hotel was better than some 4* hotels that I have stayed in but I assume the lack of bathrobes and sily things like that are the elements that keep it at a 3*.The bed and pillows were the best that I have ever slept on and provided the best nights sleep I have ever managed on a jetlagged first night in the U.S. and for that alone, I would return.There is nearby garage parking on the same block as the hotel and cheaper than using the valet parking and about 6 options in terms of food and drink, including a Starbucks in the hotel.We had dinner in the Bonfire Steakhouse restaurant that adjoins the hotel. Food and atmosphere was good. $ rate meant that it was pretty reasonable for UK visitors.Even better.... it was within crawling distance to our rooms.Staff were friendly and attentive.Overall a great hotel and I would recommend it to anyone and would stay again when returning to Boston ","annotations":[{"endOffset":103,"mention":"Park Plaza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_Park_Plaza_Hotel_&_Towers","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hyatt_Toronto"],"startOffset":93},{"endOffset":153,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":147},{"endOffset":153,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":147}]}
