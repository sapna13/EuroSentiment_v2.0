{"text":"Stylish Hotel with good service but some oddities The Conrad Miami is located in a spectacular building. The outside of the building was in real bad shape because of Hurricane damage but it was being repaired while we were there. There were a lot of windows blown out and I understand all the windows have to be redone--a major undertaking. Don't let that bother you because inside the hotel is beautiful. From the moment you walk in there are fresh flowers in very modern arrangements. They were changed two times while we were there. A door person holds the door and welcomes you, and people at the downstairs lobby are friendly as well. Here is the awkward thing: You entire on the ground level and take an elevator to upper level floor (don't remember what #); that is the lobby. I guess this must be a Conrad thing because the Chicago Conrad was the same. It does make you feel safe and secure in the hotel. The odd thing is you then take another elevator around the bend down to your room. The lobby has a spectacular view and a great restaurant for breakfast. The staff at the restaurant is exceptional; the food is good! The pool area is small but nicely designed with little cabanas and comfortable chairs. There is also a tennis court on that floor. This area was never very busy, which might be explained by another awkward thing in the design of the building. To get to the pool area from your room you have to: (1) take an elevator UP to the lobby, then (2) take an elevator DOWN to the ground floor, then (3) exit the building, (4) cross the drive, (5) enter the parking lot building, (6) take another slow elevator UP to the roof top, and then (7) you made it! Just make sure you take everything you need when you get to the pool because it is a long haul back to the room! I don't know what the architect was thinking when he\/she designed that. It is completely absurd and inconvenient. Despite these peculiarities, which might be an inconvenience for the elderly or handicapped, the hotel room is beautifully appointed, the bathrooms are amazing, the toiletries (Molton Brown) are wonderful, and the bed linens are a dream. The bed was turned down each night and a tray of water, and chocolates were left on the bed. Another nice touch was that the ice bucket was filled every night. If I were staying around the downtown or Brickell areas I would certainly choose the Conrad. However, if you are wanting to hang out on South Beach or Coconut Grove, I'd say stay elsewhere.
