{"text":"Loved the Mandarin Oriental, Singapore I am writing to inform you all of the wonders of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Singapore. We found the experience to be one of sheer luxury. I would urge anyone contemplating a stay in Singapore to seriously consider this option out of the many, many available to choose from. In terms of value for money ...it was a hit. We booked early and directly with the hotel and secured a great rate of around $300 AUD per night for 2 adults and 1 child with breakfast included. Fantastic, given the excellent standard and quality of the hotel. As a bonus, the roll out bed was free of extra charge; a rarity for the other Singapore hotels that I had checked out. My husband has worked in a global role out of London but based in Sydney for the last 10 years. As a consequence of this, he has spent much of that time travelling the world. I have been very fortunate to be able to join him on many trips and have experienced many 5 ~ 6 star hotels. I would have to say that the Mandarin Oriental ranks most highly. We found the attention to detail across all aspects of service provision to be excellent. The most notable point was the friendly and courteous attitude of all staff; from the staff who handled my initial e-mail enquiries to the Concierge and dining staff and right down to the pool and gym staff. They all expressed good cheer and humour and genuinely appeared to love their work and to be committed to making the hotel function at optimum performance. We were also greatly impressed by the size of our room (we were upgraded to a Junior Suite), the quality of inclusions and the care taken to clean the room, attend to 'turn down' of an evening and to replenish bathroom items. The latter point may seem a minor one but, can lead to irritation if unattended! Similarly we were very impressed with fit out of the gym, the hotel landscaping, the pool and its surroundings. I walked over to check out the Fullerton which, in my opinion, pales in comparison to this hotel. In terms of children, this would definitely be your choice of hotel in Singapore as: the pool was huge and surrounding area was great, you are away from the intense hustle of Orchard Rd, there are great cheap-eating Hawker food markets across the road and beautiful, riverside plu other walks in all directions from the hotel. There is a greater sense of space in and around this hotel compared the Fullerton and Orchard Rd hotels that would appeal to anyone with kids. Anyway, taxis are so cheap that all venues are easily and cheaply accessible. I have already recommended your hotel to my friends who travel and our friends based in Singapore who we were visiting. The Mandarin Oriental would be a definite choice for our preferred accommodation if we ever to choose to stay in Singapore again!
