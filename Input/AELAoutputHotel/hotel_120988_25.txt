{"text":"Very Good Hotel A trip to Boston for the 4th July fireworks meant a chance to spend a night in one of my most frequented hotels, the Hilton at Boston Logan Airport.For convenience this hotel is hard to beat. Whilst not in the downtown area, for business travellers, or those with early or late flights, you cannot beat the location. Physically connected to Terminals A and E, the hotel also offers a courtesy shuttle, which also drops and picks up at the T subway station for the city.I used Hilton's online check in system so I knew I had an upgraded room. Arriving at check in there was a lengthy line, but the Hhonors line was clear so I joined that, only to be consistently ignored by staff and barged out of the way by non-Hhonors members. I got zero benefit from using online check in or the Hhonors priority line, so I have to ask what the benefit of these services are if a hotel ignores them...But that was the only flaw with the stay. The rooms in the Hilton are nice. All have views, some of the airport which is surprisingly interesting, and on this occasion for, a view across the airport to the city sklyine. A great vantage point for the firework display, enhanced by the presence of the Queen Mary 2 in the harbour.Rooms are clean, bathrooms good, and the new flatscreen TV's are very good. My only criticism with the room is that they appear to have removed the mini-bars. Wifi internet access is available, and seems quick and stable. The exec lounge is good, offers a reasonable conteninental breakfast and again has superb views over the harbour.Check out was painless, the bill accurate and every member of staff I met courteous and polite. I would have rated at 5 stars if not for the check in experience.
