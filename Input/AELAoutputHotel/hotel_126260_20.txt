{"text":"Love the Palace! Just returned from a weekend trip to NYC to see the Christmas Spectacular at Radio City. We chose the Palace for our one night stay. You cannot get better than this! When we arrived the staff was so friendly, even making a big deal over my daughter who is 8. We had booked an American Girl package and she received the cutest little pink bed, pillow and blanket that she could take home. We even purchased an extra for a friend of hers! When we called to ask for one, housekeeping brought it up in an American Girl Place bag within 10 minutes of our request. Our room was on the 23rd floor, with a beautiful view of St. Patrick's. We were just a couple of blocks from Radio City, Rockefeller Center and American Girl Place so we could walk and shop and sightsee all we wanted. The staff was amazing, and the room was beautiful! Gosh were the beds comfortable! The room was large, with a large LCD TV, control panel by the bed for heat,air, lights, etc, and any request we had was taken care of immediately with such positive, friendly attitudes! A special thanks to Britan - who checked us in, and made my daughter feel like a princess! We left our luggage at the Bell Desk, and called ahead about 20 minutes to let them know we were coming and our luggage and car were waiting for us. The courtyard is beautiful, and the grand staircase........Thank you New York Palace for a trip to NYC we will never forget! We will definitely stay at the Palace when we return to NYC!
