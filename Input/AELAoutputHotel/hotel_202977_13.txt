{"text":"Reasonable but nothing special. My wife and I stayed at the Adriatico for five nights in early April. We flew into Pisa airport and travelled by bus from the airport to Florence. The bus drop off, by Florence rail station, was a fairly easy walk of about a six or seven minutes from the hotel. Not particularly impressed at first. The road was pleasantly busy with lots of bustle and noise, cafes, small shops, car hire places, groups at tables on the pavement, etc......... and then someone tried unsuccessfully to pick my pocket as we towed our cases along the pavement outside the hotel's main entrance - which happened to be closed off because of building work. However, nothing too disastrous, could happen anywhere we thought as we wandered round to the back entrance. Reception staff in particular and others were charming both on arrival and throughout the week. The breakfasts were good with plenty of variety, nice lounge area, bar (but watch the prices of drinks), bedroom and bathroom very clean and modern, comfortable beds, internet access available, flat screen TV, tea and coffee maker in room (we had to ask though) and a reasonable view across the roof tops towards San Lorenzo, Fiesolo and the hills.There were several very acceptable places to eat nearby (Il Profeta was good and convenient), the Arno was about two minutes walk and the main sites were ten to fifteen minutes easy walk away.For a superior double the room was bit small... even for Italy. We looked at another superior double on the next floor but it was about the same. The one big problem was that the air conditioning couldn't be adjusted as the hotel told us it was all centrally controlled. So we had to put up with a very warm room or open the window at night to let some air in - but that meant that the noise from the bars and traffic was a bit too much .... we tended to have the heat rather than the noise.Apart from the air conditioning problem which presumably was just a temporary problem for the time we were there(?), the Adriatico was a reasonable place to stay but it didn't have anything particularly special about it. Probably a bit cheaper (booked through last minute.com) than some of the equivalent more centrally located four star hotels. However, for us, it seemed a bit too much part of a chain for conferences\/business groups in a not too wonderful situation. The restaurant was closed for most of the week we were there and the builders at the front were still there when we left. Again ....nothing disastrous but if I was going back to Florence I would probably try somewhere else.
