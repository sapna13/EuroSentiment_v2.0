{"text":"Great choice for hotel in Paris Spent 6 nights at the BW Regent's Garden in September, 2007. We highly recommend the hotel. We stayed in a Queen-Garden View Room on top floor (3rd floor). The room was spacious by European standards. The bed was large....more like a King size....reasonably comfortable. Washroom was also fairly large with combination tub\/shower. The room was very clean. A\/C worked well and was quiet. Room comes with bar fridge and safe. Apart from the size of the room, the best thing about the hotel room was how quiet it was. In 6 nights we hardly heard a sound.Staff was courteous. Free computer\/internet in the lobby (The hotel guide in the room advised that there was a charge for the lobby internet. However, we used it on several occassions and were not charged.)Two small nits: No kettle tea\/coffee in room....although you could ask for a tea\/coffee tray free-of-charge at the front desk. Elevator is small. But that's standard for most hotels in Europe.The hotel is located in the 17th Arr.; a 10 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe. Three Metro stations are within a 10 minute walk: Porte Maillot; Charles de Gaulle Etoile (aka Arc de Triomphe) and Ternes. The first two stations also have access to the RER. So while there are few sights close by the hotel....you have easy access to transit.We took the Air France Bus from CDG to Charles de Gaulle Etoile....20 Euros return....took about 45 minutes....with a 10 minute walk from there to the hotel.We didn't try the breakfast in the hotel. There is a great pattiserie across the road and numerous other restaurants, cafes in the area. ","annotations":[]}
