{"text":"best service ever Just returned from 12 nights at the Intercontinental - absolutely fantastic. We were staying in the Club rooms so were met at the airport by uniformed staff and shown to their exclusive airport lounge while they took care of all our immigration formailites and collected our luggage.On arrival at the hotel you are shown straight to the Club Lounge for the check in formalities then taken to your room. We didn't like the first room they showed us as the balcony was rather dark but the second one room 4327 was superb - on the 3rd floor at the end of the corridor with a wonderful open double balcony affording spectacular views of the gardens and sea. The room itself was very large and spacious and everything was spotlessly clean.The service in the Club Lounge was second to none and within 20 minutes of our arrival the staff were addressing us by name and this continued throughout our stay. The 24 hour snack menu is more than adequate and changes daily with things like chicken burgers, tuna wraps, rendang curry etc being on offer. You get 3 hours of free cocktails and spirits every night between 5 - 8pm and the measures are very generous. There are 2 internet terminals in the lounge which are also free to Club guests.Sun loungers are of an excellent quality and very plentiful but if you want a sunbed in one of the prime positions on the sea front make sure you're down before 10am and there's no getting up early to reserve one as it's frowned upon and your things are carefully removed and stored by the staff. Beach towels are plentiful and I dont think anyboby would comment if you had a clean dry one every time you'd been in the sea.The beach and gardens are beautifully kept and there are always staff around, the sea however was a little too rough for me so I made do with paddling or going in one of the many swimming pools in the grounds which were never busy.We ate twice at the Ko Japanese restaurant which was wonderful and very reasonable compared to the prices you would pay back home....would recommend the tepanyaki it's great fun. We also ate at the Italian Restaurant and again the food was superb and you weren't hurried at all which makes a change.My only complaint and it's nothing at all to do with the hotel, it's the behaviour of some of the other guests: the Russian \/ Eastern Europeans...they are so rude and haven't a clue how to behave, I think they believe a sign saying dont do something must be like a red rag to a bull and they do it even more!!Other than that it was a fantastic holiday in a superb hotel - the best resort hotel we've ever stayed in and the service could not be beaten.
