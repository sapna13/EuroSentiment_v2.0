{"text":"Two Germans at Seven Bridges plus unusual sightseeing tips This has been a wonderful stay, for one night only - unfortunately. We truly enjoyed the unique atmosphere, the two owners' kindness, and for sure the beautiful room which is full of antiques.Located in the centre of the town these two neat and knowledgable guys will fill you in with any information you might need for making your trip to Amsterdam as much fun as can be. One of them being German helped a lot in this respect.As an unexpected add-on a Tibetan Buddhist center is right next door where you can join meditation sessions and find a well-assorted bookshop. What was the biggest surprise was the fact that in two minutes walking distance you will find Amsterdam's most beautiful garden as part of Geelvinck Hinlopen Huis museum (-). This is still an insder info as this musuem only opened in Feb 06. Have a coffee in the mystic garden and enjoy chatting with one of Amsterdam's Grand Dames who is running the museum and actually is inhabiting it.Coming from Hamburg we are familiar with high priced parking lots. But man Amsterdam is cheeky. They will ask EUR 3,40 per hour ! So if you are lucky (as we were) to find a parking lot right in front of Seven Bridges, have a lot of small change ready to feed this parking machine. It will not accept bank notes, but only coins. So, if you want to stay over night ... ask at Seven Bridges for not as high piced alternatives.Having said that it's been a great trip and we will come back definitely to enjoy Seven Bridges and this beautiful city.Best wishes to the two of you and to all who are lucky to stay for a night or longer at Seven Bridges.Gabriele  Eric ","annotations":[{"endOffset":884,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":878}]}
