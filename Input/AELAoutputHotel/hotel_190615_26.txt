{"text":"Great Location, Decent Service Barcelona was our second city in our Spanish trip and the Claris was our second favorite hotel.We arrived around 11:00 and while they had some rooms ready, we were being upgraded and ours was not yet ready, so we made our way off for lunch and the bus tour. When we came back, not only did we have our room, but they had moved our luggage into the room. And let me tell you, the room was worth the wait. We had a 2 floor duplex. The first floor had the main bathroom (separate shower and bath) as well as a Sauna (looked a little small, but what can you expect for a private sauna). It also had the living room\/dining room with comfortable couch and chairs and big screen flat tv\/ Upstairs had the bed and another full bath (no sauna). Another great feature was the tv, which seemed to have movies you could rent, and, most importnatly, 5 english speaking channels (CNN Int'l, CNBC Europe, BBC World, Sky News and Disney). There was nice art in the room, and we were left a rose. They also gave us a bottle of red wine.On the negative side, the room was not up to the level of cleanliness I like. The sink in one of the bathrooms was not clean and the floor was dirty\/dusty. I normally do not wear the hotel slippers (my feet are too big). But fortunately, their slippers were a little bigger since I needed them.Service was also a little spotty. While everyone was helpful (including the door man who remembered that my wife and I wanted a non-smoking restuarant and asking how dinner was), there was one mess up that bothered me. We had the hotel make reservations in advance. They made excellent suggestions and we loved 3 of the 4 restaurants. However, we had a bad experience the night before in Madrid where we went to a smoking resturant. Therefore, when we picked up our reservations, we asked if they were all for non-smoking restaurants. We were told that they were. However, the first one was smoking only. We left and went back to the hotel. They found us a non-smoking restaurant nearby, but not us fancy or nice. They followed up with phone calls to ensure that the rest of the restaurants were non-soking (they were).Breakfast was a buffet. Very nice selection of breads and an excellent choice of fruits. You could also order food (such as eggs, pnackages, breakfast meats, etc), but they do not tell you that.Last, we enjoyed the car they provided to take us to the airport (included in a stay of 3 nights or more). However, agan ask for non-smoking since at least one car reaks of cigarettes.The location was great. A very short walk to a couple of Gaudi houses\/museums. We were also very close to the Metro and only about a 10 minute walk to the Gothic Section.
