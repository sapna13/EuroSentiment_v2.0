{"text":"Perfect Patra Having not been to Bali for over 7 years, we returned with some trepidation. However, upon arrival into Bali, and then transfer to The Patra Bali, all our concerns were completely erased. Our family of 2 adults and 3 children, along with our friends (2 adults and 1 child) stayed at The Patra for 8 nights and just loved it! The spacious club villa suits and beautiful grounds created a peaceful and relaxing break from the hussle and bussle of busy Kuta. The hotel grounds are just beautiful and the staff extremely helpful and kind. Our breakfasts buffet was always fresh with plenty of choice and variety. We dined in every night, with 3 restaurants to choose from as well as in-room dining, and the meals were great and well priced. We enjoyed after dinner strolls along the boardwalk between the beach and the hotel, just a fabulous view. The Day Spa ($US) and Salon ($Rupiah) were both well priced and the staff at both were very kind and professional. There were two groups of hawkers, but they stayed in their seperate areas, and apart from calling for you ocassionally, they kept their distance. They offered hair braiding, nail polishing, massages, clothes, watches etc. which were cheap! Certainly not off-putting, but offering guests the choice of buying without having to go into Kuta. There were many shuttle buses going into Kuta, as well as taxi's to drive you anywhere. There are 3 pools, with 1 an Adults pool only. The main pool is huge, as you swim you look out to sea! We all agreed that our stay at The Patra was great. We thoroughly recommend this resort to all families, as well as couples. The Patra is a place to return, we will definitely stay there for our next Bali holiday.
