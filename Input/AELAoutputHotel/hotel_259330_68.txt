{"text":"Great Vacations, Great People It's a shame that most of the people who take the time to write a review about this resort are those who were not happy with their stay. The average cost for this all-inclusive hotel is less than any overnight stay at a Motel 8 in the USA, so I truly don't know what they expected. Everything far exceeded our expectations, even if we had paid $100 per person per day, which neither us nor anyone else certainly did not. The facilities are beautiful and enormous and well kept, the ac could be a little cooler but we slept well at night. Our fridge was always stocked with water and sodas. There was a stocked coffee maker in the room and a working iron with its board. TV was a 32 inches plasma. The room was serviced every day.We were a party of 8 people (16 to 47 years old) and had a wonderful 5-day stay at Grand Paradise. The beach and the settings are gorgeous like everybody else agree, and the food was great. I was the only one who got sick but it was out of my own gluttony. Many people eat too much, get sick and, understanbly, speak lousy of their stay here, but I think it's not fair to blame the hotel or the staff.The staff is very professional and friendly. Christian Cuevas at the lobby, our maid Marcela Alvarado, Yoralaisa, don Alberto, Juan, they all were very nice to us. Fun is non-stop for those who look for it. The quality of the Las Vegas-sort-of show at the amphitheater is sound for the size. Food was great. The two buffets (we preferred La Laguna and you might as well stick eating there rather than trying reservation restaurants) offered plenty of options to eat. The meat might not be done to the American taste. All restaurants look great and their staff is always willing to help. Most of them are multi-linguals, so communication should not be an issue. Tip these folks as you would at any restaurant. They deserve it. There are shows at the beach and dance classes. We also sailed on sail boats and kayaks. One note for management: Set up an emergency crew at the beach. My daughter, who can't swim, and a friend got on a kayak and sailed away into the sea and did not know how to come back. Fortunately a gentleman from Australia saw them in distress and rescued them. This resort is well worth your money and then some. We also stayed 5 days at Barcelo Golf but overall our time here was much better. I would recommend it.
