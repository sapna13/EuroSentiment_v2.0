{"text":"Not Worth the Money... We have been very disappointed by our stay in Amankila. Public parts of the hotel are breathtaking, service is merely ok, and the rooms are VERY DISAPPOINTING for a hotel claiming such a high standard.Lobby, swimming pool, beach and restaurant are great (even though we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ swim in the ocean because of jelly fishes √à√\u2020\u2022?Not Amankila√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ fault, of course)Service is disappointing: there were not enough beds on the beach, depending on who I asked to there were some slots or not for massages, √à√\u2020\u2022√ì√∂?here is no gym (there is equipment but it can be used by one person at a time, so you have to book 2 days in advance..)Rooms were absolutely not worth 750 $ per night : We had a regular villa, decoration was end 80√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂\/early 90√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, we had a view on the concrete pillars of the villa next to ours, fairly small, the terrace was dirty (dirty sofa,√à√\u2020\u2022?, bath tub was small, 2 coakroaches in the shower, just an ipod in the room to make it seem like it had been refurbished (no TV, √à√\u2020\u2022?), noisy AC.We decided to leave after the first night, we went directly to the Four Seasons in Jimbaran, for the SAME PRICE, we had a private pool, a villa twice the size, fully renovated with outside shower, great view,√à√\u2020\u2022?We felt Amankila must have been great 15 years ago, but is definitely not anymore in Bali√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ standards. We had been to 2 hotels that were cheaper (Chedi Club and Bale, 500$\/night) that were much better.
