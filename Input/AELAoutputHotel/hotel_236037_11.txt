{"text":"Small and charcterful Stayed here in 1997, at that time rated hotel high. Stayed again in July 2006. On this visit some disappointment about slightly rundown now and not being kept in best condition, as evidenced in other comments here, but on balance still liked it and still several positive points.Location of hotel good. Better hotels tend to be further out, while the ones right in the centre are generally inferior budget ones.Stayed in room 35. Small attic room on top floor, rather cramped, and many quite steep stairs to reach it; but adequately warned about these points on website and when booking. Double bed, window with no view, very little storage space, but definitely a room with appealing character. Walls need some paint. Own private bathroom across corridor, ie not ensuite; obviously recently refurbished, good size, high standard, very clean, plenty of hot water, shower quite good. Electronic safe in room, no extra charge, good. Key cards to control access to both hotel and room.Mosquitoes and a noisy unit outside (a\/c or similar) a problem the first night (unusually hot weather), so kept window closed subsequent nights.Staff efficient, helpful and friendly.Breakfast typical Dutch continental of various breads, jam, cheese, cold meat, eggs, and a few other supplies. Good coffee and orange juice. Served as help yourself buffet, not a vast spread, but quite good and sufficient for us. Breakfast room peaceful and quite spacious, better than many hotels. A few items not fresh on second morning, assume left over from previous day, otherwise a good and relaxing breakfast.Some parts of hotel need attention. Graffiti on outside an unwelcome start. Stair carpet in poor condition, and distinct musty smell on lower stairs, as noticed by everyone else on this website. Repainting some walls would be a significant, and cheap, enhancement.Paid 92 Euros per night, which is reasonable for Amsterdam (although 88 Euros posted in room ?). Larger ensuite rooms around 120 Euros, 140 euros for view of canal. Booking dealt with efficiently by email, cancellation available up to 48 hours before arrival.In summary: Needs some refurbishment - new carpets and some paint, and ensure everything at breakfast is fresh. Otherwise, still an attractive hotel with character, good value, good location, a typical Amsterdam house rather than a bland hotel. (Other than spending a lot more money elsewhere) we would probably stay here again.Martin  Sally ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1239,"mention":"breads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1233},{"endOffset":1244,"mention":"jam","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fruit_preserves"],"startOffset":1241},{"endOffset":1308,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1302}]}
