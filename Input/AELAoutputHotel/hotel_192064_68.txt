{"text":"A Ghost of a Beautiful Lady The Chesterfield Mayfair London has become a faded beauty, still interesting, but lacking a great deal.I've stayed at the Chesterfield many times and have had wonderful stays. I particularly enjoyed the elegant touches and the high levels of service. Now, the Chesterfield is more like a nice Marriott than a speccial lady. The location remains a postive. However, the new smoking terraces of the nearby pubs create a din from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM.My room was small, but filled with monsterously-sized furniture. The results was a feeling being in a flea market vendor's small shop. The bathroom was so small, that one had to take care not to hit the sink when exiting the bathtub \/ shower. The closets were ample, but access to them required a contortionist.What can one say about the price. While the Chesterfield is not blame for the weak dollor, the prices have increase over 50% from my last stay 2+ years ago. With the weak dollar, a commercial room was over $500 per day!The service staff was, at best professional. The old touch of the concierge and receptionists has been replaced by young, inexperienced people who do not suceed in pulling it off.The bar remains lovely with excellent service. Even the tennis ball that bought a round of drinks did not help reduce the sticker shock of a couple of glasses of house wine.Breakfast was very nice; however, it was so expensive that I lost my appetite.One might do a lot better at a Marriott.
