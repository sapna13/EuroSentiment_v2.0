{"text":"Great Family Time - Tips for Parents We stayed the last week of April with our 2 children who are 10 and 6. I'll just add a few key points to the previous reviews.1) The food is average. Even at the reserved restaurants. However, given our experience with all-inclusive's we didn't expect gourmet.2) The Peacocks are LOUD and annoying at 6:00 am!!!!! Get a room closer to the pool. They seem to hang out closer to the front of the hotel.3) The pool is great for kids. A lot of people leave their floats.4) The evening shows are average to boring. Mr. Iberostar was the best and they should do more audience participation. One show, Chicago, was completely inappropriate for children. It started off with a seductive dance, followed by a bedroom scene which includes adultery, physical abuse and murder. We walked out after that, so I don't know how the rest was.5) The beach is great and you can snorkel just a few feet out.6) It rained more than we liked. It appears that their rainy season decided to start a couple of weeks early. Bring umbrellas and rain jackets if you come this time of year.7) Not a lot of variety of food for kids. The chicken nuggets were frequently over fried. Yes, deep fried in the french fry oil!8) Our renovated room had a bathtub with a spray handle and the glass door had been removed and replaced with a shower curtain. I've seen parents complain about both, so obviously they listened.9) Lots of kids to make friends with. We have used kids clubs in the past, but this one seemed to be more focused on kids under 5, so my kids didn't go much.10) The rooms are best for families with 2 children under 12. Families of 5 or more or teens will probably need 2 rooms.Have Fun!!
