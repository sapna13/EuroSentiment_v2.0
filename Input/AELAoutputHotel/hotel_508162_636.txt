{"text":"Beware for now! This resort will become Dreams in December but is currently Sunscape in November. So I was there as Sunscape and the resort has really let themselves drop the ball until the new owners take over. Don't get me wrong, the resort was very nice, but has many problems to resolve. We went with our 2 boys who are 6 and 3.Problems:In our room the A\/C worked when it felt like it. The fan in the bathroom was dead. The ceiling fan had no chain so you could not turn it on. None of these was a real big deal to us, but they are not the biggest problems. The book you will find in the room that describes the resort is very wrong. Not one restaurant had the proper time or dress code listed. Not a big deal since you do receive a daily sheet, but it was a big deal since that sheet was also very wrong. You would see things like pants required and no children, but get there and see shorts and lots of kids. Also go to the restaurant to find out what time it is opening that day to avoid lines. Don't go by the schedule! The event times listed are also wrong. If you really want to do something, that day ask someone for the proper time and place. If not, you will either have the wrong place or time.Enjoyed:The resort is clean and very nice. The pool down the middle of the resort is great for everyone including kids. It is about 3.5' deep throughout the pool. The beach is also beautiful and soft. The ocean water was warmer than the pool! The people are also very nice and helpful if you are nice to them. (Be nice to get what you want. They don't always want a tip.) The kids club was enjoyed by both our kids. The staff there was very good with the boys. They really don't want 3 year olds, but they will take them. We gave them a few bucks to be nice since they took our 3 year old.We went to relax and relax we did. The problems were many, but minor enough to not destroy the vacation. If you like to take long walks, avoid the Dominican Republic. The resorts don't want you to leave their grounds for safety reasons. I didn't mention the food since it was ok, but not great or bad.Dreams is a good chain and I hope they bring this resort back to a top resort.
