{"text":"i'd rather call it the accidental my friend and i have been to punta cana 8 times and have stayed at 3 or 4 different resorts. i have to say that this one is close to the bottom of our list. we flew with air transat and stayed in the premium club. transat holidays will do their best to make your stay as good as it can be. unfortunately, as good as it got was not even close to good.we checked in quickly and were taken to our room directly beside the laundry room. the room was humid and the sheets, towels, and furniture were all damp. we immediately asked to change rooms and they did it quickly and with no problems, the rooms are spacious but dated, even the ones that were renovated if you believe it when they say satellite t.v. then you will not be pleased. if you don't go out every night and want to watch t.v, at any time, don't count on it.the buffet seating area was very comfortable but the food you eat while sitting there is another story. small buffet, not much of a selection and food undercooked or overcooked at times. we both also got sick and having been to many places there, this was a first. the a la cartes were kind of tacky and the food was just a bit above the buffet quality.great oven pizza from 11 p.m. - morn.the grounds are very well kept. very clean,the pool was okay. the swim up bar was not very well stocked and the actual bar was not very attractive. there is a small sports bar for breakfast and lunch and it was horrible. burnt hamburgers from a food warmer tray in the buffet and something that remotely resembled hotdogs. no salad selection unless you like lettuce and lettuce. there is really only one bar to go to at night and it is in the main lobby. if you don't smoke, you wont be happy. it is all one large area and you can not separate yourselves from the smokers. as most people say, the staff work their as..s of so it is nice to give them a little tip now and then.the casino is about the size of the hotel rooms and again smoke galore. there is a disco just outside the resort and it is the club to go to in the area. they bring bus loads of people from other resorts nightly.very sleazy, and if you want to pay for a good time, there are people who are very willing to oblige. power failures, water problems, lobby washrooms just plain gross!the beach... what can you say? BEAUTIFUL. everywhere in punta cana though.the entertainment was almost embarrassing and that was if they didn't have technical difficulties.we were booked to stay for 2wks but after a week of constant annoyances it was time to leave. we talked to our transat rep and for $140.00 more they transfered us to a beautiful resort called the melia caribe. well worth the money. that hotel is a 4 1\/2 star for sure. the occidental is a 3 star resort.if these things don't bother you, then it is worth it. just be prepared to be a squeaky wheel because you will not get the oil if you don't say anything. be persistent because they will blow you off if you don't ask for things 2,3,4, times.if you are searching around on the internet frantically, pay the extra 150 bucks at the onset and go to the nicer resort and you will avoid the hassles.
