{"text":"The Best Hotel in Berlin - outstanding service and huge rooms First of all - the German welcome from the doorman was discreet, efficient and warm. Then as we checked in - with our one year old daughter - the charming gentleman at reception - can only be described as the epitome of professional warmth and courtesy. We had travelled from Copenhagen and were a bit tired - and this gorgeous 5 star hotel within spitting distance of the Brandenburg gate could not have been a better choice. My husband and I travel a lot for business as well as pleasure - but this was the first time we have been travelling - all the way from Australia - with a one year old. And the Adlon has made our stay in Berlin one of the most happy trips we have experienced. Our room was outstanding, the bathroom was to die for. And I am a tall woman and was able to recline in the full length bath - with complimentary glass cofrets of different bath salts and bubble baths at my fingertips. The concierge arranged babysitting at 17 Euros an hour (cheaper than an agency that I had independantly contacted in advance who wanted 20 Euro per hour)...and also arranged sight seeing tours, and restaurant and club reservations. We had previously used Lonely Planet to find shopping receommendations - but found this not to our taste - and yet concierge was able to direct us to where we wanted to go. They arranged a cot and bed linen for our baby - and serviced the rooms twice a day. All the major sights are within walking distance from the Reichstag, Jewish museum, Potsdamer Platz and the Unter Den Linden. It is about 20 Euros via taxi from the Tegel Airport and I cannot recommend this Hotel more highly. It was the one that Michael Jackson hung his baby out of - remember? And last night while we were here the Chancellor was here too. Its a bit lifestyles of the Rich and Famous and if you can cop the 35 Euro a glass for a glass of Dom Perignon n the lobby bar - and the average price of main courses in the ground floor restaurant are around 35 euro a main course too - you don't mind because well...it is the best hotel in Berlin. Fortunately Expedia was able to secure us a room rate of AUD $468 per night which was phenonenal - but you know what? We would have paid more if we had to because it is such an excellent Hotel. Well done Hotel Adlon Kempinski. If this is a taste of the Kempinski chain we will definitely stay here again in your other hotels in Europe. Search Expedia for very competitive rates.
