{"text":"Amazing vacation I just wanted to add some little tips and things that i have seen noone else write, first off Mamajawana(sorry spelling) they have bottles everywhere for sale to take home some with the liquor some just with the wood chips, in canada at least you cannot take it home. not fun at 3 in the morning at customs being told that. i guess if you dont declare it you could get it in but i wouldnt do that.second, i think if you are going to a third world country you should learn a little but about it there. and not expect it to be like back home. i saw way to many people very angry about the roads- which if you just relax is actually really fun. and the language barrier.BRING BUG SPRAY. i did not and the bites are brutal! my boyfriends legs were covered and they are itchy! dont know what was biting us though.the resort was always clean and there were always tons of people working. maybe to many in the buffets they were everywhere! and always very friendly. they all seemed to love children.room was great but i found i could tip really good and get a little extra flowers and waters, or i could tip a dollar and get even better stuff. i think it depends on who cleans. but they deserve a tip.sometimes the towels were a little late, we got them after dinner some nights but we at least got them.go on the saona day trip. most beautiful place and the ride back on the catamaran was amazing. just dont drink to much rum!the only complaints would be the actual other tourists there. but you cant blame that on the resort. alot of rude people (and i have seen other reviews say this too) and some of the things a saw people doing with all the kids around had me sick to my stomach . (drugs) i tried to say something but the language barrier was a problem. other then that, sirenis was an amazing resort and i would go back next year.
