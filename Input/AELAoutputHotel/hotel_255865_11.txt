{"text":"Unprofessional and disorganised! My friend and I were only in Sydney for one night to go to a concert, so we were happy to stay in a budget hotel in a busy area. The place wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ too noisy, and the location is fantastic, a short 5 minute walk to central station and heaps of shops, restaurants etc. The bathroom and room were clean, apart from the doona cover which had urine stains and the carpet which had a large orange stain (not that the carpet matters). However, it was the poor service we received when we arrived that turned us off.I was called the day before the booking and informed that there was an error with wotif.com; the website kept taking bookings even though they were full, so they were now overbooked. The lady was very nice, and explained that they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° arranged accommodation for us across the road at the Metro, which has the same star-rating and amenities and would be the same price. For the inconvenience, Capitol would throw in a complimentary breakfast, too. We arrived at the Metro and waited in line a while, and when we got to the desk the staff couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ find our booking. About ten minutes was spent waiting in line and then waiting for the staff to go through the system to find us, checking with other staff, etc. Then we were told they needed to call the Capitol, because they couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ find our booking. I wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ too happy about all the waiting as we had a tight turnaround time before we had to leave for our concert, and we were hoping to get a nanna nap in before we left. We waited another ten minutes while the Metro staff tried for a while to get through to the Captitol (either the phone was busy or no-one was answering) but we were finally told that the Capitol DID have a room for us. Now that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ inconvenience: waiting in line when you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e tired, hungry and thirsty for no reason whatsoever.We got to Capitol and waited in line some more. We overheard the clerk say to the customers in front of us as they left for their room, that they were in the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√\u2020ood√à√\u2020\u2022?side of the hotel, meaning away from the street and the roadworks. How unprofessional to say that at all -admitting that there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a good and bad side to a hotel when you pay the same rate- and worse, in front of other customers!?We were given our room key and I asked if breakfast was still included; in my opinion we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° been stuffed around more waiting across the road unnecessarily than we would have been if we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° actually checked in to the Metro. The clerk checked our paperwork and said that our booking didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ include it. I explained that we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° been told we were now getting complimentary breakfast, to which the manager told the clerk right in front of us (we weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ important enough to be acknowledged) that no, our booking didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ come with breakfast, and we weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ supposed to go to the Metro at all (as if it was our fault we went there).We were told to go to the Metro by Capitol, but they wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ admit their mistake nor make good on their conciliation for the hassle. Annoyed, I pointed out that they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° wasted our time, about half an hour (meaning no nap). Indirectly, the clerk then accused us of lying, by checking his watch and saying it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° only been ten minutes since he received the phone call from the Metro. Again, they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ seem to grasp the fact that it was their fault we were waiting 20 minutes at the Metro, not the Metros or ours. The Capitol√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ handling of the issue made us feel completely undervalued; a free breakfast is nothing compared to the loss of repeat business from people who stay in Sydney CBD regularly. So there you have it: location good; amenities okay; service appalling. ","annotations":[]}
