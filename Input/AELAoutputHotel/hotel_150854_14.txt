{"text":"some brilliant things but room for improvement We have just returned from RPM and had a good holiday! summary as follows:Hotel - nice and spacious giving a good choice of using the beach or pool. Our room was smelly , musty and damp , and the high humidity did nothing to help( most other people we spoke to said their rooms were very good so perhaps we were just a bit unlucky). The fridge was well stocked and regularly refilled(small tips may have helped)Smoking is allowed in the hotel so this was a bit of a step back to a couple of years ago - the 'Boheme' room had a stale odour but was soon forgotten and all other general areas were ok.Food was varied and aimed at US\/ European visitors -by using the four restaurants it was easy to avoid too much repitition.No problems on getting towels\/sunbeds - always plenty of room Staff - always excellent . Always asking if we needed anything , nothing was too much trouble. We were not allowed to do anything - if we had to work then the staff were not at all happy.Entertainment - a little dated in presentation but never lacking in effort. The thursday evening on Carribean Street is worth seeing. Not much to do when it was raining !Beach - lots of nice golden sand and you can walk for milesSafety - no problems but we did not venture outside the resort unless on a trip.I can't think of anything else except the positives far outweight any negatives !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
