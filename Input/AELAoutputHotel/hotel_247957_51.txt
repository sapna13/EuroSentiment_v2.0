{"text":"Dont listen to all the negative reviews Steve  SissyDates: September 14-21, 2008We just returned from a weeks stay at the Occidental Grand Punta Cana. We were a bit concerned with all the variety of reviews we read on here, but to our surprise everything was great!!!We had read some good and bad reviews. Dont forget you are going to a different country, things are different and dont forget your on vacation and things run at a slower pace. This is not a 5 star hotel so dont expect it. What you can expect is a great time if you allow yourself too and overlook some small things they will just ruin your vacation.Staff was excellent!! Check and check out were flawless. Alfredo at the pool bar was quick and on the spot with our drinks. Buffet waiters were great as well as speciality restaurants wait staff. If you do happen to go here DO TIP workers who do a good job, they dont make alot of money and every little bit helps them.Room we had was large with a comfortable king bed and a couch that pulled out into a sleeper. Good size TV, variety of stations, some in spanish, but again your in another country. Air worked good, we had hot water and room was cleaned spotless every day.Food was generally good. Buffet was good there was always a good variety for breakfast, lunch or dinner. We ate at 3 of the specialty restaurants. The mexican we did not eat at. The Italian was good, the Brazilian was OK, they brought you 4 different meats (roat pork, sausage, chicken and beef roast) and 1 vegatable on big swords, it was different and fun but some meat was kinda dry. The oriental was the best in our opinion, we had scallops and prawns on a skewer with vegetables and beef in an oyster sauce that was very good also. There is also a pizza and taco place upstairs by the main pool. Tacos were great!! Pizza was good and they also had Calzones that were as good as home!!! Also get this the pizza place was open til 6:30 AM!!!! We had gotten up a few times and ate at 4 am, it was fun!!! You can ALWAYS find something to eat not matter what time it is.Hotel grounds were beautiful. There are 3 pools, main pool is huge and kept very clean. The 2 other pools, one is a large 3 ft deep pool the other is also a good size and its by the beach. No matter what building your in its a short walk to everything.Beach was great, water was clear, lots of chairs, sand was like silk.Entertainment is good, they try to make it fun by getting audience involved. If you walk out the resort to the end of the property is shopping, across the street is a craft market, to the right is more of a store type shopping. HAGGLE with vendors they WILL come down. We bought a carton of cigarettes for $25 and they started off between $40 to $50.In closing, form your own opinion but for the money this is one of the best vacations we have had. We have been to Jamaica 8 times and this was our 4th trip to Dominican Republic. Just go with an open mind to have FUN!!!!
