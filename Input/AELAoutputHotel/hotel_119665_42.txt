{"text":"Great Value in San Francisco Clean, warm and safe. Super site to stay at by yourself or family. Save some money and stay here. Great Location for downtown and Moscone center! 1\/2 block away from the gate to Chinatown on Grant street. ( could see it from my room window) and about 3-4 blocks away from the BART Montgomery station. It is an easy walk to Moscone center down Kearney street. If you want to catch muni you can on Kearney or Market street! i recommend getting a city map with the Muni and Bart routes. You can get this at any 7-11 for $4 or here is an online version which you can print up and bring with you. http:\/\/transit.511.org\/static\/providers\/maps\/SF_712200711012.pdfWireless Internet access $10 per day, tel calls 50 cents a pop. (I recommend buying a calling card at the 7-11 1or2 block away on Pine street) I bought some food at the 7-11about 2 blocks away . There are numerous other inexpensive restaurants within walking distance. I recommend Lori's Diner near Powell and Market on the second floor. About $20 for nice turkey dinner with 2 beers. I didn't try the restaurant in the lobby. The folks at the front desk will watch your bags when you check out if you want to go walking about for a while..http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?f=qhl=engeocode=q=grant+street+san+francisco+casll=36.71431,-76.24785sspn=0.593359,1.109619ie=UTF8ll=37.792117,-122.404647spn=0.00457,0.008669z=17layer=ccbll=37.789924,-122.405439cbp=1,341.66173738753173,,0,-2.1873763128327104 this is the view from the street. Print out this map to find the directions to the BART which costs $6 riding from the SFO airport. Wireless internet was $10 per day and they have parking available for about $30 day down the street. Definately recommend! There are a lot of smaller hotels like this in area.. search the internet.. not all are on the internet sitesorbitz etc.. I found this fthrough chinatown website.. http:\/\/www.ihsadvantage.com\/h\/hotelinfo\/san_francisco\/ca\/us\/83079\/?pfs=887#trafficLogID=507700402visited=trueEnjoy your stay!
