{"text":"Potential For Excellence but Falls Short My wife and I celebrated our anniversary with another couple the week of June 2nd-9th and found the resort to be a welcome break from the stresses of our daily lives. While overall this trip was very enjoyable and at times ecstatic, as a veteran Carribean traveller I've got to give an honest review highlighting The Good, The Bad....and The Ugly:The Good:Excellence Punta Cana is a beautiful resort and is impeccably clean. The hotel staff work very hard to keep the grounds, pool and beach spotless and well-manicured. If you are considering upgrading to the Excellence Club I can assure you that it is definitely worth it. Upon check-in we were welcomed with champagne, taken to the Excellence Club for hors d'ouvres and orientation, then led to our rooms which were supplied with fresh fruit, a bottle of chilled champagne, a completely stocked wetbar with premium liquors and extra tolietries. We loved the seemingly endless pool which runs the length of the property and spent most of our afternoons relaxing in the water while sipping frozen drinks. Without exception, every bartender and server we encountered was friendly and professional and made us feel at home. The beach was very nice but almost unbearably hot at this time of year. As many have said the surf is strong so weak swimmers may want to steer clear of the ocean. The spa was wonderful and we enjoyed our Swedish massages tremendously. Breakfast and lunch usually found us at Toscana for the diverse buffet. I recommend the fresh fruit smoothies for a good natural energy drink. Finally, the nightlife was sometimes cheesy but overall enjoyable. We particularly enjoyed the Circus show, the disco (the dance floor was always jumping) and the casino (loose slots but only about 20 machines to choose from and only in quarter denomination). The Bad:- Much to our dismay, the food offerings here are not of the caliber you will find at a typical four star resort. In some cases it was too spicy, in others it was too bland. Agave, the Mexican restaurant, was closed for the entireity of our trip yet no one on staff could explain why. Barcelona (Mediterranean) and Spice (Oriental) were NOT good and I do not recommend dinner at either. - Oddly, every ice machine at the resort went out of order from Sunday until Thursday. For a while we were able to get ice from the Excellence Club but by Wednesday afternoon even room service could not supply any ice.- The vendors who come onsite in the evenings to sell jewelry and souveniers will quote you ridiculously exhorbitant prices for their goods and are not willing to negotiate. The general attitude is You are American, so you can afford it. In fact this was actually said to my wife by one of the vendors when she tried to bargain with him.- Like most Carribean resorts, it remains very hot and humid in the evening. Since the dress codes require men to wear long pants for dinner at most restaurants, you can expect to be drenched in perspiration before the evening is over. Make sure to bring thin, breathable garments.The Ugly:- Room service was a complete joke. We encountered language barriers, untrained staff answering the phones who did not know the menu, wait times of up to 90 minutes and botched orders. Not once did we receive exactly what we ordered.- We booked an excursion through the hotel for deep sea fishing. It was a complete rip-off and I urge you to avoid this particular excursion at all costs. We were told our boat would hold five passengers, would be covered to provide shade and would be stocked with beer, energy drinks, water, soda and snacks. When we arrived there were seven passengers, NO shading unless you went below deck (8-10 foot swells made this option impossible) NO snacks, a dozen bottles of water and two 1-liter bottles of Coke. We were shown a box and told that for $40 dollars we could have the beer and energy drinks inside. We told the operator to take a hike. Our guides were teenagers with very little fishing experience and we only caught a small sailfish. Neither myself nor my wife even touched a fishing pole. Half the boat got sick from heat exhaustion. Needless to say we demanded a refund from the tour agent but neither he nor the hotel management seemed concerned.....and THAT is why I can only give three stars to a beautiful hotel with wonderful staff. Overall I still loved Excellence Punta Cana but hated the Dominican Republic and will not be back.
