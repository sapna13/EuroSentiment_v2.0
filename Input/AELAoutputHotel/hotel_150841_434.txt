{"text":"Oh so wonderful!! We stayed at the IBB the last week of November. It is our third Iberostar and we enjoyed it the most even though the weather was windy and we had some rain. The property is beautiful - beach is truly amazing. In spite of the weather the ocean was warm and even clear at times. We had fun boogy boarding in the waves.We had a renovated room in a block near the pool as we had requested. It was very nicely done and had a nice amount of space for our family of four. No musty smell like at the IBHD. One thing to note is there is no need to bring plug adapters as they have installed plugs that work for both American and Carribean style plugs. The maid service was great and we only had one day where it was late in the day. We always had plenty to drink in our fridge. There is a coffee maker and an iron in each room. the beds were comfortable and they gave us plenty of pillows to make up for their 'flatness'.The resort staff were very accomadating and friendly. We found the food good with plenty of variety. Another nice addition we noted at this property is that while the buffet eating area is outside, the serving\/kitchen area is airconditioned behind an automatic sliding door. The specialty restaurants were good and all very well airconditioned. We particularly enjoyed the Jambalaya. We went to the Punta Cana\/Dominicana side for 1 meal and a walk around and there was a big difference. No AC in the specialty restaurant and the property was huge with not as good food\/ service\/ amenities. One spot we enjoyed everyday was the beach bar - Basilio makes the most awesome fries and grilled ham and cheese! Our kids (3 1\/2 and 8) enjoyed the Kids Club. the staff, Kaila and Belle were wonderful. There is no actual kids club building (I think it is being renovated), they meet at a conference room but they had a printed schedule and we could always find them when my kids wanted to participate.Thje poool is nice and while not as large as the IB Maya it has a nice 0 grade entry for the little ones and is neatly divided into 3 seperate areas - the shallow, the bar (over a step bridge) and the deep adult\/activity area. You can access all 3 areas without leaving the water but you are not mixed up with the kids when you are having a poolside cocktail.While the propery is spread out it never felt crowded. there was always a chair and a palapa.available. My one complaint is that there is actually an abundance of shade - especially poolside!We really liked that there was a good mix of ages and nationalies. We always go the same week of the year and there were a few more Americans with kids this year which was nice in a way.This trip we actually left the property - first for deep sea fishing. caught 6 total - big Mahi mahi and a shark. We booked online and paid for 4 hours on a shared boat - quite reasonable. Beware though, they tell you it can be rough and I was seasick for the first time in my life!The second excursion was to the DonLucas cigar factory. They pick you up at the hotel and give a very interesting tour even for non-cigar smokers. The concierge will help arrange a time.My husband bought some and is enjoying them quite a bit. They are really developing the area and there was quite a bit of shopping especially the area around where our fishing boat left (near Captain Cooks). It was fun to walk around and I never felt unsafe.There were no bugs and we didn't get any mosquito bites - maybe the wind kept them away. Overall we were very happy with this property and are planning to go back for our annual family excursion. If you want a nice, relaxed warm vacation this is your spot.
