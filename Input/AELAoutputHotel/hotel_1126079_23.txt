{"text":"Perfect for a quick stay This is a great hotel concept and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a convenient and affordable place to sleep for a night between flights. I stayed at Citizen M recently when my planned direct flight back to NJ from Rome was canceled, and I found myself with 14 hour over-night layover in Amsterdam. I was traveling with my daughter and didn't want her to have to stay up all night in the airport, so I searched for hotel options and found Citizen M. It seemed perfect for our needs (basically a place to sleep for a quick over night and a shower in the morning), and it worked out very well. One problem we did have was that there seemed to be no signs in the airport itself giving any indication where Citizen M might be, which I had been hoping for given the description on their website stating that it was connected to the airport via a covered walk way. We arrived at the airport quite late, and had a hard time finding anyone who could tell us where to go to find the hotel. This coupled with the fact that they apparently close most of the ground level doors sometime before midnight, so we had to walk up and down the length of the airport to find an open door to get out, made simply getting to the hotel somewhat annoying. (Once you do find your way outside, if you face toward the street\/away from the airport, there is a sidewalk to the right with a cover over it (no side protection, so if it's windy or raining sideways you'd be in trouble) that leads to the hotel. We took the free baggage cart from the airport over to the hotel, where there were many more parked outside ready for use on the way back in the morning. This made lugging our bags over much more convenient.Once at the hotel, everything was great. Check in is easy and quick (self check in style using one of many computer terminals arrayed as you walk in the door). If you can make your way through a self-checkout aisle at the supermarket, CitizenM's check in system will be no problem. The room was very functional for a quick stay. I'm not sure I'd want to spend a longer vacation or full week of business travel here, but it worked very well for us. The decor is somewhere between 2001 A Space Odyssey and Star Trek (particularly the transporter room given the circular shower and toilet enclosures), but it is clean, bright, and makes good use of purposefully limited space. My daughter had great fun playing with the multimedia controller - changing lighting colors, changing TV display settings, opening and closing the blinds and shade, and finally setting our wake up call so that we woke up to the sound of jungle noises including elephants (there appeared to be several other options, some more standard sounding, as well). Bed was comfortable and very big (plenty of room for two people who otherwise wouldn't be sharing one). Shower was great. Toilet enclosure is weird, but works. It was great to have in-room Wi-Fi internet access again, after having survived for a week without at our other hotel in Rome.The entire downstairs of the hotel is a large lounge area with multiple sitting areas, TV's, computers (looked like about four public Apple Macintoshes, as well as several desks for lap top use), and even several large dining room\/conference room sized tables where you could either sit and work or have a family meal. There is also a coffee bar and a decent selection of ready-to-eat food (breads, sandwiches, salads, yogurt, fruit, and some dinner meals, though we didn't look too carefully at these since we were only there for breakfast). This is clearly aimed at a quick, simple snack or meal after or before a day of traveling, but again, this was perfect for what we were looking for during our quick stay. To sum up - if you are looking for a place for a quick, convenient stay, where you can get a good rest, take a shower (and a pretty cool one at that), grab a good quality quick bite, and have the modern conveniences of internet, TV channel choices, etc., at a very reasonable rate, this is the place for you. Given the amount of time I spend traveling for business and vacations, and how often the airlines mess up my plans these days, I hope that many more of these CitizenM hotels spring up at other airports soon.
