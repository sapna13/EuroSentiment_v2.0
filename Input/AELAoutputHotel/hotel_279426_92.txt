{"text":"Adagio- FANTASTIC I could not have been happier with our 4 day stay at Adagio this past week. The hotel was great. Modern, swanky and comfortable, but not over the top. Excellent location within walking distance to trolley and BART. Close to Union Square. Lots of good restaurants nearby, even good budget places to eat are close.The room was spacious and comfortable with a desk\/chair AND a reading area, two CD players (one was a BOSE system that you could hook your IPOD up to) nice bathroom ammeneties and a relatively reasonable mini bar (yes, I mean it).I travel a great deal for work and generally find myself in hotels along the lines of Intercon, Ritz Carlton and such... so my standards for service are relatively high. Adagio, though a relatively budget priced hotel (in my opinion) lived up to EVERY standard of service I expect from the 5 stars I'm accustomed to staying in, even though they are not considered a 5 star hotel. In fact, I would take it a step further and say- Adagio did BETTER than some 5 stars- by being GENUINELY glad to serve and ready with a smile at all times. They make you feel completely welcome.In fact, when the front desk staff found out we were celebrating our anniversary, they sent flowers, champagne, a candle and chocolates to the room. *People- listen up- I paid like $170 a night to stay here WITH parking- I've stayed in $600 a night hotels that did not do that for me on a special occasion.* To say I was shocked is an understatement. THATS how much they care about their guests!There is not a SINGLE thing that I could complain about, without being extremely petty. Now- if you're considering SF- I'm telling you- you CANT go wrong by staying with the Adagio. You'll be in good hands.Thanks Adagio for making my stay FIVE STAR all the way.
