{"text":"A Very Nice Experience We stayed at the Sofitel-Washington D.C. hotel for 4 nights and it was one of the cleanest hotels we've been to. This for us ranks highest when staying outside of our home, anything else after this is a plus. We were always greeted warmly when arriving back at the hotel from a day out and when asked for extra towels or concierge information about restaurants and shops nearby, we got good feedback and service. The hotel is around the corner from the McPhearson metro stop, making sightseeing a breeze. We were able to walk to the White House comfortably and could have made the walk to the Mall area featuring the monuments and museums but the metro(subway) was the smartest option. You want to minimize walking whenever possible if you are planning on walking all day long, get a rest in when you can. The downside of our visit didn't have much to do with the hotel since it is located in a fairly nice area with many beautiful buildings. We found it hard to find a good place to eat besides a Subway sandwich shop down the street. There are not an abundance of fast food places which is not a bad thing but we are not likely to pay $100 for dinner at the hotel restaurant and after a long day, it would have been nice to grab a bite close to the hotel. Also there are homeless people around the metro station and across the street at the park. We never had a problem with anyone but it is very disturbing when you have young children with you that see that. It's a shame that this happens down the street from the White house no less. Overall I would stay here again for the extreme cleanliness and location to the Mall for sightseeing.
