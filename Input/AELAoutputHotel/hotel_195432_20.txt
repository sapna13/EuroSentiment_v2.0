{"text":"Great Hotel! This was a great hotel. It is certainly not fancy; like some reviews have said, some bits of it are a little scruffy. This is not the Ritz. But for those of us who are on a budget, this place is a very pleasant surprise. If they fixed this place, it would be just another expensive, fancy, American-style hotel. But I didn't come to Italy for that. The people really made this hotel for me. All the staff are generous and enthusiastic. This makes a huge difference when you are traveling. The cleaning and kitchen staff were always cheerful and really cared about what they were doing. The staff at the front desk know and love Florence and are good at what they do.The rooms are basic but functional; the beds are metal frame and the blankets were old. I liked the breakfast; good fresh croissant, bread, yogurt, coffee, and fruit. They also had cereals and milk. You could have as much as you wanted which, if you know Florence prices, makes this a great bargain. There is also a free computer in the lobby. This alone will save you 3 to 6 euros. Our room was located towards the center of the building and the window opened up on the center vent\/courtyard. You want this. You do not want a room with a view here because you will be seranaded all night long by the non-stop party below. I really appreciated the quiet. After all of this, yes, you have to stay here for the location. It is one and a half blocks away from the Duomo and two blocks from Piazza Vecchio. It is a stunning location and you will not find a hotel anywhere near this area for this price. Towards Vecchio there is a cafe called Cafe Perseo which has a free appetizer bar in the afternoon. You go in, stand at the counter, order a drink or a glass of wine and then help yourself to the food. To sum it all up; great neighborhood, good people, and a fantastic price.
