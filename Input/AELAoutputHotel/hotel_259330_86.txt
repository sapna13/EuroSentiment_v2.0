{"text":"Dont stay here!!!!!! The Grand Paradise is anything but GRAND! The A\/C in my room was broken when I arrived and they refused to change my room for 3 days!!!!!!!! (be aware of room 6323). I slept on the balcony in a plastic chair because it was to hot in the room. Once they moved me out of the room they instantly put others in the same room knowing that the A\/C was broken and they were on their Honeymoon. The staff is very arogant and rude to all their customers, they could care less about your problem and you even have to wait in line to complain because everyone is complaining ! The 2 rooms I stayed in were both infested with CockRoaches, the lamps were broken, and most things were in a state of disrepair in both rooms. I've stayed in motel 6's that were a Hilton compaired to this place! The food was horrific! Lost about 5lbs from a diet of pinapple for a week because the rest of the food was nasty. Thier so cheap there that the maids were digging the used shampoo bottles out of the trash and refilling them for reuse!!! Dont stay here - Go to the Magestic Colonial I had friends staying there and it was absolulty wonderful ( I went there to visit 2 times with a day pass). This was the first vacation I've ever been on that I couldnt wait to be back home and at work it was so bad!!!! The grounds and pool were well kept, but everything else was a nightmare - once they have your money they dont care if your happy with your stay or not. ","annotations":[]}
