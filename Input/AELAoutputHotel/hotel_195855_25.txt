{"text":"AMAZING... Stay at This Hotel Okay... I travel lots and I don't give out 5s unless I'm wow'd and this hotel really accomplished that. First of all I was at another hotel in Florence and checked out early in the morning because it wasn't what we expected. Expecting to just drop our bags and head out for the day we showed up in the lobby at 7:30am. Not only did they give me a room they upgraded us to a room facing the Duomo on the upper floor of the hotel. They treated me like a king even though I hadn't shaved for a couple days and was wearing shorts and a t-shirt.The room itself was world class. Beautiful cedar lined closest... that was fit for Armani... we only had t-shirts but it was nice to look at. The bed had LINEN... yes LINEN sheets since it was summertime... the thing was a work of art with about 10 down pillows. Great work area that I used to catch up with the office for a few hours.The staff went out of their way not only to greet you but ask what you had planned for the day and then almost always offered little suggestions and tips to make it more enjoyable. Concierge helped with train tickets and added them to the bill without any extra hassle.Common areas in the hotel are also beautiful. Didn't eat in the restaurant but the food looked great. Go to the Gilli right across the street for the best espresso and desserts on the planet. ","annotations":[]}
