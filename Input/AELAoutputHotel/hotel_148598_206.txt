{"text":"Beautiful Hotel Property but Rent a Car! The Rio Mar was beautiful. The grounds were vibrant and very well maintained. The guest room was spacious and contemporary. The restaurants exceeded our expectations by far, especially Palio and The Grille Room. The cuisine and presentations were amazing. Breakfast was inconsistent and rather costly, however. Overall the service throughout the hotel property was above par. However, the housekeeping staff left quite a bit to be desired. Whenthe staff cleaned our room, it did an adequate job. However, the staff was able to actually address our guest room between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. less than 50% of the time. Most days when we returned from the beach or other daytime activities (no earlier than 4:30 p.m. for 10 consecutive days) to prepare for the evening, the housekeeping staff had not made up our room and we were constrained to settle for fresh towels and toiletries. This was very disappointing, especially for a hotel at this price point and star rating.One caveat√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√®f you plan to stay any longer than three or four days, you really should rent a car. Unless, you are the very antithesis of an adventurer, you will want off the Rio Mar island at some point.Then you will be at the mercy of the Avis desk on site and its exorbitant rental rates or, even worse, the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ shuttle service. So, take this advice and rent a car to pick up from the airport (which by the way is over 20 miles away) when you plan your stay.Would I return? Perhaps not on my next visit to Puerto Rico because I liked the off-property offerings in the Isla Verde and San Juan areas much more. Nonetheless, for a theoretically all inclusive type of vacation experience in Puerto Rico, I highly recommend the Rio Mar. ","annotations":[]}
