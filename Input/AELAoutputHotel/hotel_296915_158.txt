{"text":"So Suite...... Ssshhh........here's a secret. The Pulitzer has a Suite, and it's fabulous...Despite several hundred positive reviews, no one appeared to have stayed in anything other than a standard room. We wanted something different , as it was our 10th Wedding Anniversary. I looked on the Hotel website and noticed they had 1 Suite (only one) in the Hotel, and enquired about availability. It was fortunately available, and exceptional value at 310 Euros per night.We arrived on Thursday afternoon after a decent flight. The reception staff were very cheerful, and I had paid for a 'celebration package' for the room. This entailed roses, champagne, chocolates, breakfast in bed, and a nice hot bath to await us.We were given our key and shown to our room. Upon entering my wife (who suspected nothing) , was blown away. The room was beautiful, decked out in chocolate browns , whites and greys, and luxurious. The room was very large, with a 4 poster bed in the centre. It really could not be faulted.As if we weren't already delighted, I pulled back the curtains to reveal an amazing Terrace\/balcony, which was just decadent. It was very large, decked in solid wood throughout, and had loungers , remote controlled awnings, plants and a large table. We felt like royalty. The bathroom also didn't disappoint. Whilst quite narrow, they had made best use of the space with some natural light, and both a wetroom and a bath. All fixtures and fittings were of the highest quality.There are numerous other things that I could mention, including a fabulous Denon Speaker system throughout the suite, which allows you to connect your ipod and enjoy music in the bathroom, bedroom and terrace. There's also a 42 plasma tv, and various books.Breakfast was good, pretty standard fare, but nice.The location is perfect, a stones throw from the market square and las ramblas. If you are looking to stay in Barca, and want to treat yourself, look no further. Believe the hype..
