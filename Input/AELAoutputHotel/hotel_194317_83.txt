{"text":"Clean,friendly and central location It took us 20minutes to walk from Central station to the hotel. We didn't rush because we wanted to absorb the architecture and various sights. We saw Dam Square and 'The 9 Streets' just off from Spuistraat, the route we had taken.Once inside the room was clean, the view was good and the hotel staff friendly. We chose not to eat breakfast here, but instead along the road at Cafe Luxemberg. For 20 euros we enjoyed a good breakfast which kept us going for most of the day.The evening meal was difficult because all along the Spuistraat were some really classy restaurants. We dined in Restaurant Luden about 3 doors from the Hotel. Weird having a cat around our legs whilst dining. Despite this the meal was superb.A bar with a relaxed atmosphere was opposite the Hotel. There were various shops off the Spui in a predestrianised zone as well as all kinds in the '9 Streets' location.The Abraxis coffee shop is along the Spuistraat, where we had a small amount of the Hash Brownie Cake (which an hour later made us both feel relaxed). The staff were friendly and helpful.An Irish pub is just off Spuistraat which served up a great Steak  Guiness pie. Other sights we visited were the Museums, Red Light Area (preferred the daytime than the evening to visit) and department stores.Also worth doing is the candlelight cruise. A 2hr gentle boat cruise around the canal waterways. Wine and cheese and a guide made it very enjoyable, not sure about the Shadows music in the background. Amazing to see how many live in houseboats.We had a great 2 nights in Amsterdam.
