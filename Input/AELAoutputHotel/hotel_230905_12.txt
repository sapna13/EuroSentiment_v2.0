{"text":"Amazing staff and a Great Hotel This hotel is located in the heart of the Museum district. It is close shopping and trams that will take you anywhere you want to go. The longest tram ride was 15 minutes. The rooms are large and clean. The buffet breakfast was excellent and included in the price of the room. This hotel is a great value for the price.However, what makes this hotel exceptional is the staff. We were 6 couples and were greated by Lissan at the front desk. She got us into our rooms quickly and was very helpful with hint and information about Amsterdam. During our stay my wife became ill and we were unable to leave for our next location. The hotel was booked solid as were just about every other hotel in Amsterdam. The manager, Roel, contacted a doctor to come a treat my wife. He helped us change our airline reservation and after about 2 hours of intense telephone calls he was able to find a room in a hotel nearby at a reasonable price. He didn't stop there, he was able to convince one of his steady customers, that was due to arrive that day, to go to the other hotel so that my wife wouldn't have to move. While I was out getting a prescription filled he check to make sure she was okay. When we go back to Amsterdam we would not consider staying anywhere else and would recommend it highly.John and Antoinette C ","annotations":[]}
