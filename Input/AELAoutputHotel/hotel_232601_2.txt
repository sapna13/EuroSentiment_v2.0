{"text":"Highly Recommended I spent 3 days here as a solo traveler. Very nice hotel on Western Berlin's version of 5th Avenue. The room was comfortable and quiet with plenty of space. Good A\/C. Very good breakfast (eggs , sausage and the usual European fare of fruit, cereal, yoghurt, breads, salads and cold cuts). The staff was extremely helpful. I liked the movie posters all over the hotel (unfortunately there were no posters or postcards of movies for sale). The 2nd floor was nonsmoking - the 4th floor had American movie stars. Small exercise room with cardio and weight machines.Nearby: Burger King next door. Around the corner and down the block is a grocery store and an internet cafe (3 EUR\/hr - hotel charged 8 EUR\/hr - 2008). Nice restaurants on Bleibtreu Strasse (side street to the north and west of the hotel).Getting around: The M29 bus was convenient to getting to eastern Berlin (get a transit pass!) The 109 takes you to the Berlin Zoo train station. (the stop is ~100 feet to the west of the hotel). The U-Bahn is about 2 blocks east (Uhlandstrasse).Getting to the Hotel: VERY EASY - At the airport (TXL) head towards the bus depot outside the Main Terminal (buy tickets just inside the terminal or on the bus - 2.10 EUR in 2008!). Take the 109 to Bleibtreau strasse (the stop is after Adenauerplatz and before Uhlandstrasse - I mention these two stops as they are on most maps - tell the bus driver where you want to get off). The hotel is ~100 feet to your left as you exit the bus. If arriving by train, get to Berlin Zoo using the S-Bahn (again 2.10 EUR) then go out front and get on the 109 or 110 bus (free transfer). Again your stop is Bleibtreu strasse (about 3 stops). The hotel is across the street from the stop. I dare you to find a cheaper airport transfer!!!Check the hotel's website for deals (I received a free transit pass with my reservation and a low rate).
