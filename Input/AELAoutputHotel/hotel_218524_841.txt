{"text":"Excellence - A MUST STAY for ADULTS!! WOW! I can' tsay enough about our stay Sep 30-Oct 6. To start after you book, email the concierge to arrange for a private car taxi for the 45 min drive from the airport, its only $60 and was well worth itcompared to the stories about the big bus ($50). Then we were greatedwith champagne and a cool towel to freshin up. We were staying in the Excellance Club VIP Ocean View room and were escorted to the Excellance Club to check in. It was fast, easy and worth the extra cost. The Excellence Club was a nice stop for snacks and internet (free). Our room was terrific, it was huge overlooking the pool and the ocean which was on the other side of the pool. Maidservice was 2 times daily, it never interfered with us. Our room was always neat and clean! A nice bed turndown each night with towel art and flowers or chocolate.The grounds, restaurants were all at a high level of quallity and service. Agave was the best, Toscana was good, The Grill was good and Chez Isabelle was just ok. Be sure to read the other reviews.This is a great do nothing resort. My wife and I just wanted a relaxing vacation and we got it. We are beach people and enjoyed the private beach and service on the beach. The water was warm and at times a little rough with a strong current, but we still enjoyed playing in it. We visited the pool a few times for water aerobics, polo, etc and just sitting around and talking with other guests, everyone was so friendly. I have to SHOUT OUT! to the Entertainment crew: Rey, Isabelle, Luis, Fransisco, Mariel. They made our trip excellent! Go to the nightly entertainment and the show and then the disco. Learn to speak spanish, dance and laugh! A special Thanks to Rey and Isablle for teaching us how to dance, and for sharing their country and culture with me and my wife. That left a lasting impression on us and we wantto return to enjoy more! Do make an effort to enjoy all the daily activities, you won't be disapointed.Another person I have to say thanks to is Ricardo and Eduveegis, bartenders at the Theater bar, Ricardo introduced me to the CHAI PERENIA drink(spelling?) the Dominican Mojito. He took great care of us, drinking wise, as he floated from bar to bar. Very professional!If you can't tell, all the service was EXCELLENT! the resort was EXCELLENT and we will return again! There is so much more we can say, so write to us with your questions.Greg  Michelle, FROM TEXAS!!!
