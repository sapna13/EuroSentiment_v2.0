{"text":"Nice hotel...Good Location We spent 1 night at the Holiday Inn Express City Center, prior to our Alaska cruise. I used my Holiday Inn points for a King Suite with Jacuzzi, and a Space Needle view. Although our room did not have a jacuzzi, which I wouldn't have used anyway, it was a very nice suite. It had a sitting area with sofa, a microwave, refrig, sink, and cupboards in the kitchen area, and a very small bathroom. The smallest bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel. The sink and counter area were located outside the bathroom, which seemed strange, but was actually nice to be able to use it, while my husband took a shower. The bed was very comfortable, the shower was awesome, and the suite was very clean. The suite had 2 windows, one of which was directly in line with the Space Needle...great view!! We walked all over the downtown area, as the hotel is within walking distance of everything. Downtown areas are not always the greatest, but we never felt unsafe. The Space Needle is only 4-5 blocks, and the Fish Market is around a mile, and the same to Pier 66. We ate at 13 Coins downtown, the food was very good, but very expensive!!The staff was very friendly, and very helpful with directions, and such. They do not have an airport shuttle, we took a cab, and I believe it was around $34.00. They do have a shuttle to Pier 66 though, that the front desk will arrange for you, it is $5.00 per person oneway. We enjoyed our short stay, and loved Seattle. We will be returning, and will definitely stay again at the Holiday Inn Express.
