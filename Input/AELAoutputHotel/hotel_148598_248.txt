{"text":"An Absolute Pleasure I read some reviews of the Westin that are pretty poor, and I just don't get it. I had the most glorious time at the Westin (now the Wyndham). My new husband and I planned our wedding at the Rio Mar. I do not have a single complaint. I had to admit that after reading some reviews, I was concerned about how the customer service would be. The customer service was a 10!!!! I was asked if I needed help whenever I wasn't even looking for help. The rooms are comfortable. And, if you do not have an ocean view or would rather save your pennies, the next best thing is the view of the Rain Forest. Every part of the resort property was absolutely breathtaking. The pictures on its website do not do the place justice. The beach and ocean are beautiful. The pool area is clean and relaxing. We had 80 friends and family at the hotel with us, and everyone had a glorious time. Yes, it is expensive, but it is expected at a vacation resort. Frozen drinks are $10, but you can get the local Medalla beer for $4. Dinners range from $14 to $50. You can do it pretty cheap if you wanted to. Rent a car for the day, go to the grocery and stock up on snacks, sandwiches, water and liqour. Save your money for dinner. For breakfast you can go to the coffee shop for $4 ham and cheese croissants. For lunch grab a foot long hot dog for $7. For dinner you can sit at the Bistro bar and have a pizza for $14. Depending on how adventerous you are, a rental car would be advisable, but not necessary. We only rented a car one day and went to the rain forest and Old San Juan. We were content the rest of the time just hanging out at the beach and relaxing. The iguanas add entertainment. Word of warning, the casino closed the day we left. Rumor is that it will be closed until October for rennovations. I do not have a bad thing to say about the Westin. iIcould not have asked for a more perfect vacation with family and friends, wedding or honeymoon. Enjoy!!!
