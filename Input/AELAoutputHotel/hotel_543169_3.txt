{"text":"Very convenient This hotel was exactly what we needed for our last night in Europe. We had been there almost a month and stayed in some interesting places, so it was nice to have a clean, nice size room for our last night. We took the train from Paris to Frankfurt and just walked to Flemings. It was very easy to find. I liked the proximity to the Hauptbahnhof (main train station). We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant that night, which was practically empty. The food was good and the atmosphere was pleasant. We liked having the free wifi as well, that was very nice. The one thing that kind of put a damper on our stay is that when we were checking out they tried to charge us 100 euros even though I had booked our room online for 68. They worked to get it fixed but we had to leave to catch our flight to the States before they could get it all fixed. The good part was that I gave them my e-mail address and when I got home I had an e-mail waiting for me. Our Credit card had three pending charges on it totally over $300 but as far as we can tell, they only charged us 68 euros and the rest of the charges should fall off. My advice would be that if you book online before you go, make sure that you take the piece of paper that says how much you booked your room for because that might not be stated on your reservation in their system. Because I had this piece of paper, the process was a bit smoother. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":192,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":188}]}
