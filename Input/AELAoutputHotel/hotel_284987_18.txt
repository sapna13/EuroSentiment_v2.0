{"text":"Enlightened all of our senses: Beautiful resort with Grade A Service! We stayed at Gran Melia for a week Oct 29th-Nov 6th. The location was ideal: 5 minutes to El Yunque, 20 minutes to Fajardo (Ferries, Kayaking) and 25 minutes to Old San Juan where we spent the weekend. After a busy weekend in Old San Juan, returning to Gran Melia was like a coming home to a private oasis in Paradise... The interior and exterior of the grounds are aromatic and illuminary. Exotic, melodic, up-tempo music fills each of the indoor and outdoor spaces. Our room was beautiful and the bed the most comfortable one we've ever experienced in our lives (coming home to what we thought was a nice bed, was a bit of a disappointment)!Spend the money for the Royal Service Treatment, it pays for itself in spades with a free nightly happy hour from 6-9pm, a private Royal Service Pool, discounted services, and truly amazing, personalized service from the staff. We would specifically like to thank our butlers Manuel and Angel, who were amazing! Manuel took the time to call us on his days off to ensure our side trips were going smoothly and truly, gave us extremely personalized attention. As well, Pedro in the RS Lounge was fantastic, Leslie at the Pool was delightful, and Josh the Manager was always on call.The breakfast buffet is fresh and fantastic, Tempo for dinner was above average. Definitely venture out of the resort for more local flavors. With a rental car (highly recommended) access to all points of interest were quick and easy.As well, thank you to all of the proud, gracious, and kind people of Puerto Rico who took the time to ensure we always saw the most beautiful businesses and lands of the island. We will definitely return to enjoy your paradise again...Best~Rachelle  Eddie McKinney ","annotations":[{"endOffset":676,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":672},{"endOffset":676,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":672}]}
