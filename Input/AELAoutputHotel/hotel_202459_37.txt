{"text":"Fantastic place This hotel is faultless if you are a normal person.We booked this after the one we had booked, The Grand Hotel Esplande, was having it's leisure facilities refurbished. The hotel didn't tell us about this we picked it up when we were looking at it on Expedia at the very last minute. So thanks for that Expedia!Anyway the hotel, having not been to Berlin before, I hadn't a clue what or where we were staying. Went on the reviews from this site as always, so here goes,Bad points - None, as in none at all.Good points - Staff - superb. Polite, helpful, etc etc. Spot on.Food - The Noodle Bar - Excellent. Didnt try the other, Heat or the bar so cannot comment. Also didn't try the breakfast.Bars - The bar in the atrium is brilliant especially with that aquarium above you! The Aqua Bar downstairs near the Noodle Bar is superb and very Chique. Cocktails are top notch , but they are E10 each on average, Long Island Iced Tea or the Mai Tai or for pure alcohol the St Pauli Killer.Gym - Brilliant. Went in three times, had it all to ourselves. Treadmills, x trainers, weights, bikes etc all in superb condition.Pool - Nice with counter current which is a right laugh till you get used to it.Sauna - Ace, three saunas and like has been said before, they are mixed and you can go in naked, but this explained on all the doors and in the changing rooms. The massage facilities etc looked nice as well but didnt use them.The hotel is within two minutes of the u bahn etc and the TV tower.For a top steak go out of the hotel turn left, and within 100 yards on the left there is a nice restaurant called Block House. Opposite the hotel to the left across the park is a bowling alley, once again this is a nice place not some seedy joint.The rooms - nice, spotless, with everything you need apart from an iron which is available on request.Radisson Berlin - superb. Would stay here again without a doubt. The staff were superb as was everything else.
