{"text":"Very acceptable night before flight We had a less than 12 hour stay before leaving for our early morning flight, but I found the stay perfectly acceptable. The hotel seems to be doing some major renovations to rooms right now. The staff was nice and friendly but forgot to tell us about the lounge where I would have loved to get a glass of red wine after checking in Sunday night. When I saw it Monday morning the woman at the front desk apologized that the evening staff had not informed us. Our room was nice and large and seemed clean except it appeared the person cleaning missed an area of the bathroom counter. Everything is in one room for the bathroom rather than a sink outside the room with shower\/toilet. The counter is very long, though, so lots of room there. We did hear airplane noise but we travel with a Brookstone travel alarm clock\/sound machine so we are able to drown out hotel noise in general. I had to grab some breakfast to go so didn't get to try much. I did like the warm hard-boiled eggs, unlike some other reviewers and of course the yogurt was just fine. One thing that surprised me was that the coffee wasn't that great which is surprising in the state of Washington. The coffee is Boyds from Portland.....maybe this BW should switch to a local Seattle coffee. The breakfast area did appear very nice and clean so maybe there have been changes since a previous review. The internet worked just fine in our room for my husband and he was even able to go to the business center and print out our boarding passes ~ that was a nice plus. There was a stuffed chair and ottoman in our room, but you couldn't watch the TV from it -- you could only watch the tv from the bed. Actually with the layout you can have someone at the desk on the computer, another person in the big chair reading and another on the bed watching TV, so guess it's ok. Lots of channels on the cable TV but no HBO or Cinemax if that's what you want. They have Starz. This BW wasn't the closest place to the airport but was just fine. A few minutes down International Blvd and you are at SEA-TAC. I would definitely stay here again if I needed a place close to the airport. The price was much better than others of the same quality.
