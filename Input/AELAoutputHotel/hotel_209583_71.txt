{"text":"What a wonderful vacation! I will start my review by saying I'm glad I kept an open mind and took most of the reviews with a grain of salt.Reviews with helpful information are wonderful but like movie reviews it really is all about personal preference. If you are used to staying in a 5 star hotel in North America and are planning to compare this hotel to that than you might be disappointed. Our family of 6 stayed at the Palace May 19-26. Before I begin (and this is something I didn't see on any other reviews) I will fore warn you that depending on where you are from, you will either have to pay a fee to enter the country or a fee to leave it. Coming from the US we had to pay $10 per person at the airport so we could enter the country. Not a huge amount but definitely something we didn't expect. Check in was very quick and easy - we didn't even have time to finish our welcome drinks before we were taken to our rooms. My husband and I upgraded to a suite which was a benefit with 4 kids who spent a lot of time in our room before heading out to excursions or meals. The extra living room area was used a lot! Unfortunately when we upgraded we were told we would get extras that in fact were not included. It seems that not everyone is aware of exactly what really is included so be careful. ROOMS: We had no problems at all with our rooms except the beds were very hard.POOL\/BEACH: Like most reviews said, both the pool and the beach were AWESOME! I can't find a thing to complain about. The pool bar staff was great and Henry is the best! It is very easy to tell where our beach ended - the neighboring resorts weren't as good at keeping theirs groomed in our opinion.FOOD: Well now - the food can be a little (my daughter says weird) but I'll say different. There are some dishes that you won't find anywhere else but there. We have a family of 1\/2 picky and 1\/2 not so picky. if you are a picky eater just stick to what you know. The Steakhouse was not our favorite, the Mexican place was hit and miss but probably our favorite. The Pizza place was good but don't eat the tuna pizza - sounds gross??? it was and it made my daughter very ill.EXCURSIONS: Let me say right away that the snorkeling in the DR is not as good as you will find in other Caribbean locales. If you are going and expecting to see great snorkeling you won't. That said, The Caribbean Festival was fun, the party after the snorkeling was the best part. They put on a great show and work really hard at getting everyone involved. The Segway tour ROCKED!!! Great time for a great price. We did the 3 hour tour for $50 per person. The speed boat tour also had some snorkeling it was better than the first tour. It was a good time.TIPS: #1 - All reviews were right - bring LOTS of sunscreen - the higher SPF the better, also bring aloe.#2 - Bring LOTS of singles for tipping we brought $300 for 6 of us (3 rooms for 7 days plus bar and restaurant tipping) and just had enough - a dollar goes a long way. Also be prepared to tip at the airport both ways as you are not allowed to carry your own luggage.#3 - Go prepared for anything, all pharmacy type items are extremely expensive (ie. feminine products ($15 a box)). #4 - Bring snacks#5 - This resort does not have a lot for teens and kids to do so come prepared - although the kids never complained of being bored (they weren't allowed to) they certainly had that look on occasion.#6 - like on most cruise ships the photos taken of you around the resort only cost you $$ if you decide to buy them later. Most of them are well worth the $8 they charge.All in all a very relaxing trip - by far the most relaxed I've been in a very long time. If you go with an open mind and don't let the little things upset you then you'll have a great time.Would we go back??? - absolutely!!!!!
