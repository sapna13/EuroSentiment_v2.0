{"text":"Chic, loved the renovations My husband and I stayed at the Waikiki Parc for the first two nights for our two week Hawaiian vacation. Wakiki is not my favorite spot, but is a great stop to recoup after the long trip from the east coast. The hotel is well hidden and with the construction and one way streets, a little difficult to find. But once there, an easy walk to everything. The hotel is very chic and comtemporary. We were upgraded to an oceanfront room. The hotel sits a bit back from the ocean and inbetween two other hotels, but it was still a perfect oceanfront room. The room was quite small. The bedding was the most comfortable I slept in the two weeks in Hawaii and we were at 4 other resorts. Windows went across the whole front of our room, coverd by wooden shutters. The balcony was nice to just sit on, but we were hardly in our room. Flat screenTV was a bonus, not all resorts have them yet. Roof top pool small, and not even being used when we walked up to view it.The staff was helpful and friendly. We very pleased with the chocolates left on our bed in celebration of our 25th anniversary.Biggest draw back is, no place to eat in the hotel. Everyone likes to get up and not have to run out for coffee, but we made the best of it and walked the beach and found coffe along the way. This hotel needs a coffee shop.The hotel was very clean, other than the front rug as you entered. Maybe when the renovations are completed, this problem will be corrected. We eat on the main strip. Cheseburger Paradise and Cheese- Cake Factory were great. Great hotel for a couple days only. Not the resort feel we like, but a good rest for a couple days in Waikiki. Went to Pearl Harbor, a must everytime we go. I would return to this hotel but only as a day or two stop. Perfect for our needs.
