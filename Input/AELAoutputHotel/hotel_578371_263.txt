{"text":"Sadly Disappointed Our family just returned from a week at the Majestic Colonial and sadly we were disappointed!! It was our first time to Punta Cana; we have travelled to Mexico many times, but thought we would give the Dominican a try.The beach and the weather we had was the best we have ever had on any holiday we have travelled. The beach was really the only thing that made our trip an enjoyable one!We had booked a garden view room, but was given a room that faced the construction of the new addition to the resort. I had complained to the front desk, but they told me there was no other rooms available...whatever!!The staff was friendly, but there was very limited staff!! At the pool bars or the outdoor bars, you would need to wait at least 10 minutes before you were served!! Half the time we just gave up waiting. And the alcoholic drinks were poorly made! The tropical drinks were spoiled with too much alcohol in them!! We ended up just drinking bottled water! The soft drinks were not any better, they were very warm with ice cubes put in them.The food was another big disappointment!! We ate at the buffet mostly because we had our 2 boys with us. The food was bland, not much variety - same food every day!! Big disappointment!!!The pool was nice....but we spent most of our time at the beach! The beach is gorgeous!! Most beautiful beach we have seen!The nightlife.....we'll let's just say...there isnt one. Thank goodness our boys were content playing pool, or chess in the sports area. If it did rain....I wouldnt know what we would have done to keep us entertained??Overall....I would not recommend this resort to my friends or family. Because it was our first time to Punta Cana I can not compare it to another resort....but we will definately travel back to Mexico before to travel to Punta Cana again!
