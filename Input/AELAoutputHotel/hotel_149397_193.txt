{"text":"Loved the Bavaro Princess Went to the DR punta cana Oct. 13 - 20. Was the most relaxing vacation me and my husband had ever been on. First time to the caribbean. Booked with AC platinum.Beach was sooo beautiful. Never had a problem getting a hut thing, could be that it was off season. People are so nice and friendly, always a Hola. Some didn't speak much English and we do not speak much spanish however I did write down a few phrases I thought I might need, always found a way to communicate. Remember you are in the caribbean it's your vacation relax enjoy . Yes it's a much slower pace eg. asked for extra sugar in room ( bring your own coffee, there is a coffee maker in room takes basket filters, we took tim's so glad we did)extra sugar took 3 hours to get no biggy hubby went to platinum lounge and got some until it arrived. Asked for an ashtray in room took 2 days., no problem , use to smoking outside anyway and there are ashtrays all over the resort. The rooms were spaceous and clean. Had our own loungers on our patio.Grounds were very well maintained it's a big resort but there is a trolley that runs frequently besides the walk is nice.Food ,there is something for everyone we are picky eaters and one of us has IBS which limites food choices to begin with but we always found something to eat. Morning breakfast buffetafternoon El Gaucho had a buffet for lunch and dinner we did the a la carte resturants El Licey and Bella Pasta were our favourites.Did one excursion the tropical storm snorkling its okay a real eyeopen to what is on the outside of the resort ( we arrived a night).We are definately going back.
