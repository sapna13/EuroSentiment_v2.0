{"text":"Fantastic Honeyymoon We chose Bali as our Honeymoon as neither of us had been there before and we wanted to go to the Far East. Upon arrival at the airport you are required to pay $25 airport tax so be pepared for that. When we pulled up to the Westin the entrance was awesome there were 4-5 conceirge waiting and a Balinese musician, we were offered cold flannels and a cocktail as soon as we arrived. Check in took about 10 minutes and as we were honeymooners we received a complimentry hours massage each. The room was spacious huge bed and good size bathroom with Molton Brown Products No bath though. We received chocolates or cake every day around 5pm freshly made. The pool area is clean with a swim up bar. The beach area is literally 20 steps from the pool to the sea. There are a few balinese sellers on the beach they all have the same t shirts on with different numbers they dont hassle you though. Breakfast is good a wide variety The evening food was awesome every day we had something different and each time just fab. All the staff are very friendly and will go out of their way. You can easily access the other hotels which you can eat in also which is right next door. Not much entertaiment going on but jump in a cab and head into town wher e there is loads going on its about 15 mins and around $6 each way. I would definately reccomend this hotel we had a lovely time ","annotations":[{"endOffset":628,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":618}]}
