{"text":"Good luck sleeping on Fri or Sat nite... When we first checked in, apparently there had been a mix-up with dates (on their end). The woman we were dealing with was extremely unhelpful and we would have been out in the cold had her co-worker not stepped in. He cleared everything up within minutes. He obviously had a clue and was a good guy, whereas she was just cold and unhelpful altogether. She didn't even apologize about her mistake.The hotel has a funky vibe and the room was extremely comfortable. The elevators are so dark i literally thought that the lights were broken or something. Not so comfortable when there's more than you and a friend standing in there.Our room had a balcony that overlooked the courtyard area that is next to the restaurant (Dragonfly), which at first i thought was great, but we were to be in for a surprise later on...Apparently every Friday and Saturday nite, that area turns into a little nightclub type scene complete with a DJ and booming PA system (all under a tent). If you plan on staying either of those nights during the week, be aware of the whereabouts of your room and whether it overlooks the courtyard or not. Unless you have no problem with the annoying, throbbing oonst oonst pulsing and blaring through the walls and windows at 1AM while you're just trying to get some good ol shut-eye. Even with the balcony door double shut (there's a slider in addition to the door itself) and the curtains closed, it was maddening. Consider yourself forewarned. ","annotations":[]}
