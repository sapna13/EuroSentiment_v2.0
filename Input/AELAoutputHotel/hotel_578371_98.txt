{"text":"Never going back Okay, my husband and I went down there for a wedding. Just got back yesterday.Arrived at the resort only to find that half our groug (about 25 people) didn`t have rooms ready at 3:00 pm. Didn`t seem like a huge issue at first. We were told it would be about an hour and we all went to get a drink.Those included who did not have a room ready were the bride and groom, the brides parents, my husband and I and many others.Went back an hour later, luckily our room was ready however almost everyone elses was not. Found out that the resort had double booked many rooms and one couple from our group actually got moved to another resort. They did however get bands so they could come and go into Majestic Colonial.Bride and Groom didn`t get a room until around 9 and staff refused to give them towel cards so they could go swiming. Buffet was okay. Large selection, some food was cold when it should have been hot. Covers on food might have helped keep the heat in. Le Gourmet was the only meal we really enjoyed.Almost immediately half our group was sick. Violently throwing up, fevers, and chest problems. Mother of the groom was rushed to the hospital but returned next day. There is a clinic on site but its $90.00 to basically walk through the door and then if you need anything another arm and leg.Father of the Bride also became very ill staying in his room a great deal of the time.Bar was okay. Not a huge selection for liquor (premium) and if you wanted what they did have you had to pay. (bailey`s ect)When we went to Sandals Jamaica Ocho Rios all liquor was included. Even things like Covasia and Grand Marnier.If you ordered a slushy like drink, ie Pina Colada or Daquiri`s you had better as for alcohol otherwise you aren`t getting it. On the other side, my rum and coke had way more run then coke.Beach was really nice, water was worm. Clothing on the beach was optional so there were a lot of breasts and banana hammocks.Bride and Groom got sick on last day. Thankfully not the wedding and and when we got back home had to go to the doctors.Mother of the brides luggage did not make it to the airport even though the bus driver assured us it went on the bus. Dont know how they can assure us of that when it wasnt there. Had to pay themselves to have the luggage come by taxi and yes, they did get a receipt. I would be asking the hotel for the money.Overall we still had a good time as we were with our friends for a wedding but I would never go back there.
