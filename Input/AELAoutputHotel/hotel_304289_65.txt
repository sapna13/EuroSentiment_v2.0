{"text":"Good but staff not good at service recovery This is a belated review cause I only learnt about the TA and joined as a member last Oct\/Nov.Anyway, I am a HH Gold member and when I checked in, I was given an upgrade immediately, which was good.The Executive Floor was under renovation so there was a fair bit of noise in the morning but it was OK. The lounge was closed and a makeshift one was provided in one of the rooms on the same floor. Drinks\/snacks were limited though.I notice that the Hilton Group has managed to minimise the influence of local culture on its service style. In this hotel, everyone was businesslike - polite, efficient but somewhat distant. It was not a problem for me as I was on a business trip during this stay. Efficiency ranks high under such circumstances.I flew into Tokyo from the US on this trip and was running out of clean suits to wear. I decided to use the 4-hour dry cleaning service made available to those on the Executive Floor at no extra charge. The pair of pants came back to me just 15 mins before I had to leave for my business appt. I was in a hurry and didn't manage to check on the condition of my pants prior to leaving the hotel.You could imagine how embarrassed I was when a Japanese lady on my client's team pointed out that the side pocket of my black pants had white bits stuck on it and the pocket also appeared torn. I thanked her profusely for it must have taken her a lot of courage to point this out to a relative stranger; by Japanese standards, this was bold but only for my good.I returned to the hotel and the housekeeping people came in the evening for the pants, saying that they would do everything to fix it.The next day was a saturday and I was out for the most part,when I returned at night, I ddn't see the pants in my room. I went down to talk to the manager at the front desk. He called the housekeeping manager down to see me. He came with the pants but both men didn't apologize; the front desk manager said to me with a straight face - it is fixed now.When I came back to Singapore and wore the pants again, it was torn at the same place. I travel too much and can't afford the time to take this up with the Hilton mgt, may be I should?Apart from this incident, the hotel is actually fine, it is in a convenient location. The lobby has got a cafe\/bar that is patronised by both locals and foreigners. It has got a nice ambience.I will probably stay there again - for business, NOT for vacation.Hope this helps!
