{"text":"First Class City Hotel We stayed at the Harbour Plaza Hotel for three nights in April 2007. My family (husband, sister and parents) and I had been visiting relatives in New Zealand and decided to have a few nights in Hong Kong on the way back to England. We had an amazing time - falling in love with both the hotel and the city itself. We have stayed in many hotels, but the Harbour Plaza was certainly the best hotel I've ever stayed in. We arrived at the hotel at 7.30am after a 13 hour flight, fully prepared to have to wait for a good few hours until we got our rooms (we had already decided that we would go to the pool\/spa for a relax!), but were amazed when we were shown instantly to our rooms.The facilities and service at the hotel was first class - there were staff everywhere and they couldn't do enough for us.We went on three trips (all booked with the concierge using the leaflets on the desk at the front of the hotel), two evenings (shopping\/sightseaing\/boat tour\/meal etc) and one daytime (sightseeing), which were all excellent. We were picked up and dropped off at the hotel, and shown around the sights by an english speaking tour guide (who was very funny). Doing these tours made us feel that although we only spent a short time in Hong Kong, we saw all the top sights.I would highly recommend this hotel - it is expensive, but definatly worth every penny!
