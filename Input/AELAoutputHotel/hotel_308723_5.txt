{"text":"Nice relaxing boutique hotel - we love it It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ unfortunate that we could only get two days out of the three in Feb 08 that we wanted in this nice and comfortable but small boutique hotel. We were certainly quite impressed with the hotel quality and its value for money. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were shown to a small room where the check-in desks were located. We were then given cool wash towels to refresh ourselves and welcome drink vouchers that you can redeem at their bar at any time. All the staff were quite polite and helpful throughout our stay.The hotel is located on a one-way street, away from the main Kuta shopping area and across the road from the beach. Being away from the hustle and bustle, gives it a more secluded relaxing feel√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√∫ery much a world on its own. A taxi trip into town is quite reasonable; about Rp15,000 (about US$2) each way. Alam Kulkul definitely has a Balinese feel to it, as there are lots of statues and potteries set out in its garden outside the rooms. The gardens have a few varieties of local tropical fruits which you are welcome to help yourself to, if they are ripe. Our standard Alam room was located at the back of the complex, facing a small swimming pool and being on a ground floor had more of a resort-feel to it. I had a good time swimming in the pool, but unfortunately my partner couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ, due to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√òhat time of the month√à√\u2020\u2022? The room was reasonable sized, slightly dark but well furnished with a comfortable king-sized bed. The concrete bathtub was slightly old but large enough for my partner and I. Mosquitoes are a bit of a problem in the room as the plants\/gardens and the damp weather do tend to attract them. The room do have electric mosquitoes repellent but we ended up asking housekeeping for an insect spray which they gladly provided.We had a relaxing time in AlamKulkul and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who wants value for money, enjoy a boutique hotel with a Balinese feel but don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mind the location.
