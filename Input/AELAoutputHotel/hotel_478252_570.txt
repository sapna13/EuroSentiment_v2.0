{"text":"Gran Bahia Beach is beautiful We stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe from July 18th through the 23rd with a party of 14 people. The place is beautiful but it is as huge as everyone says. We stayed in Building 7 by the beach. The lower the number the closer to the beach. There are Trams that run you back and forth from the beach to the lobby. They are no problem to get on but I would prefer a little bit of a smaller resort. But I have to say the grounds were beautiful and lush everywhere you looked.Beach and Service: The people who worked at the resort were always helpful and ready with a smile. I really enjoyed how nice they were. If you are a beach lover (we are) you will love it! It is really one of the nicest beaches we have ever been to and we have been to quite a few. To get the best seating on the beach get up a little early and save your seats. I know some people do not like that but we spent the entire day there so it was important enough to me to get some shade. Food: The food was not our favorite thing about the resort. We were in the Dominican Republic and of course their food was prepared the way they eat. We just didn't care for it that much. (The buffets) The ala carte restaurants we went to were great. We went to the Japanese, Italian and Medditerrean. We enjoyed them all very much. Make your reservations early. We made them as soon as we got there. Rooms: Absolutely no complaints. They were large and clean. The beds were pretty comfortable and they were kept nice and clean by the staff. (Leave a few dollars every day)Entertainment: The shows aren't very good. We watched one or two. We may have missed a few of the good ones. They had the Lion King which seemed like a nice production but we didn't stay. The casino is tiny and has very few slots ( what I play) and just a few table games. Not a great casino but it was something to do.Excursions: We booked the speed boats. It was 4 hours long. Left at 12:00 pm and got back a little after 4:00pm. Everyone who went really enjoyed it. They took you to a small island and after speed boating you went snorkeling. We also took a bannana boat ride. A big tube that is pulled through the water. Five of us took the ride and it was only 10 or 15 dollars a person and we had a blast.Overall: We got a great price and it was more than worth what we paid. You truly make your own good time and if you love the beach you will not be disappointed by this beautiful place!
