{"text":"Quite simply outstanding service. This being our second trip to Sydney we decided to try a differant hotel. After reading some reveiws about this hotel on TA we were expecting high things. We were not dissapointed in the slightest. On arrival we were welcomed with a warm smile and friendly, yet respectfull greeting by the doorstaff, and help into the hotel with our luggage. The front desk staff were hugely polite and helpful offering me the best room in the hotel on finding out I had booked our stay here to coinside with my girlfriends birthday. And what a room. On the top floor, this corner room seemed to be in the converted loft area of the hotel and was simply huge. Decorated to a very high spec with all the mod cons you'd expect from a 5* hotel as well. The concierge was very knoledgable and was very happy to go out of his way to help us organise excursions, get us a table at restaurants that I knew were booked out months in advance after trying myself, and generally being very helpfull. The Club lounge is very nice with evening drinks and canapes being served nightly and a breakfast service second to none. The choices offered were anything you desired it seemd! Overall from our arrival to departure the hotel's staff couldn't have done more for us even with the hectic too'ings and frowing's of the Indian cricket team from the hotel and the swarves of press camped out on the doorstep.Ive stayed at some of the leading hotels in the world and i'm happy to rate the Radisson Plaza in my top 3.
