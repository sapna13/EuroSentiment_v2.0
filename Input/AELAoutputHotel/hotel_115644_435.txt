{"text":"Great honeymoon! Stayed for four night at the Chancellor after reading all the wonderful reviews on this forum. It was great! I requested for a newer room as it was our honeymoon, and we got room 1003. We had a bottle of champagne and a jr of sweets upon our arrival. I think this equates to service any 5 star hotel gives. In fact, maybe even more! Unless you are staying in the honeymoon or presidentail suite, how many other hotels give complimentary champagne? Beautiful room. Good size. Comfy bed. Loved their pillow menu! The bathroom was a bit small, but really really spotlessly clean. Never got to try their tub though.All the extra touches makes this hotel really special, eg the pillow menu which I had mentioned, the rubber duckie. Was a little disappointed that we were not told there was complimentaty choc chip cookies and apples and popcorn at the lobby. Guess we should have kept our eyes open. Didn't realise it until the last few moments when we were waiting for our shuttle in the lobby. Would have been nice if the front desk mentioned it to us upon our check in. Would have made our stay a lot more fun - to come back to this wonderful hotel and grab a cookie on the way up to our room :)But nevertheless, great hotel with a more-than-fair price. The so-called noise din't bother us at all. Why would anyone complain about falling asleep to the bells of the cable cars?
