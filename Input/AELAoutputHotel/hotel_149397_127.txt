{"text":"It was not bad Toronto, Ontario.I was at this resort from Feb 21-28th. I went with my 2 girlfriends who are frequent travellers down south and they also said it was a below average resort. For me, I've been to a few places (Cayman island, Cozumel, Bahamas) but I never thought my trip to Punta Cana would be like this. First, I have to say that the beach is FABULOUS! It is the only reason why I rank it a 3 star. The resort has nice landscaping but I think instead of putting attention to the outside land area, there needs to be more work done to the rooms. I do expect that the rooms will have a musky smell but our room (in front of the beach) stunk like heavy mildew and was worse when the AC was on. It blew a stench of mildew into our faces constantly! I was also disappointed with the bathroom. I wanted to wear rubber boots when I was taking a shower. The water did not drain so I was showering in a puddle of dirt and other junk that was back logged from the drain. The bathroom condition was disgusting. As for the food, it was okay. I never touched the fresh fruit or the salads but always had the foods that were hot. My friend ate the green salads and fruits and got a little sick. So I stayed away from that. The main buffet in the lobby area was decent so we ate there frequently. The late night snack buffet is disgusting but there is not anything else to eat because food cooking stops at 10pm. The resort is huge so you have to take a trolley to get around. It's great to use during the day but watch out if you decide to stay out past midnight, there is none to be found. From the front lobby to our room, it was a brisk walk of 15-20 mins!!! Which bring about another point, there are millions of mosquitoes so make sure you go to a travel clinic to get Anti-Malarial medications and bug spray. My friends and I were eaten ALIVE, especially at night when we had to walk back to our room!!!!Most of the staff were friendly but some of them needed to learn some manners. Since we were 3 females, the male workers were sometimes too aggressive and persistent in hanging out with us. Just really annoying because they wouldn't take NO as an answer. We met a gentleman who was there with his wife from Grand Rapids, Michigan who we had to pretend was one of my friends father. He would come over and tell the workers to beat it! It worked because he was a BIG giant and very serious looking. Thank you Richard and Sue!!!The entertainment (nightly theatre) is not that great but there isn't much else to do after dinner. On our first night, we were told to go to the hotel's night club. So we went but the details were a secret. At the front of the lobby, there was this cab\/shuttle that picked us up (looked like a hotel shuttle, but isn't) and took us about 10 mins from the hotel. It was Aeraeito (?). So when we got there, we thought it was part of the hotel (all inclusive) so we ordered drinks but then the bartender said that each drink was $7!!! Then another bartender said it was $6\/ drink. The first bartender was a complete liar and scammer! The odd thing is, they kept saying that they were part of the Bavaro Princess Hotel but the club was a separate cost. At the end of the night, we left the club thinking that we could take that shuttle back to the lobby, but nope, we had to pay to get back (again many different quotes of prices). So what they should have told us: Bring lots of money because we'll give you a free ride going there but you're on your own after you get out of that shuttle, you have to pay for drinks and ride home. We didn't bring enough money (just enough to tip hotel workers) so we walked home, which was a long, dark and scary walk!!!! Avoid the night club, it's full of weird locals and prostitutes! Overall, the resort was not bad. If you get a good deal (like less than 900 Canadian dollars, without taxes) I would say, give it a try but but don't expect a 5 star. It's more like a 3 star.
