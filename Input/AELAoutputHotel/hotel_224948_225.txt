{"text":"Omni style and service! We spent two nights at the Omni after Christmas. Having stayed at the Omni San Diego, I was curious to see if the San Francisco hotel was deserving of its #1 rating by TripAdvisor reviewers. I booked directly through the Omni website and the $199 Park and Play offer included parking and a superior room. Having paid approximately $48 a night for parking at a hotel in the Union Square area, this seemed a great deal. As a Select Guest, registration info is on file and so you basically walk up to the desk and receive your room card. I had requested and received a front-facing (California St) room on a high floor. The lobby area was beautifully decorated and complimentary hot cider and cookies were available. The bed was extremely comfortable, as was the large armchair with ottoman. The room is tastefully decorated with a large work desk, many lamps, Bose radio and armoire with television\/coffee service\/mini-bar and large drawers for clothing. The large closet has a safe and bathrobes. The bathroom was large with a huge shower\/tub with great water pressure. Large make-up mirror, too. As mentioned, Select Guest program will get you beverages and a newspaper, delivered at the time you designate. Some breakfast items offered to SGs at $2-4 such as bagels, muffins or breakfast burrito. Great prices! More extensive menu available through room service. This is one of the few hotels that delivers a large carafe of coffee if that is your selected beverage. Bagels come toasted, wrapped in a cloth napkin and with cream cheese and an assortment of fruit preserves. The steakhouse restaurant has very good food- a variety of soups, salads and sandwiches were on lunch menu. Prices a bit high but not out of line for SF restaurants. Staff very attentive. Hotel very quiet but the city, and Financial District in particular, have a low occupancy rate during the holiday period. This hotel is an excellent choice for business travellers.
