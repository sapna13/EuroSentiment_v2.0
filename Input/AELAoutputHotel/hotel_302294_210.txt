{"text":"Great Experience I have just returned from Singapore for a 3 night stay and had a great time in the Pan Pacific Hotel.I arrived off a long flight from Europe at 8am in the morning and was expecting to be told that I couldnt check into my room until the afternoon which is normal practice, was really surprised as quite the reverse happened and I was upgraded to a suite for my stay as there were no normal rooms available!!!.The hotel was slightly more expensive than I normally pay for my stays in singapore but I had the special package which included $40 a day credit with the hotels bars which made it a competiive deal, and the hotel is well worth it with an amazing atrium, great pool \/ Gym and an excellant choice of restuarants.My only gripe was that the free breakfast offered as part of the package was continental style, which was very good but did not include cooked items like bacon, eggs and sausages for which you had to pay about $5 extra.The Hotel is connected to the Marina Mall and is about ten mins walk to the Raffles hotel and Chijmes bar \/ Restaurant complex ( great place for a night out ! )The main thing I will remember though are the staff, they are everywhere you go, incredibly helpful and really make your stay here five starred. Overall an excellant experience and as long as I can get the package deal again I will definitely be returning.
