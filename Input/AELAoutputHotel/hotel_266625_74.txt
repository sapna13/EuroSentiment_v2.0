{"text":"Back totally RELAXED! We went to Punta Cana to get away from our busy lives and we did just that!! I would recommend this location to couples and famiIies. I went as a single and thought that it lacked some night life and was very coupley but still relaxing!Hotel Room: This was one of the most disappointing things. The room was not nearly as nice as what we are used to. The bathrooms were clearly just remodeled and quite nice. The pillows were HORRIBLE; bring your own. They are very lumpy. The beds are ok. The decor is quite cheesy. Food: The food was ok. You were able to find something you liked in the buffet lines. Although, I recommend trying to dine at the Japanense place, Jade!! Awesome food and atmosphere! They did try to force feed you Mamajuana. The shot of choice for the DR. I could have done without that but it's ok. The seafood restaurant was HORRIBLE. Do not go there!!!! I also heard the steak was not very good. Which I can kind of understand because the beef in the buffet lines was not very good. The quality of beef is not at American standards. Mexican restaurant was pretty good. Italian was one of the better places that we ate at. The buffet lines for lunch down by the beach were pretty good. We ate a lot of nachos, french fries, grilled chicken, hot dogs, fresh fruit and such for lunch everyday. The breakfast was good. Fresh made eggs and omelets daily.Service: The service was amazing!! Give your bartender, waiter, housecleaning a few dollars and they will go above and beyond for you the whole trip!! Say Hi to Amaury and Juan Carlos for me at the bar in the lobby. They are both great bartenders and fun to be around.Entertainment: They have shows every night in the theater. If you enjoy dancing and comedy, you will have fun. The man who runs the shows speaks English, French and Spanish flawlessly! I recommend doing that if you have the chance a couple of nights. Beach: The beach was very nice. If you want a cabana, you will need to get up around 6:30 am every morning. Go down there and put your towels down and then you can go grab some breakfast or go catch a few more zzzzz's before heading down there. The only thing that I missed at this beach was there are not any crashing waves. It is really calm water. I find the waves fun to play in. We walked down the beach past the next resort to play in the waves. The men at the other resort will yell at you but just keep walking past their property.Casino: The casino is kind of pathetic! I would hope that you are not going there the casino! There are probably about 12 slot machines and 2-3 poker tables. Nothing special. I would not recommend it.Disco: The first night that I went into the disco, I thought that I was the only person who spoke English. It was NOT fun but we did try it out one more time and had a blast. Mostly because we had quite a bit to drink and we were out there shaking our bootys!Deep Sea Fishing: DO NOT DO IT!!!! There are 3 men who bring you out fishing, NONE of them speak English. The Atlantic waters are far too rough. There were 4 of us on the boat and half of our party got really sea sick. We had to have them turn the boat around early. NOT worth the $90 to go deep sea fishing. Not to mention, we did not catch anything.Pool: The swim up bar is fun. You will notice that one side of the pool has far more kids in it than the other side. If you do not want to be around kids, just go to the other side. If you have kids, the workers interact with them on the one side. The pool is warm and clean.Other: You will find there are a lot of people from Canada at this resort. Punta Canada as we began calling it. Also, there are a lot of people from everywhere. We met great people from England, Scotland, USA, Spain and Italy!! People overall were quite friendly. There is the language barrier at times but you learn how to deal with it! Go to this resort, relax and have some fun!!
