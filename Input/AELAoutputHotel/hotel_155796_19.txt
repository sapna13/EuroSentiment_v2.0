{"text":"Great place for children The RoomThe rooms are very spacious and clean, loved the little balcony with a bit of ocean view and the large shower. Nice surprise to find a coffee maker and fridge...(originally thought that these were not included). However they really seem to have a problem with towels in this hotel, no wash cloths or hand towels, they did bring them when I called but had to ask for this 3 of the 5 days that we stayed... then It took quite a while each time and the last day they just never showed up so we had to make due....not something you would expect from a nice place like this. The PoolsVery beautiful well kept.... only problem was that there were tons of kids....looked to be like a school group or kids day camp for locals. We were really looking forward to the little pool bar but after seeing all the kids using the bar stools to jump in the pool we thought better. They did tell us that the kids group would be done by 5 pm but I really didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think I wanted swim after that many kids in the water. They also allow these children to run about the hotel using it like a play ground screaming and caring on like kids often do. This just wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ something I care for.The Restaurants We really enjoyed the Star Fish√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√¥ervice and food were both excellent√à√\u2020\u2022?really loved the mofongo√à√\u2020\u2022?they have some of the best that I have ever tried on the Island. The Blue Iguana was a very convenient place to stop for a drink if we could only have gotten served there. We were the only guests at the bar and still had to wait a long time for a drink or to even be noticed... ( a simple hello and we will be with you in a moment would have been nice, but nothing√à√\u2020\u2022?not even a look in our direction). We were just too tired to go anywhere else so we endured this often. I will say that one and only one of the bartenders was very pleasant. The other girl with the long pony tail very rude√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√πe seen her and just turned around and walked out on our last night there√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√™ust didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think we could hack her rudeness any longer.OverallI would recommend this hotel for families with kids√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√ßreat place for kids to run and play. Older people would not do well here a lot of walking up hills√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√≠uggage has to be carried up too, no elevators. Couples looking for a nice quiet get away√à√\u2020\u2022?I would recommend going some place else the pools have too many kids and practically any bar is better than the one here.
