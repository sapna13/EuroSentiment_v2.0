{"text":"You know, not so bad! Quite a bit of mixed reviews here. I am a long time Hilton customer and have stayed at many properties around the world. This was really not as bad as people make it out to be. Sure it is old but it is clean and there are people working all day long to keep it up and looking good. It could use some sprucing up but it was just fine for a long weekend or so. We were there 4 nights.Despite what others have said the beach is pretty darn nice. Clean, private and no, there are not rocks everywhere. We even saw a nice array of fish while snorkeling by the break rocks about 50 yards off shore.The pool is also very nice, even when crowded there is a chair to be found and plenty of space in the pool to relax.One thing that is true is that it is expensive to eat and drink here but why wouldn't you go off campus to Condado or OSJ to do that?Our room was nice with a large bathroom. I also understand some rooms have yet to be refurbished but they all will be in time. The people on staff were also as pleasant as they could be, except for one Concierge that had a bit of an attitude.All in all the place was just fine for a few day Caribbean getaway and I would go back. It is an old place that is kept up, keep that in mind and go enjoy!
