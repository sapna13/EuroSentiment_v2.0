{"text":"not bad! Me and my partner stayed for a week in the hotel 8th sept-15th sept. We booked a superior king room which was more than adequate for our stay. House keeping was everyday with a turndown service in the evening. The room was kept overall clean however a little dusty towards end of week.Only one thing that really [--] us off was that there is a gap of about 2 under each door which enables you to hear every door open and shut on your floor. This drove us mad every morningComplemetary coffee was served till late morning. followed by lemonade in the afternoon and tea in the evening.All situated in the modern style lobby.We had no real dealings with reception staff so can not comment however the doormen always seem pleasent.The hotel is situatuated near union Square however the neighbourhood was a tad intimidating in the evening with almost a begger on every corner throughout of San Francisco. Being a regular visitor to NY i can honestly say i found it safer there.The hotel had a modern flatscreen monitor which had a good variation of chanels to choose, and also there are coffee making facilites.There are Apple mac PCs located round the back of the elevators and guests get a free 15 minutes a day!!!!!! not much time if you are there on bussiness. however you could opt for the ethernet cable in the roomWe had no problems at all with the hotel in itself (apart from the noise )however would probably stop in the wharf area if we was to visit again.
