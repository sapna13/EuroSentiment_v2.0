{"text":"A nice hotel This is a nice hotel, but the reviews seem to go a bit overboard. I think that's because the manager (owner?) and the people who work there are all so nice. They bend over backwards to make your stay comfortable and to help you plan your day. The hotel is very pleasant and there was nothing wrong with it... but I find it's rating of 7 out of all hotels in Amsterdam an exaggeration. I would certainly go back and know what I was getting, but I might try something else too. In fact, 12 years ago I stayed at Seven Bridges and I think it was in a lovelier location (near the canals). So here goes with this review -- the room I stayed in was very pleasant and very clean. It was large enough and it had a nice terrace outside. The breakfast in the morning is fine, with hardboiled eggs, cheeses, ham, croissants, cereals, and fruit -- coffee of course. There are phones and TVs in the room. I thought the bathroom was quite large for a small hotel. There is also internet service in the room (free) as well as on the computer in the lobby. The only reason I might stay elsewhere is to be closer to the canals. This hotel is in a safe and lovely neighborhood near Vondelpark. and the museums. The park is great but it's nicer to walk around the canals. This can be done easily enough but you need to take a 15 minute walk first through the park to get to that area. The tram stops right outside of this hotel and it's easy to get anywhere in Amsterdam... so you can take the tram to nicer places to walk. It's also nice to rent a bike, but once again, you have to walk through the park to Leidseplein to rent a bike. You do get the feeling you're a little bit on the outskirts of the city even though it's in the city. All in all, I might stay here again...but I also might go back to Seven Bridges. I think they're comparable but the location makes a different. If you do stay at Hotel Zandbergen, go to the nice tapas restaurant a few blocks away. We thought that was exceptional!... go South to the end of the block, and then take a left and walk 2 or 3 blocks and it's on your left. And if you look for a Reizstafel (rice table) at an INdonesian restaurant -- I think it's better to order separate small dishes than to let them figure out what 12 dishes go together... That's all. Enjoy.
