{"text":"Highly satisfactory My partner and I stayed at the InterContinental (IC) Hotel Bali recently for five days and overall the experience was highly satisfactory. The resort is quite vast, beautifully landscaped, with gardens, pools, lagoons and prime beach front location. There weren't many guests when we stayed and during Xmas and New Year, the guest numbers are bound to increase though the size of the resort also means one doesn't feel 'hemmed in' by fellow guests. There are also quite a few security guards checking vehicles entering the resort. Taxis are also easily available, try to get a taxi with a running metre as some taxis go on fixed price (like some taxis in Kuala Lumpur) to certain locations. Hotel service was gracious and pleasant.Check-in was swift and personalised...a member of reception meets and greets you at the resort entrance and then deals with the in-room registration and check-in details etc with you while you are relaxing in a comfortable sofa in the lobby with a cold drink and cool towel...when we were there, there was no queueing up behind a reception counter to check in as it is with most hotels..We stayed in a Resort Classic room, spacious with a balcony (overall size is almost 50 square metres)..nice view of the lagoon and gardens, with frangipani trees and a small slice of ocean view..bathroom was lovely, toiletries from Audley's of London, strong shower, comfy bed and pillows, in-room safe, and a working air-con that wasn't arctic like some hotels...there is room for improvement though: the furnishings like the desk, coffee-table etc are quite dated, soundproofing needs to be enhanced (taps and showers from next door quite audible) and the TV was somewhat small for a 5-star resort, considering some competitors are now installing flat screen TVs as standard furnishing...a smaller room at say (40 square metres) with more high-end furnishings \/ design could be an option..can't comment on resort dining and only had a glance at the spa facilities as we were out most of the time...there are several seafood restaurants by the beach and smaller resorts opposite the IC which offer alternative dining options e.g the Royal Bali Beach Club has a decent, reasonably priced menu of Asian and Continental dishes and there's the Villa Balquisse as well...fyi, dessert here (very tasty almond tarts) and mineral water for 2 cost as much as the simple dinner of local Indonesian food we had at a beach-side cafe earlier but the Villa Balquisse is an elegant, intimate venue nevertheless..KuDeTa (about 20-25 minutes away) is also an excellent option, great beach location, stylish setting but prices for the Modern Oz\/Mediterranean food can be a bit high at dinner so suggest maybe brunch or lunch..In summary, four stars out of five and look forward to further room refurbishments (plus faster Internet access at the Internet corner located in a gift shop)...would like to return to IC if we get another chance to visit Bali ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1317,"mention":"slice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sliced_bread"],"startOffset":1312},{"endOffset":2193,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2189},{"endOffset":2347,"mention":"tarts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tart"],"startOffset":2342},{"endOffset":2347,"mention":"tarts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tart"],"startOffset":2342}]}
