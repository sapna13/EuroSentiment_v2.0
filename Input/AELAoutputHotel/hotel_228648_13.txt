{"text":"very disappointing We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Alexandra. We booked through Easyjet and can honestly state that we were hugely disappointed at the star rating attributed to this hotel. In our humble opinion this hotel is in no way a 4* establishment. We booked a junior suite and were 'upgraded' to a suite. The suite was on the 7th floor accessed by the most claustrophobic lift that I have ever experienced. The suite overlooked back yards littered with rubbish. The suite itself was shabby and even with every light in the room on was dark and oppressive. We complained and were moved to another suite. This one was at the front of the building and a slight improvement on the first but for the fowl smell which we eventually identified as coming from the toilet. In the morning we woke to a plume of dust hanging heavily in the air over our bed. This we presume came from the renovations being carried out on the lobby area (something which we weren't told about by Easyjet) and which added to the desolate appearance of the place. We complained again and were moved to the junior suite with balcony which is what we had booked with Easyjet. This was an improvement and by way of apology a complimentary bowl of fruit was sent to our room. The staff is courteous enough but this place has nothing by way of luxury. The towels were well worn and grey and the one time we ate in the restaurant we were the only people eating there. To add to the tale of woe, my daughter actually spotted green mold on a breakfast roll, fortunately before eating any of it.
