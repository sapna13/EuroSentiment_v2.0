{"text":"Not as luxurious as I was expecting I was excited about staying here, but the property did not live up 100% to my expectations.The lobby area is nice, although somewhat small. Everyone was exceptionally nice at check-in, so that was good.When I got to my room, I immediately got a poor impression. The decor was a bit 80s, the furniture was chipped in obvious places, the ottoman was missing a button, there was a glaring stain on the chair, the drapes made a loud squeaking sound when opened. And the 'view' was of the building across the way. There was no CD player, as is standard in hotels these days, no coffee maker, the mini bar was unimpressively stocked. The bed had no flat sheet, as many people have noted, which bothered me. The bathroom was nice, though, and a fresh orchid in a pretty vase was a nice touch.At first the mattress seemed very cheap, but I did sleep well on it. The featherbed helped. It was very quiet on the floor, which was nice. The building itself felt very sturdy and solid in construction.I liked that there was a bar\/lounge that served food on the ground floor. The gym was small but decent. The little 'business center' -- more like a walk-in closet -- had 3 PC computers that were free to use. So that was good. The lack of security late at night concerned me somewhat. We got back at around 1 a.m. one night and there was no one minding the front door. Since the elevators to the rooms are right near the front door, we asked the man at reception about security and he told us that they had cameras. What use are cameras, though, if there is no physical security to stop an intruder.Overall, I enjoyed my stay, but it could have been better and certainly more luxurious, as the hotel chain touts itself.
