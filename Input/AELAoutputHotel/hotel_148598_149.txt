{"text":"Really Unenjoyable PR Vacation - Rio Mar Just returned from a week's vacation at the Rio Mar in PR with 2 of our children and 4 granchildren and 2 inlaws with 2 other children (8 adults and 6 children in total). We were part of a modest sized group.  On a scale of 1 to 10, our opinion, TWO. First, we were to have received a lower group rate of $369 a night, however, what no one told us is that the hotel adds on a Resort Service Fee 8%, so the room is about $30 more per night. This hidden charge is, in our opinion calculated to fool the traveller and we believe is unethical and dishonest, since the room charge is not $369 but $369 plus $29.52 per night. The Hotel also added a bellman charge, but did not advise us when we checked in so we unnecessarily also tipped the bellman.  Also added in was a room housekeeping gratuity charge, which we were also not advised of but discovered when we asked for the bill the night before checking out. We also discovered one of our rooms (we had 4) was overcharged because of a mistake, but the night manager would not attend to it at the time and since we were leaving at 5 am the next day there was nothing that we could do. The night manager was less than helpful and we do not expect much more from the hotel manager, Mark Stevenson, whom we will send the information contained herein. The hotel staff appeared to be more concerned with attending to a convention group of 600 there at the same time than our modest sized group as well as small groups or individuals.  Worst yet was the meal service: Lunch at the hotel. A patio restaurant. If you were served in less than an hour after you gave your order (and you had to sit at a table to give an order since they would not take the order in advance) you could consider yourself among the fortunate. Staff alternated between unconcerned or could care less. A turkey burger sandwich with a piece of tomato that was inedible and not ripe. Dinner - although the actual food in the restaurants was tasty, the kitchen was either understaffed or incompetent. We made advance reservations at 3 restaurants for each night there and the earlest we were served was in the Japanese (an hour). The other two (the Italian and fish restaurants) averaged from an hour and a quarter to over an hour and a half after we gave our order. By the time the food came the children were tired and cranky, the parents were also the same and the experience was more unpleasant each day. Moreover, we made reservations at the early time of 6 p.m and were one of the first ones in eacfh restaurant so we could get moderately quick service - if we had come later I think a sleeping bag would have been necessary. Rooms were clean and fine and housekeeping staff was excellent. Golf course staff helpful. But these positives could not overcome all the negatives. All in all, if I had a choice for a vacation resort in PR, it would NOT be the RIo Mar and I an inclined to think this is a Wyndham problem also so we will make it our business to avoid the Wyndham chain in the future.
