{"text":"You don't get what you pay for We went to the Bavaro Princess for a summer vacation in July 2008. Honestly, it was the worst vacation we've ever had. We had nothing but problems from the time we arrived, starting with trying to check in. That was a big fiasco. We had upgraded to the Platinum Package before leaving home, but the hotel couldn't find any record of that. We had to pay for it again! If you want anything resembling service, though, you have to get the Platinum Package.The food was terrible. Everything is buffet unless you make reservations at the restaurants, and those are very difficult to make without argument. With the Platinum Package, you get to make reservations at the gourmet restaurant Chopin, but that is almost a joke. For instance, my wife ordered something called Shrimp-Stuffed Portobello Mushroom with Hollandaise Sauce. When it came out, it really looked like canned dog food. There was no portobello (only domestic mushroom pieces), no shrimp (just chicken), and no hollandaise sauce (tomato-based). We tried to complain in English and Spanish (my wife is fluent), but the waiter seemed unable to comprehend either.The rooms look ok at first sight. They are typical Caribbean construction (cement). The A\/C didn't work very well, and the bathroom wasn't included in the air-conditioning. We had small black bugs in our bed on two different nights, and we had large geckos running around our room on two other nights.The best part of the stay was the beach. The DR has some nice beaches, and we actually stayed out there more than anywhere else.If you are planning on vacationing in the DR, learn Spanish and stay somewhere else.
