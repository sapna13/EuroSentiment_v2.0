{"text":"Thumbs up I do a fair bit of travel on business and am fed up with staying at marriots\/hyatts etc. I can wake up and not know what city I'm in.I wanted to visit SF with my wife for an extended w\/e trip and a friend recommended the kimpton chain as being a bit different and after some research I booked the Argonaut direct with the hotel.I had read on other reviews that the concierge and front desk personnel weren't favored so I checked them out in particular. They couldn't have been more helpfull. The bell boys and doormen were great as well.The room was fine (Don't pay the extra for the room with a view as the hotel is only 4 floors so you won't get a view anyway. )Accept that and go for a quiet room that has no view onto a small internal roof. I only look for a view if it's going to be really worthwhile.Comfortable and quirky, the place was a joy to stay at and the people great and genuine. It's nice to stay in a hotel where everyone working there doesn't have their hand out for a tip everytime you go within 20 paces of them.One thing for Kimpton, get rid of the starfish cushion on the bed. They're too hard to use so they just get thrown somewhere when you want to sleep and their more trouble than they're worth.I thought the restaurant was over priced and there are a number of places where the breakfasts are better and cheaper. Try the diner on Giardelli square. Better view too.I'd definately stay again ","annotations":[]}
