{"text":"A good hotel near the beach I base all my hotel choices on the reviews and ratings on tripadvisor and usually only book hotels that are ranked within the top 20. I don't know why I decided to go against this norm and booked the Icaria but I have no regrets whatsoever!Location: We took the train from the airport and changed to the L4 on the metro at Passeig de Gracia. You can use T10 tickets for the train as well as the metro. The walk from the metro station to the hotel is at least 10 minutes. But since one of us almost had his wallet pickpocketed, that was the last time we took the metro during this trip. Going back to the airport at the end of our trip we took a taxi and it only cost EUR23. The hotel is set in a quiet area with a bus stop right in front of it and the tourist bus is only around the corner. You can get to La Rambla on the 14 bus in about 10-15 minutes but a taxi ride will only cost EUR6 anyway. A 5 minutes walk will take you to the beach and a further 2 minutes you're at the marina. There's a good supermarket in the shopping center only 2 minutes away where there are also lots of restaurants. Hotel \/ reception: It has a nice lobby, well furnished with tropical fish tanks. As soon as you enter the hotel you can already see the terrace and the pool in the back. Apparently some non-guests also wander in to use the pool... People at reception are helpful. They sit quietly behind the desk but as soon as you walk up to them they will smile and do what they can for you. Check in was quick but one of our rooms wasn't ready until about 2 hours after we checked in.Room: Sufficient space, well furnished and clean. The bed was very comfortable. I've been having back pains for a few weeks before the trip and during the 3 nights there I always woke up the next morning pain free! (Once I got home to UK the pain returned... :P) The safe and fridge both came in very useful. We had a pool view room on the 4th floor and we could see the AGBAR tower clearly. No noise from the construction site next door while we were there. Maybe they have August off...Breakfast: A good selection of hot and cold items. Breakfast is served from 7 - 11 so it never got too crowded.Recommendation: There a seafood stall restaurant called La Paradeta near to the Zoo\/Park on C\/Commercial 7. You can get there on the 14 bus and it's also a stop on the tourist bus. You pick the seafood you want from the stall, get it weighed, tell them how you want it cooked and they cook it for you. Really fresh and tasty and very reasonably priced. For the amount we ate it would have cost us at least double back in UK. It is down an alley way next to the old market, so mainly locals eat here. They open at 8, we finished our meal at 10:30 and there was still a long queue at that time, so get there early! Best meal we had in Barcelona.We did all the sights and ate too much food so I don't think we'll be going back to Barcelona anytime soon. But when we do go back I would probably choose Icaria again.
