{"text":"Great time at the Westin Rio Mar (mid September 2006) We traveled in mid september 2006 for 5nights and 6 days and had wonderful weather everyday. We lucked out as we booked on CheapCaribbean.com and they included free insurance for hurricanes, etc. Since it was low season and they threw in the insurance, we had nothing to loose. It was 85 degrees everyday with an ocean breeze.  The hotel and grounds are immaculate. We don't understand why anyone would say anything negative. The staff was nice and we were upgraded at no charge to an ocean view and we asked for a refreigerator and received it complimentary. Since it was low season, not all of the restaruants were opened. But we knew this when we booked. We prefer no lines and the run of the place and this is what we had. On the weekend, they had a convention and when the groups came, they added music at the lobby bar and more restaurants opened. So we had the best of both worlds--no lines, our pick of lounge chairs at the pool with umbrella's and then it became more crowded and we had more resturant selections.  The conceirge was fine and they have an entire 3 ring binder with menus of area resturants. We went to Bamboo lounge, a resturant outside of the hotel and they provided complimentary transportation. We read about this restaurant in the 3 ring binder. Go there for dinner, reasonable and fun and they pick up at hotel for free. There is a little store at the bottom of our hotel, down the road about 1 mile, so we picked up the local beer--medallah light, which was perfect for our room and some snacks. They also have wine and other items. We did not rent a car since we had already been to San Juan on a previous trip and didn't feel the need to do Old San Juan. We did the rain forest tour and booked at the hotel. It was $38pp and included transportation. We hiked in the rain forest, I wore sneakers and had a bathing suit on under my shorts. You can stop at the falls and swim if you choose. We were with a group of about 8-10 people, it was amazing. Do the rainforest--it was incredible! We also choose to snorkel and we were a little disppointed that the hotel dive shop charged $95 pp, but if you drive to the marina in Fajardo, about 20 minutes away, it was only $59. But since we choose not to rent the car, we were ok with paying extra to book with the hotel. I offst the cost of renting a car. It was a catamaran boat with open bar all day and sandwiches for lunch. It was a full day and we stopped to swim first before we went to the reef. We choose to grab a toasted bagel or nice selction of pastries at the little coffee shop near the casino in the hotel--David's Cookies. It was reasonable as opposed to splurging at the hotel restuarants. We also ate lunch at the tiki bar near the pool or the outside restaurant near the pool. This was on the reasonable side. We choose to take a cab for dinner 2 additional nights and we stayed close to the hotel and it was $14 round trip. The location and distance to restaurants is at the concerige. There are about 15 plus outside resturants. We went to this 1 near the hotel, it was called Rich's or something close to that, it was were the local's go and it was on the side on the mountain. Beautiful view. Nice meal and very reasonable. We also ate at the hotel. The Westin is 5 star, so naturally, the restaurants are 5 star. So break it up, go to the local places near by and the prices are more reasonable and enjoy your vacation and the hotel and all its ammenities too. We woud defintiely go back. Check websites for good deals. We also received a $200 Discovery Gift Card. Great time.
