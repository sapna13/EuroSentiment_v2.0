{"text":"Be warned do not stay in this hotel My wife and I looked into this hotel for our weeding. Everything seems perfect when we spoke to the hotel people and looked at the website. We set up the weeding via email and telephone. When we arrive to the hotel it took almost 2 hours to get us checked in our room. After that delay we went to check out the hotel and it was a little dirty. We said well we are here already might as well make the best of it. Next problem arose the hotel is in a mountain and due to this they charge ridiculous prices for their food and amenities, and I mean over priced. If you want to go out of the resort to eat which you can eat great food and affordable prices you have to either walk like miles or you can get a cab which will cost you about $40 dollars just to get down the mountain. Then same amount to get back. So of course we had to stay in the complex. So I decided I wanted to rent a car so that I can go out of the complex but wait if you rent a car you have to pay about 30.00 per day unless you rent the car through the hotel. ok so finally we give the final numbers of people coming to the wedding we told them 48 people plus 2 dj and 2 photographers. The photographers and djs would eat hamburgers and a drink for about 25 each. so here is the kicker on the contract they put 52 people total which was correct as per our count. 48 people invited and 4 workers at a discount price. When the weeding was over at the end of the night when we are drinking and having a great time they gave us the contract and it said 52 total people attended. So we signed it. Cool, our cards were charged we closed out and we were gone. Until about July 07 when they charged an additional 936.00 dollars. So I called the hotel and asked why the charge well they said we signed the contract for 52 people I said correct. 48 people plus the 4 workers. They told me that the reason was that they forgot to add the 4 plates at 234.00 each. I was like what; those people are part of the job which was supposed to be charged at the quoted price of 25.00 each as per our emails. Even with our email backup they refused to give us our money back. They said that we signed the contract for 52 and that charges were correct. This was completely done on purpose as they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ break down the amount of people so after that fact they can come back and charge an extra 936.00. I have to say also that security was really bad there things were missing and in the own complex cars were left without tires all 4 tires. I just want to let people know to be very careful when booking with this hotel and check the taxes and all other hidden fees that they have. Outrages. Also if you have to buy souvenirs best to buy at the airport if not you will get ripped off. The food in the hotel in no way real Spanish Puerto Rican food. So if you are going to the hotel and expect real Spanish food forget it and I know I am Puerto Rican and lived most of my life there. Well good luck to all. So much more happened but not enough space I could write a book on the whole process.RgdsEric ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1237,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1227}]}
