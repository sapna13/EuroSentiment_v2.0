{"text":"Great Holiday I stayed at this hotel in August 2007 with my Fiance. The grounds beautiful and the gardeners will get you a coconut down but for a tip! The food is lovely and a great selection and plently of food for everybody. The rooms are cleaned everyday and the sheets changed! Nice and spacious, 2 double beds, tv, air con - bathroom nice and big.It is more for families but the Spanish children either do not want to play with the English or play too rough as we discovered on our 2nd day as there were two very heated arguements between English and Spanish families regarding their children playing together!! The entertainment is ok... the staff work very very very hard - doing the kids club from 9am - 3pm then afternoon games, they have some tea about 6pm and then back doing the kids disco from 7pm - 8.30pm and then the adult show from 9pm - 11pm and after that they supervise the adult disco until 1am and walk everybody to their rooms to make sure everybody is safe! (not that the hotel is unsafe)We went on 2 trips - swimming with sharks and Soana Island...swimming with sharks is a definate! forget the Island it smelt awful and was filthy! Overall this hotel is nice but i have stopped in the Ibrostar in Bravro and i wish we had gone back there!! I personally think that the Dominican is a cheap mans carribean and won't return there again!
