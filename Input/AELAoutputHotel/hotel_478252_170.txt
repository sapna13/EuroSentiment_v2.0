{"text":"Better tha fine Hi, I've been in BP May first week; its pretty much as most of the comments you can read here, (good food, nice place, etc) so I just wanna talk about what I didnt find in the reviews.Have read before comments saying Dominicans were rude, but I found you just have to smile; they don't wanna like you just because you tip them, of course that could be a plus, but if you dont smile them SINCE the beginning forget about it, it doesn't matter how much tip you them, they will be rude or ignore you, for me it looks kind of a pride issue, wich is fine and positive, doesnt matter you have more money than them, they just wanna see you smile, as they do.The show at the Pueblo Principe was pretty fun and amusing, if you don't have a dance partner you can sit near the dance floor, there are entertainers who'll invite you to dance, don't be shy; they are very nice and quite good dancers. After an hour the show is done, so every body heads to the disco, and that's another story.The disco pretty sucks (did somebody say it before?) it smells, is small; they just open for 2 and a half hours and try along to fulfill all ages dance music tastes, they start with some Bee Gees and 70's, go through 80's, (miss the 90's,) and finish with lots of regaeton, no salsa at all, a bit of merengue and a bit of bachata; so here's a tip for the women traveling alone: don't stay in this resort, I felt kind of trap here; if you wanna go outside and try other discos it must to be taking a cab ($15 each way), I didn't feel safe to go by my own, so I went with a couple of guys I met, we didn't became friends, so it was kind of uncomfortable all the way back. The discos Outside, I just try Mangu, if you are in your 20ies it could be fun, I'm not so it wasnt, that's also why I recommend to go to the resorts wich are closer to the bavaro town, you'll be able to try other discos outside more than once; you can see in this map:http:\/\/i31.tinypic.com\/oq93px.jpgstay til the Punta Cana Princess to the south side, indeed into the Punta Cana Princess is located Areito, another disco I have heard positive comments but didn't try this time; so THAT'S ONLY if you are traveling alone and are interested into the night life, if not, it doesn't really matter.As you should read before, the beach is just amazing, no towel game at the time I was there, guess it depends of the season; have been told at the main pool it wasn't the same, but in the others ones I found a place anytime.For Watter sports I highly recommend Scuba Caribe, they are not longer in Bahia Principe beach side, so you can find them at Riu's wich is just aside (see the map again please). I did scuba diving and even I got terrible sick once in open water (Tip: take dramamine half hour before) they were so much kind (thanks Hamlet!), I'll defiantly repeat the scuba next time.Hope this can help you, have a nice trip!
