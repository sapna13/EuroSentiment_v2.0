{"text":"It'll do for budget travellers but be prepared There are a couple of good things to say about this hotel... the best being that there is no curfew and the reception is 24hrs. So no need to worry about getting locked out. The people on the reception were always pretty helpful. It's also close to the station. However, when we entered our room there were holes in the ceiling and although the man who cleans the rooms had just left, it felt and looked so unclean, years worth of ingrained dirt that you probably couldnt even get off with Cillit Bang. Cobwebs and spiders all over the ceiling.There was no toilet roll or towels in the bathroom. Then half an hour after check in while I was in the middle of getting changed, there was a knock on the door and without waiting enough time for anyone to get to the door to open it, a man lets himself into the room with the toilet roll and towels! The towels I could not bring myself to use and went out to buy some. The pillows were not only half the normal size of a pillow but so thin it was hardly worth bothering with and the 'duvet' was about as useful as the pillows.The room was advertised as having a tv ...it did but the tv screen was tiny and the 3 channels it had were so fuzzy that you just couldnt watch it, no matter how much we tried to tune them in better. All in all, if you really dont care and are just looking for a place to crash when you get back from a good night out, then its fine, but in that case you are probably better off getting a private room in a hostel, it'd be cheaper and probably cleaner. If you are looking for something halfway decent dont stay at the Manofa.
