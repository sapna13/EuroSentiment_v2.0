{"text":"Amazing hotel. I selected this hotel from it's placing here on TA, and had a positive response when I mentioned it on the forum, which was good enough for me as we were only spending the night in Florence.We arrived into Florence by train, and had no difficulty locating the hotel on foot - despite plenty of luggage and children :)The entrance to the hotel is discrete,(something that must have contributed to the accolade of winning TA's best hideaway location in 2007) and leads up some steps to an elevator, which brings you to reception.We were met by the incredibleTommaso, who is probably the strongest member of any hotel team that I have ever met. This man is a concierge, manager, mind reader all rolled into one! The luggage disappeared, we were given a briefing of the city, and details of our booking at Accademia Gallery were passed along, and we then went to our rooms, which were two interconnecting rooms, with access to a patio.The rooms were very classical Italian (yet fully modern), pristine, shining bathrooms - all the latest technology, and very comfortable.The public areas are furnished in the same way, with occassional tables filled with guide books, fiction and DVDs.It's only when you walk out of the hotel that you realise what a fantastic location you've choosen - the Duomo just a short strollaway.We made our way through some of the sights, returned for a shower - and Tommaso mentioned 'happy hour', which we thought we'd miss - not something that springs to mind when you're with children.However, as we called into the reception the music was a draw, and we had a glass (or two:) of Prosecco, while my son befriended two American ladies who had similar travel plans to ourselves, and made for a great half an hour.We crossed over the square and ate at the local restaurant (recommeded by Tomasso) which was another success.Next morning we checked out effortlessly, and got into a taxi for a short tour of some of the places that we missed like Ponte Vecchio  Piazza Michelangelo - again, all effortlessly (well seemingly!) organised by Tomasso.Yes - we would look no further on any future trip to Florence than the Davanzati!
