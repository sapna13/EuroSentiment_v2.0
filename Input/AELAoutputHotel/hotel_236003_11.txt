{"text":"excellant location with very helpfull staff We have recently retiuned ( 02\/10\/06) from Florence. We stayed at the Hotel Villa Liana for three nightsWe took a long time and deliberation of our choice of accomodation doing endless surches on the inter-net and mulling over various reviews (Times and Lonely Planet to name two sources).However, we chose this hotel and were more than delighted with our choice. It was such a delight to walk in to the foyer after a frought transfer from Pisa airport. This was due to the Italian's idea of the highway code and our abilty to change gear with the right hand whilst on at the wrong side of the road.The room we were given looked out over the pleasant car park which sounds a bit naff but we had a quaint balcony and below the gravelled court yard has a small garden and water feature with plants and shrubs, and no traffic noise. We were in room 5.Our only regret has to be our failure to pack moscquitto repellant as they had a field day!Breakfast was included and the usual continental meats croiassants were available but toast, boiled eggs ,yoghurts lots of fresh fruit and a large variety of cereals and teas were also available.The rooms and hallways reflect the true Florentine style with frescos on the walls and mosaic tiles on the floors. Our room had an ample bed an arm chair and two seater sofa, along wth T.V and fridge. The wardrobe was large and contained extra pillows and bedding, and we also had air conditioning. The ambiance was nice and relaxed.The staff were helpfull and very polite. We were given advice on places to eat. Taxis were booked on line when requested even pug adapters found when ours did not fit. On our third day we decided to brave the traffic again and head up in to the Florentine hills and the staff advised on places to viist. One Etruscan town Certaldo Alto is well worth a visit dating back to the 13th Century. They were helpfull when we checked out also which was at the ridiculus hour of 3.30 in the morning. The location is so good because you are not in the loud hussle and bussle of the centre or have to pay city centre prices but you can be in around ten minutes. The Duomo could probably be reached in less time.The room rates for doubles was 170 euros on the tariff in the lobby, However, we booked on the inter-net diect with the hotel [----]and got the reduced rate of 140 euros per night. Parking was 15 euros per day cheap for the area.We would gladly return in the future.Maxine and Rich - Aldbrough Nr.
