{"text":"Pleasant stay We stayed in a twin room at Fita Hotel in early september for 3 nights, after a few days in London, where we stayed in a chain hotel. We found this hotel very nice for many reasons. First, the location. We enjoyed walking to Leidsplein every day either to eat, sightseeing or shopping. Second, the room. The beds were very comfortable, and we had everything we needed in the room. There were tea making facilities and also a coffee machine. The bathroom was nice and perfectly clean. We had enough space for our big luggage, and the elevator was much of help. The breakfast was nice as well, with plenty of sweet choices and great cheese (we loved dutch cheese!). The wifi internet and printer were very helpful as we needed to check some things for the rest of our trip. Also the free phone calls, which we used to arrange some stuff we needed for the next part of our trip. Both internet access and phone calls were a problem in London, but they weren't here!. This things might be not important for a lot of people, but it were for us as we needed to keep in touch with our family and arrange tickets and accomodation for the rest of our trip. The owners provided good information about the city and also gave a warm welcome. It was very convenient to buy tickets for the museum from them and avoid the HUGE line in Van Gogh Museum.
