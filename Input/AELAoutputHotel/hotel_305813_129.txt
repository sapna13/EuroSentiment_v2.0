{"text":"Lovely hotel in bustling Mongkok Enjoyed our stay at this hotel very much. We booked it because of the recommendations on tripadvisor and we were definitely not disappointed. We booked directly with the hotel and included breakfast with this package. I would recommend that you take the breakfast as it is an excellent buffet with a huge choice of food. We also booked the limo from the airport which made our journey from the airport less stressful. The staff at all times were very pleasant and helpful. Although the bedrooms are not the largest that I have stayed in they are very well appointed and have all the amenities that are necessary with lots of lovely toiletries in the bathroom. The room was immaculately maintained and we were never disturbed in the room yet it had always been serviced when we returned to the hotel in the afternoon\/evening. The hotel also has a lovely pool on the roof. Apart from the hotel and adjacent mall the surrounding area is not particularly upmarket and if I had known this when I had been booking the hotel I would probably not have gone there but in fact it was not a problem and we never felt threatened at any time. I was happy to walk in the vicinity of the hotel on my own without my husband. Although the hotel is slightly further out from the centre this is not a problem as it is adjacent to the MTR which takes you all over Hong Kong quickly and at a very reasonable price. Again it is clean and very safe. If I were returning to Hong Kong I would certainly stay again at this hotel as you get luxury at a very reasonable price. ","annotations":[]}
