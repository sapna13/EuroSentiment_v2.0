{"text":"A classy, nice hotel in an excellent locaiton I stayed in the Mandala, to be found right at the Potsdamer Platz, over a weekend. My room was called an executive suite, located on the 6th floor. It was very spacious, especially the bathroom and the walk-in clothes closet, and arranged in a very pleasing way. Additionally, my room featured a balcony which looked out the back of the hotel onto a brick building and a very quiet street. Small touches made it especially comfortable for me - the swivel tv (so it wasn't a flatscreen, but still), the CDs, the books in the shelves. Everything was clean and crisp, and the AC was making sure that I wasn't dying of heat (37√ä√©? C). I was a little miffed at the price for the WLAN, considering you can get it free right across the street in the sony center (an amazing new complex!!!), or at a number of coffee or food chains, but I guess you can't have it all. The staff at the front desk were well schooled and very helpful. Unfortunately, the spa on the 11th floor is being renovated so I did not get a chance to experience anything of that sort. The spa in the sister hotel is available for use, however. I also enjoyed a couple of drinks and dishes in the first floor lounge, and thought both the lounge and the food were excellent (and again, most attentive staff). The area itself is one of my favorites in berlin - everything is new and modern, and shopping\/dining is plentiful around here. To summarize - if you get a good deal for the weekend, it is definitely a hotel you should stay at. I know I will if I come to berlin again.
