{"text":"Impressive service! Nice boutique hotel! My boyfriend and I just came back from a 4D\/3N stay with Hotel Monge. We selected this little parisian hotel after reading the reviews on trip advisor. The hotel is a short 2-3mins walk from the underground station. If you are planning to do your sight-seeing and travel around paris on the underground, you'll find the proximity to the underground station a huge convenience. Hotel Monge on the other hand is not exactly close (this I mean within 300m radius) the main attractions like the lourve, champs elysse etc but it is quite near to notre dame. Fantastic facilities \/ amenities around the hotel too - pharmacy, restaurants, takeaways and supermarket. We got a small room facing the streets - it has a double bed complete with an ensuite bathroom with shower. Everything is 'city-sized' - small and compact. Extremely clean. No problems at all! Julie, Juliet and the rest of the staff at the hotel are unfailingly polite and helpful all the time. They provided us with hot water (for tea) every night we were there. Answered our queries and recommended us where to get late night supper, paris style. Breakfast is superb - croissant are nice! Most importantly - we accidentally left behind an item of sentimental value and emailed Julie about it. She promised she would search around for it and she did! She found our belonging and kept it safe while we picked it up on our way back from Milan. Were really grateful to them for it. Overall a great hotel. The service was simply all-rounded. Would definitely go back there again. Pity the lift could only fit one person + 1 piece of luggage.
