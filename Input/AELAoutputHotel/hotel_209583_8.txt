{"text":"Nice and beautiful if you have control of your self. The hotel is great, the service is good and the installation are nice with a few problems in the way but nothing big, the beach is excellent, very clean and beautiful water, they offer you a lot of activities to enjoy (not so cheap but great), the food is good, try just to eat the breakfast at the buffet restaurant, them try the others restaurants that have some specialty in the food, the Dominican restaurant is excellent, you need to try it, warning!!! if you go to the restaurant outside of this complex, the food is not so good and the quality is worse. The pool is nice try it in the morning less people around and more clean of course, don't forget to bring with you a lot of change for the person that serve to you, one dollar can make a lot of difference in the service, trust me, one dollar can move a mountain in this place, you decide what you gave to them. The room was fine with everything, complete, just a few problems with the bathroom and the air conditioner, after a call, they send you right away a technician to fix it (very quick), the lady that help us cleaning the room was very polity and helpful, don't forget their tips, 1 or 2 dollars at day will be very nice. The entertainment in the hotel is nice, but it can be better, try the tropicalissimo show at the casino. With the DRINKS be careful, don't drink to much and don't mix too much, they give all the drinks that you want, is your problem if you kill yourself, remember that you have plenty of days to enjoy. DON'T FORGET THE SUN BLOCKER AND THE AFTER SUN GEL, this items are the life of this vacation. The after sun gel is very important to relieve the pain in the skin, before you go to sleep. TRUST ME.
