{"text":"Great design, great location, great price, some teething problems I have just returned from a 2 night stay in the hotel with some friends and we had a great time overall.First impressions were very good - the hotel is a striking design outside and the design continues inside. It is very trendy and well designed.The rooms are spacious and well layed out, although the bathrooms may not be to everyone's tate... The showers are amazing though.All of us said that the beds were the comfiest we've ever stayed in, although the blackout curtains were a little too effective!The concierge staff were also very helpful.However, as the hotel only opened at the end of September, there are still a few teething problems. For example, we phoned down to reception to ask for some ice to be sent to the room (there are no ice machines on the floors) only to be told the first time that they had run out, and the second time that we need to go to reception to collect it ourselves. Not exactly 4 star service...A friend also asked for an iron and ironing board to be sent to her room (the in-room information book said these were available and not exactly an odd request!) only to be told these weren't available but they offer an ironing service which has to be paid for.I'm sure these are just small niggles in the opening weeks which will be straightened out soon, and for such a well-located hotel with such great design features (and nice touches like in-room espresso machines) we were happy to overlook these little issues.The rooftop 'pool' is more like a big hot tub, but does have stunning views over the city - the view at night is beautiful and highly recommended.All in all, a great hotel and good value. We paid √à√\u2020√ü?60\/room\/night. Not sure if this was an introductory offer for the opening few weeks, but the hotel is comparable with those for a lot more.We all said that if we come back to Barcelona, we'll be staying here ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1432,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1428}]}
