{"text":"Ok, but nothing extraordinary I would like to start this review by letting the readers know something about the reviewer. I like new, contemporary hotels and tend to be comfortable in large business chain facilities. Give me a new Meridien, Westin or Marriott and I am generally pleased. While many find such hotels cold, I love them. I am not a B  B person and quaint does not interest me. While I enjoy good service, it isn't usually a factor in selecting a hotel.For these reasons I did not think the Davanzati was for me. However, the gushing and extremely favorable reviews of this hotel kept catching my attention. I have never seen such uniformly highly favorable reviews of any hotel in any part of the world and finally decided to give the Davanzati a try.I expected to either love or hate this hotel. In the end, I found it be be ok without either loving it or hating it. I truly cannot understand the high rating so many others gave to the Davanzati.On the positive side, Tomasso and Fabrizio were all they were cracked up to be. They really went out of the way to accomodate us. Tomasso's restaurant recommendations were incredibly good and our meals at his restaurants were the highlight of our visit to Florence. Our superior double room was large, even by American standards. The room was quiet and the air-conditioning worked well. The king size bed was comfortable. The bathroom was large. The hotel's location could not have been better.On the negative side, we found our room to be dark and gloomy. The furniture (except the bed) was modest; almost spartan. The shower was awkward to use even by Italian standards and the bathroom was dark. My wife missed having a make-up mirror.I would consider staying at the Davanzati on a return visit but would also look for alternatives. ","annotations":[]}
