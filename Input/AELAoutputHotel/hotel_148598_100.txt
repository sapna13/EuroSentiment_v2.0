{"text":"Best Vacation Ever My husband and I just got back from a vacation at this hotel. It was BEAUTIFUL. At first I was worried because some of the reviews were not very flattering, however, it was more than I ever expected. We had an ocean view room on the 2nd floor. It was a nice view. Each room has a table and chairs out on the balcony. The room was very nice and clean, granite counter tops in the bathroom and had a modern look. We have expensive taste and this hotel room was great. Noise was never a problem. The weather was around 85 degrees everyday. There were quite a few iquanas walking around which was scary at first, however, they quickly run away from you. You need to rent a car and don't do it from the hotel. I went on cheaptickets.com and rented a car. The hotel uses Avis but it is very expensive. It is $15.00 per day to park your car in the parking deck. Don't take the rain forest tour, drive it yourself. In addition, the shuttle from the airport was $30 per person each way, so you will save a lot of money renting the car. Do not eat at the resort. The restaurants are over priced. The breakfast buffet was $25 per person and $19 per person for continental. Dinner averaged between $30-$55 per person. However if you go off the resort there are plenty of restaurants and fast food chains (KFC, McDonald's, UNOs, Chili's, TGI Fridays etc). There is even a Walmart nearby. The staff was very nice and courteous. Although I did not bring a child, it was very kid friendly. It had a playground, kid pool and lots of kid activities. The spa was expensive, approx. $140 per person for a massage. This hotel is right on the beach, there is an adult pool andw a regular pool. The casino is tiny and closes at 2pm on weekdays and 4pm on weekends. We went on a Sun-Thurs and the resort was quiet and not over crowded. If you like golf, be prepared to pay $120 green fees per person. San Juan is about 20mins away. The ride from the airport was about 20 mins if you take the toll road. Take the toll road, it is $1.50 and the quickest route to the hote. This hotel was very upscale and nice. It is away from the city, but the entire island is only 35miles wide and 135 miles long so everything is close. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
