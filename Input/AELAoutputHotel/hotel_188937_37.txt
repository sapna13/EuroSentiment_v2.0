{"text":"Lovely rooms, nice concierges, good location, doing some things quite badly Located in cheerful, slightly bohemian Monmouth Street in the northern part of Covent Garden, this is a very central hotel, with comfortable, quality rooms, nice beds, clean, efficient and well run by a team of friendly, helpful and committed young concierges who deserve plaudits for their energy and attitude.There are however some problems people visitors should be aware of. Food - room service food is not particularly good quality, as with many central London hotels (and British hotels generally) - so we tried breakfast room. Cooked breakfasts were terribly bland - my omelette, advertised as free range eggs and chef standard tasted like cardboard if cardboard had a taste, which this did not. My companion had to leave her poached eggs as uneatable. The following day breakfast (Sunday morning - I should have guessed!) was chaotic. No tables were available - directed to one being cleared. Eventually it was. No bowl; bowl found which turned out to be grubby. No spoon. Eventually (after asking three times) one was brought. Similar tasteless fare.The honesty bar appears to be used as an over-charging point by reception on checkout - I was forced to dispute no fewer than three different overcharges, including an entirely fabricated room service charge for something we never had plus excessive car parking charges I was not warned about in advance.The luxurious gentleman's club-style drawing room, which could have been a nice haven of calm, turned out to be typically full of businessmen holding large noisy discussions on their latest deals in Dubai - evidently the hotel allow non-guests to hold business meetings in there. Got really sick of their annoying sales patter, totally ruined what promised to be a relaxing Sunday early evening - astonishing that they allow this.Rooms at the back of the hotel are against noisy Shaftesbury Avenue which features non-stop police sirens and motorbikes through the night.Overall - very, very nice bedrooms and good central location but not anywhere near as good as the hype.
