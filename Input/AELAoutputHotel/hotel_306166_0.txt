{"text":"Very nice for a fancy hotel The Conrad is centrally located in the harbor area and is a nice place to get many of the little touches of services and luxury that this kind of hotel provides. Particularly now, it is a good moment to get some exceptional rates at the Conrad. It may be more expensive than other hotels in the area, but with the rate that we were able to get, it was much cheaper than a hotel in Europe. The beds were very comfortable and the little touches like the fresh fruit in the rooms were appreciated.One minor complaint: the fancy bedside panel with which the room controls the lights was not working well. In our first room (We started and finished our Asian vacation at this hotel), the switch for the desk lights needed pounding in order to turn it on and off. In our second room, even though we turned the privacy light off in our room, it didn't turn off at the door and we came back from a long day of museums and shopping to find that the room had not been made up. Simple switches do have some value!The staff were friendly and perform beautifully. They sometimes even cross the line into being too helpful and too intrusive.As usual, I am constantly irritated by how much these high end hotels charge for things like breakfast, drinks and extras. If I could find a chain that gave some luxury but also charged reasonable prices, then I would be a loyal customer. If breakfast isn't included in your rate, then I would skip the hotel breakfast and instead walk the 10 meters into the nearby Millennium Walk and catch breakfast in the mall. I also found that the quality of the juice and cocktails in the (very expensive) hotel bar was below other bars that I found in Singapore.
