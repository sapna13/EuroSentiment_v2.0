{"text":"Don't listen to negative reviews My fiancee and I, age 27  28, got back from Excellence just over a week ago, and I have to say that this resort is amazing. Anyone who finds fault with it is either weird or someone who goes on vacation looking for something to complain about. Here's a quick breakdown:BEACH: Very nice and big. Not the white sand, but beautiful nontheless. The water is pretty rough, and I was worried about that from reading other reviews, but I have to say that swimming in the ocean was more fun with the waves than in the calmer waters in Mexico. The red flag was flying everyday, but there were always people swimming and always a lifeguard on duty.Pools: Amazing!! Long and winding, with a nice swim-up bar and other bars always close by. The more secluded cascade pool was really nice too. Like the beach, it was always pretty easy to find a place to lie down.Food: The last couple of reviewers said the food was horrible. These people must be used to 5 star restaurants in Paris, and even then I don't see how they could say that the food was bad. We ate breakfast and lunch almost everyday at the Toscana, although they always had something to eat by the pools and down at the beach at 12:30. The breakfast buffet was great. My fiancee liked the omelette station, and the buffet food was above average. Lunch at the Toscana was great. Again the buffet food was good, and the pasta station was amazing - choose your own ingredients and sauces. For supper, we did not go to the Agave, the Spice, or the Mediterranean restaurant. Chez Isabelle (French) and the Toscana (Italian) were our favourites. They were amazing and I don't understand how people complain because everyone there during our stay seemed to agree with us. Try the Chateaubriand at Chez Isabelle. The Grill restaurant was also good. The only disappointment was the Lobster House. I love lobster and had heard that it wasn't as good in the Dominican, but I still held out hope. Well, it wasn't as good, and the other food was below the standard set by the other restaurants. Overall, the food was great!!!Service: Everyone there was amazing. The service was great everywhere on the resort; such friendly people. We had some repeated problems with our toilet, which probably could have ruined other people's trips, but to us it was absolutely no big deal. Again, the staff went out of their way to make sure things were resolved.Activities: Lots to do. We played tennis, pool, volleyball, ping pong, and went horseback riding. The nature park, the gym, the spa were also very good. The activities staff is great, although sometimes it is hard to get the people motivated to get involved, and they were never pushy. The nightly entertainment was good, not great. This resort isn't really tailored to young singles; the nightlife is not very wild.Overall, this resort is amazing for a romantic getaway. I would recommend it to anybody.
