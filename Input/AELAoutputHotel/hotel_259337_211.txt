{"text":"wouldn't go back I booked a group of thirty guests at this resort for our wedding. From the minute that we walked into the hotel lobby when arriving, till the day we left it was a joke! Our group had booked and payed extra for two family suites, never recieved them. We were all suppose to be fairly close as far as keeping our group somewhat together, meaning our villas were located near each other. Didn't happen, we were spread all over the place. We were told how they go out of their way for weddings, yah didn't happen! Food was OK, drinks weren't great , had to keep checking our children's virgin drinks because they kept putting alcohol in them. Bar staff were rude and really didn't care to try and even understand what we were trying to explain. Staff hitting on our teenage kids...First time to DR, so wasn't sure what to expect, but never thought that their tourism would be that far behind Mexico! The grounds and the beach were beautiful. The gardening staff and cleaning staff could teach the bar staff some manners. They were far better to chat with and help you. The front desk staff and the bar staff could take some helpful hints from these hard working people! Oh yah and booking your elcarte meals...good luck!The shower leaked all over bathroom floor ever time you showered, fridge wasn't cold and you had no control to turn it colder, and our room cards(keys) never worked, in several rooms and it was a far walk to the lobby ever time because the, FRONT DESK STAFF WOULD NOT COME AND HELP ANYONE, JUST KEPT GIVING US NEW CARDS SAYING THEY WOULD WORK! FINALLY GOT SMART AND MADE IT WORTH THE MAIDS TIME IF SHE WOULD JUST LET US IN!!! ","annotations":[]}
