{"text":"Excellente, Indeed!!!!! July 13-23, 2008Everyone has their own experience and their own lens as to how they define an excellent  vacation! We just returned from 11 days at the resort and are already excited about returning next Spring. We travel frequently throughout the Caribbean and tend to think that we have high expectations regarding our own definition of an excellent travel experience.We did not experience any of the problems others have expressed here on Trip Advisor. The resort is a slice of paradise. Some thoughts that maybe haven't been expressed by everyone else...Rooms: We stayed in the Excellence Club and will not choose this option next time. Our room was in an ideal location in Building #7, which is in the center of the resort. The same identical swimout room in Building #6 would have cost us around $900 less for ten nights, and we would have been just fine without the other ammentities that come with the Excellence upgrade. Like other resorts we have visited in the Caribbean, our room had a bit of a musty smell. Since we had read about this issue in other reviews, we went to our local Lowes and purchased a product that we placed in the corner of the room, and it immediately took the smell out of the air. You might want to try it.Service: We found everyone to be friendly and helpful. The service was a bit slow at times at night when dining in one of the restaurants. You've probably read all of the reviews about tipping. It was a bit of a shock to see how many people don't tip. The staff does not push you for a tip and the service looked like it was the same regardless of whether foks tipped or not. We feel, however, that if we have the money to go on this type of trip, we should also be able to express our appreciation to the folks who go out of their way to make our experience a great one! Please consider taking a wad of 1$ bills with you, and put an extra smile on the faces of the people who work so hard for so little in a country that is plagued with such high levels of poverty.Food:Breakfast - Excellent with lots of choices!Lunch - Good with some great beach food throughout our stay!Dinner - Very average, but still ok. We don't expect all inclusives to be like a high end restaurant in the states! Neither one of us got sick as others have mentioned from time to time in their reviews. I eat everything, but I use common sense. If fish\/seafood is served on the beach at 12:30, then I don't grab a plate full of mussels, shrimp, and calamari after it's been in the sun for two hours. Others didn't seem to understand this and will probably be talking about their food poisoning issues in their own review! Shows:We laughed and said that the shows were the ones rejected by Carnival Cruiseline back in the 80's. The sax player, as mentioned often, is outstanding! And we had fun just hanging out and being with all the fun people we met.Overall Resort (Facility):It really is like a slice of heaven - the beach - the pool - the botanical gardens with the parrots, peacocks, and flamingos! It is amazing! (And we laughed because we took about a case of mosquito spray with us and didn't have even one bite us during our whole trip! Maybe it's all about the time of year, amount of rain..whatever!)So....have fun! We'd love to hear from folks who are planning on being at the Excellence Punta Cana next March. That's when we plan to return.The biggest complaint I had was that I didn't take along enough Tide stain remover sticks! HA! Keep that in mind!
