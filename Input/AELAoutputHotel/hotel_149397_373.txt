{"text":"Fantastic from St. Louis, Missouri My husband and I stayed at Bavaro Princess Feb 1st -Feb 11th 2007. I just have to say that the Resort is beautiful. Everything is clean an very lush with all the greenery an flowers. The wildlife was a bonus peacocks running around parrots ect. We were here last year and stayed at the Grand Palladium which was great also. I cannot understand why people give the rooms a bad review. We where right by the beach the rooms were roomy and kept very clean. The beds they have here at Bavaro were the most comfortable beds I have had in any out of the country hotels. The one disappointment was there was no alcohol in the rooms unless you are platium. The webb site kind of throws you. If you tip the bartenders they will give you the premium liqours and a couple of bottles to take back to your room.If you can get platium go for it . The beach is the very best, it is kept clean and really nobody bothers you.The pool by the beach is the place to go but just to let you know the pool bar closes at 5:00pm. My greatest thanks to Maximo, Rubin, and Diego. They take care of the pool bar and they are the best. We met so many friendly people there and many new friends. The food is okay we liked te Buffet and the seafood resturant the best. We are not that picky of people as long as we have a beautiful beach, a drink in our hands, and a good room were okay with that. The only complaint I have is there is nothing to do at night accept go up to the main lobby bar. They should do something about that. We took a couple of the tours through Apple. The outback safari and the snorkel with the sharks and stingrays. I would suggest them they were both fantastic. The ouback safari takes you inland and you really learn about the country.You stop at a coffee and chocolate plantation. You also go to a dominicians home It is a full day. The resort is big not as big as the Grand palladium but you walk alot and if you do not want to walk they have trams running all the time.I tryed there spa and loved it! Ladies do the chocolate wrap never felt better. If you are smart bring alot of $1.00 dollar bills to tip. They say you do not have to tip but come on these people hardly make any money for all the time they put in. We give them a couple of dollars and they take good care of you. I want to thank are friends John and Marlo for suggesting this resort and meeting us there. Also I want to thank are friends that we met there from Canada Mike and Deb, Step and Finn, and Colin and Tasha. Hopefully we will be seeing you soon. Please take the time to go to this wonderful country and make sure you stay at a resort on Bavaro Beach you will never forget it and like us you will want to go back.
