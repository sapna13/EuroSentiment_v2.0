{"text":"Great Hotel My boyfriend and i have just got back from a 3 week holiday in Australia. We spent a week in this hotel in Sydney and loved every minute. It is very quiet, we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hear another guest when we were in our room, and there were plenty of guests staying. I would defiantly stay again. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The concierge booked a few restaurants for us and gave us a few tips on places to see. The Hotel is great for business users as it is in the CBD and is also brilliant for holiday makers as it is in a great location. A 10 minute walk in one direction to the Rocks and Circular Quay where you can see the spectacular Sydney Harbour Bridge, Opera House and Botanical Gardens or catch a Ferry to the Zoo or Manly. And a 10-15 minute walk the other way to Darling Harbour to watch the sunset and eat fresh seafood - but beware, this is expensive, even compared to London prices. The hotel is also located opposite a bus stop and taxi rank and also Waynard Underground station where you can catch the train to Bondi beach and Sydney's Suburbs.The Hotel has a very sophisticated look and feel with dark wood and marble finish throughout in all public areas. The rooms are very clean and modern with large queensized beds and flat screen TV's and the Hotel is extremely well equipt with a gym, sauna, swimming pool, gift shop, Sports Bar with free Pool tables, Piano Bar, Restaurant. We were surprised to find that the Sports Bar was not open at the weekend and closed at 10pm most nights. However the Piano Bar was open later and is well worth a visit on a Saturday Night. Great value for such a good hotel, would recommend it. ","annotations":[]}
