{"text":"A Home Away From Home My family and I ( husband and two children ages 12 and 10) spent 6 wonderful days in Florence from the 19th to the 25th of this month. The service was excellent ( no request was too big or too small) and we would not hesitate to recommend it to future travelers. For guests who do not have the luxury of speaking Italian staying in a hotel where you could ask questions in English was very benefiial. The room whilst having basic furnishings was more than adequate- especially when one considers the prices of other hotels in Florence as well as the length of time you really spend in your room ( too many things to do and see so you never are really there). The location was superb - close to the bus and train as well as the major attractions. The breakfast in the morning was an added benefit and it was nice to feel like you had personalized service.We chose this hotel primarily because of the service element and were in no way let down. Only one suggestion to future travelers - if you come by train into the SMN train station - whilst it is 5 minutes away if the streets are clear and you know where you are going we would suggest that if you have luggage take a taxi rather than attempting to walk. Thank you for a wonderful experience. We all rubbed the hog's nose so now we have to return! ","annotations":[]}
