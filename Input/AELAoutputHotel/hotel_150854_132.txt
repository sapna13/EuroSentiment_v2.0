{"text":"Great 2 weeks Vacation at RIU Macao We (couple 40\/37 + 6 years old daughter, Russian speaking Canadians) arrived to Toronto from Punta Cana this morning (Sep 2nd) after having 2 weeks of vacation in RIU Macao. We had a great time!The vacation started bad - our flight was rescheduled due to the hurricane Dean, but it was just smooth and fine right after.We already stayed at RIU Taino (next door resort) 2 years ago ( advertised as 5 star hotel) with no A\/C in the restourants and therefore were considering a place with that option. This time we also thought to book kids friendly Riu Bambu, but realized that the restourants there are not air-conditoned either.Riu Palace Macao has A\/C in the main restourant (International)and in the Japanese one.The food was great, pretty big selection and the spectacular presentation. The only concern was the small metal tea kettles - y look uggly and designed that bad that some portion of your tea always will be out of your cup. From our past experience we concluded that nothing is better then the principal restourant and going some where was not an option. They offering a kitchen tour ... I amaized how hard those peaple working, most of the food is handmade, no dish washer. One Canadian lady - a professional food inspector - joined the tour and was pleased with minor concerns - it's pretty good result.The room was just fine - the staff organized a separate bed for the child. It was a 1st floor Superior room with a big balcony, pool view (limited ocean view too) - always clean and air-conditioned, no smell. The only problem that I recall was an unpredictable changing a water temperature when taking a shower - it was a pretty big discomfort specially for our little daughter, but we managed to work it out.The RIU Macao beach is amazing, it's the best one from all hotels around. You can always find a shadow place, no need to rush in the morning to towel-book as we did 2 years ago in Riu Taino. But many towels themselves look dirty with the stains,which downgrading the hotel from the advertized 5+ stars.Overall, I would give to this hotel 4 stars being in Canadian\/US standards. The main reason we arrived to Punta Cana was the beach\/ocean - we tried to be on the beach most of the time.I personally don't understand the peaple who arrived to that paradise and spend all day long next to the pool with chemicals in it. Hey! Everyone makes it's own vacation! By the way, there is a pretty good pool entertaiment program, but I think that Taino and Bambu are better. There is no direct access from the pool to bar - you can not swim to get you drink like it's possible at Taino\/Bambu and Palace Punta Cana.The kids programs are the best at Riu Bambu, our daughter was few times at MiniClub at Bambu and had a good time, also we took her couple times to MiniDisco 8pm kids entertaiment at Bambu. Riu Macao also has some kids activities but not that many. The night entertaiment is pretty good, we loved Michael Jackson show. Some remarks ... the performers have pantyhoses with holes and it looks cheap - seat a bit far away - you won't see it :-). The earopeans don't have advanced anti-smoking policies and it's seriously impacting life for non-smoking peaple (and the kids) in the bars and the shows. The restourants have separate smoking tables and you almost don't feel this problem when dining. So, for the evening shows we went to RIU Palace Punta Cana with a half-open theater and more advancedventilation system. We also found out that the life entertaiment (dancing with the ocean breeze ) before the show is also much better at that new resort.Another positive experience: the flight to Toronto, Canada was scheduled at 9:15pm. The pick up time was 5:15pm, check out at 5pm (the hotel management did not have any problems with that) - 4 hours before the flight. We decided to stay in the hotel longer, checked out at 6:30pm, had a dinner and arrived to the airport by taxi (35 min- $35). We could not belive: few peaple from our hotel who left at 5:20pm still were checking in their luggage. It was worth paying for the taxi ... By the way the flight back home and the landing were very good - thank you SkyService!I tried to be objective and listed things that may be helpful for the guests and for the hotel itself (to improve). We defenetly had a great vacation and want to thank all peaple who contributed - we will consider coming again.
