{"text":"A Great Vacation I stayed at the Melia from Feb 9 and 16 with my family. I have been to this hotel once before and it was an amazing experience: this time was no different. The Resort: The resort itself is gorgeous, the best kept grounds that I have ever seen in Punat Cana. Although it is a large resort , there are three trolleys constantly runnning to help you get around. But you should try to walk so that you can experince all the beautiful scenery around you.The Staff: The staff is extremley friendly and while some don't speak very good English they will always try to help you out. We actually made friends with a lot of the entertainment crew and the bartenders.The Beach: The resort is located on Bavaro beach, which is consodered one of the best beaches in the carribean. The sand is white and the water is a beatiful turquoise. There are no rocks or shells and relativley little seaweed. There is always plenty of beach chairs and shady areas if you don't like too much sun exposure. The Rooms: I noticed that the rooms had been updated from last year, they were painted a different color and flat screen televisions were added. The mattresses on the beds are really firm, but I never had a problem falling asleep. The rooms are always fully stocked and cleaned, although I did have to call for towels twice. The Food: The buffets had a descent selection of food and even if you are the pickiest eater you will never go hungry. There are burgers, fries, pizza, and steaks cooked right in front of you. There are also healthier options. The a la carte restaurants are amazing. I never had a problem getting a reservation - there was always a restaurant available. The best time to call is at 9:00 a.m for next day reservatons - but you can always book two night at a time. The French, Mexican, International, Chinese and Seafood were my favourites.  Entertainment: I am in my 20's and I found that the entertainment was more geared towards an older crowd or children. This is because thsi more fo a resort for families or couples. There is a disco which is open until 2:00 am but it is usually pretty empty. Nevertheess, if you are in my age renge you will likely meet others and have a good time. If you really want to party you can go to a club at another resort called Mangoo. It is really popular with tourists and locals and is actually safe if you go with a group of people. Overall, my family and I had an amazing vacation and will visit this resort again in the near future.
