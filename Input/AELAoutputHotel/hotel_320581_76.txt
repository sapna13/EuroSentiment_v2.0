{"text":"Great Hotel, Great Location My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights at the end of April. Except for the small size I couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have wanted for anything better in this price range. The room was very neat, clean, and the d√ã√\u2022√ñcor was extremely pleasant. There are slippers, razor, toothbrushes, hairbrushes, bath sponges, soap, shampoo, hair conditioner, and something that was either a light robe or a nightshirt (I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not sure) for your use. The room had an internet connection and for those who don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ travel with a computer there were two computers with complementary internet access available in the second floor guest lounge (which also had free coffee and tea). There were no closets in our double room but there were 4 or 5 hangers with a place to hang things on the wall by the door. Having no closet space to put our luggage in put a bit of a strain in the available walking around spaces. For two nights it was no big deal. The staff was courteous and helpful.We arrived at the Shinjuku station after a 2.5 hour bullet train ride into Tokyo from Kobe. Upon exiting the train I immediately understood why other reviews emphasized how easy it is to get lost. I followed the directions in another review and had no problems getting out and finding the hotel. So, if you arrive via the Shinjuku station look for the South exit (or Southern Terrace) sign(s). When you get to the sidewalk cross the street and turn right. Walk to the first street and cross. Then turn left and the hotel is about a block and √à√¥√ú down the street. If you are leaving Tokyo via Narita airport you can catch an airport bus for about US$ 30 per person (one way) that will pick you up at the hotel and take you to your terminal at the airport. You can catch that same bus at the Shinjuku station with a wider variety of pick up times but you have to drag your luggage with you. You can also catch a JR train at the station but I think the cost to the airport is higher. The trade off is how much rush hour traffic you want to sit trough in the bus. We used the bus from the hotel and got to the airport in plenty of time.If you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to spend big $$ for dinner try shopping at the food court in the nearby Takashimaya Times Square or under the Lumine1 (in the Shinjuku station). We bought dim sum, sushi, dessert, and a soft drink (for 2) for about $US 20. There are plenty of places to buy prepared foods but not to sit down and eat them so we just brought it back to our hotel room and feasted.
