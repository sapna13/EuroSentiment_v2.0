{"text":"excellent vacation My wife and I stayed at the Occidental Grand in January 2008. The weather was beautiful. Don't forget the sunblock. Our flight was delayed which kind of sucked because we didn't get to the resort until around 1:30 am. We flew Air Transat from Toronto. We had the preferred club( I think they changed the name of it). We had robes and slippers, as well as clean beach towels in the room every day. This was nice because alot of people were complaining that they couldn't find where to get the beach towels. Our view kind of sucked from our room. We were on the ground floor and faced pretty much nothing. The next resort was right behind us. I would request a higher floor, due to a better view and also because the room had a smell due to the dampness. We had a problem with our bathtub in our room. It would not hold water. We complained and they did send alot of people to try to fix the problem, but it still was not fixed when we left. I know some people would lose it and say that their holiday was ruined, but we just had showers and laughed at it. A holiday is what you make of it.The food was okay. I wouldn't say excellent but okay. A la carte dinners are also okay. The brazilian restaurant was the best one i think. We ate there twice. Breakfast in the buffet was also good. We also had a place above the main pool where we could order breakfast off a menu and it was only available to people who had the preferred club. It was nice. The same restaurant also had an area for lunch which was nice.My wife and I only went on one excursion. We went to Saona Island. It is an unbelievable experience. I would highly recommend it. They pick you up early in the morning and bus you to the boat. (About an hour or so). While on the bus, they bring you through small towns where you can see how the local people live. They take you by speed boat to the Island. Really cool. You spend a few hours on the Island and they give you lunch and drinks. Oh ya, while on the speedboat, they stop at a natural pool. A sandbar way out in the ocean. You get out and play games while holding starfish. After you spend a few hours on Saona Island (very beautiful), they bring you back on a Catamaran while dancing and drinking for about 2 hours.Back to the hotel. The staff were very polite. The only thing that started to bother a bit was the timeshare people. A simple no gracias went a long way. The shows were okay and entertaining. This isn't broadway so just relax and have a good time. We also walked to a little town just outside the main hotel grounds. It was fun and lots of shopping areas to be had.The beach was absolutely beautiful. We spent most of our time lying on loungers on the beach. There is a beach bar which was nice.lolWe are not big party people so we don't have much to say about the nightlife. We did go to the Nightclub once our last night. We didn't care for it too much. First, you have to pay for your drinks. This is supposed to be all inclusive. Second, this was a nightclub for anyone. Even the locals could come in have a drink. Overall I would say that this hotel was very nice and clean. The grounds are kept very nice. I would not stay here again personally, only because my wife won't stay at the same resort twice...She wants to see a different place. So it's off to the Mayan Riviera in November.
