{"text":"Just spent 6 nights in this fantastic hotel! I was in San Fran for the NADA convention and was notified by our VP of Marketing that we were staying at the Chancellor. Uh-oh I thought to myself. No brand name hotel? Being a constant business traveler, I usually like the brands because I know what to expect.Wow. The Chancellor made me realize my expectations were pretty low! I was extremely impressed with this place. The hotel is beautiful- although it's old, it has been fully refurbished and is absolutely pristine. The guest rooms and the lobby are filled with character. The rooms are beautifully furnished and they are absolutely spotless. I'm a slob and the maid removed all evidence the mess I created every single day. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the free in-room WiFi was icing on the cake.I was most deeply impressed by the staff of the hotel. I didn't catch names, but every person who helped me was oustanding. I was amazed when my breakfast was brought up to my room and the person who delivered it started asking me how I like the room and then explained how it had been completely redone. This was a great indication of the pride this person felt in the Chancellor- if you're going to engage me in a chat about how the room was redone while you deliver my breakfast, you're obviously pretty proud to be working there.That sums up my experience with the Chancellor- everyone seemed to be proud to be there and the ruboff of that pride was excellent service all around. It was so great to get to experience a city like San Francisco while staying in a hotel like The Chancellor. I am now looking to return to San Francisco with my wife and family for leisure. If we do, The Chancellor will have first right of refusal of my business. Nice work! I highly recommend this hotel.
