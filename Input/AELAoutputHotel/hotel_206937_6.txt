{"text":"The Cristal was not my kind of Palace September 26-30, 2007This was my second organized tour since my college days some twenty years ago. I was on a tour organized by AHI International and we were to stay at the Cristal Palace for five nights. While our brochure listed the hotel as four star, first-class, I'd say that was a generous description. The hotel was ideally located a mere five minute walk from Las Ramblas and one of Gaudi's buildings was right around the corner. Breakfast and dinner were included in our package and served in the hotel's dining room. The food was fairly good, but by day four it would have been better to explore the local restaurants for dinner on our own. Our hotel room, a double, as I was traveling with my senior citizen mother, was adequate, and looked out to the court yard. My gripe with the room was in the bathroom. The first night I thought I heard water dripping and went to check the bathroom faucet. The dripping water was coming from the ceiling from the room above us!We immediately notified the front desk and they said they would fix the problem. The next day a maintenance person had come into the room and dabbed some fresh paint on the leak. (Ya, that's how I fix leaks at my house. NOT!)No suprise that the water continued to leak through the ceiling every night of our five day stay. Trying to sleep at night was like participating in a water tourture test, a mild test, I'll admit. We could hear the constant drips and eventual streaming of the water breaking through the paint repair.A friend of mine is heading to Barcelona in April and asked about my hotel stay at the Cristal Palace. I told her to look elsewhere.
