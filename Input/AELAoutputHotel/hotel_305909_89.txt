{"text":"Outstanding I stayed at the Royal Plaza in Mongkok for over a week in November\/December 2006.The overall experience during my stay far exceeded expectations based on numerous trips and previous Hong Kong hotels. I would describe staff - from check in to check out - as quite outstanding: friendly, well-informed, helpful, polite and efficient. It was always a pleasure to deal with hotel personnel and to feel welcome and valued without a trace of servility and this began with my first e-mail contact well before booking a room.Even the airport shuttle bus connections arranged by the hotel worked without a hitch - something of a boon for tired travellers, though limousines can be arranged for those with deeper pockets!The rooms and other services were well above average for a hotel of this class - comfortable beds, airy bathrooms, and good facilities in general. The buffet breakfast and evening meals were certainly not conducive to those 'weight watching' - abundant good food and plenty of choice too. One word of advice: buy the pre-paid vouchers for both breakfast and evening meals from reception as you'll get far better value for money.The hotel is extremely well situated for Hong Kong's very efficient public transport - it sits atop Mongkok KCR station and is but a short walk from the MTR as well. It also runs a free shuttle bus to Tsim Sha Tsui something of a Mecca for unwise shoppers many of whom have been caught out by unscrupulous traders though the hotel can't be faulted for that in any way!The nearby markets - mainly the province of locals - are well worth visiting not only for bargains but the atmosphere too.I'd recommend this hotel without reservation to any traveller wishing to stay a little distance from the frenetic noise of Nathan Road - it's about 10 minutes' walk away - and who wants excellent service and good value for money.
