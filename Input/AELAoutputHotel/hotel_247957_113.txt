{"text":"More like torture not a vacation This was the worst vacation of my life. The weather was cloudy all week. Take away the beach and the pool there was absolutely nothing to do. Any water activity I wanted to do was always cancelled due to rain. I was bored out of my mind. I managed to go snorkeling one day and that was actually cool. That was the extent. I am from New York so I am spoiled with good food at home. The food at this hotel is absolutely gross. I tried everything and nothing was good. I had to go to the supermarket and get chips and crackers to survive the week. I also had to leave the resort to go to the supermarket because the one that the resort provided was ridiculously overpriced. A bag of Sun Chips was $6. That is more than three times the amount I pay in New York and New York√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ prices should be higher than a third world country√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ prices. The shows at nighttime are basically the same every night. It is always people from the audience doing a dance on stage. The entertainment was lacking. I mean if you want to go away and be bored out of your mind this is the place for you. I am 23 years old and my boyfriend who came with me is 29. We did drink a lot but after a while of just drinking you do start to get stomach aches. I went to the club one night and stayed to midnight waiting for it to get good but we were the only ones in the place (besides the security guards). The staffs at the bars were the nicest. The rest of the staff was really nasty to Americans. They try to take advantage of you every chance they get and I was tipping like crazy. The rooms were ok minus the ant infestation and the power\/water constantly shutting on and off. There is also no water pressure in the showers. If you have this place booked, I would cancel. That was the worst spent $2400 of our life. Since the second day I was there I could not wait to be home. I never ever felt that way on vacation before. If you have no choice and have to go, I would pack snacks to eat.
