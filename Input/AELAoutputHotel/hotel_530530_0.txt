{"text":"Do NOT stay at this hotel! We stayed 2 nights at The Payogan for our honeymoon at the end of August. We arrived to receive a very slow check-in, after which we were shown to our garden villa. Our room had a terrible odour with all the bedding covered in mould and stains! You could smell sweat through the pillows and we had to lay our beach towels over the bed to sleep on. The robes were stained, and the in-room safe wasn't even bolted down so could have been taken away by anyone.Our outdoor bathroom had a large spiderweb with a spider sitting in the middle over the shallow bath, which the staff did nothing about getting rid of.There was a rooster right near our room that crowed from morning til night.The restaurant served what tasted like canned spaghetti  2 minute noodles, and was very slow and staff just chatted amongst themselves rather than wait on us. The buffet breakfast the first morning was ok, but the 2nd morning they provided less than half the buffet options.We booked activities through the hotel, which they told us were confirmed. But hadn't actually been booked, which we weren't informed about until after waiting an hour to be picked up by the bus.The website listed wireless internet connection... not unless you want to sit at the reception desk and use their computer to check your emails!Staff were useless and were unable to assist with any local recommendations of where to eat etc. When we made complaints they barely understood us and made us wait an hour for the manager, who we don't believe listened to a single word.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!
