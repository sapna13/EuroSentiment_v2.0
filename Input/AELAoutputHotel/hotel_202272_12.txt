{"text":"Exceptional Business Venue I had no expereince of this hotel before my business trip and only booked it as a consequence of the convention team being so professional in their response to me concerning the availability of conference facilities. This was certainly my good fortune as I seem to have found the perfect venue for meetings in Frankfurt. As the main reason for being there was business, it's only fair to address this aspect first. Just one word sums it up .... professional. I didn't have to worry about a thing. Everything was organised as arranged, no fuss, perfect. The hotel generally ... hotel reception is excellent, freindly staff offering a nice welcome. Room was great, huge bed, espresso machine, lcd tv, desk... just as you would expect in a business city hotel. Bathroom not the best i have experienced in Germany. Slightly smaller than i would have expected, didn't get a floor mat change on my second day, could have been cleaned a little better ( or am i just being fussy ?). Bar is great, staff attentive. Breakfast very good, wide range of choice. Restaurant ( Aqua terra? ) superb, food was superb - of the very highest quality, the team in the restaurant were very good ( they would be a credit to Gordon Ramsay ! ). The restaurant would score 100% if it were not for the lack of bread offered during our lunch on the first day ( we were offered it the second day )... so only 95 % ! Finally, the Wellness centre was well equipped and almost empty . I didn't venture into the pool - sorry !
