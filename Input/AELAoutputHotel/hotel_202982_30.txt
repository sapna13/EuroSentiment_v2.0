{"text":"Perfect Hotel In Florence We are just back from Florence, where we stayed in hotel Albani for five nights (in: April 27th, out: May 2nd). We had booked two double rooms and one single. Having read the previous reviews, I was a little bit worried about the quietness of the rooms and the rudeness of the stuff but I am pleased to report that our rooms on the second floor were very quiet, and the staff could not be better.This is a wonderful hotel, nearby the train station and very close to the city√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ main attractions. As a previous reviewer has accurately described it, this hotel is √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Ön oasis of tranquility√à√\u2020\u2022?and we were very happy to come back after a day of sightseeing along with the maddening crowds that inundated the city. As far as our rooms are concerned (doubles 220 and 222 and single 223), I must say that although they were the cheapest ones, they were of adequate size and nicely furnished. The doubles were above the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ entrance and when the windows were closed, the room was really soundproofed. The single was at the back and very quiet too. The marble bathrooms were also nice and comfortable. The staff were very professional and polite especially Elisabeta at the reception, who was very attentive and helped us a lot. Nevertheless, be warned that if you ask the hotel to make your museums√à√\u2020\u2022?reservations, they will charge you for their service. This is the only thing we did not like about the hotel, as we know that this service is for free in every hotel we have stayed in. The breakfast was very good and plentiful, but I cannot say anything about the restaurant because we did not try it. All in all, we loved the Albani and we would return without any hesitation.
