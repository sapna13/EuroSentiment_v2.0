{"text":"Incredible Value and Great Hotel Weighing everything - value, service, location, amenities - this is truly one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. This small hotel wraps everything together incredibly well. Please note, this is not a luxory hotel and is not a kids chain hotel. This is a hip, personal, fun hotel with great rooms, great location in the middle of Boston and excellent friendly service.From check-in and booking with Ingrid at the front desk (who actually remembered us calling and asking her about location, etc.) to the room with speakers in the ceiling, free water and a well used and helpful Top 10 Boston Guidebook in our room that was ours for the stay, the little touches and important things (clean comfortable bed, excellent shower) were thought of and included in the stay. The hotel itself has a Euro Chic feel (without being at all overbearing) and each night as we walked home the bar was open with a small crowd of people lingering in the lobby or in the bar outside. The location is a stones throw away from busy and crowded Newbury street but a little out of the way to make sure that quiet and solitude exists once you are in your room.Please note, this is not a hotel with gorgeous views, or three elevators - this is a small, charming hotel that makes it easy and fun to explore Boston and its neighborhoods either by foot or subway (across the street) that is truly a pleasure to stay at. I could not recommend it any more highly.
