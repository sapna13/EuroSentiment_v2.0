{"text":"Miami Area Visit 3\/28 - 4\/4\/08 As Marriott Vacation Club Owners we exchanged our week at our home resort to stay in Miami so my daughter could visit a couple of colleges and we could visit the area.The Villas at Doral are very nice. It was not a very busy week there, so it was quiet and peaceful.At check-in our room was not quite ready (housekeeping shortage) and we left our cell number and waited in the lounge. Within 10 minutes our room was ready and we were on our way.We had a 2bed\/2bath villa (room 7201) and it was very spacious. There were a few minor things - there was a stain on the carpet and the living room sofa was in need of replacement (it wasn't very comfortable) - but overall it was a great stay. Our bed was comfortable, we always had hot water and all the appliances were in great working order. Our room overlooked the golf course and was the furthest building from the Pool, but that was ok by us. There are lounge chairs not just at the pool, but all along the pond and several places to sit outside to picnic or whatever. We even used the gas grills for lunch one day. You do need to ask someone to help you light them, but once we understood that - all was great.The staff was very courteous and helpful. We asked for towel service and it arrived in 15 minutes and then the front desk called to follow up. We checked out the gym and game room and attended a couple of the activites. Ice Cream Sundaes were good and our daughter played Wii a couple of times.Overall - the villas are comfortable and enjoyable. The Doral Resort and Spa is across the street and they will transport you over there if you book a golf game or have a spa visit.One thing to note is there is a great deal of airport traffic (flights coming in for landings), but we did not find it distracting and my son was fascinated with watching them so close.The area is busy - not like downtown Miami, but there were plenty of places to eat, etc... We really liked Pizza which was just up the road in the Publix plaza. We also went to Panera in that plaza and stocked up our fridge at the Publix.The rest of the trip was great too. We went to South Beach and enjoyed Lincoln Road Markets. The best meal we had all trip was here at the Books  Books Cafe. The service was EXCELLENT and the food was even better. There were lots of other choices but this fit us best.
