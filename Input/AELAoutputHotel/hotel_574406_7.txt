{"text":"Everything was wonderful minus the front desk staff From my room, there was a wonderful view of the hong kong skyline. This view was even more lovely at night. On the 40th storey of the hotel, there was even a gallery for guests to have an unblocked view of the harbour.The rooms were very classy. They were predominently black and white, with earthly tones, evoking feelings of being sophisticated without being too cold. Even the hotel freebies, like the mineral water bottles, and the slippers, were impressively designed. My favorited service staff were the doorman\/conceirge team. They are the best I have ever encountered. Always helpful, always cheerful, and informative. It was a pleasure to see them everyday.My only qualm about this hotel is the TERRIBLE FRONT DESK STAFF in charge of checking in. My family's check in was delayed because of their inflexibility and general unhelpfulness that bordered on absurd. We had some complications as we did not book our rooms directly through the hotel, but through a online agent. Thus, some changes we made to our booking were not reflected in the hotel's computer system. Not only were the service staff unwilling to help us by making the changes in their system, they even referred us to the internet room and asked as to make our own changes and attempted to charge us for our computer usage. My interaction with the other front desk staff on other occasions also deepened my disappointment. They were unhelpful, unfriendly, and always very sullen looking (as mentioned before by another traveladvisor user)On a whole, the hotel is clean, classy and good-for-value, despite the occasional hiccups.
