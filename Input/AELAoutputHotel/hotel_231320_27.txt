{"text":"Hotel Damrak (dont b confused with Damrak Inn) My partner and i went to amsterdam last Wednesday and stayed until Tuesday. We were staying at a 4* hotel called the Gresham Memphis, which we got a really good deal with thanks to a website, however the last night (Monday) they we're charging us double what we'd paid for all the previous nights. So we decided to have a look for hotels around The Dam and Central station for the last night, We got a twin room for 85Euros.We decided to stay here because friends of ours had for the last 4 years and when we spoke to them they said the Hotel Damrak has some new rooms and some older rooms. We had a modern new room which apart from the bathroom was just as good as the 4* we were previously staying in.The bathroom is tiny and a bit grotty but nothing you couldnt live with.if there's two of you and you both want a shower, dont expect to go straight after each other, as it goes freezing cold! Believe me, it was freezing!The hotel staff were really great and let us leave our bags there in a locked cupboard until our flight - some 10 hours after we'd checked out there, which was nice.The breakfasts are the same as they are in every place i've been to in amsterdam,you get tea\/coffee\/juicecereals\/bread with either jam, ham or cheese.That's it - but approx 3 doors away they do fry ups for 5euros, approx √ä√£¬¢3.50I would definately stay there again, but please shop around for your prices and dont be afraid to go outside the centre as the trams are fantastic and so cheap, you could end up saving a fortune just for being 10mins away.Anyway hope this helps.Laura ","annotations":[{"endOffset":171,"mention":"Gresham","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Gresham_Hotel"],"startOffset":164},{"endOffset":1561,"mention":"fortune","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fortune_cookie"],"startOffset":1554},{"endOffset":1561,"mention":"fortune","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fortune_cookie"],"startOffset":1554}]}
