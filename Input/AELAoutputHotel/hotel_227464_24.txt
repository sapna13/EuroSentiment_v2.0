{"text":"Fabulous in Every Aspect I booked a room at the Hotel Regina for 3 nights and 4 days after reading reviews and seeing photos on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed in any way and this hotel, its staff, service and location were ideal for our trip. I e-mailed the manager 3 days in advance and requested a smoking room, balcony and bath tub. The manager responded speedily and was very helpful, which was much appreciated. Even though we didn't get a smoking room (no doubt due to the late booking), the rest of our requests were met. Also, as it was my fianc√ã√\u2022√ñe√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ birthday on the day of our arrival, he was treated with a delicious birthday cake and bottle of Cava as a surprise. He was delighted by this warm welcome to the beautiful city of Barcelona!The location was ideal; we were based in the hubbub of the city but without the noise and bustle. A 2-minute walk to a city tour bus stop (which is the best way of getting to the hidden and more well-known sights and areas of Barcelona) and Las Rambla (with its marvellous variety of street artists, cafes, markets and people). A 5-minute walk to the enchanting Gothic Quarter and 10 minutes to the Arc de Triamf whilst surrounded by the spectacular architecture of Gaudi. In fact, the Hotel Regina was so well located, everything was within in easy reach. As a couple on a romantic break, we wanted privacy, comfort and a touch of sophistication from our hotel and room. We weren't disappointed. The staff were friendly, non-invasive and very helpful even abiding our poor but eager attempts at speaking Spanish with wide smiles of amusement! The bar seemed more suitable for business\/non-intimate guests due to its layout and but was perfect for intimate late night drinks after exploring the city√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ nightlife. This is another great appeal of the hotel; with Las Rambla 2 minutes away and its many cobbled side streets leading to mystically lighted and delightful squares, there were an endless variety of bars and restaurants catering for all people, tastes and budgets - morning, noon and night. The room and en-suite bathroom were very spacious, clean and beautifully designed in modern decor. And now, for the beds! It was like sleeping on a cloud; with no noise from the street or air conditioning (which was superb); this was an amazing experience in itself! If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e looking for a romantic, hassle-free, relaxed and seductively modern hotel with easy access to all of the great sights of Barcelona without the noise, I strongly suggest you stay at this hotel. I would not hesitate in recommending the Hotel Regina in Barcelona to any lone traveller, couple or small family visiting this cosmopolitan yet traditional city steeped in fascinating history.
