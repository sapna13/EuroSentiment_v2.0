{"text":"Florence in the rain My husband and I stayed at the Cavour for 2 nights in September. Overall it was a good experience other than the bathroom. The showers in the room are not as you would expect. There is a large narrow tub with a hand held shower mounted on the side of the tub about midway between top of tub and the ceiling. There is a movable glass barrier that is suppossed to prevent you from getting the entire bathroom wet. I wish I had taken a picture for a better explanation. I have a very bad back and it was a bad situation for me. I ended up sitting in the tub to wash my hair etc but the tubs are hard to get in and out of as no handles etc. When I asked about changing rooms because of the bathroom I was told all the bathrooms were the same unless I wanted to go into a single room with a standup shower and no tub. I looked at the room but it was 1\/2 the size of the first room so we stayed in our original room and the bathroom was soaked every morning. It rained the entire time we were in Florence but we still had a great time. The hotel has an excellent location. Close to all the galleries, Dumo and shopping. We walked everywhere without any difficulty. The staff was friendly but not like other hotels we stayed in through our tour. We had a corner room on the 3rd floor so it was great to have 2 windows but it is very loud at night . The rooms are equipped with extra shutters to close over the windows so this took care of much of the noise. They provide turn down service with fresh towels each evening. Breakfast was great every morning with the best coffee. Did not get up to the terrace because of the rain. I probably would not stay here again only becasue of the shower situation but if this situation does not bother you go for it!!!
