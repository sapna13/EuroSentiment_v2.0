{"text":"Great for kids.... My husband  I (along with daugters age 3 and 1 1\/2) stayed at th Gran Bahia Principe from Nov 30 - Dec 7. Resort - it is huge but not a real issue since the trams run so frequently. A lot of places, other than beach and pool, to sit and lounge.Rooms- Big and very clean. We upgraded to Club Golden and it was well worth it. Were very close to beach and pool. Staff working in our Villa were awesome. So nice and great with the kids. We tipped daily and never had to ask twice for anything. Mini fridge was stocked with plenty of extra bottles of water since they warn you to not even brush your teeth with the tap water!Beach - Gorgeous and always plenty of loungers available. Waves were a bit rough the first couple of days but we still managed to have a lot of fun.Pool- great kiddie pools but found that the water in kiddie pool at the main pool was very murky a few days into our trip. We went to another pool and found out that they actually ended up closing off the main kiddie pool! Loungers at the pool a little harder to come by so have to get to the pool early!Food - travelling with young kids I thought I would have a problem but there is such a huge variety that this was not an issue for us. We along with our kids always found something we liked. Nothing like the fresh juices and fruit! The buffets were good. Mexican and Italian restaurants were absolutely fantasitic! Japanese was alright but they definitely get an A for effort!Entertainment - Mini disco for kids was a lot of fun. Although repetitive for the adults, the kids loved it. A lot of singing and dancing with a fun game at the end. This is something our older daughter looked forward to each night.Overall we had a great time and no major complaints. Great resort with great staff. Definitely a good place to go if you have kids.
