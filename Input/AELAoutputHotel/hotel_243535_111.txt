{"text":"Great Value for Money After reading the glowing reviews here, I decided to take a chance on the Fusion and was happy with the experience overall. The front desk staff and the concierges were extremely friendly and courteous. My room was impeccably decorated and immaculately maintained, and even contained some of the little flourishes you find in top properties (like the way the towels were laid out, one of them in a flower-like shape). There was a sizeable flat panel TV in the room, and to my surprise, free high-speed internet access (according to the offering description on Hotels, internet access was supposed to be an additional charge for me √à√\u2020\u2022?I did have to pay $3 for a connection cable since I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have my own, but that covered the entire 7-day stay I was there). The hotel is located in prime tourist area and extremely convenient to public transportation (be careful about wandering just a few blocks to the west though, as you end up in the notorious Tenderloin -- its proximity isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really a concern if you just don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go there). Now here come my gripes: The internet connection jack was right behind the bed√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ headboard, which means I had to use my laptop on the bed instead of at the desk. This got fatiguing after a while.Another thing: Sometimes there was a humming noise in my room. Not sure if it was the pipes or what.Also, the maid service left something to be desired. One morning, around 8 AM, one of the maids tried to enter the room without knocking first. Granted, I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door, but I think they should always knock before entering, especially at that hour.On another day, I placed a tip for the maid on the pillow then left for a few hours. When I came back, the room still was not made up but the tip was gone. I found that really weird.On another day, one of the maids disturbed my afternoon nap to ask if she had left a cell phone in my room (she hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ).The real kicker came after I checked out. While checking out at the front desk I was asked if I had drunk any of the bottles of Evian in the room. I answered no, but thought to myself √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??hat Evian?√à√\u2020\u2022? as I had never seen any bottles of water in the room (and even if I had, I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have been stupid enough to consume them, given the ridiculous prices of mini-bar type items). When I got home, I checked my credit card bill and found an extra charge from the Hotel Fusion for $7.90. I called the hotel and got put through to the manager, who explained to me that the charge was for Evian bottles. When I told him that there had never been any Evian in the room, he contacted the housekeeping staff, who insisted that there was. I reiterated that there wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ, so he told me he would remove the charge immediately, but did so in a manner as if to say √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√∂√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not sure if I believe you√à√\u2020\u2022? I suppose he has no way of knowing who is telling the truth in this situation, but that just added insult to injury. It certainly made me regret tipping the maids as much as I did.However, these negatives don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even come close to outweighing the positives of the hotel. I booked my reservation through hotels.com and got an excellent weekly rate. Really, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ hard to believe that this is only rated as a 2* hotel, since it is just so nice. Okay, so the breakfast consists of synthetic muffins, but I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ care about breakfast anyway.
