{"text":"Great Hotel; Great Location! We stayed at this hotel for about five nights in December. Travelling to New Orleans is a very affordable vacation and December is part of their off-season and the weather is still nice that time of year! We chose this hotel beacause of the tripadvisor reviews. And boy, was everyone right on! I am a little late writing this review as a result of a very poor experience that I had at a Country Inn  Suites in Wytheville, VA. So, I just wanted to give this hotel in New Orleans their well deserved praise.This hotel is situated right on the edge of the french quarter, and close to the warehouse district. It was an ideal location, but still off the beaten path a little.Check in was easy and the staff was friendly. We stopped at the little bar in the lobby during happy hour. That's where we met John, the bartender. He was great, just as other reviewers mentioned. He was very helpful with suggestions on places to go and the Swamp Water was yummy!The rooms were very clean, quiet and comfortable. The room was small, but the ceilings were high so it made up for the fact. The only downfall about the room was the TV- it was a tiny outdated model. Maybe they upgraded since we last visited.The fitness room was pretty nice and the pool, although small, was very nice and private in the courtyard.A nice touch were the fresh baked cookies they had at the front desk. The complimentary breakfast was sufficient and you could sneak in the room throughout the day for coffee.I would definitely recommend this hotel. It was very afforadable, clean, a great location, and the staff was very pleasant. A+ to the Country Inn  Suites in New Orleans!
