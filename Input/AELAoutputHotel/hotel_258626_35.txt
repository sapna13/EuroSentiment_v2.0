{"text":"Super pleased with Prava I have read mixed reviews about this place but booked it anyway mainly for the price of the suite. We paid $129 per night for a corner King Suite. It was a very big room with an awesome bed with plenty of pillows. The bathroom was very big and classy. I didn't feel anything was old or outdated. The interior of the hotel was very nice. We received free breakfast coupons for both nights we stayed. This was a full course breakfast bar with a make it to order chef as well. The only thing that I would have checked as not totally happy, was the parking lot. They charge you $6 a night to park. Other than that, we had not one complaint. I called at 11AM after we left the airport to ask for an early check in and they told me to come on in, the room is already waiting for you. Check in took all of 3 minutes with no problems. Checkout took all of 1 minute with no problems. The location of this place is great. It is right off the Dallas Tollway which can get you to all the major highways. It is just a mile south of Addison. There are a ton of very nice places to eat in Addison. We also went to Pete's Duelling Piano bar in Addison. It was a great place as well. It's a younger college age crowd though. From now on, I won't even bother shopping around for another place to stay. Prave has my future business when I'm in Dallas.
