{"text":"Average hotel, at best. We arrived Thursday evening for a three night stay after a trip to Las Vegas and were greeted by more noise in the lobby than anything Las Vegas had to offer ! The bar on the ground floor resembles an after match booze up and appeared to be patronised solely by non-resident young Bostonians. Friday and Saturday evenings were exactly the same and therefore there is nowhere in the hotel for residents to sit and have a quiet relaxing drink.We had an executive corner best view room on floor eight which was tiny even by US standards. The view on all sides was straight into occupied office buildings and the bathroom ( shower room ! ) had a clear view window which meant the blind had to be down whilst the bathroom was in use. The bathroom was large but poorly designed without a bath although more than adequate space existed.We breakfasted once at the hotel and the food and service was adequate but nothing special. Although the printed bill for breakfast said service was not included an additional rubber stamp in red highlighting this fact was stamped on top of the bill - how thoroughly naff !We paid $565 per night to stay here which seems absolute top dollar and the booking was made on the hotel's website.Whilst the location is good for walking around the shopping district, the hotel staff were friendly and helpful, the bed and bedding were extremely comfortable, my wife and I find very little else to recommend the hotel and quite a few things as highlighted above to put you off, and especially the bar noise which was quite absurd !The real mystery to me, having used Trip Advisor extensively in the past, is how this hotel can possibly be the current number one recommended hotel in Boston on Trip Advisor.....Philip Hills ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1733,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":1727}]}
