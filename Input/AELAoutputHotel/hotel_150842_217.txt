{"text":"Absolutely Fabulous I along with a friend have just returned from the Hotel Dominicana this week, After reading all the dreadful stories about this hotel, I felt I had to put something onto your site because I thing we must have gone to the wrong hotel.Right from the moment we arrived into reception we were greated with a drink and smiles from everyone. Whyen we were taken to our room, we discovered we had been given a room with a very large double bed. I returned to reception and said we were two ladies together and however good friends we were we didn't want to sleep in the same bed. This caused quite a laugh and without hesitation they upgraded our accommodation, we were whisked off into a golf cart along with our luggage to a bungalow.The food was really good with lots of choice, we dined at the Chinese Restaurant, Steak House, Hard Rock Cafe and also the Main Buffet Restaurant, again greeted with smiles from everyone, nothing too much trouble for any of themSome of the musical shows would not have been out of place on any London Stage, the professional singers and dancers wonderful.The gardens were beautifully kept with teams of gardeners delivered around the site every day to cut the grass and tend to the hedgerows and boarders.The Star Friends team kept everyone entertained with various activities from 10.30 am to 5.00pm with a brief break for their lunch, around the pool and beach area. They were then dressed in their stage clothes to greet everyone with a smile as they entered the main buffet area. After the mini club disco they went onto the stage and professionally entertained, when they were not on stage they paraded around the room asking people to dance, the evening entertainment finally finished around 11.00pm. The Team then turned their attention to the disco where they stayed until the early hours of the next day. These people made our holiday, we made friends with many of them, they knew our names and anything that was happening, we were encouraged to take part, they work extremely hard for very little pay but their favourite saying was I love my job and it showed. Our special thanks must go to Tony, Sergio, Wilson, Mac, Juan, Lucia, Ciao, Archie and not forgetting Richard, thanks very much to each and everyone of you, you were brilliant and true stars. I must add, we are not two teenagers, quite the opposite, but we were made to feel like we were. We have never returned anywhere we have been before, and only returned to England on 05.10.06. but we are already planning to go back to see them all again next year - see you in 2007.
