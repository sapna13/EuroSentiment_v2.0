{"text":"Amazing Block 7  While I have been in the Dominican before, this was my first trip to Punta Cana. While we had a very good time, there were a few things missing. We had our room changed from the original room (block 5) to Block 2 lower level the second day. While in the second level, the A\/C was broke, we had no towels and no maid to be seen for the 2 days and when I spoke to the Manager of HK, Caren DeVries, I cannot tell you enough how incredible this woman is. The first most important thing is that she spoke ENGLISH! It was beginning to get nerve wrecking the fact that not only the Dominicans didnt speak much English, neither did about 80% of the vacationers! She was right on that phone getting things done immed. While the A\/C was permanently broke, I asked if I could upgrade to block 7. She was able to get us in and I cannot tell you how INCREDIBLE those rooms are. It was nice to see that Caren really cared about us. The wait staff in Windows were also unbelievable. In the mornings, our cappacino was waiting for us..they work so damn hard and get little acknowledgement from vacationers. The Italian restaurant was really not that great unless so I hear, you like fish. The tex mex American restaurant was amazing, we ate there twice only problem being lack of air. God was it hot! All in all I would have to say the resort itself would rate a 4 1\/2 but the rooms definitley a 3 at most. Would I go there again...if I am in block 7...for sure! The customer service is this place is AMAZING!!! Thank you Caren for honestly caring about people! ","annotations":[]}
