{"text":"Resort good, food bad. Majestic Colonial.We chose this hotel because it was the # 2 on trip advisor and we usually trust the rating and comments on this website.We were scared to go after reading all kinds of reviews about this hotel on trip advisorMy husband and I traveled in many different countries in all kinds of hotel ratings, as an ex travel agent I also been too many All-inclusive for work in the past and have a good idea of the quality\/price for that type of hotel.The Hotel is very nice and not too crowded, beautiful swimming pool area and on a nice beach.I really appreciate the fact that you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to wake up too early to have a chair on the beach or around the pool, there is plenty of space for everyone at any time of the day compare to many all inclusive places where after breakfast no one is sitting on chairs but all of them have towel or personal items to reserve the place.We booked a standard room and made a special request for a room on the building 2 far from the constructions well in advance of arrival, facing the swimming pool. We got exactly what we requested. The real problem of this hotel is: THE FOODBy the way you can make one reservation only per specialty restaurant per week.The Mexican restaurant was really bad. We were really disappointed. We saw some people order food and leave 5 minutes later because they couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat the food. Special Japanese restaurant it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ simply a stir-fry really no big deal but was fine. The other Asian was really just average.The Gourmet is a joke; they have the d√ã√\u2022√ñcor to make it look like classy with a sommelier etc. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get fooled by that. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the quality of an okay wedding dinner or an average cruise ship meal. They also ran out of more than the half of the menu at 8:30pm Our favorite was the Steakhouse restaurant, excellent steak and better than the Gourmet.The buffets indoor and outdoor were just ok and half of the dishes were generally always cold and about half looked like they were dry and needed replacing, about 25% of the dishes were both warm and did not look like they were sitting there for hours. The best is the made to order food but there may be a wait.Almost everybody was complaining about the food in the resort during the time we were there. The quality of drinks was not constant sometimes you had a great cocktail and another time it was absolutely disgusting. I thought the sizes of the cocktails were fine but most people were walking with their thermos and complaining how small the drinks were.We really don't care for the Dominican Republic, but the facilities itself were on par or better than the other hotels we say up and down the beach.Keep in mind the Resort is 4 stars but the food is really a 2 √à√¥√ú to 3 stars and you will not be disappointed.
