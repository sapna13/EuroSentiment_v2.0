{"text":"El Conquistador Is THE BEST!!! We have just returned from our amazing stay at The El Conquistador Resort and Golden Door Spa (Arrival April 27, 2007 - Departure May 5, 2007) Our two children actually cried the whole way to the airport on the day we departed. They did not want to leave and neither did we!This phenomenal property is located on a cliff with unsurpassed ocean views. Our two connecting rooms were deluxe with large bathrooms (nicely upgraded), walk-in closets, large bedrooms, nice sized balcony and flat screen TVs (full cable access). I might also mention that the beds were very comfortable! There is so much to do while on property that we never felt the need to leave. We all enjoyed the two brand new $2 million+ catamarans that sweep you from the Hotel's marina to their private island. We visited the island every day - sometimes staying 2 hours, sometimes longer. Our two children (ages 3 and 6) played endlessly in the safe clear water while we relaxed over cocktails and good reading.  There is fun for the adults, too! I had the most amazing 80 minute facial (The Rainforest Organic Facial) at the Golden Door Spa. I personally belong to a very high end spa in Colorado and the Golden Door was superior to my spa by far! I highly recommend the Rainforest Facial, all of the massages and the reflexology treatment. You will not be disappointed! The treatments along with the venue are superb. I also attended many of the fitness classes at the spa. One of the instructors taught me some great balance techniques during a group class. This particular trainer was very knowledgeable and used to train Mariah Carey! My husband skipped the spa and played two rounds on the golf course. He was pretty excited to get to play more than once! I know he had a great time. I did not play the course but drove by it a few times in the complimentary valet golf cart. The course is beautiful with breathtaking views and lovely landscaping. The hotel service is superb and the restaurants are top notch. There is plenty to choose from. However, we particularly enjoyed our gourmet meal at The Strip House (try the Lobster Bisque as an appetizer and do not miss the Cheesecake for dessert). We were overwhelmed by the amazing sushi at Blossoms Restaurant. While at Blossoms be sure to order the spicy tuna rolls - they are to die for! Drakes Martini Bar is right across the hall with great cocktails and a stylish decor. Recreation at the hotel also includes a casino, multiple shops, outdoor pools and many smaller restaurants for quick and tasty meals. The funicular entertained our children and provides lovely ocean views (it takes passengers from the hotel to the marina). It is important to mention that there is a kids camp for children ages 4 and up (must be potty trained). Our 6 year old son spent a couple of days in the program and had a blast. The counselors were terrific and my son made some new friends. Finally, both of our children were endlessly entertained by the water slide at the main pool. I believe at last count our son went down that slide 243 times during our stay. Exciting news to share is that the hotel is in the process of building a state of the art water park. More slides!! The water park will be completed in early 2008. Although we have MANY amazing memories from our stay perhaps the most poignant was watching our son swim independently for the first time. We hope to return as soon as possible and plan to make it an annual trip. We have to return to for a visit to the new water park!  Thank you to the staff of El Conquistador for a dream vacation!
