{"text":"Fantastic ..... and there is a totally smokefree real English pub close by.... We often stay in London and while we previously enjoyed the flash decor of the Soho, Charlotte Street and Covent Garden Hotels we had been less than pleased with their pricing and in the latter two - their lack of service so on the advice of Tripadvisor contributers we decided to try Chesterfield Mayfair. What a fantastic find. Thankyou everybody! The hotel is centrally located in classy Mayfair not far from Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street. If you are a keen jogger it is in close proximity to Green and Hyde parks. I would describe the hotel decor as English and in a style that was very welcoming. Our room was very nice although maybe not as nice as the ones pictured on their website. The bathroom was excellent and the all important shower worked beautifully. The staff were attentive and friendly (special mention to Walter the Italian waiter) and the food at breakfast and dinner was excellent. They quietly dealt with our non-smoking request in the dining room (I have a lung problem). There is a bar but it was far too smoky for us to enter. Fortunately we found a wonderful real English pub (The Running Coachman) just two minutes down the road which is totally smokefree......so we dropped in for a pint or two and some classy food and wine at very reasonable prices. Overall our stay at Chesterfield Mayfair was excellent and we will be back. ","annotations":[]}
