{"text":"A real value among beachfront Isla Verde resort hotels! My wife and I just returned to Houston from a wonderful stay at the Courtyard Isla Verde Resort in Puerto Rico. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico and our first experience with the hotel. We were not disappointed. The positive reviews of the property on this website from previous guests were right on the money.The staff were professional, accommodating and just downright friendly. We were made to feel like valued guests. The first night at the hotel we had dinner in the Salsa restaurant. Our hostess, Ruby, remembered our names from that point on. She stopped by our table two nights later while we were in the lounge and greeted us by name. It may seem like a little thing, but it made us feel special. The lounge showcased live high-energy Latin music every night from a variety of bands and most nights the dancefloor was hopping. The last night there, a Monday, a trio of balladeers entertained on acoustic guitars with percussion accompaniment. This was a nice change of pace from the frenetic dance music of the previous nights.The casino was buzzing all the times I was there and although I didn't win any money, I had fun with what little dinero I was willing to let go of. Note: It is illegal to serve alcohol in a casino in Puerto Rico. You may bring your drink inside as long as it's in a plastic cup.The beach was beautiful and very clean. The sea lapping against the shore was a soothing balm for the senses. The water was a sparkling aquamarine hue just like in the Caribbean travel brochures. My wife spent most of her days there and commented to me that she felt completely safe there by herself. I was impressed with the professonalism and friendliness of Elizabeth and Amy, the two desk clerks who handled my reservation inquiries. Amy went above and beyond in assuring me that she would block a room to my liking, although it is not hotel policy to reserve a particular room for guests in advance. The room we were booked into was exactly as I had requested. We were in Rm. 722 which is the closest non-smoking ocean view room to the beach on that floor. The rooms facing fully the beach are considered ocean front and are premium priced. Our room afforded a very good angled view of the beach and the sea, as well as the palm-studded pool area, which was particularly attractive at night. The bed was the most comfortable that I have ever slept in in a hotel. There were plenty of pillows and plenty of room. I can't say enough about the bed.And last but not least, the service was great. We called the front desk twice during our stay. Once, to ask for more in-room tea bags and once for more of the excellent in-room coffee. Both times, an employee arrived at our room in less than 5 minutes with more than what we asked for.Now, I do have a few comments about what I didn't like:(1) Although, there are 5 restaurants at the resort, the menu in 3 of them, except for the salad option, is akin to fast-food (sandwiches, hot dogs, chicken fingers, etc.). Also, of the five, only the three fast-food types are open for lunch: Picante (lounge), Playa Grill (swimming pool) and Banana (deli). (2) Although as a guest you are paying for the amenities of a resort in your room rate, the hotel management charges you extra to use their chaise lounge chairs for the beach.(3) Granted, I've never stayed at a resort before and my opinion on this next subject might be uninformed, but I felt the charge for the Salsa restaurant buffet was excessive. The restaurant offers a breakfast and dinner buffet at $12.95 and $21.95, respectively. The choices at both are abundant, but at the times I dined there the quality of the offerings were only slightly above average.Overall, though, we were well pleased with our experience at this hotel and would definitely stay there again.
