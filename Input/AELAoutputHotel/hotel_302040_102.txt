{"text":"Good but lacks something special Stayed in this hotel as part of trip to Far East, having stayed in two great hotels in Bali the Peninsula had to be something really special to top them.Overall it is a fantastic hotel with perfect location. We were staying on our anniversary and were given an upgrade plus cake and champagne in room, this was all wonderful. In addition to this we were told that each of us would receive a free spa treatment, I would not normally bother but took advantage of this and it really was good. However when we checked out it it was not free, it was pay for one and the other goes free, not the end of the world as my wife would have used the spa anyway, but would have liked to have known.The hotel cannot be faulted on service, it really is as good as you can get, my problem comes with the overall feel of the place, it just seems to lack something special. The communal areas are filled with tourists having tea or business men having meetings, you really could be in any hotel anywhere in the world. As hotel guests it just felt like the whole place was very hectic and not somewhere you could go back to and chill.My wife travels frequently to HK and tried the Peninsula again in October, but has now decided to return to her old favorite the Intercontinenal which has much nicer rooms and is a little less hectic.
