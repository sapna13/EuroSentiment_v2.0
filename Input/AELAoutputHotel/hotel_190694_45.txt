{"text":"Good, Very Good Stayed at the Adlon for a 3night break end of Nov , beginning of Dec and a very enjoyable stay it was. As it was my birthday the day we arrived there was a birthday cake awaiting our arrival in our room, they had upgraded our room level as well, plus all the touches you expect from a class hotel. The room had ample space for the extra bed we required for our son, this was in fact removed every morning when the room was cleaned and return late evening to enable us to have as much space as possible during the daytime, of course we were out most of the time but appreciated the extra area being available when we were in there. Front desk were excellent, very helpful with any queries, all the staff from the cleaners through to the door staff were always friendly. The hotel obviously as written in other reviews is located in a prime area,+ 10 secs from the front door there's an S bahn station for further exploring the city. As the saying goes  You get what you pay for, yes it's not the cheapest hotel in Berlin but well worth the extra as the rooms\/service\/location are in the top bracket. If anyone is thinking of treating someone to a special stay in Berlin then this is the place. Will have to try the 5 room presidential suite with security provided on our next trip, providing those lottery numbers come up of course !
