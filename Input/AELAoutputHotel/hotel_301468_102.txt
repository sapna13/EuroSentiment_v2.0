{"text":"Perfection Stayed here for ten nights over Christmas whilst visiting family. Had a Club City Room, slightly larger than the Sea and Marina view rooms as I recall but not by much - a very good size. On every level I found it impossible to fault the hotel - staff were incredibly attentive and polite but never overbearing or appearing to be 'sucking up' or giving the impression you are a king. They just come across as genuinely happy to be at work and pleased to see you, like friends. We just felt totally at home throughout. I would almost everyone take a Club floor room. The Club offers excellent value for money and you can, if you wish, eat three meals a day up there (inclusive) incl. champagne breakfast and cocktails at tea. The Club staff are amazing and the whole Club experience made our stay extra special, providing the perfect place to relax and meet friends and family before venturing out. Choice of restaurants on site is exceptional and Melt totally changed out attitude to buffet. The quality of food was incredible so much so that after our first lunch visit we decided to have Christmas Dinner there too. Every festive food imaginable available including Lobster, monkish, sushi, roast turkey, brussel sprouts(!) indian, thai, chinese and, especially for the Antipodeans, an a open charcoal barbecue outside with a huge selection of meat and fish cooked on demand plus a whole lamb. it's not just quality though - nothing is on massive platters, just smaller plates, expertly prepared and replenished as required. Which made it easier to take small bites and enjoy a little of everything rather than stuff yourself on the first course. My mouth waters just thinking about it........ oh to be back there! Mortons Steakhouse on site is like being in the US - I've spent plenty of time in the US and it was like being teleported back there. Food, portions, service, style..... an incredible feat of theming and a fantastic meal. Then to working off the marvellous food......the gym is newly equipped and the well trained staff were, again, well beyond expectaions. The outside pool area was relaxing with great service from the staff. Concierge was spot on too - a little something I noticed was that the hotel staff gave all the taxi drivers a gift. Might have been Christmas or to highlight that it is now branded Mandarin Oriental and not just The Oriental. Which incidentally was the only problem, if any, during our stay. Despite the age of the hotel and its appearance in so many photos I could not believe the lengths we had to go to in explaining what hotel we were going to and where it was. Grasping Singlish helps but even then we needed to list every other hotel in the vicinity before drivers worked out where to go. But I think the gifts were a means to deal with this - a great idea. Totally recommended and I do not want to stay anywhere else next time. Perfect!
