{"text":"Canadians like it here but Six of us stayed from Jan 19 for 1 week. If the ifa was smart they would have a few more English speaking people on staff. That was the biggest problem. My tour company said this place had construction completed Dec. 15 2007 but that is totally false. Ther are 2 buildings that have 40 rooms each that are by the small pool in the ocean part. They are totally gutted and under complete renovations. You could here the skill saws going at dinner. We met a couple who were book itnto a room that had only plumbinmg coming out of the wall. We had to bribe the top guy 2 get 2 cards , keys to the room. The beach is fantastic. You could not ask for more. I loved it . It mad up for the rest. I talked with my tour rep. in the lobby and she told me the hotel was not under construction. and that took awhile to translatedI said have u been to the beach, and look over your sholdr. She said no i have not been to the beach. over her sholder is the main entrance where there is a huge building under construction.I just dont like the fact that i was lied to before i went from my travel rep. he was a jerk. if the ifa is to survive with candians they had better gety this stuff straight. My rep told me they would move me or compensate me if the place was under construction. We will see if they compenstate. I took alot of pictures. Workers carrying toilets on there heads up to the rooms. No renovations, crap The rest great I loved punta cana and recommend it to anyone. Even the ifa , but A dont lie and B learn some english., ","annotations":[]}
