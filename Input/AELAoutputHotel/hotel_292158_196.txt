{"text":"Really good first resort experience I went to Punta Cana with my boyfriend. We really liked our week! The weather was perfect! We were surprised by how warm the water in the ocean was! The beach is really well kept there are palm trees everywhere and plenty of beach chairs for everyone. Some vendors on the beach but if you don't look at them they won't hassle you. All the people working there are really nice and patient. We learned some basic words and expressions in spanish before going and it was fun to practice with the staff. Don't go to the shops outside of the resort the vendors are terrible and really agressive.The rooms smell musty but are very clean. The rooms could be better decorated but it has all you need and it is right next to the beach and the pool and restaurants. Everything is just close by. We visited all the buffet restaurants and we prefered our buffet. It is smaller than some others and we liked the decoration. It was not too crowded. The food is just great everywhere you go. We could not believe how good it was, we also tried the mexican and seafood restaurants and both were really good.It is possible to get really good drinks at all the bars we drank mohitos the whole week :). The pool and beach bars are too busy though so you get more basic drinks but it is still very good.If I would come back I would go to the Bavaro side. The rooms seem nicer and their lobby is just great. However there is a chance your room will be a bit far from the beach ..In all an awesome week we just beached out in the sun and went swimming all the time and we ate like kings and the place is beautiful.
