{"text":"Great place  My husband  I loved this place. We are frugal travelers but like 3  4 star hotels if we can. We had stayed the week before on business at another place: Ocean Resort at the other end of Waikiki. That place was terrible compared to this. See that write up also if you are interested in a cheaper place. Back to the Aqua Palms. I made the reservation based on Trip Advisor members, from AAA at a rate of $125\/night. The beds were very comfortable and I am very picky. We had a studio deluxe on the 9th floor with a wonderful view overlooking a park, Hilton Hawaiian Village, the ocean, and Diamond Head mtn. Our room had a small refrigerator and microwave. We had a King bed, small table, small desk, and large sleeper couch. The room also has a large chest of drawers, small closet next to the bathroom. The bathroom was small in that the door opening and closing didn't give you much room to stand. The counter was nice and long at the sink. The sink was in the same room with the toilet and full length tub\/shower. The microwave\/refrigerator and closet were next to the bathroom by the front door. The closet has extra pillows and ironing board\/iron. The bathroom had a hair dryer. The kitchen area did have a small cupboard. There was a small 4 cup coffee pot with free coffee provided the first night. You can purchase more coffee pods at the front desk for $1.59 each. It was 10% Kona but was good. The other 90% was arabica beans so I couldn't complain. Nothing was provided except for two small microwavable containers. I didn't expect that so was pleasantly surprised. The couch was very comfortable for sitting and for lounging stretched out. We didn't try pulling out the sleeper bed. The hotel is a smaller complex which I wanted. The rooms have room darkening drapes (needed to block out the early morning sun and the heat of the sun in the afternoon.) We were there right before the earthquakes hit. We stayed Oct. 9-13 and the earthquakes came Oct. 15. It was very hot and humid and even the locals complained. But our air conditioning kept us comfortable. The TV is high on the wall and had a great picture.The room also had free internet though a broadband connection.Parking is $15\/day just like about every hotel. Parking was not too tight. We had a rental car from Hertz - Subaru Forester and had no problems fitting anywhere. Nearby restaurants - 1 block away was where we ate: Outback Steakhouse, and Red Lobster. Across the street is the Hilton Hawaiian Village (HHV) where we took in a poolside show one evening and also watched the sunset. We also strolled the many shops there and bought a few souvenirs - better quality and choices than the ABC stores on every block in Waikiki. The do have some of the same things as ABC, so check there too for better prices on many items. In fact I found body gels and lotions priced differently at two different stores in HHV. One store offered them $2 more each. So, you never know. By the way, I purchased several coffees (10% and 100% varieties) at ABC store  another grocery store on Lanai, to take home. The best is 100% Kona from Ferrari - Hawaii Mountain Gold. I will be ordering more from their included order card I found in the package or off the internet.
