{"text":"Fabulous Time! I just returned home from a week vacation at Iberostar. I went from the 25th of Nov to the 2nd of December with my family and best friend.The hotel was beautiful. The landscaping was jsut wonderful..the gardens were maintained very well and they were very colourful. The beach was also very nice and aswell was the pool. It was kind of hard to find a good chair on the beach, you had to look kind of hard. There was a great variety of bars all across the resort, my favorite had to ahve been the lobby bar. The Bartenders were very nice and helpful when choosing a good drink. A really good drink id recommend to try would be an Iberostar or an Alexandre..tey were so tasty!The entertainment was prety good, and the night show was generally very well done. The animacion staff were very friendly, and tried to get everyone involved. They ahd a beach party the one night and it was quite a fun time. The disco was really neat, and they played a large variety of good music.We went on 2 of the excursions..We went snorkeling with the sharks and sting rays, and also to Saona Island. Saona island wasnt really something that I would recommend.The service at the hotel was awesome, they seemed to be able to tend to everything you needed..The one tihng I jsut wasnt to happy with was the food..Al though alot of people seemed to enjoy it, I wasnt a big fan.But I would recommend getting a reservation at the stake house beucase the food was really good there. it was probably the best all week.Overall, this resort was fantastic! I have been to the Dominican twice and now and would definatly love to go back. I would recommend this to many people and definatly people looking for alot of fun. I hope this is helpful ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1063,"mention":"sting","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sting_Energy_Drink"],"startOffset":1058},{"endOffset":1063,"mention":"sting","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sting_Energy_Drink"],"startOffset":1058},{"endOffset":1063,"mention":"sting","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sting_Energy_Drink"],"startOffset":1058},{"endOffset":1063,"mention":"sting","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sting_Energy_Drink"],"startOffset":1058}]}
