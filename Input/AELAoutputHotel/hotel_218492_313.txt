{"text":"The BEST vacation ever! I read 2 bad reviews and could not understand who wrote them. My family and I stayed at this resort for 7 nights at the end of April 2007. We absolutely loved it! The first day was a bit disorganized as the room was not ready on time however the rest was just absolutely above my expectations. The beach was clean and beautiful, the room was comfortable and clean. It was cleaned every day and decorated with fresh flowers. The food there is just a delight, especially desert. Fresh fruit and fresh juices of different kinds every day. The stuff was very friendly and made us feel at home. The resort area was very clean. I loved the activities so much: aerobics and kids club (I traveled with my son) during the day as well as movies and different performances every night. The performances were very professionally organized with beautiful costumes and special effects. There were also a lot of other activities available like boat tours etc. but as I was with my mom and a toddler we did not take any.We also met many people from Canada and US (including those who booked through Apple Vacations) and they all were happy about their stay in this resort.My mom visited Punta Cana Princess resort last year but after visiting Punta Cana Grand this time with me said that Punta Cana Grand was much better. We had the best vacation ever. I told all my friends about it and I am planning to visit it next year with my family and a couple of friends. I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially families with kids.
