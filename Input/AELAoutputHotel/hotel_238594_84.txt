{"text":"Wonderful hotel, friendly with very nice rooms and superbly located We have just come back from a three night stay in Barcelona and stayed at the Montecarlo. When we visited the city 7 years ago, my husband fell in love with the outside of the building and vowed he would stay there if he ever went again. For his birthday, I booked this short break and he was delighted that I had managed to book a room there. Despite only having a standard room, when I spoke to the hotel, they said they would do their best to let us have a balcony. When we arrived they confirmed that we did indeed have a balcony overlooking La Rambla. The room, whilst not being the biggest we have stayed in was very good, and the bathroom was magnificent with a huge jacuzzi bath big enough for two. The beds were very comfortable with the usual egyptian cotton sheets you would expect in a good quality hotel - even the pillows were to my taste. A novelty was the electric bed, enabling you to sit up and have a drink whilst watching the tv. Although they had Sat TV, the only english channels were CNN and BBC World, however we probably spent more time either walking round the city, or chilling out in the bath to help our aching muscles. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. All in all, if we went back to that wonderful city, we would always ask for room 301 at the Montecarlo! If you want a good meal, try El Burrito y Yo in the old quarter. Great food and good ambiance.
