{"text":"Expensive, but great hotel DH and I just stayed at the Westin Palace on our 3 day stay in Madrid. We stayed there because we were able to use Starwood points to stay for free. (We generally use Starwood points and stay at 5* hotels in Europe, so we are used to hotels at this level). I checked this site before booking, but knew that unless the reviews were awful we would stay because it was free.The reviews we read criticized the hotel for two main reasons: cost of everything in the hotel, which we anticipated, and criticisms that the staff was not helpful or nice. We found the former to be true but not the latter.Everything at the hotel was, indeed, exorbitantly priced, especially considering the weakness of the dollar v. the euro. But we had planned for that (we brought instant oatmeal and hot pot to have breakfast in our room. We discovered that we didn't even need the hot pot because there was a hot water urn set up near the elevator on our floor with instant coffee, tea, milk etc available in the morning). Service in the hotel, on the other hand, couldn't be better. The staff was gracious and helpful. When I asked at check-in how much to tip the bellman, as I usually do in a new city, the desk clerk told me it was included. The doorman asked us where we were going each time we wanted a cab and then would give the cab driver directions to the location, and he did this even tho we did not tip him. The concierge made reservations for us for dinner at a kosher restaurant that he suggested and then suggested another one. And the next night he asked us how we had liked the one he suggested. (in a city like Madrid, for the concierge to be aware of kosher facilities is quite unusual).Everyone we encountered in the hotel was nice and helpful. The room was clean and beautifully appointed. There was coffee on the floor available in the morning and huge bowls of fruit available all day. The location of the hotel can't be beat. You can fall out of bed and get to the Thyssen museum, the Prado and the Reina Sofia are a short walk away. The business center was open at whatever hour we needed it. The only drawback to the hotel is that there are some steps into the hotel and from the lobby to the elevator (about 8) that can't be avoided. If you have problems with steps this could be a real issue. We loved the hotel and would go back again. If you can afford to pay the rates, or if you have points to use, I highly recommend it.
