{"text":"Caution travelers for Catalonia We stayed at Catalonia Bavaro Resort from June 22 - 27 and we were very disappointed with quite a few things.Room - we stayed in building 23, 3rd floor, halfway between lobby and pool, good location. Clean room overall and nice size with sitting area (what was included in pkg) but there were problems. No towels when we got there so we called. Didn't deliver so we found the laudrymat next door and got some from them. Same thing the next day, no towels but they brought some later. No face cloths at all but they give you sponges. First nite toilet was continually leaking but they fixed it the next morning. No hot water every afternoon from 2-5 so you had to wait to take a shower unless of course you wanted to freeze. TV went off the day before we left and didn't come back on until late that nite - same for everyone there. A\/C in room ok but could have been cooler. Blow dryer in bathroom would have taken an hour to dry my hair so I used mine. Blew the circuit out every single time and that was just with the tv on, no lights. Managed to get it dry tho. Keys to our room didn't work one day so we had to walk to the lobby and get new ones. We talked to another couple there (they will also write a review) and they had similar problems as ours, even the key thing. Beds of course are hard but that happens most places - we took a blanket and put underneath the sheet which helped. They have a huge spa tub in the bathroom that we were going to fill. It would have taken 5 days just to get it up to the halfway mark so forget that.Food - now this was the disappointment - buffets were not good. I cannot believe that anyone could eat that food in the other reviews. It was amazing how they could take veggies and turn them into something that nobody could recognize and taste horrible. The one good items were the roasted chicken and fried chicken however my husband got 3 pieces and all were still bloody - didn't eat them of course and even the waiter went ewwww. Even the breakfast had limited food and they put salad and carrots out as a filler, we laughed. The nice thing was you could make reservations for the ala carte restaurants instead of waiting in line in the mornings to get a reservation. Ate at the Rodeo Steak House and the steak was tender (better than the buffets that were like leather) but just a little overdone. Mariachi, Mexican restaurant was our fave. We would have eaten there every nite had we known. La Toscana, Italian - tried 3 different entrees, just OK. There is a place by the pool called Snack Bar Pleamar and unfortunately we didn't try that until the last day - GREAT pizza!!!! I would have lived on that had I known. Heard from another couple the Japanese was not good so glad we didn't try that one.Pool and Beach - Pool is nice and large but just no breeze at all due to where it is located. Beach is gorgeous and huge! There are plenty of palapas however you do need to get out there by 9 a.m. to reserve one, even tho they say you can't, cause they will be taken. Plenty of palm trees tho for shade also. Went to the bathroom by the pool and they had shut the water off so had to wash the soap off my hand in the pool - I think they have a water problem at this resort obviously.Service - well, it was ok. Most were friendly but some sure weren't. My husband likes club soda but from the tap is flat and they would not give him a small bottle of it, which they had plenty sitting there for alcoholic drinks. It was like he was robbing their bar. Heck, he's not even drinking liquor.Would be stay here again? No. I'm sure there are plenty of other resorts that will be so much better than this one. The beaches are gorgeous there tho. We have stayed at so many resorts and found this to be no more than maybe 3 star. We have always been easy to please too so you can either take this as advice or not but hope it helps in making your decision.
