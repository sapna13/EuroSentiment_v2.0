{"text":"Bravo Beach Hotel Vieques has amazing pristine white sand beaches. Untouched, secluded, natural, and what a variety! Red beach was my favorite, it is a sheltered crescent. What I'm getting at here is that you go to vieques for the beaches, not for a hotel... If you're looking for a beach-front hotel this is not your island. BBH is on the coast, a kind of slimy rock beach. To get to the sandy awesomeness you must rent a car, preferably 4wd, and be willing to trek off into the wilds.BBH has an extremely friendly helpful staff- they scooped us up from the ferry our first day, and arranged our rental jeep.They'll pack you a nice lunch to take to the beach. The food is pretty good at the hotel. You won't want to use the pool by the restaraunt, but the one by the honor bar is more private  we spent a couple of enjoyable hours there.Locals of the island's south shore seem to resent tourists, at times being openly rude. But other than that most people were quite friendly- the kayak bio bay tour was really fun and the guides were very nice.My favorite moment on the island was a sudden brief rainstorm while at one of the more remote beaches-- swimming in a downpour and then watching the storm retreat over the ocean was amazing. And the soggy pothole infested dirt road would have been impassable after had we not had a 4wd, so keep that in mind when choosing your car!
