{"text":"Wow, wow, wow...this place is fantastic!! This was our first trip to Venice and booked this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews. The hotel was absolutely amazing. We stayed in two themed rooms the Oriental and the Sala Noir and both were beautiful but the Sala Noir was over the top fantastic. The Sala Noir was two stories with the bathroom upstairs and what a wow the bathroom was, the shower had four different shower head configurations and was sized for two people. The bedroom in Sala Noir was amazing as well with a huge 2 meter diameter Murano glass chandelier hanging over the bed. I'm gushing, I know, but there is more....The service was absolutely top notch. From the moment your water taxi arrives at there private dock you are treated as royalty. As your bags are being delivered to your room you are asked to rest in the most amazing lounge\/living room area, as you decompress from your trip to Venice inhaling the scented candles and absorbing the amazing design and decorations in the opulent room you are presented with glasses of complimentary prosecco sparkling wine to sip as you wait for them to make your room perfect.Being such a small boutique hotel every request was met instantly, you literally put the phone down and there is a knock on the door with your request.Everyday we had a small surprise from fresh apples in the room when we returned from site seeing to a new orchid to complimentary glasses of wine to welcome us to our 2nd new themed room......are you getting the picture.Breakfast was amazing. They will serve it in your room, the breakfast room, on the terrace or in the lounge. The breakfast was served with the finesse of a fine dining restaurant by the sweetest, most charming waitress.The staff were over the top helpful with everything you requested.I can't imagine a better hotel in Venice and will be recommending it to everyone heading there.
