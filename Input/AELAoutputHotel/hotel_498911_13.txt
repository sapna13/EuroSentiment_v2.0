{"text":"I loved this hotel................ it's da bomb!!!! Staying at the Best Western Hotel in the San Juan Airport was one experience that I will never forget. Actually, I would like to thank the American Airlines for screwing up our flight arrangements and placing my family there for the night. Although it was the night shift, the hotel staff was extremely pleasant and that's a rare case and I commend them for that. However, I was disappointed with the dinner menu. When I got to BJ's Bistro at 10 o'clock, I was told that dinner would be served until midnight. So, I expected to see on the menu food items such as baked chicken, rice, salad,etc. To my disappointment, I was told that I can only have a sandwich as if that would be considered dinner! I didn't complain. I ordered a mozarella chicken sandwich with potato chips. Yes! I said it potato chips! I was expecting french fries not chips you get out of a tin or bag but the sandwich was delicious. Now to the actual rooms. I must say the rooms are of the best: well made, nice, big, comfortable beds with beautiful, clean linen. Don't even talk about the tv. Flat screen in a hotel?........ Nice touch but I was upset because there were limited channels. Overall, the room was good but the soap was too small. After one bath, that was it. No more soap. What cheapness is that? Anyway, I slept well the evening. In the morning, there was a buffet breakfast. That was the best breakfast ever! Eat all you want? Beautiful. Just Beautiful. Breakfast was limited but it was still ok at the same time. After breakfast, I said goodbye to the beautiful hotel and it's lovely service.Generally, I enjoyed my stay and I would recommend that anyone reading this, visit this marvelous hotel ","annotations":[{"endOffset":711,"mention":"sandwich","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":703},{"endOffset":711,"mention":"sandwich","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":703},{"endOffset":808,"mention":"chicken sandwich","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chicken_sandwich"],"startOffset":792},{"endOffset":826,"mention":"potato chips","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Potato_chip"],"startOffset":814},{"endOffset":855,"mention":"potato chips","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Potato_chip"],"startOffset":843},{"endOffset":885,"mention":"french fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":873},{"endOffset":940,"mention":"sandwich","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":932},{"endOffset":940,"mention":"sandwich","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":932},{"endOffset":940,"mention":"sandwich","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":932},{"endOffset":1034,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1030},{"endOffset":1153,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1149}]}
