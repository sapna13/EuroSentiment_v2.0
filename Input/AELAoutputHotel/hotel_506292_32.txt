{"text":"We didn't want to leave We stayed at Uma Ubud for a week in October and absolutely loved it. I researched on tripadvisor and was impressed by the consistently high reviews. It had everything we wanted - laidback luxury with good facilities (25m pool, gym and yoga). However you certainly don't feel restricted to the resort (it's not even a resort really, more like a boutique hotel) as there are many fabulous eating options close by. Our favourites were Naughty Nuris (great ribs cooked on the roadside bbq) and Ibu Okra (spelling may be wrong - it's the best suckling pig ever and you sit on the floor to eat). We ate at Mozaic too - my other half liked it but I found it a bit bland. If you do go make sure you reserve a table ouside in the garden, otherwise it really is disappointing and the elevator type music is dreadful. Back to Uma though, everything is really perfect there, from the welcome pick-up at the airport (cold towels are such a winner) to the fantastic, friendly staff. I got really ill while I was there and they were able to supply us with medicine. Luckily it only knocked me out for 24 hours. We had a terrace room which we loved, great terrace for chilling out on (I love the way the staff light the outdoor candles for you at night). The bathroom was perfect and very spacious. The spa is nice, but really I strongly recommend walking two minutes down the road (in direction of Ubud) to the Bali Botanical Spa where treatments are a fraction of the price and the surroundings are far more beautiful and Balinese. I only discovered it on the second last day and was so sorry - I would have been there every day otherwise! I envy anyone who is about to go to Uma, we would go back in a flash. We spend the second week with friends in a villa in Canggu, which was also fabulous. All in all it would be difficult not to enjoy Bali. ","annotations":[]}
