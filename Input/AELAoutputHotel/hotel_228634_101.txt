{"text":"Crazy surroundings I booked 3 design rooms (2 doubles and 1 family suite) on the Royal Floor for 4 nights starting on 12\/27. I was attracted to this hotel because they had a family suite and the location, but unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the hotel for a number of reasons. Although there were a few good points, I would choose not to stay here again:Pros:√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?oom price was very reasonable: 130 euros for first two nights\/195 euros for last two nights on double rooms; 250 euros for family suite.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?ocation on Las Ramblas (if you like very busy surroundings). It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ near Placa Catalunya (transportation hub), shopping and the interesting Barri Gotic area √à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ\u201AÑ¢esign room had two sinks in the family suite; pefect for a family of 4√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ\u201AÑ¢ouble rooms on the Royal Floor faced Las Ramblas. This made for great people-watching.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?ainshower and Jacuzzi bath were nice to have available after a long day of touring√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?a Poma Restaurant is next to the hotel and they provide room service. Their pizzas were OK, pastas not too good, but surprisingly, their paella was pretty good.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ¬¥levators were always readily waiting on the ground floor.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?here are lots of good restaurant nearby, but best to choose one on the side streets off Las Ramblas (because of price and quality)√à√\u2020\u2022?-5 minute walk to Boqueria market√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ¬©onvenience store a few doors down. We bought our water and soda there when lines weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ excessively long as they tend to be in the later afternoon.Cons:√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ√ülthough rooms were sound-proof from the noise on the streets, there was constant noise from the restaurant below, which you could clearly hear from our rooms (#8, 9 and 11) You can hear them moving chairs around, vacuuming and generally moving things around until 2am. Other reviewers mentioned this as well. √à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?ome nights were so busy on Las Ramblas that it was a chore just to walk through the crowds. Hotel staff said this is typical of weekend nights. √à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?taff was cordial, but not very helpful. They did not offer restaurant recommendations, but rather, gave me a map with restaurants shown. I asked for their personal preferences in the area and was told on 2 occasions that most of the restaurants are good √à√\u2020\u2022?they just didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ say which ones!√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ√Üad to have our keys for the family suite re-programmed 3 times. Reception was apologetic, but did not know why this was occurring.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?here is no coffee\/tea service in the room. There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a Royal Salon for those staying on the Royal Floor which provides tea service but the Salon opens at 8am or 8:30 or 9am √à√\u2020\u2022?depending when staff decides to open up. I asked the front desk about this, but they said it should open at 7:30am. You can, instead, grab some coffee in the breakfast room which opens at 7:30 or purchase in the machine in the lobby for one euro. So, if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e an early riser, like me, you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l have to wait for your morning beverage!There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ no concierge or phone book available. I had to rely on the reception staff who were not openly helpful.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?his is not a four star hotel in the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢raditional√à√\u2020\u2022?sense. They might have received a 4 star rating because there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a restaurant and because of the location. It couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ possibly be because of the services or amenities.Please beware - the lower Ramblas (toward the water) is a bit seedy, especially at night. If I were to return to Barcelona, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° choose a location on the Passeig de Gracia. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ amazing how much less crowded and crazy things are on that opposite side of Placa Catalunya - but, of course, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ considerably more expensive. We had the most amazing and wonderful tours with Spanish Trail. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l post a review under tours in Barcelona.
