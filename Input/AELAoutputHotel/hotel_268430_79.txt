{"text":"A great trip with a few caveats I recently stayed for 4 nights with my 2 teenage daughters.Our room was ready when we arrived,and had 2 comfortable beds,a flat-screen TV,CD player,coffeepot, and mini-fridge with complimentary bottles of water.There was a balcony witha table and chairs with a beautiful ocean view.The beach behind this hotel is the nicest on the strip in Isla Verde,with white,powdery sand,palm trees for shade,and even a few hammocks for lounging.The staff wil bring your drink to you on the beach,or you can cool off with a cocktail at the pool's swimup bar.There is also a kiddie pool,and hot tub.My only complaint here is having to pay $6 for a beach chair-just increase the daily hotel rate for Pete's sake,and don't charge for the chairs.There are a few restaurants on the premises,as well as limited room service. The breakfast buffet at Salsa was good,with made-to-order omelettes and Belgian waffles among the offerings.However,the dinner buffet at Salsa was not good.The salads,side dishes, and desserts were good,but all 4 entrees (turkey,chicken,pork,and mahi-mahi) were dry and underseasoned.The food at the bar,Picante,was good,as were the lighter dishes available at Bananas,and the poolside grill.There is an outdoor restaurant called Sirena also,but we didn't get a chance to try it.The inhouse casino was fun,and there are 3 computers available in the lobby with free internet access .My daughters spent time on the computers,because there wasn't much for them to do at night.There were families with young children,couples,and some business travelers,but not a lot of teenagers around.We rented a car for 24 hours;just enough to spend an afternoon and evening browsing around old San Juan,and a half day at El Yunque rainforest.The hotel staff is helpful and pleasant-they genuinely seem happy to assist with any questions or requests.Overall,I would definitely recommend the Courtyard,and hope I stay again in the future.
