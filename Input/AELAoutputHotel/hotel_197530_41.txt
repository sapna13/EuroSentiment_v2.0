{"text":"Subtle and effective service, fabulous little hotel We stayed in this hotel during the height of the summer Paris season this June. Myself, my husband, and my six-year old son very much enjoyed our stay.The hotel staff was amazing. They were always there to lend a helpful hand with a tremendously positive attitude. When my son accidentally left behind a plush toy, they contacted me and immediately mailed it out so it was waiting for us when we arrived home.Breakfast is a little buffet with a good variety of foods. The rooms are small but well-appointed, and there was plenty of space for a rollaway bed for my son. Bathrooms are fabulous and well-designed. Hotel is very quiet and subtly elegant.Just a couple of blocks from the George V metro station, and from the Champs. Was right in the thick of things without the price or the noise of being right on the Champs. One of the things which amazed me were the number of languages the staff new. From many European languages, to Japanese, Chinese, and what sounded like Vietnamese -- many travelers will find themselves at ease in communicating no matter where they are from. (I hesitate to say the typical 'they speak english so well! for fear of being accused an obstanate American. But it is important to note that indeed they do speak english well if you are from a country that speaks a language I did not already list.)I cannot recommend this hotel more highly. We very much appreciated our stay and will stay again.
