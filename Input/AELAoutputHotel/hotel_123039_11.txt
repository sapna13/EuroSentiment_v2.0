{"text":"Great Hotel, Horrible Front Desk Upon arriving at the hotel, the front desk personnel treated us as if they were doing us a favor to check us in. The actual hotel was moderately clean except that the interior is starting to look a bit dated. Our room was fine except the foldout bed was very uncomfortable for our son. This hotel charges for internet access by the day which is unheard of in this day and age. Although the parking was free, it is not secured. The towels they provide were small and didn't dry you very well after a shower. The rooms were relatively clean and the location was quiet in the evening. When we were checking out, there was a discrepency in our hotel room rate. Because they hurried us through the process, I decided to deal with that when I got home since we were late for our plane. After getting home, I tried contacting Doubletree by using their toll free number but their agent told us that I had to discuss this issue by calling their hotel in Washington which has no toll free number. When I called that number and payed the toll call, they were again not willing to discuss the discrepancy with my room rate so I pretty much gave up with them. I would have to think twice before going back to this hotel again. Their personnel at this hotel were the worst I have encountered in the 30 plus years that I have been traveling around the world.
