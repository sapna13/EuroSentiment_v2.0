{"text":"NOT THE ONE On the last two times I went to Bali, I stayed at Grand Hyatt during my first visit back to Oct\/Nov 2007, and the last time I stayed at Gran Melia. If you are confused which hotel you should stay at, I recommend you to avoid this hotel. I'm not saying that this hotel is bad, but I found that the room is quite crampy and the bathroom is not up to a 5 stars hotel standard! I stayed there during my trip with my schoolmates..The lobby is nice, still I prefer Grand Hyatt's because at Grand Hyatt I had this 'free', 'escape' feeling. Then, on the way to your room, especially at night, the hallway is SCARY! It's like there's no one around but you feel like you're being followed. This might sounds a bit ridiculous but it's true. Both Hyatt and Melia are huuugeee resorts, but it's not supposed to give you this 'scary' feeling. I enjoyed walking alone at Grand Hyatt, but at Melia it gets scary.The room is much smaller than Grand Hyatt. I'm comparing the standard rooms. I've heard that the villas at Melia are awesome, but as I've never stayed at the villas, I think the room is rather a big disappointment. The bathroom door is locked traditionally which is supposed to be a nice touch of Balinese feeling, but it got cramped and not well kept, so the wood are showing its age and the bath is not that clean. While at Grand Hyatt, the bathroom is very spacious and luxurious! Sorry if I compare Melia with Hyatt so much, but hopefully my review helps those who found themselves in doubt whether or not to stay at Melia OR other resorts next to. The breakfast was awesome! Not disappointing at all. But if you order foods to be delivered to your room, its a total rip off!! The prices are way too expensive! The foods taste excellent, but the price doesn't go with it! I ordered fried rice for Rp 120,000. I don't expect a cheap fare for foods at hotels, I know the standard. But here, it's way too expensive! and they don't have cashiers at midnight, so you have to have the exact amount of money to pay, or charged when you check-out. The person who delivered my meal was very friendly and willingly help me.The facilities are greaaat though! The garden, pool, private beach, tennis court - these things are the reasons why staying at huge resorts is sooo great! The private beach is clean, and it's romantic to lay down there at night with your couple, or anyone. Hanging out in the pool is nice. There's a live music at the cafe beside the pool at sometimes at night. The welcome drink is a nice touch.One night, me and my roommates forgot to bring the keys, so I asked the reception to give me an extra key. The staff were not that helpful, they were not polite, and the others were just talking to themselves. The security was nice btw, I told him my name to get the extra key, but he rejected it telling me that it's not my room, but then I told him my roommate's name, then he gave me the extra key. In the end,, I'm not coming back here. I prefer Hilton and Grand Hyatt! The hallway is so damn frightening!
