{"text":"Super staff! The best part of our stay at the Hotel David was the staff. They helped us find a lively trattoria for dinner. They tried so very hard to help me recover my cell phone. They host a convivial, generous wine and snack event in the evenings. They juggle multiple guests' needs in the small check-in area with aplomb.The second best part was the very fair price they charge for a room in Florence.Since one of our party has arthritis, the somewhat long walk (15-20 min., a bit over a mile) to the Ponte Vecchio made the location unsuitable for us. If you want to get away from the tourist maelstrom and the more unsavory parts of town, however, the location is great. It's almost on the river, has a small courtyard-garden, and has flower boxes in many of the windows.Our room was a bright shade of salmon, and the halls are adorned with small murals for trim, so the decor is cheerful. Our room was large enough, though not large, and the bathroom was clean, white tile with one of those tiny quarter-round showers that are ubiquitous in Italy. The room was quiet too.The common spaces are filled with comfy, overstuffed furniture and well-used by the guests. In general, the furnishings are older, some antique, some not. There is no glamour and no drama to this hotel, just homey charm.Breakfast was standard continental - coffee, juices, rolls, baked goods, ham, cheese, yoghurt. The lift is small and up a few steps, but serviceable.I would recommend this hotel.
