{"text":"Good and centrally located Stayed at the Charlesmark for 1 night on a very cold January day. Ideally I would have given the Charlesmark a 3.5 (I never give a 5 unless something is absolutely perfect!). Reasons why it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ 4 for me:√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?here was a constant hum from the generators on next doors roof. Although not terribly annoying, it was there (and in fairness, the hotel can do nothing about this).√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?he heating system is hot air and was quite noisy, even on low. The hotel could do something about this.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ√ò don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like a hot bedroom so turned off the heating at night but woke later feeling very cold (well, it was -5C outside). I went in search of extra bedding but there was none, so I ended up turning on the heating. I was only staying one night and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ sure the hotel would have offered me additional bedding had I asked for it. However, I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really feel like making a fuss at 2am.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?here is very little storage area. If two people were staying for a week, they would need to live out of their suitcase.Now for the good things, which would make me come back to the hotel and recommend it to others, bearing the above in mind:√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?ood value for money.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ¬∫ery centrally located.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?revious reviews talk of traffic noise √à√\u2020\u2022?my room was at the back and it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a problem.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ√ülthough the room wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ huge (I had a Queen room) it was of ample sufficiency. The bed was very comfortable, the room clean with modern furnishings and good quality entertainment system, and, for a business traveller, the all important free WiFi.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?he bathroom was small but perfectly formed with an excellent hot shower, good accessories and well laid out, considering the size.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ¬Æreakfast is a very √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âontinental√à√\u2020\u2022?affair with tea, coffee and different pastries available. Not a huge amount of choice put perfectly acceptable.
