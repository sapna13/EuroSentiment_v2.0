{"text":"Nice Hotel in a Terrific Location My wife and I just stayed at the Splendid Etoile for eight nights in a superior room. Overall, we would highly recommend this hotel. First, it is in a very convenient location for traveling from the airport and getting around the city. The Air France bus shuttle from the airport stops right across the street and the Metro entrance is also within a block. We often took the Metro to our destination (Louve, D√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©?rsay, Latin Quarter etc.) and enjoyed the walk back to the Splendid Etoile taking different routes each day. Our room, number 503, had a nice view of the Arc and a pleasant balcony to enjoy the signs and sound of Paris. The room was a reasonable size and clean. The housekeeping staff is very good and on numerous occasions returned while we were out for dinner to tidy up the room. The concierge staff was fluent in English and provided friendly and helpful guidance. There is a nice convenience store just a block away which was great for morning fruit and yogurt. Unfortunately for us the bakery located at the end of Carnot Ave was open for only one day and then closed for vacation for the balance of our stay. It is a superb option for breakfast coffee, bread and pastries. We tried several of the restaurants within a short distance from the hotel and found L√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©√πrc, Lateral and Grande Armee to be decent. However, because you are so close to the Arc and Champs Elysee the local restaurant tend to be a little bit touristy. We would certainly return to the Splendid Etoile should our travels take us back to Paris.
