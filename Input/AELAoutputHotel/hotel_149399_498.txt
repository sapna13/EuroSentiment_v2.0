{"text":"Not a 5 Star 3.5 star We just returned 10-21 FEB. We chose this resort as my niece was getting married.The problems started for her..very business uncaring wedding planners.New tax instituted 1FEB from government of 375-500 USD on weddings that some people were paying and other couples had the wholesaler [Thompson Holidays] from England] absorb cost.First Choice initially was not going to which was who she booked thru.We are from USA so did booking here.We were VIP.. did not see much difference except guest sevices did help with dinner reservations..Serious problems with food ..we managed all specialty restaurants and the French and Capri [seafood] were the best but the management needs to take a look at the staff serving...very disorganized and and served cold.We had 1 warm meal at seafood after being there x2.The buffets had lots of course as mentioned catering to all cultures which was good.Lots of Europeans versus Americans so that was fun.I beer and only 1 beer,,,Presidente which got old after awhile.I white table wine and 1 red table wine ..poor quality but you could get a bottle of cheap American chardonnay for 30 USD.Sometimes drinks did not have alcohol in them which was funny to watch.Majority of people should go to Paradisus next door which had all the beers and higher drink labels.For the price we paid it was a 3.5 star instead of 5.The poor people that woud ring and ring for the dinner woud always think they were missing something but they were not except not being herded in a buffet.Beach as reported is the best and the water lovely.Shore excursions are double snorkeling prices elsewhere 73 USD but the rep told me they get 45 percent commission on tours so there you go.Wedding did turn out loely as grounds are immaculate so how could the background spoil a bride.The Royal Service she was in still did not get housekkeping for 2 days and they were limited on the block they had for booking restaurants.I did go see Riu Palace and I love the Riu properties.Never to go back..no one got sick but we were careful.
