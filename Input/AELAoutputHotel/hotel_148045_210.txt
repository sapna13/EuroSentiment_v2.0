{"text":"not worth the $$ Our troubles started upon check in. We were staying there for a wedding, and the price we were supposed to be paying for the wedding party was not recognized through the resort. We had to end up booking through another travel site, and paying much more. And after numerous attempts to call them to sort out the problem (long distance of course) and having no one answer the phone we had to stick with spending more money on reservations. After arriving to see if there was anything they could do to help us, they actually told us No and there was nothing they could do for us. Wow, horrible. The area around the pools are extremely slippery. The concrete they decided on was a horrible choice. And to get to the main pools, you have to walk through an outdoor restaurant. I felt rude basically interrupting people while they were enjoying lunch\/dinner just trying to get to the pool. Also, there is no easy way to get to the 3 different pools in the main area. Which leads me to my next complaint. My father already had a sprained ankle that was in the process of healing, very well I might add. Well, in trying to find a better way just to get to the hot tub from the pool, he ended up slipping (again on the slippery choice of flooring) and rolling his ankle again. It was horrible. And the staff there, didn't care. They looked at us like we were stupid when I was trying to rush to get him ice (and trying not to fall myself) and told them I needed a wheelchair ASAP. When the staff member finally showed up, he had the nerve to tell me Oh, don't worry the use of the wheelchair right now is free, but if you need it any other time it will be $25 a day Are you kidding me?? First of all....over something that happened at your resort, and the complete nerve of them to take advantage of people in that since is outrageous. The food. Well, the restaurants were wonderful. Dinner at the Stingray was amazing and the service was outstanding. Also, Blossoms was wonderful as well. And truly the other dinner places were great as well. However...the prices are insane!! One morning at breakfast, my husband and I (keep in mind it was just the two of us) had a $50 bill. $18 for Belgium waffles, and $4.50 for a glass of orange juice. And trust me, the waffles were not that impressive. There were only 3, and they were small. Also be prepared for the 20% automatic gratuity they put on. One other disgusting fact is, my husband and I went to David's Cookies one night and Wilma had the most disgusting gross finger nails I have ever seen in my entire life. They were long and brown with so much dirt and grime underneath I couldn't beleive that she was allowed to be in the food service industry. And she didn't wear gloves to get our food. Needless to say I couldn't eat. I put in a complaint with the front desk staff regarding this. The staff was touchy. They didn't seem to enjoy their job at all. One lady wouldn't even give us towels until we could prove that we were guests at the resort. I can understand, however we had wristbands on from going to Palomino Island earlier that day. The only way you can get a wristband is showing proof that you are guest there. So we then had to dig through all of our belongings to find our card just because the wristbands weren't good enough for her. The spa was wonderful. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. However, I had a Rain Forest facial there and the Esthetician was extremely heavy handed. It was not relaxing at all, the lights were on the whole time and she was cleaning during the treatment. Banging around utensils and the metal bowl they use. I wish I had choose a different treatment, I did hear the massage someone else had was wonderful. The rooms were ok. Not up to standard of a 4 or 5 star resort however. And the elevator did not have AC in it, and to top it off, it was slow. And be prepared for a lot of walking. The resort is almost too large and it truly makes it hard to get from point A to B. Palomino Island was very nice, however the ordeal of having to get there almost not worth it. All I can say is Good Luck to the future guests.
