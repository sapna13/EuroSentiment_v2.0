{"text":"An unusual stay at La Quinta Seattle Downtown La Quinta Inn  Suites Seattle Downtown has its ups and downs, and it will do well to point out both in order for future guests to know what they are getting themselves into.Let me start with the good points first. Its location, while on the fringes of downtown, is not really that bad if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mind walking. Seattle being a walker-friendly city has a simple lay-out that would not confuse any first-time visitor unless the triangular intersections in some areas get the better of you. If you love to visit the Space Needle though, you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be in luck as anyone can leisurely walk to the same in less than 10 minutes. The hotel, formerly known as Hawthorn Suites, has been renovated to reflect the chain√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ features. Although the finishing touches still leave much to be desired, there is a distinct homeliness (and dog-friendliness) that will make you feel at ease, especially that the hustle and bustle of activities in the main tourist sections can no longer be heard. The lobby and breakfast areas are clean, just as the small room providing free internet access. There is also an enclosed part which is supposed to be a pseudo-spa with heated Jacuzzi exclusively for guests. The two elevators, however, are so old that only one was functioning during our stay.The room we got was clean with a good toilet\/bath. There is a small fridge and microwave very useful when you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to eat out and just buy food from a convenience store two blocks away. Also, the cable TV has about 65 channels available. On the debit side, the balcony was obviously broken into in the past so a long wooden stick was placed on one side of the sliding door to reinforce security. It was reason enough for us not to leave our valuables inside the room when sightseeing or shopping. But one thing which terribly annoyed us was an unusual incident which happened during our second day. Since I am used to giving tips to housekeeping before checking out on the last morning, we left the room expecting the same to be cleaned by the time we return. Sure, it was tidied up, but on the notepad on the bedside table, the phrase √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??--] [--]√à√\u2020\u2022?was scribbled using either a fingernail or pointed object so you cannot easily read without putting the notepad close to your face. This alarmed us but thought it best to complain about the scribble the following morning to the manager. We were not sure yet if it was really housekeeping who did the same. Night came and passed and when I was taking a shower, the bathtub felt like it was rocking like a boat. It made me so dizzy that I stepped out of the room for fresh air after dressing up. At that point, my mother (who was reading the morning paper in her bed) told me that she felt something cold blew at the back of her neck while I was in the shower. She also added that √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºomeone√à√\u2020\u2022?(or a spirit) quickly walked by the balcony door going to the room entrance. This happened (including the rocking boat shower) for two days and it was a good thing we were already about to leave thereafter. Now, I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to make this review sound like a ghost story or something, but it surely made our skin crawl.In fairness to the hotel, the people at front desk were very easy to deal with. They always went out of their way for any small request or question we had. The complimentary breakfast items are constantly replenished and it always starts our day full and bright. Never mind the morning √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬©resence√à√\u2020\u2022?in the room. We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e more afraid of thieves\/robbers anyway. ","annotations":[]}
