{"text":"would not recommend this place We just returned from a week at the Princess Bavaro and very disappointing. Nowhere near a 5 star hotel. The accommodation provided through Sunwing tours was sub standard and not clearly described. There are 3 levels of accommodation\/service and the top being Platinum, one might have a better experience if you are able to book this level. This is a HUGE property and a beautiful one at that , however, the staff were clearly unable to handle the numbers of guests. We found that if you were fluent Spanish you also had a better chance of better, quicker service. We had a medical emergency in our group, and fortunately it was only a perforated eardrum and the response to our request for assistance was very upsetting. Had it been anything more serious and you couldn't speak Spanish, it could be very serious consequences. Yes it is a different country and reference is continuously made to DR time , they are still charging top prices for substandard service. The buffets were adequate but the individual restaurants, Sakura, Pescadora, Chopin, were awful....when we asked for assistance at the Casino the dealer rolled her eyes at us because we weren't able to communicate in Spanish. Clearly not customer focused for all guests.....The beach is beautiful, but it was very crowded and the water was very rough. very windy at this time of year.....however no one makes this clear before you travel..We have been to all but 5 islands in the Carribbean and this experience has been the most disappointing......
