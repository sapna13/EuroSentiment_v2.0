{"text":"Save yourself the trouble, go to Mexico For all of you that don't know, secrets excellence has been sold. In return you receive terrible service, awful food and rude hostesses. Our Room The rooms at the resort leave something to be desired. The beds are rock hard and the refrigerator can barely keep your drinks cold. The air conditioner blasts you with a spray of mold and mildew. We called guest services with many complaints, including the smell from the a\/c, lack of room service menu, no complimentary robes. Guest services brought our robes the next day, but never accomodated us on our other problems. The language gap may have had something to do with it. If you have any problems after 8 pm, please don't call guest services for they will not understand a word you are saying. The rooms are so muggy that if your clothes are the least bit wet, they will never dry on their own. Forget about the laundry service, to wash a single pair of underwear you will be forking over 3 bucks!! FOODIn a nutshell, the food was terrible. Like many of the reviews before mine, it seemed that the only palatable food at the buffets was the pizza. The beef is oversalted and tended to be overcooked. It seems that the food selections are more for europeans than americans. The formal restaurants were good and offered what seemed to be better quality meat. I would recommend Bordeaux, the chateau briand was good and the service was very friendly. In all, the nicer the venue the better the food. You are off getting dressed up every night and frequenting El Patio or Bordeaux, for all of the other restaurants are a complete waste of time. Oh yeah, and get there early, the wait at the formal restauarants can be long. They only have about 50 tables.AlcoholWhat do you expect, its all inclusive!! Tip early and often, and you will receive good, strong drinks. Benjamin at the beach side bar is friendly and knows how to make many tasty drinks. I don't have to many complaints about the bartending staff. As long as you order simple drinks you won't have too many problems. Pools and BeachLuckily the resort was not too crowded. We spent most of our time at the waterfall pool. The pool was nice, but had few chairs near the water. Get there early or you won't get a seat. The beach had great views, but they need to comb it. We found broken glass, litter, and alot of driftwood. They don;t take care of their beach property at all.In all, we won't be going back to this resort. We may never go back to Punta Cana. This resort was rated as a 6 Golden Apple, Apples highest grade. I would give this resort a 4. We stayed at a 5 apple in Mexico (aventura spa palace) and it blew this resort away in terms of appearance, service,food, etc. Save yourself alot of aggravation and go to Mexico. The people are friendlier and are able to meet the standards of spoiled Americans, like us.
