{"text":"Decent Hotel But Far From A High Class Paris Experience Just stayed 4 nights at the Hotel Innova on a business trip that allowed plenty of free time for Paris sightseeing. I found this hotel through the positive reviews on Trip Advisor.While I have no particular complaints about the hotel, let's keep it in perspective. The location is near a Metro stop (Pasteur) which is about 15 minutes to Concorde and about 10 minutes to the Convention Center. Not bad. There is very little to see or do near the hotel although it is about a 10-15 minute walk to the restaurants of Montparnesse.The rooms are about typical for a European business hotel which means it is rather small by U.S. standards. Those accustomed to a hotel as basic as a Marriott Courtyard or a Hampton Inn will think those are luxury hotels compared with the Innova. The double bed is actually two single beds pushed together and while the mattress was not terrible, nobody should think they are getting anything like what they would get in a typical U.S. chain hotel. There was a TV in the room but it could not have been more than about a 12 inch screen (not that you come to Paris to watch TV).The rate paid was around √à√\u2020√ü?0.00 per night making this hotel an excellent value for a business traveler or a budget traveler. If you are on vacation or a honeymoon and want a memorable romantic\/Parisian experience you should try to find a good deal at one of the better hotels in a different part of the city as there is nothing at all romantic about this 2 star property.
