{"text":"Fabulous Hotel If you are deciding whether to stay at this hotel or not then please book - you will not be dissapointed! Location - If arriving by air then take airport train to Sants station (approx 20 mins). The hotel is located directly across the road so is easy to find and you dont need to walk far with luggage. To get to the city centre the Metro station is 2 mins across the square and its only a few stops to the main sight seeing areas. The View - BREATHTAKING!! The restaurant is located on the top floor (23rd) and from here you have panoramic views from the mountains down to the sea. You can even see Sagrada Familia from here. Rooms - very well decorated, clean and modern. Marble bathroom with double sink and walk in shower which is huge. Very reasonable mini bar prices. Food - did not have dinner in the hotel but the breakfasts were lovely. Hot food on offer was poor but the selection of breads, cakes, cereals, fruits etc made up for this. Excellent coffee. Staff - very helpfull, on arrival the receptionist provided us with a map of the city and guided us to the best metro stop etc. Also gave us coupons for free cocktails in the hotel bar which was a nice touch. Restaurant staff were very friendly and allowed people to sit on after the 10am closing time. This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in and I cannot fault it in any way. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona in the future.
