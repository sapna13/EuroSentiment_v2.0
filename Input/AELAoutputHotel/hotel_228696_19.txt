{"text":"Great little hotel to stay in I find that this hotel is a great little hotel to stay in. The staff was very friendly to us. Every question I asked they were able to answer. I tried to speak French to the staff but my French was horrible. It is a good thing that the staff can speak decent English. I love the breakfast room and the breakfast buffet that they are serving everyday. Next to the hotel is a small meat and fruit market with great pate and jambon. If you would be willing to walk a little further down (10 minute walk) to where the Gallery Lafayette is there is a big shop like Walmart called Monoprix next to it where they everything that you need to buy at great prices. The hotel's location is also very great. I can take the Metro closely located by the hotel (5 minute walk) and can get to any places in Paris. It is also close to the L'Open tour hop-on, hop-off bus. The room was clean and comfortable to live in. Cleaning service was also great. I don't have many bad things to say about this hotel at all except perhaps I do wish that they would have an ice machine for the customer in the hotel but I couldn't find one. I would also wish that they provide free wireless internet service but they do not. It is available with cost. But with that said, I still like this hotel and would stay here again.
