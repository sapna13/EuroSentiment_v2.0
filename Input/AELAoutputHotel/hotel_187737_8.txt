{"text":"A hidden treasure We have just returned from one night at the Draycott Hotel in London which we booked so we could go and see Michael Buble at the O2 arena. The hotel is small yet perfect in every way and the small details had all been thought of. Complimentary tea and biscuits at 4pm were divine, it was like taking a step back in time to the old days when people greeted each other and conversed in quiet tones. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the wonderful staff. It was an absolutely stiflingly hot day when we arrived in London so was heaven to walk into a perfectly air conditioned luxuriously cool hotel reception area which was peace ful and tranquil away from the hubbub of Sloane Square nearby. Unfortunately we missed the glass of champagne at 6pm as we had to take the boat transfer to O2. That evening when we returned exhausted but happy (unfortunately too late for the complimentary mug of hot chocolate) we fell into the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in. The pillows seemed to be made of gossamer as did the bed covers. Breakfast the next morning was like eating in a Michelin starred restaurant - the scrambled egg was delicious - you have to try it!Overall I would say this is probably one of the loveliest hotels we have ever stayed in and the best by far in London.Fab staff, fab location and a bed that you just didn't want to leave! What more could you want?Thank you Draycott hotel for a wonderful time.
