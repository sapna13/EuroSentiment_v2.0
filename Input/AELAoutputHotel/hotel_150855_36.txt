{"text":"Definetely Not A 5 Star Resort!!!!! This was my 5th time to Punta Cana and I can honestly say that, although I love Punta Cana, this was by far the worst resort that I have ever stayed at. My fiance and I booked this trip last minute and was advised that the RIU Taino was an amazing place to stay at - well we beg to differ. This resort is graded as a 5 star but I would say it is more like a 3 star. Let me start off by saying that we are not picky travelers and we travel to various distintaions every year (sometimes twice a year). So by us typing this negative review, there must have been some issues. ROOMS - The rooms are very small and the beds are two single beds so if you are larger people they are not very comfortable. They provide you with one small pillow and the beds are like sleeping on the floor (rock hard). However, they will bring you another pillow upon request. The washrooms are okay but the showers are small. The bar was well stocked and the liquor dispensers were always full (not that we used it since we had plenty of alcohol throughout the day). The maids came in daily and did a nice job on the rooms and would even leave a towel decoration with flowers in your room which was nice. We usually tipped them 2-3 dollars a day.STAFF\/FOOD - I didn't find the staff as friendly at that this resort as I did at the Allegro, Grand Palladium, Occidental Grand Flemenco. The grounds staff, maids and reception staff were usually friendly but the bar and restaurant staff didn't appear to be that happy. It was also hard to get some sort of service in the buffet restarurants (and we are good tippers). The buffet restaurant was always packed and there was no such thing as waiting in line for your turn to the selections. Many people would bud and even try to take your toast when it came out of the toaster. We enjoyed the remainder of our meals at the sister resort RIU Bamboo which I enjoyed very much. People were friendlier over there and the selection of food was better over there. The RIU Taino food was not all that great, including the specialty restaurants.POOL - All I can say is that the pool at the sister resorts are better. We spent most of our time at the Bamboo resort's pool. Happier people over there and party galour. If you are interested in oil paintings - buy your painting around the Bamboo swim up pool bar (Johnny is very nice and does amazing work)BEACH - The beaches are amazing in Punta Cana no matter what resort you stay at but beach chairs we scarce on our resort since people would head down to the beach in the early morning and save them. We would just walk down the beach until we came across some vacant ones (no big deal).I would recommend that if you are going to stay at a RIU resort in Punta Cana you book the Bamboo, Palace Macao or the RIU Palace (which is breathtaking - we walked through it).I would not return to the RIU Taino resort again for numerous reasons no matter how cheap it was.
