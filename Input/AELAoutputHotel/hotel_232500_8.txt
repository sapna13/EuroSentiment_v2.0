{"text":"Limited Shuttle Service; Poor location, but nice rooms I just stayed there for 2 nights. Not recommended for backpackers\/singles. First of all... The room is amazing and well equipped\/supplied. Clean, no smell, no noise. Staff had great service. Great place to rest\/sleep.Biggest negative: Their shuttle service to\/from Airport only runs from 0600-2345. If you need transportation during other times, you'llhave to take the Taxi (about $20 Euros), and only if you've reserved in advance. Shuttle is usually packed, but haven't seen anyone left behind. Hotel is about 15 min by shuttle to the Airport, so can't walk it. Shuttle was very prompt every time... so don't be late.The Airport can actually serve as a great base. Frequent trains to Central Station run 24 hrs. Return ticket is $6.20 Euros. 4am is cut-off point for day\/night. Ride is about 15 min. Another 15 min walk tomost night life areas. Medium luggage storage locker available at $6 Euro for 24 hrs. Hilton and Sheraton seems to be within walking distance of the airport (500m), so might be something to consider. Cut out the reliance on shuttle service, and 30 min each way could mean big savings vs. city-center locations.If you have few luggage and flying out early morning, another option to save big is to store the luggage for the last night. Check out on the last day, store the luggage, party hard. Most bars\/clubs close after 2am, but a few closes after 3am\/4am time frame depending on weekday\/weekend. Take the train back to the Airport, nap in the grandlobby, pickup luggage, and you'll be first in line at check-in. Would've done it myself if I knew this beforehand. ","annotations":[]}
