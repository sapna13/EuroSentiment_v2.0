{"text":"Paradise in Bali! We stayed just three short days at this magnificient resort!On arrival, we had been upgraded to a Suite! Oh my! It was 77sqm of absolute luxury!! This was our third stay at Le Meridien and each time just gets better!From the moment we arrived until we left, nothing was any bother for the staff. Not that we wanted for anything!Our suite was very well appointed with beautiful pictures on the walls, a powder room, a living room with settee, chairs and TV and sound system and an alcove which housed the fridge\/tea making facilities. All this opened on to a balcony overlooking the 7th fairway of the golf course. The bedroom was beyond double doors with a chaise lounge, another TV, balcony, and king size bed. A passage way led to a make up alcove, a huge walk in robe and a really big bathroom! Beautiful toiletries were provided on a daily basis, as was three pieces of fresh fruit and a lovely little floral display! We even got a little wooden box with six exquisite hand made chocolates!! Breakfast in the Cendana Restaurant is excellent, with a juice station and staff on hand to freshly prepare juice to your liking.The Egg Station also had freshly made pancakes and waffles and real maple syrup and freshly whipped cream and walnuts and fresh strawberrries!We ate at the Cendana one evening and twice at the Nautilus Fun Pub. My husband said the Lamb Shanks at Nautilus were the best he has had!! (He had them both nights!!!). My husband is the golfer and played twice and said the course was in very good condition! He visited the Spa on each of the days and had a fantastic massage by Made Sumiati! She is very professional and is very good at her work.!! He said the ginger tea after the massage was very good also.I found some good quality pieces in the Boutique in the complex.Although the prices were more than Kuta, the quality is incomparable. All the staff were very friendly, the rooms were cleaned meticulously each day, the pools and grounds were well maintained.Undoubtedly, we will be back for a fourth visit!
