{"text":"Very nice, but not perfect I decided to write something helpful for the people who are planning to stay in this hotel as I had killed a lot of time on reading from this site and was shocked at the diversity of opinions. Thus I would try to be as objective and precise as possible.The HOTEL is like a small town, but it is easy to get around (if you are not a complete moran of course) as you are given a map. The transportation system is effective.There are lots of PARTS and CLUBS there: Premier (futherst from the beach, secluded), Bavaro and Punta Cana sides are mirrow reflections of each other, Golden Club (closest to the sea), Ambar (the newest part, close to the see) and so on.My girlfriend and I booked Golden Club, but got upgraded to Ambar, which was very lucky as being in Ambar you can use all the facilities and restaurants of other parts, but no outside can use yours. What a feel of exclusiveness. Besides Ambar is adults only. Othewise there is almost no difference where you live.Now there is a CONSTRUCTION next to Punta Cana reception and along the Bavaro side, mind not to get there - all the other places are ok.Some of the staff speak adequate ENGLISH, at least one person at the reception and head waiters. You should not expect the others to do so.The TERRITORY is beautiful and very clean, the BEACH is great, though there was a bit of sea weed sometimes, but it is safe.The ROOM was ok, NO BUGS seen in ten days. You have to pay for the SAFE 3-4 $ per day.The FOOD is GOOD, if MacDonalds is not the corner stone of your diet. We went to 4 restaurants and found out that our Ambar Buffet was better than any of them as it had more variety. For those who enjoy seafood can recommend Pescador (fisherman). Can't say anything about Bavaro and Punta Cana buffets cause we didn't eat there. Snack bar is OK. Mind that you need to have trousers for dinner and shorts for the snack bar.As for ENTERTAINMENT: there are nightly shows and the corcert hall is always packed (I couldn't make myself to watch them for more than 10 minutes though); there are some watersports, but they are not free (as you have to pay insurance) and some other stuff of no importance.We entertained ouselves.Hope my review will help you to make your decision.
