{"text":"A Lesson in Compromise I stayed in the Ritz Carlton based on exceptionally low rates on the company's website and glowing online reviews. Although I'm hardly a devotee of the Ritz Carlton brand, it was at the end of a six week trip through Southeast Asia--and after staying at the legendary hotels in other cities, I thought perhaps I could forgo one top hotel on my trip and still be reasonably comfortable and contented with my choice. I was wrong. The Ritz was teeming with tourist groups and families who had no doubt been lured (like me!) by the rate and the raves about the property's amenities and signature saltwater Thalasso spa. Although the grounds were lush with flora and beautifully landscaped gardens, the din of the lobby and crowded pool area was not remotely resort-like or relaxing. It felt more like a convention taken over by the spouses and offspring of the conventioneers.Once shown to my room, I was immediately taken by the cheap quality of the materials used to furnish it--quintessential Ritz style chintz and marble on a poor man's budget. What's more, the walls were paper thin. I could hear the couple next door talking as if they were standing behind my headboard.The next morning, I was awakened at 7:30AM by loud chatter and laughter outside my window. When I drew the curtains back, I was astonished to see three employees gardening five feet outside of my room, socializing as loudly as if it were the middle of the day! I went to the breakfast buffet--which was jam packed with families and children--and immediately felt queasy after drinking the orange juice and tasting my cold scrambled eggs. My spirits were further soured by unsightly unbussed cups and saucers at the only free table I could find. I sustained a mild case of food poisoning from breakfast, and spent the early part of the afternoon resting in the room and wearing earplugs to drown out the noise of the gardeners on one side of my room, and hotel guests passing by my door on the other.The poor customer service didn't stop with dirty dishes and rude gardeners. On several occasions I asked the concierge to help me book a tour or deliver a newspaper to my room. In the Hong Kong Peninsula or the Raffles in Singapore I would have received cordial phone messages and faxes confirming my requests. At the Ritz Carlton, they blew them off. I never received a copy of the daily morning paper I saw at other people's doors. Finally, on my second evening, twisting my body like a contortionist while training my camera on the setting sun, trying to achieve the illusion of a tranquil sunset (hundreds of people around me, I'm not exaggerating, were marring the frame and taking pictures of that sun!), I had had it. I went up to my room and called the Four Seasons in Sayan, Ubud. I explained the noise\/crowd issue to the manager, who was sympathetic to my plight and told me he had heard the complaints many times before. He offered me a peaceful villa with a plunge pool and breakfast. I checked out of that noisy, crowded, poor imitation of a five star luxury hotel and never looked back.
