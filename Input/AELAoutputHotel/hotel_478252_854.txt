{"text":"Incredible - Loved It!!!! The place is gorgeous! Very clean! The food is excellent! The wine, however, is atrocious! For the most part the service was super - except for in our room (and we tipped 5$ a day), but constantly had to ask for towels, water, coffee, or cream to go with the coffee. We were in the golden, and they didn't start giving us the chocolates until mid week (not that I cared, or even remembered until I saw them). But everybody is so friendly, and the women who cleaned our room were friendly too, and came right away each time we needed towels or face cloths or water or whatever we needed, so we forgave and tipped anyway. They didn't ever make anything special with the towels on our bed or in the bathroom - but again, it isn't necessary to have a nice time. But is the Gran Bahia ever huge!!!! Not that I am complaining. I loved walking to and from places - it kept me in shape. We always walked every where, out of choice, because the weather was great and it was fun to do so! But if we didn't want to, we could have taken the transportation that was provided. We had block number 60 (super! super! super! with partial ocean view and as close to the beach as can be!) We loved it. I needed to get up every morning at around 6:00 a.m. to place our things or else we wouldn't have chairs (we went one morning at 8:30 - 9:00) and there were no chairs at all (we struggled to find the two we eventually found) - and definitely no shade. So after that I got up and we were set for the day. I was happy to be that close to the beach. It must have been hard for those who were further away.I loved having the beach towels in my room, and I especially loved being able to have the free INTERNET. Yes 15 minutes at a time, but you could go back several times a day if you needed to. We didn't - it was plenty to be able to communicate back and forth with our kids.The food was truly great! The restaurants were super (French and Italian were the best). Again, everybody was so wonderful it made our stay super. We stayed in club Golden and would do it again. We loved being so close to the beach.The shows were OK, but the Micheal Jackson show was super!!!! We enjoyed all the shows we saw.Coming home, they tried to charge us an extra 50$ for extra weight - which we didn't believe because we had plenty of extra weight going and we barely bought anything. So I remembered that if we told them we would pay with American express, they would let us go. At first they said, just pay us 30$ and they wwould be happy (but would not give us baggage tickets) and I was shocked and told them no way. So when I told them we only had American express, they told us it was OK and let us go through. I wasn't too pleased about that. Oh well, I am glad I knew ahead of time!!!!All in all it was a wonderful vacation. Sun every day with 30 c (the only day it rained was the first day, it rained for about an hour - while we were eating lunch).Would we go back? No. Only because we never go back to the same place twice - because we like to try different places. Next time we will try somewhere were we can go visit the country a bit more (museums and things like that). Also, though I loved the walking I did find that the place was maybe too big. That is just my personal opinion - it does not take away from the beauty of the place nor the service. And as for our room, it seemed like most people we talked to had wonderful room service, so don't worry about that (yes they do walk into your room at any time without nocking - it could have been embarrassing a few times - but we started getting used to it!!!!). Remember to pay for a safe. An absolute must!!!! As for the getting the room - is was great they booked us in on the bus - however, we couldn't get our key right away (it took 3 hours) and getting the safe and booking the restaurants was very, very, very long.A super place to visit! A great choice and we don't regret going there. I recommend the Golden to everyone. I recommend the hotel - I just loved it and had a truly wonderful time.
