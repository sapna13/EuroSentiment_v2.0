{"text":"Perfect for us! I stayed at this hotel with a friend of mine for three nights. It was absolutely perfect for us! We were looking for something low cost that was in a great location. We shared the one bed, which wasn't very comfortable, and the view from our room was of a cement wall... but really how much time do you plan to spend in the room anyway?!?! Oh and the hair dryer was not good at all.. bring your own!! If you don't have your own converter they will provide you with one at the front desk. Also, there is a computer for your use in the lobby. The staff is nice and helpful, and they speak English very well. There are some nice inexpensive places to eat right around the hotel, but I can't remember the names of any of the places we went.You can walk anywhere from the hotel. The first day we walked to Notre Dame, then back to the hotel to catch up on zzzz's! It is definitely worth the extra money to go to the top to see the gargoyles and the view of the city. The second day we walked to the Louvre, down Champs Elysees to the Arc de Triomphe, all the way to the Catacombs (very long walk), and then back to the Eiffel Tower! We are both young and very active, so it worked for us. The metro station is right by the hotel so on the third day we went to Montmarte. Besides getting to and from the airport, it was the only time we used public transportation!! We walked to the Sacre Coeur and Moulin Rouge and hit up some of the boutiques. When we got back to the hotel we walked over to le Bon Marche department store and grocery store. The grocery store is a great place to get some souveniers... they have herbs for only a couple of dollars that make a nice gift since the packaging is in French! A litle more romantic!! We live in NYC so we are used to walking a lot, but this was a great itinerary and I recommend it to anyone in Paris for a short trip!
