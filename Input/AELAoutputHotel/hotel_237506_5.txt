{"text":"The best stay in Firenze We were recommended this hotel by an Italian conference organization group (Consultia Umbria) as we were attending a week long conference at the Fortezza di Basso. The location of this hotel could not be more fantastic. A 7 minute walk to the train station, minutes from the Duomo, San Lorenzo church, seconds from the world-famous open air market and a lovely walk from the Ponte Vecchio and the Boboli Gardens. It was a pleasant 10-15 minute walk to our conference center in the morning. It was safe, secure, and the breakfast was absolutely amazing. There is a woman who greets you with a buongiorno and asks if you'd like cafe. Say yes, and savor the most amazing cafe latte you'll ever have! The breakfast included orange juice, yogurt, cereals, meats, fresh fruit, croissants--an all around filling breakfast and was one of the highlights of our trip. We were greeted nicely by the desk staff (we stayed 8 nights total, one more night than originally planned--they were very flexible in letting us stay longer) and Olivier, the day manager, went out of his way to ensure we received a package that was to be delivered to the hotel. Unfortunately, there was a charge on the package and he could not accept the charges, so he did a ton of research, made us a map, and told us how to get the package. When it was redelivered the next morning, charges still affixed, he PAID for it out of his own pocket and we paid him back. The internet was included, as was breakfast, and you are able to access it from your room.Fantastic service, I will definitely be staying there on our next trip. One downside: each room is very unique and we happened to get a room with a teeny, teeny tiny shower. Most of the staff speaks some English, so don't be shy and give them a call if you have a special preference for a room.
