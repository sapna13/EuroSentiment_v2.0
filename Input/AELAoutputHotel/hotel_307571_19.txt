{"text":"Fantastic We arrived at the Four Seasons in Jimbaran after a lovely 3 nights at the Oberoi in nearby Seminyak and were anxious that the extra money we had paid for the FS was not going to be worth it! We were relieved to find the hotel met every expectation we had had, the rooms are gorgeous! Overall our stay was fantastic with the facilities being well equipped and the staff extremely friendly and helpful (without being intrusive).Some of the earlier reviews mention the aeroplane noise over the resort, but we didn't notice more than two flights a day passing over the resort and the noise was gone within 60 seconds - hardly excessive and not even a minor irritation!One minor point is the cost of both the food and drinks in the hotel, which compared to the Oberoi (five star as well) was more expensive, especially as the Oberoi included the 11% tax and 5% service charge within their prices and the FS added the 11% tax and 10% service charge on top of their listed prices. eg Bintang Beer at the Oberoi was 45,000 Rupiah incl. tax and service at the FS this is 65,000 Rupiah excl. 21% taxes etc!Not a horrendous deal but a little frustrating especially as there is not much choice around the hotel without getting a cab.We did find the Warung Mei restaurant a little more reasonable and the food was excellent (Indonesian cuisine).We will definately recomend this hotel to our friends and will try and come back here ourselves it is perfect for a special occasion treat!
