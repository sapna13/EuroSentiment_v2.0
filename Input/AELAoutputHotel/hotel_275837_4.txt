{"text":"Cosy hotel in great location. Good pick ! I stayed there for 3 days in December 2007.The set up and looks of the hotel certainly deserves its 3 stars. The nice Salon, furniture, high ceiling and marvelous stone floors gives it a mix of cosy  luxurious.There's a 24 hour desk and the staff is very professionnal and helpful. Somehow the professionnalism doesn't translate into a warm reception but all the same, the standard is that of a large hotel. Breakfast was typical of Italian hotels.They do not have other meal services.There's truly a marvelous terrasse overseing the square...would have loved to sit there in the hot summer months.The room was very nice and clean. Perhaps a bit small but then, when in Florence, how much time do you expect to spend in your room. Again, the room floor had wonderful stone finish and the bathroom was modern and large. My room(109) had a wonderful terrasse which only I had access to. It' was one of those enclose by 4 walls which keeps you in the shade...not useful in December but great in the hot summer months.Many sights are within walking distance - actually, all Florence center is easily done walking - and the area is quite safe at night for those that worry about area security. Proximity to the train and bus station is a major benefits as many day trips can be done from Florence - Pise;Siena; Venice -.Overall, a definite thumbs up.Keep in mind that as I was in low season, I paid less than a third than the price shown on the room tag (175 Euro). Everything is relative and the quality was great for the price paid. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":159,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":155}]}
