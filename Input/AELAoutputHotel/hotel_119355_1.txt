{"text":"Another airport hotel... What should be a great hotel suffers from infrastructure weaknesses. They should consider spending a few dollars on fixing sound problems.We checked in to room 405 around 11 PM and the hotel was very quiet. Nice staff. The room had no toilet paper (one empty roll and one with less than 10 sheets left) but the staff got us a roll quickly. There was a used towel. The room was decently appointed although the cover on the light fixture in the bathroom was torn (this was reported by another TripAdvisor reviewer a few months ago and I hope this isn't the same room and they have chosen to ignore the problem). The shower curtain was too short and I would guess that they measured the width of the shower without adding extra for the circular shower rod. A nice feature was the relaxation CD set up on the clock-radio\/CD player. The beds and pillows were comfortable. We slept very soundly.Then at about 5 AM the noise started. Delivery trucks and plane noise were very apparent. I checked to see if the windows were dual paned and they were, but they were really cheap and the inside glass rattled when I tapped it. There was no way they were modern low-e units. The hotel would be smart to upgrade these. Perhaps also add thicker drapes.The room next door had an alarm go off at around 7 AM and there was no one in the room to turn it off. People talking in the halls also was distracting. At 8 AM the cleaning staff walked in without a knock.Disappointing given the quality of desk staff, wonderful beds, and overall nice layout, location, and furnishing of the rooms.I did get the room from Priceline and this is probably the worst room in the hotel. For that I got six solid hours of great sleep. They could really improve the noise level with upgraded windows and I could have made it eight hours of great sleep . There's about 300 rooms so that's some major money but it's a business expense that would remove most of my criticisms of this potentially great hotel.
