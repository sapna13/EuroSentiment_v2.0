{"text":"10\/10 - Very impressed! My daughter and I stayed in this hotel last week 3-6th June. VERY impressed with it. Central √à√\u2020\u2022?as their name suggests √à√\u2020\u2022?very near the Duomo. The room and bathroom were immaculate. The beds were extremely comfortable. Air conditioning working and easily adjusted to suit. Staff were friendly and very helpful. We couldnt work the TV √à√\u2020\u2022?this was immediately sorted out by the receptionist. Large choice at breakfast √à√\u2020\u2022?hams, cheese, fresh fruit, cakes, etc. much like a larger hotel. Despite being in the centre of town, it was very quiet (our room was at the back). Large choice at breakfast √à√\u2020\u2022?hams, cheese, fresh fruit, cakes, etc. much like a larger hotel. They booked a table for us at the restaurant we requested. * see below. The one they recommended to us where they were offering a 10% discount √à√\u2020\u2022?you have to be sure to get there before a certain time to get the discount √à√\u2020\u2022?we didnt read the leaflet and got there too late but the meal was quite good. Sorry, cant remember the name. An added advantage was the free internet access. We found this very useful.The hotel was hard to find, down a side street. But like others have said, get a good map and you are OK. Finding your way back each day is easy, using the Duomo as a guide point.The small lift others have said was too small, was not. It was enough for two with two large suitcases √à√\u2020\u2022?no problem.The only negative thing was, in our room √à√\u2020\u2022?No. 4 (Lippi) there was a flashing red and green light in the room, linked to a wall heater which was a bit distracting in the room at night but this is the only bad thing we can say about this very nice hotel. * We recommend the Ristorante Acqua al 2 which was the one the hotel booked for us. A gourmet experience. They do sample plates of salad, pasta, main course and desserts. We had plates to share of 5 different pastas and then 4 different desserts. It was all delicious. They are famous for their blueberry steak. Would have liked this but found the pasta filled us up too much. Approx. 45E for the two of us, for the pasta and dessert selection plus water and a bottle of wine. Amazed at the price!
