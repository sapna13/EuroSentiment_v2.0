{"text":"It is what it is -- and that's pretty much OK You can't beat the location, just a block or so from Amsterdam Central Station and the Red Light District. The staff was very helpful -- they were nice enough to get my room ready a few hours before normal check-in. Very friendly -- even the waitstaff was pleasant (the lobby doubles as a restaurant).Breakfasts are about as basic as they come. If you'd like a break from the hotel breakfast, I recommend De Vergulde Lantaarn, which opens at 9 most days (10 on Sundays, I think). It's on the street just behind the hotel (red and white awning). (Go north from the hotel, hang a left at the first alley -- it's a narrow street, then left at the first street. About 100 feet down on your left.)Basic accommodations (I had a single room) and that's about it. You get two towels and the soap comes in a dispenser (no swiping bars to take home). Housekeeping, heaven knows why, likes to come in a lot -- it wasn't unusual for them to show up three times a day. Though the rooms had deadbolt locks, housekeeping had no way of knowing I was trying to get some sleep -- no Do Not Disturb tags. So, they'd constantly knock to get in.I got the feeling the same people own several of the hotels along the Damrak -- I seemed to see the same people in several of the hotels.Pretty good sized room safe (enough for a laptop computer and a couple external drives with room to spare.)If you're looking for a basic room to serve as home base, you'll do OK here. Things got a little noisy in the halls in the evening but nothing that disturbed me too much. If you need somewhat better accommodations, try the Hotel Inntel, the Victoria or the Golden Tulip (all within a stone's throw of the Hotel Damrak). I wouldn't recommend this place for a honeymoon but, for what it is, you'll be OK. (FYI, the Inntel is directly across from the Betty Boop Coffee Shop -- where Quentin Tarantino wrote a good bit of Pulp Fiction.)If you're really looking to spend some coin but stay in the same location, try the Swisshotel or, if you really have deep pockets, the Krasnopolski.
