{"text":"Great hotel, great location I called to book a room and was a little concerned because they either have 1 king or 2 beds and you can't reserve a particular room. I told the lady that we have 3 people and have to have 2 beds. She said that would be fine. We drove in and the hotel was right there on 5th street. Getting to the parking garage was a different matter. You have to turn BEFORE the hotel to get into the garage. We tried to go around the block but you can turn right, can't turn left, on and on. It took us 45 minutes to get into the garage. Driving in SF is crazy!Anyway, I asked when we got there to make sure we have 2 beds and she said they were out of those but would give us a free upgrade and a roll away was in the room. The upgrade part was that we had a little kitchenette which was real nice since we were staying 4 nights. Our king bed and the bathroom were behind 2 doors for privacy. We liked that a lot. And our bed was devine! Our son was fine on the rollaway. He is 6'3 and was a little too long but he slept great.We each had a tv and there was free internet. No breakfast and I do NOT recommend Venue. That place was a disaster and wasn't good. Across the street is a little pastry place and cereal so we recommend that place instead.The city is very, very noisy! You can ask for a room on the back side of the hotel I suppose but I think it would still be noisy. It seems everytime a call is made for emergency they send1 fire truck, 1 police car and 1 ambulance. It is just noisy.The location is great for using the bus system and trolley. There is a huge mall on the same block so that was handy for food and there is a market in there as well. If we were to go back to SF we would maybe stay out of the area as long as BART was able to get us into town. But if this is your first time in SF I would recommend this hotel.
