{"text":"Adequate but stinky I was put in this hotel by Singapore Airlines after I missed a connection due to their late flight. They assured me it is the hotel they use for first class passengers (though I was only in business class on the flight). I arrived in the early evening and left the next morning, so my experience was limited. However, three things particularly struck me about the hotel:1. There was no way to get the guest room to a high enough temperature to be comfortable,2. Though I was told that the entire hotel was non-smoking, the room in which I was placed had clearly been a smoking room very recently, because I not only couldn't rest well, but I became physicall ill and could barely breathe because of the smell of stale cigarette smoke, and3. The buffet breakfast is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had at a hotel. Indeed, my room service dinner the night before was bountiful, beautiful, and reasonably priced, so the terrific breakfast was simply the next food installment. I won't stay here again (there's a Conrad a short distance away), and had I known how pervasive and persistent the cigarette smell would be, I would have moved (but I was already tired and foolishly thought that it would go away or I would become used to it). I can see that this has the potential for a very good hotel; I simply don't think my experience there was a pleasant one, and my assessment of the property, therefore, is probably much more negative than the hotel generally merits.
