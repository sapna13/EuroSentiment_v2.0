{"text":"Think twice before staying here We decided to stay at the Renaissance because of the reviews. Well, it didn't start off so great. When we booked the room we asked if we could possibly get an early check in and were told that shouldn't be a problem, so we drove in from Huntington Beach and arrived at around 1:00 pm and were told that it would be at least 2 more hours before our room would be ready. That is regular check in time, well our room was not even ready then. It was over 100 outside but we walked around the mall near by had some lunch, etc.. finally we got our room. It was a studio suite at $315.00 per night. It was okay, the view was of the street in front of the hotel, not so great even though they told us we would have a great view. We were on the 3rd floor. I booked a limo with the concierge to take us to dinner at Spago for our 19th anniversary. He made the arrangements, gave me the price and I in turn gave him a nice tip! Well after our 3 hour limo trip to dinner, I was over charged $104.00 The next morning I talked with the staff who made the arrangements and he said he would take care of it. Today it is 9 days later, I have made over 8 phone calls to the staff and nothing has been done!!!! My credit card was charged $408.00.............when I called this am the staff answering the phone was completely rude! I was told the staff who made the arrangements would call back in 5 minutes, still haven't heard a word.At 4:30 am we were woken up by banging and sounds of moving furniture behind our wall in the bedroom area. It went on for a couple of hours. We could not figure out what the sounds were, but needless to say, we were awake very early that day. I called the front desk and ended up speaking to the night manager. He said he didn't know what it could be, but offered 2 breakfast vouchers- WOW, that was really nice LOL!!! We were suppose to stay another night, but opted to check-out. They couldn't even offer another room because it was sold out. Come to find out, behind our room was a conference room and they were setting up for an early morning meeting, too bad for us.There was one staff person Lisa who was so wonderful!!! She knew it was our anniversary, had champagne, strawberries, cheese, etc.. sent to our room with a card. And she really was a doll! She really tried to make everything right and her customer service skills were great! Everyone at that hotel should take lessons from her. I work in the Special Events industry and supervise staff that work directly with the public. I would never allow my staff to respond and react to customers as some of these people did. Advise to those who want to stay there, go to Beverly Hills or LA, it is close and you will get so much more for your money. We spent our last night at the Four Seasons...................need I say more.
