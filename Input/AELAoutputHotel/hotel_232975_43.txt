{"text":"Wonderful staff The hotel staff were exceptionally helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for them. All the staff we met were friendly and seemed please to help in order that we had a great stay. I would go back to this hotel. However if you are planning to spend a lot of time in the hotel, rather that use it as a base, you may find there's limited facilities.The room we stayed was large enough for the three of us and all beds were comfortable, even the sofa bed. The bathroom was very clean and reasonably spacious. The shower was powerful and water was constantly hot. We had air conditioning in the room which was necessary as our room over looked the main road and it would have been too noisy to have the windows open.The Hotel was central to all the main attractions and most were within walking distance.We flew into Pisa and took the airport bus as the trains were on strike, this worked reasonable well. On our return we went by train and left our luggage in the train station while we visited the tower.Things to watch for, 1) make sure you pre-order tickets for Galleria degli Uttizi  Academia, as the queue are extremely long, especially in the summer months.2) make sure you take the right travel plug adaptors, seemingly Italy is different to the rest of European countries.3) If you plan to travel around by local buses, you need to buy your tickets before getting on the bus.
