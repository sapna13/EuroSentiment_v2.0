{"text":"I thought Id died and arrived in heaven This is itthis is what Paris isGeorge V is the ultimate Parisian HotelWe were met at the door of the airplane by a gent holding a card with our name, whisked passed the queue thru the diplomats\/staff aisle then our luggage was located and taken to our van \/ transfer.Our driver took us to George V and gave us a mini tour on the way. Upon arrival we were met by the doorman as if coming to our own home, very warm and welcoming. Reception check in was efficient and very courteous. We were personally taken up to our 2 rooms and the young German lady explained everything to us - made us feel like well as if everyone really appreciated us staying at George V. The rooms were gorgeous. On the 6th floor side view onto George V Avenue. The housekeeping kept the rooms immaculate, replenishing the toileteries Bulgari !!! and just continuing the absolute blissfull state from beginning until end.We had breakfast each morning (included in our stay) and felt nothing but pampered by EVERYONE on staff. The food was faultless, delicious, well presented and served by staff who served as if they were actually enjoying their job.The flower arrangements were the most beautiful and creative display of art comparable to none other.....the mood in the hotel was one of quiet luxury and peaceful well co ordinated staff who just wanted to do their best and were always on their best most personable behaviour for ALL guests staying.If you ever have the opportunity of going to Paris - my only tip would be to stay at George V and get a taste of heaven.
