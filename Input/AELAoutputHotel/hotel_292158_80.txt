{"text":"Grand Palladium Punta Cana Resort vacation My girlfriend and I stayed at the Grand Palladium, Punta Canna Resort and Spa for 7 nights. We booked our trip through Apple Vacations, which we highly recommend. Their all inclusive prices were great, their on site representatives made sure we were happy and well informed about tours, and a variety of general information. We had a great time and enjoyed our stay in this beautiful resort. What we loved the most we had access to all three Grand Palladium Resorts, all within walking distance. These resorts sit in 80 acres of beautiful grounds.The rooms were incredible, and let's see, the beach, the pools, the variety of restaurants on the premises, the service the people could not do enough for us. Of course you always find a few people complaining about this and that, but they are usually people that are miserable anywhere they go. Please when you visit this incredilbe island, be respectful to the locals. They don't all speak english, but they make sure they accomodate you at 120%. You get service with a wonderful smile. Some speak English, German, French and their native language which is Spanish. They are simple, happy and wonderful people to be around. If you are the type that likes to venture on your own to explore the island, this is not a good idea. The hotels offer many incredible daily escorted tours that you can explore and feel very safe. The Grand Palladium resorts accomodate Europeans, Canadians, Latin Americans and Americans. You will meet may people from these countries who bring their entire families at this resort from 4 years old to 75 years old. This resort is recommended for family vacations, honeymooners, singles, single parents and anyone who is looking to have a really fun, relaxing vacation by the sea. Neither one of us got sick. The weather in this island is in the mid 80's every day, year round. The hottest month is August (will not recommend you go then). It is sunny every day, it rains two times a day, for approximately 10-15 minutes every day (to water the beautiful flowers and trees and grounds), and then the beautiful sun shines again. If you do not want to get sick on this island, here are some suggestions. Do not drink their water, or use ice on your drinks (the water bottles are FREE all day long for you), do not use regular sink water in your coffee in your room (bottled water available for you in your mini bars and regular bars), avoid excessive all inclusive alcohol during the day especially the delicious fruity drinks. We only took one all day tour, The Bavaro Runners tour,which was incredible and a great eye opener as to how the locals live. We visited villages, people making coffee, cigars, sugar cane fields, a local gorgeous beach, horseback riding (optional ride),you will see plenty of local life. Bring the children crayons, coloring books, clothes, plenty of candy, or toys.The local children do not have any of these products available to them. The tour guides, ask if you are interested in sharing anything with the children (they do not recommend $$), and if you have to give, they make stops at the villages and bring the little kids on the buses to visit you and say Ola to you and Mucho Gracias with great smiling faces when you offer them anything. It is an awesome experience if you have the opportunity to do so. But enjoy what you have in your life and enjoy this beautiful country for a relaxing, fun and incredible vacation.
