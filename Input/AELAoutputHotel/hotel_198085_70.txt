{"text":"Silver Wedding Anniversary Stay at the Terrass Hotel We visited the Terrass as part of our 25th Wedding Anniversary celebrations, and took in two days racing at Longchamp - the Prix De L'Arc de Triomphe Meeting. We took a room on the second floor, which afforded no view. With the benefit of hindsight, and the other reviews on here, perhaps we would have requested a better room. That said, on Arc weekend, our choice may have been more restricted.The room was very clean, and of quite a high standard. We were pleased with the level of accomodation. We booked via 'Hotels Direct' and did so on the basis of board and full cooked breakfast. The only element of the breakfast that was cooked was the provision of eggs fried, scrambled or boiled. This information, akin to a state secret, was only elicited after an enquiry of staff, and an observation of others. This was not a problem, and in truth the breakfast fayre was adequate, but full cooked breakfast signifies something rather different to those of Irish, English or American origin.Given the number of restaurants and bars in Montmartre\/Sacre Couer, the Hotel Restaurant was extremely expensive, and we did not use it during our stay. We did stray into the bar on one evening only, but a cognac and a gin and tonic at a total cost of 21 Euros was enough to persuade us that better value was to be had elsewhere. The minibar in the room looked tempting enough, but considering that a 3 cl bottle of cognac would have cost us 7 Euro, as opposed to a 20 cl bottle (same brand) for Euro 4.50 at a shop directly over the road, this was not a facility we used either.Thestaff were unfailingly polite, and room cleaning was excellent, but on checkout, the receptionist did attempt to charge us for minibar items. The quickness of withdrawal when we challenged this smacked of a try on, but this was a minor issue.All in all, the Terrass was worthy of it's 4 star rating, but we would shop around (and perhaps demand more) if staying in that sector of Paris again.
