{"text":"Worst hotel-experience ever Had my absolute worst hotel experience ever when I was staying in LKF hotel over last New Year -and I do travel a lot within Asia so I can compare.I had booked a suite through the LKF hotel website which stated I would get airport transfer and free broadband. I thought this was not an extravagance considering the rate, equal to a room in Four Seasons which unfortunately was fully booked. When arriving at the airport there was no pickup. Contacted the hotel and they confirmed I would not be picked up. Lost time and money arranging transport, but thought there might be some mix-up √à√\u2020\u2022√ä√™√Øhese things happen. When arriving at the hotel, staff maintained transfer was not included although it clearly showed so on my voucher, confirmation email and on their website! Got a little impatient with them. Made them read it and argued until they finally admitted there was a mistake on their part but they still did not offer any apologies or compensation.Same with broadband. First they said I wouldn't get any free broadband (although, again, it said so on their website), then they said they couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ offer it because of the Taiwan earthquake √à√\u2020\u2022√ä√™√±nless I paid for it. I couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ believe my ears. They obviously took me for someone mentally retarded. It was all pretty insulting.Don't get me wrong, it is not really about a silly airport transfer or internet access -I am quite used to slightly harsher travel conditions and can really do without these luxuries. What really riled me was the attitude of the staff and management.Great service does not show itself when everything goes smoothly, it is pretty easy saying hello to people and asking how they are and all that chitchat. Great service shows itself when there is a problem. That's where this hotel falls short. Actually, some of the waiters at breakfast lacked even this most basic friendliness and courtesy -especially one of the older waitresses who obviously only had eye for the old rich white guests.As a final insult, the manager did not even reply to my complaint-email. In retrospect I was a real fool paying for this since they ripped me off √à√\u2020\u2022?as in not living up to their side of the deal. They did finally offer me a transfer back to the airport and a discount on my next stay √à√\u2020\u2022√ä√™√≤hich I thought was quite hilarious√à√\u2020\u2022?Did they really think√à√\u2020\u2022?Bottom line is these people do not know how to run a hotel.Moreover, being a hotel-designer myself, I agree that the design is typically Hong Kong cheap tacky -sort of IKEA-chique. When comparing the suites with Four Seasons√à√\u2020\u2022?..well, they just don't compare, sorry. Yes, it's central, but honestly, Four Seasons is a 10 minutes walk away by escalator. Plus it is much easier to get a cab down there -around LKF there are traffic jams galore.When in HK, either go cheaper and spend your money on shopping or go for a real treat and choose a hotel that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ worth the extra expense. LKF hotel certainly is not.
