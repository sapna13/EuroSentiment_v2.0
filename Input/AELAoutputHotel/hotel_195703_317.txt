{"text":"Hotel Casci was a dream! I had a need for a five person family room, and the Hotel Casci was more than happy to oblige. We have three very young children who cannot sleep in a room on their own,. Luckily, the Hotel Casci has a VERY large room for five that was more than adequate to meet our needs (even by US Standards it was big!). And the bath tub! The kids were in heaven. It was pretty large! And the price for the room was comperable to other hotels in the area that were proposing two small rooms for us. Unfortunately, Florence is a little pricey as far as hotels go, but I don't think the Hotel Casci is. We were welcomed very nicely, our children were addressed respectfully (despite having a little too much energy after a long car ride), and we received all of the help we needed settling into our room, finding restaurants for dinner that would be family friendly, providing assistance for a VERY early morning trip to Pisa, providing an early, quick breakfast, wake up calls, etc. I cannot express how perfect it all was. As far as service goes, I've never been to a nicer hotel, and I travel about 20% of my time on my company's expense, so I've been to many nice hotels!My children also liked the extra special attention of Hot Chocolate in the morning, made especially for them. Having protein at breakfast was a great treat (hardboiled eggs, yogurt) that we didn't have at all of our free continental breakfast hotels. And the croissants were as good as in Paris!What makes Hotel Casci so excellent is not just its service, but the whole package. The hotel is charming. The rooms are clean as clean can be. US Citizens can be a little anal retentive about cleanliness in hotels (I know, I'm one of them), but this was as clean as any five star US hotel I've ever stayed in. Never a stray hair in the sink, no crumbs on the floor, pristine linens and towels.The personnel who helped us, from housekeeping who asked every morning if we wanted our room made up now or later, to the front desk folks who are exquisite in their recommendations for restaurants, to the porter who treated every bag gently.My daughter was eaten alive by mosquitos in Venice before we arrived at their lovely hotel in Florence. I think it's a tribute to the hotel that the front desk was SO concerned after seeing her bites that they wanted to be sure it didn't happen in their hotel (IT DID NOT). And if we even suspected a problem, just let them know...August is a rough month for mosquitos and they'd spray for us. I can't imagine that service at the JW Marriott in DC, but you can find it at the Hotel Casci. And don't get me wrong, there were many romantic couples at this hotel...it's not just family oriented! I hope my next trip to Florence is alone with my wonderful husband, and we'll stay there again. In a heartbeat!!
