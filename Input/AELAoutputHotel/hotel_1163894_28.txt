{"text":"Absolutly Outstanding I booked this trip last minute so I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a lot of time to research the hotel before leaving. However, upon arrival I knew I had made the right choice. The Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana is absolutely a magnificent resort. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know where to begin with describing how fantastic this hotel is. I suppose I will start with the service and the people who work there. I found no problem communicating with the employees, their English is very good. The resort and rooms are absolutely immaculate and clean, and I am very picky when it comes to cleanliness. The pools are well kept, the beach is amazing, and the grounds are so beautiful. The resort is large and they offer a shuttle service back and forth from one end of the resort to the other, however, I never took a shuttle once, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ takes about 5-10 minutes to walk from the reception to the beach. My only grumble is about the entertainment√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√§t could use a lift, the dancing is amazing, but the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Öcting√à√\u2020\u2022?could improve, you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l see what I mean if you go there. The food is great. The buffet has a wide variety of international dishes, and the a la carte restaurants are fantastic. I must say I am amused to read some of the negative reviews about this resort. I do not understand what these people expect when they go on a vacation. I suppose I would say you should consider the source and take their reviews with a large grain of salt. Don't wait or think about this anymore, just book the trip and go! You will not regret it! ","annotations":[]}
