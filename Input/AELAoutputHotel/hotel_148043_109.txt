{"text":"A feast fo the senses. On a recent trip to Puerto Rico my wife and I had the opportunity to leave the kids with family and get away for a little time by ourselves. After receiving recommendations from family and friends we decided to stay at the El Convento Hotel.We were not disappointed!The beauty and grandeur of the hotel with it's high ceilings, arched doorways and marble floors impacted us as soon as we walked through the front doors. The walkways between the rooms and the courtyard were wide and airy. The courtyard with the nispero tree and tropical plants is tranquil and welcoming. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed -- they even have electricity and running water (a thing unheard of in buildings built over 300 years ago:-) . The restaurants are great; we particularly enjoyed a relaxing late night visit with friends at El Picoteo over Cafe-con-leche, Tres Leches cake and Creme Brulee. However, if you prefer to find a place off property ther are many options to choose from and all within walking distance from the hotel.We found the staff to be attentive, helpful and friendly, a combination not often found in hotels of the caliber of El Convento.Located in historic Old San Juan, sharing the old city's charm and allure while adding to it a blend of old and new to create an atmosphere that is both unique and captivating, my wife put it best when she described El Convento Hotel as a feast for the senses.
