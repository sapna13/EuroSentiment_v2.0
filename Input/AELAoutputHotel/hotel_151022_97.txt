{"text":"Great Value for the Money My husband and I stayed at Natura Park Resort from January 21 - 28, 2008. We were somewhat skeptical before we went after reading some of the reviews, but were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the resort and service once we arrived. We had a smooth check-in and were shown to our room which was right at the beach, pool and upper bar. Great location!The food was good. You will never go hungry. Everyday at lunch aside from the buffets and snack bar they also had an outdoor grill going by the pool and made some delicious stir fry dishes. We tried two of the specialty restaurants. The food was OK, but actually you have more choices with the buffet. Our room was wonderful. Extremely clean - flowers on the bed and in the bathroom everyday. Floors mopped and clean towels everyday. Absolutely no complaints with the room or the housekeeping staff.Drinks at the bar seemed to be watered down or were extremely weak. However, the staff did not seem to have a problem with giving doubles when asked. There are two bars right on the beach, so you don't have to go far for a drink. The beaches are beautiful. The water was warm and clean. The sand is more like powder than sand. The skies were clear blue, with a nice breeze to help cool you off. The grounds are extremely clean and beautiful. The bridges over the mini water areas, along with the flamingos, ducks, geese, herons and fish make it even more special. The plants\/flowers were incredible. HOT TIP: Regarding the beach chair situation. We got skunked the first day in getting a beach chair. We soon figured out a way to have a perfectly placed beach chair everyday thereafter. We would go down to the beach at night around 10:00pm and pick out two good chairs, place them under a thatch hut, (right by the bar!) and then wrap our towels around the top of the chair. Don't do this with the resort towels because if they get taken you will have to pay $10.00 each. So take a couple of your own old towels and you should be set. It is unfortunate that you have to resort to this, but if you really want a chair you either have to get up before 0600 or try our trick and have a sleep in!ONLY COMPLAINT: The smokers! Coming from beautiful British Columbia, Canada, we are not used to smokers - especially smokers at meal time. There was suppose to be no smoking allowed in the restaurants, but they don't seem to enforce that rule, which was rather disappointing. However, a small complaint when everything else was so nice, so we tried not to dwell on the smokers and just moved if we had too many of them around us.BEST ACTIVITY: Find Johnny Be Good (black pants, red polo shirt and big smile) and book a sunset horseback ride. The best $40.00 value you will ever have. Galloping along sandy beaches as the sun sets was the best fun ever! Also the Catalina Island Snorkelling Trip is great. A long day 0700 - 1900, but well worth it. The crew were so much fun and the waters are beautiful.BOTTOM LINE: For the price you get a clean resort, good food, and beautiful surroundings. The staff were always friendly and liked to help us with our spanish when we asked. We will definitely go back to this resort.
