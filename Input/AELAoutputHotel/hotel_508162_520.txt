{"text":"This is the one! If you don't like this place you'd have to be crazy! My kids (4  10) say it best when asked, what was their favourite part of the vacation, and the answer is- Everything!Location is prime-set in a tropical jungle-no hotels beside you. The hotel itself is beautifully designed and the walk to the beach or your room is along a pathway of palms and gardens. The pool is a meandering marvel with loungers and covered huts along the way.The beach is picture perfect. Food was great and no reservations required. The kid's club was over-the-top fantastic-my kids had a blast. Special thanks to Marilyn and Clarabel. The service was outstanding (even though they don't expect it, please tip them, they work so hard and a few dollars goes a long way). You have to get a message at the spa - I was a marshmallow all day! Rooms are clean and comfortable and Solly always had a nice surprise for us when we returned to our room. The entertainment team has boundless energy - we haven't had that much fun or laughed that much in years.Thanks to Usher, 50 cent, Sephanie, Alberto, Melke, and Mickey Mouse! You'll find yourself saying hola a hundred times a day because the staff are so genuinely friendly and helpful. They really are the icing on the cake of this wonderful resort. Hello to Nelson at Hotel Beds - it was great spending time with you.Tours - Marinarium - Recommended - I've never snorkeled before (let alone, with sharks and stingrays) and I loved it. Not a great tour for small children as the boat ride back is a bit of a party ( O.K., a lot of a party!).Manati Park - Recommended - You actually got to swim with two dolphins for about 10-15 min. before the posed pictures - well worth the money. The other animals and shows were also good.All I can say about Dreams Punta Cana is that I researched the web for the perfect family vacation for four months, and I found it. My husband owes me, big time!!!
