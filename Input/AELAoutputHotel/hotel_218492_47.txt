{"text":"don't read the negative...you are in the SOUTH don't forget... We were in this hotel the week of august 16... When we first arrive we got a room in block 5 wich is the lowest class room... it's ok but I always like to have the higher class room and this is very personnel... but the room was very ok.. I'm just picky... the next days we asked for a room in block 9-10 or 11 but there was none we were offered in block 7 wich is the highest...WOW...what a room.. it was a suite delux master. we had a private lounge with a big screen tv and internet free at any time of day and there was never anybody there...always very clean. so that's for the room...RESTAURANT: it's fine.... however be aware for the men to bring on pair of long pants cause you won't be able to get in... and that is the real thing, this is for the Italian restaurant. The sea food resta. wich is outside at night is ordinary,,,, for the American Grill we went 3 times... the margaritas are super good... the food is good also... the buffet is ok but I always try to go less cause I like rest. a la carte... during the days there are many choices of food on the beach: pizza, chicken, hot dogs , hamburger and many other foord... VERY GOOD ,,,fries etc...... We always bring our own glass like a plastic patio glass... it's bigger and our own... a lot of people do it the bartenders are use to it... The beach is not that long so we took a 25 min. walk back and forth 3 times a day. However the water sports with no motor are free and very fun... the guys are very nice and Philipps like people and is very helpful.We had a super nice trip... no it's not a 5 stars but it's a very good 4 - 4 1\/2 .... don't forget you are in the south and not at home... people there don't live the same way we do,,, litlle things that might offend you are not important to them... like towels beeing late or other...so if you think those little things will heritate you... take a big 5 stars and again some people are so picky that a 10 stars would still not be good enough for them... so have a great vacation and I strongly recommend this hotel.
