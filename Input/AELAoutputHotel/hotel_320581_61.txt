{"text":"Great Hotel! My husband and I stayed at the Sunroute only a couple of weeks ago. It was a great hotel, and I loved staying there. The lobby and hallways are attractive and elegant. They have a guest lounge with TV, 2 computers with free internet use, and a free tea\/coffee machine.The room was small, but that was expected in Tokyo. I booked an economy double via Expedia at a great deal (A$114 per night), which turned out to be what the Sunroute call a semi-double. This is a double bed (140cm wide) with about 2 metres around the edge of the bed, which had one side against the wall. This turned out to be fine, we just made sure to put our suitcases under the desk when we got ready in the morning. The room also had a fairly big TV with Japanese channels, plus one channel each in Chinese, Korean and English (CNN). But one of the Japanese channels often had English-language movies on at night, if you're interested. As for us, we didn't spend much time in the room.The bathroom was of a reasonable size, and really clean, with a shower-in-bath dealie, and those fabulous Japanese toilets with the warm seat etc. One thing I loved is that they provide you with just about everything you could need while travelling - toothbrushes, toothpaste, hairbrush, razor - plus, they have big pump-containers of shampoo, conditioer, bodywash and Shiseido face cleanser. You don't really have to bring a thing!The staff were very helpful and friendly. They allowed us to check in when we arrived a little earlier than the regular check-in time of 2pm. Many of them spoke English (but it helped that I knew how to ask in Japanese if they did), and 2 helped us by making reservations in Japanese to restaurants. And they allow you to leave your luggage if your flight leaves later in the day after you check out.The location of the hotel is great - the Shinjuku subway station is literally next door, and the JR Shinjuku station is only a 5 minute walk, where you can get the Narita Express to the airport, or any number of train lines if you have a JR Pass.I would highly recommend this hotel to travellers heading to Tokyo.
