{"text":"Nice Hotel, but there was one BIG problem I just stayed here the weekend of Dec.15th through Monday. The hotel is very nice, but there were a few unexpected glitches that people should be concerned about. First, I have been to NYC more times than I can count, but never stayed in Time Square, now I know why. I am in my 20's and love this city, but Time Square actually has a lot more low lifes in it then good people, so if you want a more peaceful hotel that is near the same places, stay on 5th ave. I speak from experience the quality of the people is just better. Second, my 2 complaints for the actual room was this, there is no fan in the bathroom so it is like a sauna, and the sink is so small that you cannot fir your items on it. Lastly the biggest thing, my sister left her wallet (with no cash, but credit card and license!!) in our room because it didn't fit in her tiny purse. We didn't realize it until the next morning when we had to leave, but her wallet (with her photo ID) to get on the plane was missing!! A maid took it and we later found, used it at the hotel vending machine (debit\/credit card). The staff denied maids in the room at this time, but this is not true due to the fact that I was w\/ my sis and saw her place the wallet on the dresser. We almost missed our flight, and had to go fill out a police report for her to even get on the plane, such a fiasco. Anyway. this was upsetting along w\/ the treatment of the situation.I realize one should not leave a wallet lying in plain sight in a room, but still is was just shady and plain wrong. Word of advice, watch the maids and all personal belongings, we didn't and ended up getting burnt. Other than that this hotel is ok, I'd reccomend staying on 5th ave though, take my advice.
