{"text":"Fantastic Hotel This was our second trip to Singapore in the last few years and we did wonder whether we should try the Fullerton this time. However, we decided to go back to the Ritz Carlton having had a wonderful stay there last time.We were not disappointed. We were met at the airport and quickly whisked away along the east coast parkway to the hotel.On arrival at the hotel we were taken straight up to the Club lounge as we had booked a club room.Unfortunately, the club manager informed us that our room wasnt available immediately. He asked if we would object to being upgraded to a one bedroomed suite instead. That didnt take much thought!The suite was enormous and overlooked Marina Bay. A fascinating view by day with all the activity but by night it is even more impressive with views over the bay, the Fullerton, the financial district and along the Singapore river to Boat Quay.The club lounge had been extended since our last visit. There are still 5 food and beverage presentations per day. So basically, should you wish , you can eat all your meals here.( Meals are buffet type though). A very nice addition is the Martini bar which overlooks the city of Singapore. Here, May makes absolutely wonderful martinis, several of which we sampled.The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to City Hall MRT which links you with the rest of the island. You can walk to it via shopping malls and links so rarely have to go outside in the sticky heat.Taxis are also plentiful outside the hotel. We only used them once and I think we chose badly. The taxi driver was very disgruntled when we asked to go to the Stamford hotel, about 5 mins away and grumbled all the way there. The staff are very friendly, especially in the club lounge. Nothing is too much trouble.Only one little quibble was our room didnt get turned down one evening, our cleaned the next morning, as we were still in bed at 8.15am, we had to ring housekeeping to let them know as the maid didnt return later either.Im sure this was just a one off as it has never happened to us there before.Unfortunately, I cant comment on the retaurants as we either nibbled in the club lounge or ate in the city, but their write ups in the city guides were very good.We loved it there and will definitely be going back for a third visit.
