{"text":"5 STAR QUALITY HOTEL EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS!!!!! My elderly mother and I celebrated the Thanksgiving holiday in Nov\/Dec for a week at this exceptional property. The experience was indescibable! I quite carefully and meticulously only stay in 5-star properties and noticed that the property was listed in Conde Naste's GOLD LIST OF EXCLUSIVE PROPERTIES for 2008. The CONDE NASTE TRAVELER magazine review did not do the property justice.Firstly, it is situated right on the Arno River with restaurant and rooms with balcony\/arno river views. One must only, when staying Florence, have a room-with-a-view (an Arno view) --MAGNIFICO!Secondly, the staff treat you like their own personal family. Romano, distinguished himself as during our week's stay was always looking out for my mother and me. Remarkable! From ensuring special diet requests were fulfilled, making sure our room was exactly what we wanted to recommending wine, exhibitions, concerts, instruction on computer, to mailing postcards, to only name a few! He had his staff from bellmen to restaurant chefs\/servers, meet our every request on a timely and exceptional fashion! He probably should manage his own property that is how good he was to my mother and I!!Thirdly, the hotel's restaurant is highly comparable to even the most exclusive restaurant the likes of Coco Lezzone, Cibreo, Cammillo, etc. Because it rained most evenings we ate a few nights at the hotel's restaurant. I constantly read inquiries from Trip Advisor members about which Firenze restaurant provides an epicurean experience for foodie's and their discretionary palettes? Well, try La Serra, the hotel's restaurant. Arno views are a given here, but the food is to die for! Unbeliveable filet, seafood, pasta dishes, wine discoveries and out-of-this-world dessert surprises!! In fact, one night we had this unbelievable chocolate wonder all designed as a cup and spoon and filled with a banana and liquor cream custard and sprinkled with a beautiful sheen of chocolate and cream glaze with raspberries - no words, when tasting, you simply have to go there and have your own! It was not unusual for us to call and speak to the chef offering him praises for the food; something I don't usually do.Also, room service matched the quality of the restaurant and Simon was always happy to assist us!The room was like walking into a jewel box! The room's sliding doors, which comprised a full wall were open, The light was brilliantly shining in. The balcony was so inviting displaying the Arno and Piazzale Michelangelo. The murano glass fixtures were shimmery. The beds were like sleeping on a clouds. The bathroom was perfect for us in that we requested a large shower for my elderly Mom for ease in showering - perfect! It had overflowing goodies and amenities, appointed plush enough for our tastes. We always need extra towels because my Mom and I always ask every property we stay at. The housekeeping service was at your beckon call and within seconds we had everything and anything we need. Again, I just kept shaking my head..All I can say, it was as if every staff member had esp for our every need.The staff epitomized the heart of the Florentines in that they take pride in their occupations. Most at that hotel, that I talked with have been there for years and are proud of their hotel and what they do for a living. They truly provided unforgettable and cherished memories for my mother and IThis is the only hotel to stay in while in Florence!!
