{"text":"Great experience Visited the Riu Palace Macao in May. Some of the reviews are way off. First of all, my girlfriend loved it so therefore I loved it.This is a long beach with many resorts dotted along the way. They all share the same beach. Like I said, it's long and appears quite safe. I stayed in a garden room and upgraded to a beach view room before my girlfriend arrived. To tell you the truth, we didn't spend much time on the balcony but I guess the beach view was nice. It's not too expensive to upgrade. Why should you stay here? Well, like I said, my girlfriend liked it and she walked some of the other properties. She said I made a good decision, so that made me quite happy). It's smaller which I was concerned about before arriving but after the experience I think smaller is better. You do have a chance to interact with other guests and it is easier for the resort to pay attention to details. As far as activities, there's a shop down on the beach and representatives in the lobby for anything you could do at any another hotel. Snorkel, horses, etc. etc. etc.We went on the Santo Domingo trip. It's ALL day (7am to 9pm) and alot of time is on the bus... enough said. Still, I think the dominican trip would be incomplete without it. It gives you some history and perspective. And they do stop for some shopping. Ah, it's okay. When you're on the bus you keep thinking maybe you shouldn't have done it and especially when it gets late but afterwords, it seems worthwhile.We both thought the food was good. I thought the main buffet was as good as or better than the theme restaurants. Sushi was kind of like bazzaro world sushi... entertaining. Okay, I do admit we were still hungry after sushi but it was entertaining. The buffet is really pretty good and a couple nights really stood out. One night they had a good seafood selection and another they had a great beef selection. They do a good job with it! Some of the fufu drinks aren't good, some are. The beer is just like beer. Rum and coke, just like rum and coke. The rooms are okay, nothing bad. The pool is fine and not too crowded. It gets hot hot hot around the pool because there isn't much breeze there. I liked between the pool and beach because there's plenty of shade and plenty of breeze. Take two drinks and zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Oh yeah, the people were a mix of US  Canada, German or Dutch, French, or Russian in that order. Interesting to people watch, very interesting to try to tell where people are from before you hear them speak or observe which book they are reading.The domican experience quite pleasent. The people were great, 90-95% great people. Not too pushy but looking to make a deal. wink wink We'll go back, definately... it's a super value. When we do go back which I think will be in October, I'll do the following based on my experience:- go on the island trip- be more disiplined with spending, we bought a lot of stuff.- make sure you bring enough cash. ATMs not around every corner, but everwhere takes plastic.- brush up on my spanish. just to impress)sometimes long distance cell phone service is unavailable during peak times 3pm-6pm so keep that in mind. the resort does have a computer center open for a good range of hours. the computers are loaded with skype, i think, and have headsets.overall, i came with a set of expectations and concerns. none of the concerns were realized and the expectations were exceeded by 2-5 times. divide what they deliver for what you pay and there isn't a better value or experience on this earth, imho.
