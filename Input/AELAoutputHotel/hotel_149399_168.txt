{"text":"Stay away Comfortable is not the word to be used to describe this place.It is true that the resort has grounds are well cared for. The lobbies and Marketplace are nice as well and that is where the positives ended for me.Beware: The trains that take you around spew black clouds of nasty smoke and so do the little mopeds that all the staff ride around on. The stench and noise is really bad, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe never been to a place so gassed and smelly in Canada or US. The sidewalks in the alleys are covered in oil so if you are not jumping side to side to give way to passing vehicles while covering your nose you are still forced to smell all the oil that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ evaporating under the sun.The beach stinks of gasoline too because of all the speedboats constantly going by and a little inflatable flying boat. The washrooms are far from the beach with all the logical consequences and the calm standing waters of the ocean make it nastier. You have to wear a shirt, shorts and sandals in the beach buffets so if your bathing suit is still damp and you are hungry you again have to be inconvenienced one way or the other.The rooms are old and dated and if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ give a bribe your room will probably face a very busy road with roaring smelly vehicles and a train that rings its bell at all hours of day or night. You are given each one bath towel so if you take a shower in the evening be prepared to use the same old wet towel in the morning. And what genius thought of putting the only hooks in the bathroom right over a bide?The food was mediocre as expected the service was the same √à√\u2020\u2022?Dominicans are a long way from understanding what customer service is. Asking 3 different people for a drink at breakfast and being reprimanded for being late for dinner (what happened to the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≠ominican time√à√\u2020\u2022?) because of an issue with a door lock is not enjoyable.So a 2 -3 star resort at best as far as I am concerned!
