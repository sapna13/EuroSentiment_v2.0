{"text":"Over rated Travelled from UK to Orlando for a wedding and then on to NYork for 4 nights stay at the Affinia Dumont with my Parents - their first time in the States.On arriving at reception the girls were friendly but not warm, one girl asked me 3 times was this my first time staying at the hotel!! Had booked direct months in advance and had requested quiet rooms on high floors. My Parents got a room on the 4th floor and our room was on the 14th floor. The rooms were huge which was a plus but no way near quiet. After the first night I suggested to my Parents that they move rooms but they didn't want the upheaval of it all.On the third night there were road works all through the night directly outside the hotel. We complained the next morning and we received apologies and were asked if we would like a free breakfast which we declined as we had already eaten.The hotel is expensive for what you get. I agree it is in a good location within walking distance to Empire and Macys which was great, but the little extras that you needed to pay for were silly. I also agree that there should be no charge for use of the internet when most other hotels offer this service for free.I had a look at the Spa prices which I thought were high but then some people are obviously happy to pay.When checking out of the hotel I spoke with a really nice guy who was very helpful, I mentioned to him that we were not happy about the noise and he give us a $100 discount between the 4 of us.Overall, the hotel was nice but not good value for money.Myself and my Husband are returning to New York with 6 friends and we won't be staying at the Affinia. I really don't know what all the hype is about!!!
