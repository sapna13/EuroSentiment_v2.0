{"text":"Great Property, Great Staff, OK Food Returned from a week at the Punta Cana Princess on 08 November 07. Best vacation value for the dollar that I have experienced. Loved the 'Adults Only' policy. The property was beautiful - large and lush with a great pool and an excellent location on the beach. Staff were very friendly and always responded to any requests for information, assistance, etc.We traveled with another couple. E-mailed ahead and asked for adjoining rooms in building #5. Received a quick response and our request was granted. We were right beside the pool and very close to the beach. Lots of loungers and beach beds, both at the pool and on the beach. Not crowded at all - not sure if this is a slow season or if this is typical year round. Anyway, it was great.Only down side to this resort is the food. If you looking for cruise ship cuisine you will be sadly disappointed. Food is plentiful and more than adequate, if you are not a picky eater. Food here was better than at AI's I have stayed at in Mexico and Cuba. However, food is not the 'strength' of this resort (and I suspect of any Caribbean AI resort).While the food wasn't great, it met my expectations of an AI resort. However, in all other areas (rooms, pool, beach, grounds, staff, etc.), the Punta Cana Princess exceeded all my expectations. I would not hesitate to recommend this property to anyone looking for an economical 'laid back' vacation on a beautiful tropical beach!
