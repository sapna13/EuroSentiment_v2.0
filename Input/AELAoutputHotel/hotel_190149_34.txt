{"text":"We were robbed and left like it was our fault 1. The website is misleading. My wife and I thought breakfast was included in the total package, but when we arrived, the front desk told us it was not. We showed them a print out of the confirmation clearly showing that for 40.00 euros we got breakfast for the entire 6 night stay. The front desk manager accused my wife of making up the emailed confirmation. Rather than arguing with the staff, we accepted and moved on. (The staff should have acknowledged that it was misleading for the the website to confirm that breakfast was included, and apologize instead they accused us of trying to defraud them. My wife and I could have stayed else where for a little more, but chose this place because of the breakfast being included for 40.00 euros more.)2. One night, I clearly remember placing 225.00 euros in the safe, and locking it. The next day after being out the entire day touring the sites, we opened the safe and it was gone. Someone who had access to the safe took the money. We asked the manager again if there was any possible way that the maids would have access to the safe. Rather than, being helpful, his immediate response was to say there was no way in the world that any took anything. He then suggested that we may have misplaced the money. We looked, but I am very carful with placing my money, and I can honesty say that I placed the money in the safe. I would never stay here again. the Room is poor, but the Front desk manager does not belong in the service sector. he has a tone of accusing the consumer of doing something wrong. ","annotations":[]}
