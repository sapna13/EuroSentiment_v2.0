{"text":"Service is why there are so many great reviews. After staying at the Elan Modern, it's very easy to see why the hotel's reviews are so high. What sets this property apart from so many other hotels is the amazing service of its staff. Few places I have stayed have rivaled the front desk\/concierge service of the Elan. (Note: The Elan doesn't really have room service; they can provide it from the diner across the street.) The Elan's front desk\/concierge staff's service easily reminded me of several Four Seasons.During my stay, the front desk\/concierge staff went above and beyond to provide information and directions about local sights and restaurants. They volunteered to print out personalized driving directions and explained how to (try to) avoid the LA rush hour. Most amazing, however, was after checking out and getting directions to the airport, the one of the front desk\/concierge staff gave me his business card and said to please call the hotel if I got lost, stuck in traffic, or needed further assistance on my way. Few hotels care enough about their guests to offer to assist them after they have left and paid their bill.Our room (111) was small, but nice and clean. As it was below street level, it had no view whatsoever, but overall we were pretty happy with it.The worst part about the Elan is that the neighborhood isn't that great. Across the street is a Taco Bell and a Goodwill store and next door to the hotel is a car tire shop. Excluding the massive Beverly Center mall a few blocks away, there really aren't any good restaurants, coffee shops, or anything else of interest nearby the hotel. Fortunately, however, the sights of Beverly Hills, Melrose, Hollywood, and other, better LA neighborhoods aren't too far away (relatively speaking).If the Elan was only in a better neighborhood, it would be a perfect place to stay!
