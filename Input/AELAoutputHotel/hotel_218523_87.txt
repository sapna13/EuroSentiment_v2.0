{"text":"Don't let the 4 star rating fool you.... When we first arrived in Punta Cana, we were shuttled to the hotel Riu Naiboa via the Apple Tour van. The guy who spoke broken English was giving us the low down on the way to the hotel, but we were in the back of the van and couldn't hear what he said. It was stressed that we attend the Apple talk at 5 pm in our hotel lobby.At check in on Monday (9\/4), we were happy that our room would be ready in 5 minutes. After waiting for the S-L-O-W elevators, we made it to the room where we were overpowered by the smell of mildew. After you got used to it, it wasn't as noticeable each time you entered the room. We dropped our bags and headed to the Apple talk. No Apple rep was there. We waited for 30 minutes and another tour man told us that the Apple person was at another hotel within the 5 resort complex, or that the Apple person would be at Naiboa on Tuesday.First night I thought I'd die because the beds were rock hard and the air conditioning worked when it wanted to work and even then it wasn't very cold.Hotel pool was nice, you could visit 2 of the other resorts and use their pools as well. We were told we had to eat dinner in our own hotel restaurant, which after the first night I discovered they never really had a change in menu items. It was the same (nasty) food everyday.We went back to meet the Apple representative on Tuesday and again they were not there. Finally on Wednesday we walked to the Palace (casino) and found the Apple rep who told us they are never situated in the Naiboa hotel. Very interesting that their own personnel do not know where the Apple rep is located!!! All the rep had to tell us was to make sure that we checked in with her the night before our departure to check to see when we would be picked up to go to the airport.Bottom line - the beach and pools are nice - the hotel staff is very friendly (when they understand what you are saying). The beds, the rooms and the food are not up to 4 star standards by what I've experienced in my many travels around the world!Book at your own risk!! My back is very upset with me for this vacation!
