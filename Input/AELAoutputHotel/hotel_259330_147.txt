{"text":"Good Value for the Price We booked a four-star wild card package through Go Travel Direct for March break and assumed that we would end up at the Club section of this resort. Instead, we were assigned to the main section next to the beach. That worked well for us (two adults and two children).The main section appears to be one of the original resorts on the Punta Cana stretch of beach. Consequently, it's showing its age a bit. The rooms are OK and kept clean but they could use some updating. Our beds were very old and one of the two was in rough shape. Over the course of the week, we saw workers bringing in new beds so it appears that this problem is being dealt with. A\/C worked fine. Bathtub drain very slow which seems to be a common problem in Caribbean resorts. Safe key and TV remote are available through the front desk.Food was fine. The buffet restaurant has a nice and varied selection. We booked three speciality restaurants over the course of the week and they were all good. As others have noted, they're not five-star restaurants but we weren't expecting that. The decor in each was nice, the service was pleasant and the food was good. When you order filet mignon, just don't expect a true filet. But, all in all, a fun experience.The beach is fantastic and compares well with Varadero in Cuba and Playa del Carmen in Mexico. It's very crowded but we generally found shaded areas around the pool and then made regular forays into the ocean with the kids. Both my daughter and my niece loved playing in the waves.Go Travel Direct advertises this resort as a four-star. I'd say it probably was a four-star originally but now is more like a three or three-and-a-half star. Considering that we paid about $1,000 a person including taxes and fees, we found that the resort was a good value. However, if we had paid the full price, we might have been a bit disappointed.One disappointment had nothing to do with the resort. We lost one full day of our vacation due to a one-day delay on March 9th supposedly due to the big storm the day before. We woke up very early Sunday morning to discover that our flight with Zoom Airlines was delayed until Monday morning. However, I noted that the other charters made it out of Ottawa on Sunday with delays of a few hours only. I have complained to Go Travel Direct but have not yet heard back about any compensation. Zoom also changed our return flight with days to go from a 2:30 afternoon departure to a midnight departure. Very disappointing since it made for a difficult return trip.
