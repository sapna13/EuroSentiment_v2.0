{"text":"Very Disappointing I recently had the displeasure of being with 32 other coworkers on a working vacation at the Rio.Several issues advertised by the resort are misrepresented.The food is ok, if you like over cooked, deep fried everything.The in room liquor dispensers are stocked with something rot gut  and not really drinkable, We booked a fishing charter through the resort  big rip off We were told that there would be no more than 5 on the boat, remember this is a charter, not a party boat, when we fineally got to the boat, due to transportation we were over an hour late, there were 9 people on the boat. This is an extreme case of over booking.......We did not have any kind of safety breifing and I seriously doubt there were enough life preservers for that number of people, as none were visable, nor were we told of where any were. The mate set out 6 rods and we putted out for and hour and a half, turned around and run back, there was no communication between the mate, and the  watchers.Comming back the bait was pulled up into the prop wash ,so there was no possibility of catching any fish, the charter ( ? ) was conducted in a very unprofessional manner. The over booking was done intentionally, it cost $800 for a two hour boat ride. The resort workers ( common people ) were very friendly and fun to be around, the supervisory staff seemed to be pretty much confused most of the time .All in all, different but not something I would care to do again.
