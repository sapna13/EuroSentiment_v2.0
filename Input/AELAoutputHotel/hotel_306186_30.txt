{"text":"Very poor service I stayed 2 nights at Orchard Parade in June 2006 but I would definitely not go back to this hotel again. I was being moved to 3 different rooms (including one room which have not been made up after the previous occupants left) on the first day of my arrival and it was close to midnight before the staff got things right. The staff kept telling me one thing but then not doing it. Was told that an extra bed would be put into the room only to find out hours later that they couldn't put an extra bed into a standard room. The excuse was that they had misunderstood and thought that we were happy to have 3 people in a double bed (after prepaying for a triple room??) Was then told that a bigger room was available for us and someone would send the key up now but after half an hour of waiting (packed up and not able to do anything), no one came. When I called the front desk to follow up, the person who answered said she would find out what's happening and call me back in 5 mins but waited for another half an hour, no one called or came up. Had to then go down physically to the front desk before they started looking into the system to find a replacement room! Meaning that I could have just waited there in the room (based on what they told me) the whole night and no one would have come up!The saga continued when the replacement room I was given was not even made up yet after the previous guests left! Thought mine was probably a one-off case until I was passing by the hotel's reception the next evening and overheard an angry guest at the reception shouting that this was the hotel with the worst service he had ever been to.
