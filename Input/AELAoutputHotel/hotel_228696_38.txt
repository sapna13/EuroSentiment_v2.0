{"text":"Nice Find My husband booked this hotel for our first trip to Paris as a valentines day surprise therefore i didnt get a chance to do much research on it.TIP - If you are travelling to Paris via a flight i would recommend using the metro as it is way cheaper than the taxi and only takes about an hour max. Taxi - approx 45 euros whereas Metro - 8 euros per person.On arrival we were welcomed with friendly receptionist staff. We were also given the option of choosing between 2 rooms - one on the 3rd floor and on the 7th. The one on the 7th floor had been recently refurbished and had a balacony you could sit on and look over to the Eiffel Tower but other than that the views were not the best. We then made our way down to the 3rd floor and although the rooms were not as modern they were more spacious. The new modern room was available but of course at a premium price of 60 euros per night. We werent going to spend a lot of time there so we decided to go for the one originally booked.The beds were comfy, the bathroom clean and there was plenty of space. The breakfast staff were very efficient and helpful but had the same buffet selection each morning. The staff were helpful when we were inquiring about some excursions. There was an open tour bus stop 5 minutes down the road which was helpful. For our trip to Disneyland we used the metro and there was a station just down the road too. Location wise you cant go too wrong - bus, metro, shops, food, cinema, bistros are all within walking distanceHowever, we did have a few bad experiences - the cold tap in the bathroom made a funny noise when it was turned on and sounded as though the whole room was going to cave in. Also the one english channel they had was frozen so we were stuck watching the french channels.Other than that a nice find and a pleasant stay ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":867,"mention":"premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":860},{"endOffset":1801,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1797}]}
