{"text":"Very nice evening..... In preparation for a dinner, concert, and a night out on the town with my wife I decided to roll the dice for a 4 star hotel on Priceline. Much to my surprise the Hotel Intercontinental was what came up and for a very modest rate at that. I was looking forward to the stay, I was familiar with the hotel and location and have been wanting to try it. I did call ahead and assure my reservation was for a King non smoking room and the friendly young lady on the phone assured me that would be no problem and that we would be staying in the newly renovated area.Having used Priceline in the past I have noticed several hotels give you second class citizen treatment upon arrival. NOT here... the staff at the front desk was warm and friendly as well as very quick and efficient. We quickly had our room key and were off to our room. As I read in an earlier review the elevators were amazingly fast! We got to our room with little time to spare to get ready and head off to dinner before going to the concert. We quickly were in the room and found it to be nicely appointed. We unpacked quickly changed and were off again. Once again and consistent thru the weekend the elevators were always fast -and we were on the 12 th floor! We returned to the hotel late after the concert and the bed was amazingly comfortable and the room was very quiet. This was a nice hotel to get away to and enjoy a first class setting and friendly service from all staff members we came in contact with. I was impressed as we were leaving and walking down the hall to the elevators that the maids we came in contact with all smiled and said good morning! -Friendly indeed!I do want to add that other reviews spoke of the parking fees and I was leery.... I was prepared to pay the $18 to valet park and be done with it since the reviews mentioned that the other parking was $10. However the very friendly older man at the valet told me the self parking only a few feet away was FREE! -Yes a very nice staff and a relaxing weekend! I would recommend this hotel again and again!
