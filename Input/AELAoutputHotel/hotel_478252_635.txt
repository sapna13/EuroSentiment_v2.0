{"text":"Family Spring Break My extended family took a weeks vacation for our Spring Break. I am 18 and travelled with 1 13 year old, 6 cousins my age, and our parents. Everyone had a great time and it was a vacation we will never forget. Being 18 I was looking for a week of relaxing by the beach and pool with a drink in my hand and partying all night. Daytimes were great. Beautiful weather, drinks, and volleyball. The nightime was fun, but hit or miss. Here's what I mean.There are 4 options of things to do at night.1. hotel bar, geared towards my parents generation, which can be fun if you enjoy partying with older people.2. casino- drinks are not included but is a nice change of pace.3. outdoor stage- good for 1 or 2 nights a week4. disco- fun dancing, drinks included, we went here every nightOne of the problems we had were the lack of people our age (18-21). We ended hooking up with a big group of people our age the second day which solved this problem for us, but had we not, the night life would have gotten old. So the nightlife is hit-or-miss, and depends heavily on who is vacationing at the same time as youRooms were nice, although my dad and I had a portable DVD player and electric razor stolen from our room.Food was edible, but not great.Overall I would definitely go back, and am considering it for a trip I am taking in August with my buddies ","annotations":[{"endOffset":670,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":666}]}
