{"text":"Lasting impressions Beauty, harmony, style, minimalist luxury and comfort are truly attainable without compromising, intruding on or perverting nature. This is the message eloquently conveyed to us by the Hix Island House. This was our second visit to this unique place and we can categorically state that, at Hix's, we experience the friendliest coexistence of environment and a man made resting habitat : a serious (not grave!) respect and commitment for a genuine conviviality between human nature creativity and the inherent, constant presence of a natural scenery. Now, you may think: Is this vacation place for purists, poetically inclined, eco-minded people? Well, of course these qualities could enhance the enjoyment of Hix's particular ambiance, but then, the ambiance itself offer the conditions for these sensitivities to arise in you. This means rarely encountering invasive civilization noises or personnel (the on-site, day to day service crew is literally invisible and privacy, as well as silence seems to be of utmost importance for management). Ahhh√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√∂he blissful, sky open, solar-powered showers√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√∂he good old majestic breezes interpreted by Australian pines leaves hush or bees buzz√à√\u2020\u2022?the sumptuous, intimate pool√à√\u2020\u2022?the undisturbed, window-framed landscape and horizon views√à√\u2020\u2022?the birds concerts and rain symphonies√à√\u2020\u2022? Given. People who travel to special locations are conventionally encouraged by the tourism industry to consider amenities. So let's put amenities in proper perspective. At Hix's, amenities are not only plentiful but, above all, thoughtful. For example, you will get an atypically spacious room (only 13 of them) furnished with artful (and useful!) original accessories of world known designers. Thus, if you open up to the aesthetically pleasing surroundings, you are bound to get in touch with your relaxation responses (a short distance to stress decompression) without excluding basic earthy conveniences. Follow me?  Wining and dining has never tasted better (if you look well, in Vieques you can find almost any fine gourmet goods to satisfy a sophisticated palate). And then, you have a very short distance access to some of the most astonishing beaches in the Caribbean to let yourself go. What a treasure! We will definitely return in the future. We want to revisit this small and masterfully designed hotel that serves both: humans seeking to rest in solace embedded in natural beauty and nature itself.
