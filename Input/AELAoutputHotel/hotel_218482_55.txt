{"text":"Dining with the birds Just returned from the Catalonia Bavaro Resort. The resort was rated a 4.5 star but I would not even give it a 4. The resort itself was nice and fairly well maintained. The room was dated but generally clean. We lucked out and got a room by the ocean but the problem was that the air conditioning only slightly worked. After asking for repair twice we gave up. The service staff were all friendly and for the most part tried to give you what you ask for but you occasionally found that you got something completely different because the person didn't understand. The biggest problem with this resort was the food. It sucked to say the least!!! Sick for 3 days from it. Now it could have been the fact that the buffets were open air and when you dine you dine with the birds that are nesting in the rafters and coming down to help themselves to the food. Look up people and you will see bird dung on the rafters, now that said if it is on the rafters I am sure it makes it down to the food. It seems sparrows love fresh cakes and pastries as they really seemed to prefer this area of the buffet.The beach area was nice but the seaweed was a little much in the area. The pool was great but very warm.The drinks sucked unless you like sweat sweat drinks. Full of sugar and nothing blended in front of you. In fact I never saw a blender at any of the bars ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1046,"mention":"cakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1041},{"endOffset":1059,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":1051}]}
