{"text":"Decent Hotel, Good Breakfast We chose this hotel based on the Trip Advisor reviews and on the price (they were offering a slight discount, but I think the price was still a little high for what it was). The room was a good size, but I wouldn't exactly call it a Deluxe Water View King Room. The view was nice when we were sitting on the bed because we were far enough away from the window to avoid seeing the commercial buildings and the street below. The location kind of sucked, except that it was a quick shuttle-ride\/drive into downtown and it was a short walk to Dukes Chowder House (fantastic food, good service, kid-friendly) along a pretty little boardwalk. The free shuttle was great. The driver was very nice, they had a car-seat for our toddler, and they left the hotel every half-hour (this has obviously changed from the once-an-hour departures of last December). We were excited by the big-screen tv in our room, as we were hoping to watch a movie on it - the only problem was, the movie I was dying to see wasn't working properly (the desk attendant said it had been watched too many times). The best part of our stay was definitely the continental breakfast - had yummy self-made waffles with strawberry sauce and yogurt, the coffee was decent (we liked that they offered free coffee in the lobby - wasn't always hot, but better than having to make it in our room), and it was a bright and spacious room. We also liked that the hotel had it's own tiny convenient store.So, although our initial impression was a little disappointing due to the not-so-scenic location and thanks to an unfriendly and unhelpful man at the front desk (he had absolutely no interest in giving me any tips about the area and didn't smile once), our over-all stay wasn't bad at all.
