{"text":"Perfect escape The hotel and service was perfect and worth far more than 3 stars. Check in was smooth and the staff were very friendly throughout our whole stay. The room was always spotless and had plenty of space. Each day your room also gets free bottled water so you can avoid the bali belly. The resort is aimed at those wanting a romantic, peaceful getaway. Not many children around which we personally saw as a major plus. The building itself looks very nice and has some grand stonework which looks even better in the night-light. There is a nice selection of shops and food onsite, the breakfast included in your stay has a great choice and a lot of foods are cooked to order infront of you (omelettes etc). They also offer room service until the early hours, however if you wanted to try a wider selection of local cuisine there are plenty of restaurants right outside the gates on the main road. (Try the Bamki Hotplate!!!)As with any holiday you need to reserve your sun lounger early in busy periods but the hotel do their best to help by not allowing towels to be hired until after 9am breakfast. The pools themselves are lovely.The onsite massage parlour is also worth a visit, all guests get a free Jet Lag 15 minute massage card, but paying for one of the more indepth treatments is well worth itThe overall feel of the place is a relaxing, clean, friendly environment where you can be at peace away from the hustle bustle of street traders. If you do wish to venture out and see some of the island, the hotel can offer good deals on tours to some of the major attractions. This can also all be added to your room bill if you wish to pay at the end of your holiday.Having toured past some of the other hotels on the island I saw no where else that compared to the Puri Santrian and we would definitely go back ","annotations":[{"endOffset":554,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":550}]}
