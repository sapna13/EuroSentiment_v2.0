{"text":"First-class hotel Myself and my hubby stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on the way to Bali for our honeymoon. We were very impressed when we walked into the hotel lobby as its very large and has marble flooring, and a lovely large bar in the centre. Check-in was done in super-quick time. The staff are tremendously efficient and very friendly too. We were upgraded to a room with a balcony and being on the 29th floor, we had an amazing view. The glass elevators on the outside of the hotel are very impressive, if a little bit scary the first time you get in them. Its worth taking the elevator right to the top where the restaraunt is, even if you dont eat there, as its on the 37\/38th floor (I think!) and the views over the city are spectaculor. Our room was really nice, however we had twin beds and not a double, but we pushed them together and they didnt seperate at night so there was no falling down the crack incidents! It really wasnt a major problem as we were only there for two nights. The bathroom was lovely too. It was quite big and had a really nice massage shower which we enjoyed very much. We didnt eat in the hotel as we ate out on both nights, but the menu did look nice with a variety of dishes. On our second day, after being shopping, we came back to the hotel to find a huge bunch of gorgeous lillies, a massive fruit basket and a chocolate cake with 'congratulations' iced onto it, which was really really yummy! The hotel is conveniently located and is attached to a shopping mall (one of many) which takes you to the MRT and then its a just a short ride away to the different parts of the city. We got a tourist day card for about $8 sd, which we felt was really good value. Be aware that you will be fined if you are caught eating, drinking or smoking on the MRT. It may seem a bit harsh but when you look at how clean everything is you can understand why they do it. All in all the hotel was a brilliant start to our honeymoon and we'd definately recommend it.
