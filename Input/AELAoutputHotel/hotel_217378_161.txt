{"text":"Don't stay there, not even if it's your last option Our booked hotel in Coconut Grove was closed because they had no energy due to the hurricane, like most of the hotels around the city. At that point, since we did not know the city, it was about 21hs and it was getting kind of scary, we had no option but to stay at the Wyndham, at least they had energy! The hotel is quite expensive, for what it is, with extra fees and parking etc√à√\u2020\u2022?everything people say on the other reviews are true. But ok, we thought √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬Æill stay for overnight and then check into another hotel next morning√à√\u2020\u2022? The thing is next morning after we checked out, we waited the parking service to bring our rented car. That was the big problem. There were scratches on the trunck, like someone dragged a heavy luggage over it. The thing is, no one have access to the parking lot, except the parking drivers. Of course nobody had seen anything. None of the valet parking employees. The worst thing was when we asked to talk to the hotel manager, it took sooooooooooo long. The staff was passing the problem one to the other, and saying that the responsible for the Valet Parking was not there. They asked me if I wanted to contact him by celular phone (!?) what we did, but after a few words he said his crew would never do such a thing and then, the phone went down √à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√©e never answered my next calls√à√\u2020\u2022?.The hotel on the other hand, said that they could not do anything about it because the problem was with the parking lot. Can you believe nobody wanted to talk to us, and take responsibility! There was this unprepared lady at the reception desk of the hotel that kept saying like a robot √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬Æe can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ do anything about it, that is the procedure you have to talk to the valet parking√à√\u2020\u2022? But the hotel is the one who charges us for the parking. And they are in the hotel property. After we said we were going to call the police, just then a man from the hotel (above manager we think) came from somewhere and said that there was not going to be a problem gave us his phone number and etc. just this one person. The situation could have been handled in max. 30 minutes and it took almost two hours. WHAT CAN I SAY THE HOTEL SERVICE IS BY FAR THE WORST. THE PARKING LOT √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?\u2022WNER\/MANAGER√à√\u2020\u2022?WHICH TALKED TO US ON THE PHONE WAS RUDE. THE WOMEN AT THE RECEPTION DESK (WE THINK SHE WAS THE MANAGER) UPREPARED. DON√à?√¨T STAY THERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!! FOR THE PRICE , YOU CAN DO MUCH BETTER IN MIAMI. ","annotations":[]}
