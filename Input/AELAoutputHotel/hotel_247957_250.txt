{"text":"Great Time at the Occidental We had a wonderful time at the Occidental. We were there from Jan 20-27th 2008. Food: Awesome everyday. If you can't find something to eat in the main buffet, you obviously should have stayed home. We only ate at one of the restaurants, the Steak House. It was very good, no complaints at all. Franklin on the Crepe Station is AWESOME! Maximo is equally as good on the Omelet Station. Air Conditioning was awesome in the eating areas.Room: Very Nice. They are a little more dated then our Riu stay last year, but they made up for it in size and decor. Air Conditioning great here as well.Beach: What can you say that hasn't been said about this beach, it is totally beautiful. I'm sure it's one of the nicest in the world.Shows: We only went to the Michael Jackson show, which was great.Excursions: We went Parasailing which was fun. Now, the AWESOME one..... Cave Fun-Fun!!! If you ever book any excursion, book this one. Not many people know about it so you have to ask but it is a trip of a lifetime. It is a 3 hour bus ride one way. Once you get there they feed you a meal then you are off on a 30 minute horse back ride through the forest and Mountains. Now you have about a 45 minute hike through the Forest and up and down interesting areas till you get to the hole in the Mountain you have to Repel down. You repel down 60-70 feet, then you set off on a 2 mile walk through the cave, where you encounter bats, under water passages and beautiful sights. Once you get to the end of the cave, your horses are waiting for you, then you have a 15 minute horseback ride back to camp. They feed you again, and fill you up with alcohol. (if wanted) Then back to the bus for the ride home. The bus ride itself is interesting as you go through many cities and get to see how these people live. We were picked up at 6:40am and got back at 6:00pm. It's a big day but it's the best $99 we have ever spent on a trip!Time Shares: The only reason I mention this is because many people have been on here saying that it's terrible how they bug you and they won't leave you alone. This is a crock, we were asked but a kind no thank you is all it takes then they are good, actually I would joke with them lots of days and see how their day is going. All in all it was a wonderful trip, we are still trying to decide if it was better then our trip last year when we went to the Riu Merengue, but both are awesome and I would highly recommend either resort.
