{"text":"Nicest Hotel in Rue Cler area We stayed here because from our Trip Advisor Research it appeared to be the nicest of the Hotels in the Rue Cler area. And it was!From the moment Frederica welcomed us by name to the time our pick up van took us to the airport, Frederica was a welcome font of knowledge and information and maps and suggestions. And what she couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ help us with, the two free internet computers in the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ pretty lobby solved for us.Our room a double superior room, was exactly what we were hoping for in Paris, elegantly furnished with a view of the Eiffel Tower that we marvelled at day and night. The room was ample with a big, comfortable bed, two large windows for light, a big TV, desk and room safe. The windows had electric shutters to block out the light and the noise so we slept soundly after our days of wandering the beautiful streets of Paris. The bathroom was a good size with a strong hot shower and a separate toilet in another room, almost unheard of in Europe. There was also a walk in wardrobe with an automatic light that activated as you walked past it which was particularly useful for those that need to visit the toilet in the middle of the night.Breakfast was not included but there was a bakery on the corner to the left and Rue Cler with multiple cafes and another bakery to the right. Rue Cler is just the most beautiful market street, especially on a Sunday, and definitely worth a visit. The close proximity of Relais Bosquet to the Eiffel Tower, a really good landmark to get you back home, The Ecole Militaire, the Invalides, the hop on √à√\u2020\u2022?hop off bus, the Metro and heaps of cafes and brasseries make this an excellent yet not too touristy location.
