{"text":"5 Stars at the Park Shore for sure My wife and I stayed at the Park Shore for our honeymoon. From the moment we arrived to the time we left we were treated like royalty. We arrived early for our room but that was no problem Leonor and Frank and the rest of the staff took care of us and had us a better room within minutes. Leonor found out my wife loved flowers and every day there were beautiful flowers waiting for us in our room when we returned, not to mention the best hawaiian chocolates we have ever tasted. Champane was delivered to our room and waiting for us in ice when we returned. Every day we were greeted by the friendly staff I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. They treated you like family and no request or advice was too much. Frank and Leonor offered us great advice on things to do. To some up the whole stay in just a review is not enough, there were so many things that we loved about the Park Shore. The pool was awesome, the view from the pool was awesome as well. From our room we could hear the gently waves of the ocean, and spent many night laying in bed just relaxing to the waves. We had a great view of the ocean the beach and diamond head. The room was very confortable and balcony was great. What I am trying to say is simply, Mahalo (thank you) to everyone at the Park Shore and we will be coming back soon, you made our honeymoon the best it could possible be. On our last day there it was a sad day, Frank, Leonor, and Tim gave us a frame with our picture in it and we had to say our good byes. When we left we were not leaving a hotel, we were leaving friends, and it is always sad to say good bye to friends, but until next time THANK YOU PARK SHORE for EVERYTHING. ","annotations":[]}
