{"text":"Beautiful Hotel, Awful Service My wife and I stayed at the Westin Palace in Madrid for three nights in December 2007. The hotel is beautiful, the room was huge and the bed was very comfortable --- especially compared with other European hotels.However, I have to completely disagree with the comments about how great the service is. We had worse service in this 5 star hotel than any of the other hotels we stayed at in Europe.On more than one occasion 2 door men stood around talking while my wife and I had to open the door for ourselves. We called guest services 4 times during our stay, each time the service was poor.I was told that an electrical transformer and a scale were not available (even though the hotel literature said it was) because the person answering did not know what they were - she asked me repeatedly what a scale does \/ what purpose does it serve. When I got frustrated enough to go down to the lobby and ask the concierge for assistance she was visibly annoyed at having to assist me. When we were checking out I had to call guest services 3 times to have someone come and help me with my luggage (it took 45 minutes to get someone to bring my luggage from the 3rd floor to the 1st floor). If the elevators were not so tiny I would have done this myself as there is no reason this.Also, my wife and were on our honeymoon and my american express travel agent made it a point to indicate this in all of our reservations (it said it on all of our travel vouchers) and the Westin is the only hotel we stayed at that did not acknowledge it in some way.So while the hotel \/ lobby was beautiful and the location was great I will never stay in this hotel again.
