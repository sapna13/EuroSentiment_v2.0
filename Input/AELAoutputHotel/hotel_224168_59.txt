{"text":"Lives up to Renaissance standards My mom and I stayed at the Renaissance for a weekend trip. It is a fabulous hotel, convenient to Hollywood attractions and near a light rail stop. The service was exceptional and friendly. Our room was a decent size on the 9th floor and looked out towards the Hollywood sign. There were wooden blinds, as well as a blinder to keep the early morning sun out of the room. We ordered room service one night, and the food was pretty good -- Twist has an eclectic menu with many things to choose. It only took 20 minutes for the food to arrive. I also took advantage of Spa Luce in the hotel, and it was incredible. The spa is beautiful, relaxing, and offers a diverse menu of treatments. Very impressed with the new spa. There is an outdoor pool on the 5th floor, which offers comfortable lounge chairs, as well as private cabanas. The beds in the room are the updated Marriott beds and EXTREMELY comfortable. The hotel is connected to the Hollywood\/Highland complex, which offers a bit of shopping and restaurants (highly recommend Trastavere), and you can catch a shuttle to the Pantages theater from the complex. Valet parking through the hotel is $29\/day, but there is a parking garage as part of the of the Hollywood\/Highland complex for $10\/day if you want to self park. Overall, it was an excellent stay. The only downside is the $9.95 charge for internet, which seems to be a common theme in Los Angeles.
