{"text":"Was So Nice! My new Husband and I went along with another couple to this resort! It was beautiful and the rooms were great! When we arrived we had a small but nice fruit basket with a bottle of rum, along with a towel spread with fresh flowers, two shirts and a letter welcoming us to the resort. Our room was very clean, always had clean towels, stocked mini bar. The beach was fantastic and so was the pool side. Every morning when we went to the buffet we were always greeted with an Ola, and the housekeepers, groundskeepers were always in a good mood. The waiters at the buffett were very nice and always remembered what we drank and our glasses were never empty! As for the hurricane, the only time it ever really rained was late at night, the shows were good, and the drinks were strong. The only thing I have to complain about was the last day we were there, we had to be checked out of our room by noon, but our plane didn't leave until 930 at night, so we had to find something to do for the hours we waited, and without a room, it was difficult to stay in the heat all day. The don't give you a complimentary room to use before you leave, they let you go to the bathroom and use the showers in there to get freshned up before you leave for home, they didn't tell you for an extra 10 bucks you can use a room. Even though that happened, it was still a memorable stayI would recommend this resort to anyone!
