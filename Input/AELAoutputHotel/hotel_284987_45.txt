{"text":"IF it wasn't for.... Our stay at Gran Melia was just okay... the grounds appear well maintained, rooms are ample size and have great amenities. But here are the true things that you need to know about the hotel. 1 - the rooms are entirely too far away from the amenities, you'll have to walk back and forth to access any and everything on the grounds, there were supposed to be carts running every 5 minutes but we never saw any. And calling the front desk was a joke.2 - there is no beach on the grounds... although the resort is surrounded by the ocean the water is not really suited for swimming seaweed, and other growing organisms will discourage you from doing so. 3- there is nothing to do in the area for miles...so you're better off renting a car so that you can drive if you plan on doing anything off of the resort. 4- the restaurants are overpriced and not that great of quality. 5 - the main pool is just nasty! Looking at the stuff floating around the family pool turned my stomach and with so many children and babies in the pool there's no telling what that foamy stuff was. There are two other pools on the property one which is only accessible to Royal Service guests and the other for people who choose to indulge in spa services. We were stopped from entering both of these pools although no one was actually in them 6- BED BUGS! The morning after our first night I noticed that I had several bites on my back...thinking that they were mosquito bites I went to stock up on the Off. The next morning a few more bites...it wasn't until the plane ride home with I noticed the strange looking bites on my feet and ankles and realized just what they were. Needless to say I really probably wouldn't recommend the hotel to anyone unless your willing to shell out the cash to pay for Royal Service, then they'll probably kiss your [-] to make sure that your stay is excellent.
