{"text":"Pampered and spoiled. My wife and I spent 7 nights at this wonderful resort and absolutely fell in love. The rooms were wonderful and the atmosphere was intoxicating. The staff were most attentive and catered with a smile to our every need. I would however like to offer a couple of helpful hints. Take a bundle of cheap washcloths with you as these are not put in the rooms. Take along some extra clothes hangers as you will need them. Also purchase one the adapters for you electrical items from the Mini-Mart in the lobby, as the receptacles are recessed into the wall and items such as, camera and cell phone chargers can't be plugged in without them. For action after sundown, walk to the Riu Bambu, left when you hit the beach, as the nightly shows are most entertaining and the crowd is a little more lively. One last thing after spending your morning on the beach, if you feel the need for an excellent snack, simply pull on your shirt and step into the Caribe Grill for a very good light meal.I know all tips are included, at least in the travel package that we had, but the young ladies who worked in the buffet waiting tables were there for all 7 days we stayed and they worked @ 16 hours per day. If you get up early enough you will see the housekeepers out picking the flowers they use for decoration in the rooms, consider the unending smiles and hard work these people put into your stay. A few dollars will go a long way to making their lives and work more enjoyable.Enjoy :) ","annotations":[]}
