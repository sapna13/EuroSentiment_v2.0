{"text":"Best European Hotel I just got back from a two week trip to Italy. Originally, I had planned on only spending 5 nights in Florence. After only 3 nights in Firenze, I decided to stay for the majority of my trip there, after I fell in love with the city, and with my hotel. The hotel is located extremely close to the train station, and within walking distance of everything the city has to offer. I stayed for 11 nights at the hotel, and the price of the room varied between $110 to $140, depending on the night. The avg. cost per night during my stay, was around $127.00For a European hotel, the size of my room was larger than what I expected. The bathroom was extremely modern, and the daily breakfast served was very good. I can't compliment the Hotel Staff enough. They all spoke english extremely well, and new the city better. It would be very easy to show up to this hotel, without having anything planned to do during your stay, and work on the suggestions of the staff alone. I'm not sure how the price of this hotel compares to other's within the city. However, I have stayed at other hotels in Rome,Italy (for the same price, or more) and have been extremely disappointed with my room, and with the hotel staff. Florence, is my new favorite city to visit, and I can guarantee I will only stay at this hotel. Take my advice, stay here if your going to Florence. ","annotations":[]}
