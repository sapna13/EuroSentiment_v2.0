{"text":"Not too Bad I stayed at this hotel based on the recommendation of my travel agent. Initially I was told that this is a 5 star hotel but found out from some of the online hotel booking websites that it is more of a 4 star hotel instead. However, do not be put off by all these as the service that you will receive once you step into the hotel will make you feel like you are in a 5 star hotel. Front desk reception staffs were friendly and helpful throughout my stay there and facilities like the swimming and Jacuzzi pool were acceptable. I was allocated a smoking room and was duly informed by the reception when I checked-in even though I requested for one when I did my booking. However, the reception reassured me that the room had undergone a treatment beforehand. Once in it, I found the room very comfortable and don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ reek of cigarette smell at all! Everything was in the room as also in a good condition unlike some of the 5 star hotels I've been to where the cupboard doors were virtually going to drop! I requested for an ironing board and iron almost everyday and the hotel always promptly delivered it to my room almost immediately after my call. One thing however, was that the pillows were too soft and you may consider requesting for extra pillows. The location of the hotel was also superb as it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ located close to the goldfish market and the ladies market. If you are looking for cheap bargains, go to the shops along the alleys off Prince Edward Road as the stuffs that you will find at the touristy markets are generally more expensive. If you are taking the MTR to the hotel on a rainy day, alight at MongKok MTR station (Not Prince Edward Station) as it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ linked to the hotel's shopping complex by a sheltered overhead bridge. The walk will take you around 5 to 10 min depending on your walking speed of course. The hotel is also located above the MongKok KCR station where you can take the train to China or other more sub-urban shopping malls like the New Town Plaza at Shatin station. Overall, this hotel was a superb choice and I will definitely choose this hotel when I go back to Hong Kong again. ","annotations":[]}
