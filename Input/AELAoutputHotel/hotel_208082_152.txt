{"text":"Paris trip Second time we have stayed at Hotel d'Albe. We will come back a third, I'm sure. Just as when you buy a house the three things you look for are location, location and location; how can you beat the location and price of Hotel d'Albe for a trip to Paris? Let me count the ways: 1) Come up out the Metro exit at St. Michel (if you come up out of the right one-there are three to choose from; choose # 2) and walk 100 steps to the hotel! A real plus when you are toting luggage. 2) Looking for a place for breakfast other than the 13 Euro breakfast the hotel offers? Look no further than going out the front door, turn right for ten steps and you have a wonderful little place to grab a croissant or pain au chocolat and espresso quickly (for less than 13 euros). 3) Looking for a place to eat out for lunch or evening and don't want to bother getting back on the Metro to go somewhere? Walk out the front door and you are in the Quartier Latin where you have multitudinous restaurants (maybe 30 or more?) within 1-5 minutes walk. 4) You are less than 5 minutes from Notre Dame, 15 minutes from the Louvre and very centrally located. You'd want to take the tube to go to the Eiffel Tower but the Metro is so close. Also, the RER is close as well and the C train takes you right to Versailles without changing (although the route was slightly different during our July, '07 stay due to construction on a certain section of the Metro).Finally the rooms have always been clean, beds are good and the A\/C worked well (at least in our room) unlike some places in Italy we stayed. When we go to Paris we don't hotel shop anymore....
