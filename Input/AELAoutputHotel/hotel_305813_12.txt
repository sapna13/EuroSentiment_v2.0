{"text":"Lovely rooms, friendly staff My husband, daugher and I rented two Club rooms, which were great. Wonderful, comfortable beds, clean modern rooms, although not the largest we've ever stayed in. Bathroom also was new - wonderful shower with both rainbird and hand held shower fixtures, plenty of hot water, good water pressure. Also the heat\/air conditioning worked well. (The three absolutes for a good hotel room - good pillow, good shower, ability to regulate the room temperature.) Paying for a room on the top floors with access to the club was more expensive but well worth it. The concierge there was very helpful. There was always something good to eat available (they have breakfast, tea, cocktails and a dessert time), it had ready computer access and was quite comfortable after walking around the packed streets of Hong Kong. You have the choice of breakfast in the club or downstairs, with the downstairs breakfast much more elaborate, with plenty of choice of food. Know, however, that everything is cleared promptly at the time they say breakfast ends. We arrived at the hotel late in the evening and left mid- morning - both times used the limo service, and again, although there was cost involved, we found it was worth the money. The location isn't the best - most americans don't stay in kowloon, we were told by local ex-pats we met, and they refer to it as the dark side,- but we found it convenient to the underground and easy to get where we wanted to go. We also wanted a more traditional experience, rather than a purely touristy one. We didn't visit the market there but did another several blocks away - mainly inexpensive but not terribly impressive goods. The attached shopping mall is exactly that - a fairly traditional shopping mall. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay.
