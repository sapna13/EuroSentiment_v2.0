{"text":"Can't say enough good things I've never written a hotel review before, here or anywhere else, but I feel compelled (in spite of all the OTHER good reviews) to write about the Park -- great location, lovely decor, thoroughly competent staff, and a really reasonable price. My husband and I stayed here for almost a week before going to Kyoto for a few days, and then we stayed again for several more days before leaving Japan. Both times we had a very clean, modern room (lovely bathroom with a great shower and lots of great products, by the way -- brush, razor, toothbrush, various toiletries, etc) with a wonderful view of the Tokyo Tower (and even Mt. Fuji on some days!). The hotel is easily walkable over to such great\/convenient locations as Shimbashi Station, the fish market, Ginza, the Ginza Corridor (great dining of all sorts), etc. Back to the hotel, they were very efficient and accurate about arranging things such as a day trip to Mt. Fuji and a bus back to Narita at the end of our trip. We never ate at any of the restaurants\/cafes there, since they seemed a little pricey and there were a ton of lovely and reasonable places to eat in neighboring highrises that were easily accessible by the over-street walkways that connect the buildings in this area (by the way, highly rec. the set meals at the Excelsior Caffe in the Pedi Shiodome building if you're looking for something easy to get to, good, and cheap √à√\u2020\u2022?for instance, first thing in the morning √à√\u2020\u2022?think they open as early as 7am), but we did splurge on drinks in the lobby bar on our last night -- we sat and looked at the beautifully lit-up Tokyo Tower and contemplated our lovely stay in this wonderful city and at this wonderful hotel!
