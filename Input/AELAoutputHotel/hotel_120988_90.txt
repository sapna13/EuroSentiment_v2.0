{"text":"Great Hotel This is a great hotel. I got stuck in Boston due to a flight cancel and picked this hotel because it is at the airport. I didn't care if it was nice or not, but I was pleasantly surprised. Here are the pros\/cons:Pros:1. Everything about this place is nice and new! It has a beautiful, huge lobby and at the end of the hallway on each floor are two chairs\/table that you can sit and look out into the Boston Harbor - very nice.2. The furnishings and decor in the rooms are top-notch. There is even a huge LCD HDTV in the room - and you get HD programming.3. If you want to be by the airport, you're there! There is a shuttle that can take you from the airport to your terminal, which is what I did. I think you can walk from the hotel to the airport, but the agent told me to take the shuttle and it was very convenient\/quick.4. Since my flight was cancelled and I had a rental car, I had no way to get to the hotel from the rental car place. I called the hotel and they picked me up in 5 mins!5. The food\/service in the restaurant was great and not over-priced.Cons:1. Half the channels on the huge LCD HDTV I mentioned above didn't work.2. The sound insulation in the rooms is not good - I could hear people coughing in the room next door and could hear people in the hallway outside my room very clearly.3. Again, the location is great if you want to be by the airport, which I did. If you want to walk the freedom trail, go to a game at fenway or eat in the North End, you are not in the city and you won't be able to walk to them. It's a short cab ride, but it's not like you're staying in the heart of the city.Overall, this is a very, very nice hotel and I think I'll stay there the next time I go to Boston.
