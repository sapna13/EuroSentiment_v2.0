{"text":"Very nice place in a central location The main entrance to this hotel is actually on 41st St., but there's another one - easy to miss except for that big askew clock - in the middle of the busiest block of 42nd, between 7th and 8th Aves. The rooms are all from the 23rd floor and above, with the lobby on the 21st, via a dedicated elevator. I got there late AM and was told my room wasn't ready. But they took my cell number and said they'd call when it was. They did, at about 1 PM. (Baggage check is at ground level.) Getting the key took a while because of a line at the desk.The room, on 23rd floor, was bright, clean and spacious, with a desk, lounge chair and a 37 flat-screen TV, which I only used to get local weather. A big window lets in lots of light and offers decent city views. There was no street noise, and this is 42nd St. we're talking about. A nice-sized closet with had real hangers, and cloth bathrobes, too. I almost slipped in the shower, though. When I mentioned this at check-out, the clerk told me I could have asked for a mat, so you might want to keep this in mind.A passable exercise room is on the CC, or mezzanine, level, not the 23rd floor as stated in the hotel guide in my room. There's also a business center, $2.99 plus $.59\/minute to use the computer.The location is great, a short walk from subways, Times Square, the theater district, restaurants, et. al. The biggest problem was negotiating my way through the crowds on the street. If you can get this place on Priceline, it's a pretty good bargain.
