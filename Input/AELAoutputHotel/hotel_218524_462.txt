{"text":"LOVED IT!!! My husband and I just got back from a 6 night stay. We absolutely loved it!! The moment we pulled up to the resort we fell in love. We stayed in the Excellence Club where we met so many nice couples of all different ages. We had a beautiful oceanview room with a mini bar that was like your own bar at home. Our bed was a little to firm for me and my husband but none the less quite comfortable. Our bar person gladly changed what my husband and I did not want stocked in the bar with everything that we did want to drink. We tipped him generously our first day and he was our friend for the week. Always asking us if we needed anything even after he did his daily room check.I have read the reviews regarding the food at the resort. I am very happy to say that I enjoyed every meal that I had!! Toscana's was excellent, the breakfast at this place is phenominal. The Grill was good, but my favorite would have to be Chez Isabelle. Everyday, I tried the Excellence drink of the day. Do not let a day go by without trying each drink of the day. My favorite drink of the day was called Hot Summer. I loved it so much I made sure I brought home the recipe with me!This resort was immaculately kept. The pool was beautiful. Every staff member that you passed greeted you. If you are looking for inexpensive gifts to bring home, to the right of the resort is the local vendors call Wal-Mart. They are located on the beach. Go see Nancy and Charie. The first store on the beach. No pressure to buy anything. But you will buy something, you cannot help it!! I purchased several paintings and masks along with some other gifts.I highly recommend this resort to anyone who is looking for serenity.I would to say that I did not like the hour ride to and from the airport. But, it was worth it!!
