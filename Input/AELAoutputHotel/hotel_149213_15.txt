{"text":"A half decent resort I stayed at Barcelo Bavaro Beach Resort over the christmas holiday and didn't get a chance till now to write a review. We got to the airport with no problems, the flight was on time and everything. Everything went pretty smooth at the airport except it took a long time for them to get the luggage on the conveyor belt for pick up. Being to Cuba previously 5 times the security at Punta Cana is MUCH lighter basically going right through. The bus ride was smooth and so was check-in. Others reviews say that the resort is overbooked and they redirect travellers to other nearby resorts. Well I guess I was lucky. The room was alright. We had problems with the tv and we reported this to the lobby as soon as we checked in. Every time we called they said somebody is on the way to look at it. Nobody ever came. But I rather have the tv not working than the toilet pipes in the washroom exploding and flooding the room like other guests reported. The food was not bad. But the snack bar is way too overcrowded and you can wait a good 30 minutes for a pizza. The service in Punta Cana is NOTHING compared to Cuba. Also none of the staff in any part of the resort except for the lobby spoke any english. In Cuba the service is lighting fast, the staff speak fluent english and are very polite. If you tip a waitress in Cuba 1 dollar she would be thrilled and give you top service. In Dominican they just look at the money and take it. No Thank-you. Our room was at one end of the resort. It had its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage was the beach was not packed with plenty of room whereas near the snack bar people on the beach are all around you. Very claustrophobic. Disadvantage would be there's a good kilometer you need to walk to get to the restaurant. The beach was beautiful. White sands and blue water . Mainly only reason why we went to this resort. Went golfing paid 80$ but thats not bad for a round of golf. Nice course for all ages. The night life was trash. The shows were horrible. Once again nothing compared to Cuba. Basically right after dinner you could go to sleep and not miss anything exciting. Many fun excursions but been on many of them already so far except for the SEGWAY tours. Really fun. Tried snorkelling off the beach but don't bother no shells, coral or any fish whatsoever. Overall not a terrible resort but Cuba is much better in every category and the flight from Canada is shorter ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1075,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1070},{"endOffset":1130,"mention":"Cuba","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cuban_sandwich"],"startOffset":1126},{"endOffset":1817,"mention":"White","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1812},{"endOffset":1953,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1949},{"endOffset":2061,"mention":"Cuba","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cuban_sandwich"],"startOffset":2057},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"Cuba","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cuban_sandwich"],"startOffset":2371},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"Cuba","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cuban_sandwich"],"startOffset":2371},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"Cuba","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cuban_sandwich"],"startOffset":2371},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"Cuba","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cuban_sandwich"],"startOffset":2371}]}
