{"text":"Closet Rooms On arrival we were greeted with champagne, that was probably to numb us for what awaited us when we went to our room. It was no bigger than a closet and claustraphobic with a tiny window opening to a dark airless internal shaft.We promptly complained and were told there was nothng that could be done as the hotel was full, so we demanded our money back as we were prepared to go in search of another hotel room ratjher than stay in this closet. On hearing this we were told that there was a room available but the people had still not checked out and we would have to wait for them to collect their luggage from the room. This was after 3pm.Two hours later we were told the people had checked out but the room needed to be cleaned. We had been sitting in reception all this time and had seen no one check out or collect luggage. Another three hour wait followed while the room was serviced and finally we were given a room at the back of the hotel. So in all from the time we arrived in Barcelona till the time we finally got our room it had been a wasted afternoon. They have a nerve charging people the same price for the closet room as for their normal sized rooms. The reception staff were not particularly helpful and downright unfriendly.Although we had little noise at the back of the hotel the rumbling of the metro every 10 minutes or so was very annoying.So fellow travellers when booking this hotel be very wary of the 4 internal rooms on each of the floors they are tiny and claustraphobic.
