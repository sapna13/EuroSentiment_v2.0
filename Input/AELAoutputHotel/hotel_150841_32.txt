{"text":"Great week at the bavaro We just returned from the bavaro and let me start off by saying this is a great resort. We did not expierence a lot of things other people have written about. Our room didn't smell like mildew and the air worked great. If you leave the door open the air shuts off so we just keeped the door shut. My only complaint with the room would be the shower, when you turned the water on the whole bathroom got wet.   They were doing a lot of constuction around the property. The lobby was half closed. I am sure it is going to be beautiful when it done. The grounds were immaculate and there was always someone cleaning or gardening.  We found the food to be great and I am not a person who really likes buffets.The food was very fresh and presented amazing. If I can change one thing about this resort it would be making reservations for dinner. I went right away to make our dinner plans and were told the only openings were at 9:00 P.M. well that wasn't going to work for us since we had our 5 year old with us. I asked to speak to the manager and she found us reservations at 6:30. We heard a lot of people complain about the same thing and we all laughed because the restaurants were half empty every night.  The staff here is amazing. We diid tip our housekeeper every day and a lot of the other staff, they deserve it they work very hard.   The beach and pool were great and never a problem getting a chair. Be careful around the pool it gets slippery if you are not wearing rubber soles. We saw a lady fall and break her ankle.   Outside entertainment was alot of fun. Henry , P.J. and Isabel are the best. There is a lot for kids to do. Our 5 year old hasn't stopped talking about our vacation. I would highly recommend this hotel if you want great service, great food, amazing beach and just a wonerful vacation. ","annotations":[]}
