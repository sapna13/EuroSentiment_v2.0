{"text":"Good Time, Worth the $$ I wasn't expecting too much from this hotel, however, I booked it because I was traveling alone  didn't want to stay in a total dump. It was good on my wallet  I felt pretty safe here. Overall, I stayed for 11 days.The location can't be beat - on the strip, but not in the center of it, so it is quiet at night yet you are able to enjoy everything about Waikiki. The restaurants are all great  the ABC store located in the hotel is ideal [they have lots of sales, stock up on waters  keep them in the fridge!] The Starbucks was great as well.The bed was HUGE and the room was clean. I did shower with my sandles on, but not because the tub was dirty...you could just tell that it was older. I did like the bath products [Bath  Body Works]Most of the hotel staff were really friendly; one woman needed a wee bit of an attitude adjustment, but then I just spoke with other staff during my stay. They could upgrade the pool\/beach towels to actual poll\/beach towels.Other than that, it was a lovely stay. The price was great - especially since I stayed for 11 days. I only spent time here to sleep, so I didn't take advantage of the hotel pool [and why would I when the beautiful ocean was RIGHT across the street!]I would consider going back again if I was traveling alone. If I were going with anyone else, I'd upgrade to a resort.
