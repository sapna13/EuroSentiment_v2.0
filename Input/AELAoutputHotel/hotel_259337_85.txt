{"text":"A week of paradise .... Sat here, back at my desk in the land of 9-5, I am still in absolute awe of the lovely week my lovely boyfriend have just returned from.I wish I had the time to write about everything that made this place so fabulous. Unfortunately I don't. So what I will say is that from our room to our meals to the staff and the service we received, I have not a single complaint. Our room: huge, comfy, cool, mini bar stocked to out liking, huge jaccuzi, lovely hot shower, table decoration filled with fresh flowers picked from the gardens (we saw the maid doing it)...the whole room spotlessly cleaned each day. The gardens: lush, colourful, vast, lined with coconut trees. Trimmed, mowed, preened and maintained to perfection everyday, by potentially the most friendly gardeners I have ever had the pleasure of meetingThe Food: I am quite fussy when it comes to food. Here I was absolutely spoiled for choice. Having never gone all inclusive before, I was a little worried. Silly me. From steaks to roast chicken, pork, beef, duck, grilled fish, freshly made paella, pastas cooked to your liking, choose your own ingredients, pizza's burgers, themed nights, mexican, american, dominican, spanish, gala...i could go on and on. red, white, pink wine and beers and juices all served with dinner and lunch, and a glass of champagne served with breaky. A la carte's? we only tried one of the many as the buffets were lovely, but our experience was lovely food, lovely service. The Staff: for me, the staff at this resort made it that extra bit special. Never before have i stayed in a place where people do everything they can to make you feel so welcome. The people here go out of thier way to make you smile, and are so full of life and happiness themselves. It became a genuine pleasure to be around the staff, who always recognise you and say hello\/ola. i'm still saying ola now....I'm going to have to stop now, still so much I want to say and not enough time to say it in.Basically, if you want to go away, relax, have fun and an amazing time in an amazing place with the person\/people you love, then this resort is perfect. Im missing it already.p.s - if you go, look out for the gardeners collecting the coconuts that have fallen from the trees, they cut them open for you to drink from then and then eat them....they taste amazing and added a nice little touch to our hol...I want to go back...right thats it, i'll stop now :-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1080,"mention":"paella","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Paella"],"startOffset":1074},{"endOffset":1156,"mention":"burgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1149},{"endOffset":1251,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1246},{"endOffset":2366,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2362}]}
