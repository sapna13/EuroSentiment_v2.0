{"text":"Wowza! What a great place! Just returned home from this resort a few minutes ago. What a great resort\/ holiday! We really wanted to stay another few days.When reserving this trip, we spent a lot of time trying to figure out where to go, investigating on the internet, finding best price vs best place and reading these reviews for thoughts. We found a fantastic resort, Gran Bahia Principe Bavaro.Last year we stayed at Grand Paradise, which was a very nice resort too. I certainly wouldn't mind staying there again but Gran Bahia is superior and MUCH larger.We didn't figure out until we got there, that there are two parts to this resort. One is the Punta Cana side (the regular side) and the other being the Amber side (the step up side). It might be worth while finding out how much more the Amber side is. You get a few extra (ie- meals, private pool, extra access to water sports equipment). We travelled with Air Transat which was okay. I recommend taking extra snacks and drinks with you on the plane as they don't feed you too much.Hotel room- Gran Bahia rooms were really good. The bathrooms have normal showers, facilities,etc. The bed linens, towels were clean. Beach- what can I say....it is truly amazing. There are lots of sun beds, palaps, palm trees, quiet areas and fun areas.Pools- great!! The pool closest to the beach isn't the clienest. Not sure what to expect with the pool is so close to beach and people don't shower off their sand covered bodies. This didn't stop us from spending the whole day in this pool. However, my preference was the pool closer to our hotel room. (Did I mention the pools have swim up bars??? Fun! You must try the chocolate banana slushy and if you are new to the Resort lifestyle the Bahama mama is also a must!)Water sports- this can get very busy and can be a little frustrating. It seems like you have to reserve the day before or hang around and hope people don't show up for their reservation. For Wind surfing you need to take lessons cost $35. A 2 hour snorkeling trip was really good, cost $35. Boogie boards, kyacking are free.Food- buffet is good, lots of variety and nicely decorated. For the al a carte restaurants our favorite was the Japanese. Also tried the gourment which was very nice and the seafood place which was fine. Bars- endless drinks. Also, have a nice coffee  tea area. This area can get pretty smokey. Lobby- beautiful. Lots of places to hang out.Entertainment- really appreciated the effort of the entertainment staff. The Michael Jackson and Legends shows were really good. The Lion King show should have been for kids. Old towne entertainment which includes a house band which was great! And a little skits iwth crowd participation. The skits were silly but mindless fun, good for a laugh.Old towne also has stores, vendors, internet, hamburger joint, karobe bar, pool tables and a night club. All really good. Staff- overall very good. Some of the staff seem a little bored or annoyed (this is only an observation- not a comment of concern).Did hear on our travels that the RUI location is great and the Barcelo locations are good too (there seems to be 3-4 different Barcelo resorts). There was one I saw that I would like to go next year. Melia Caribe. We also went on two tours. Bavaro Runners was fantastic. We had a hilarious tour guide, Alex. It is worthwhile requesting his tour. Santa Domingo- we went this year and last year. Good this year. Great last year. Last year we ended up on a tour with a women tour guide from the Netherlands. She was great. If you can, go for two weeks. We went for one and wanted to stay longer. Hope this helps you make a decision.Happy travels.
