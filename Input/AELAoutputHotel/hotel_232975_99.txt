{"text":"Il Guelfo Bianco: an experience to live For me Florence was always a dreamy destination and when I decided to visit it I wanted to organize it in such a way in order to enjoy every minute of my days there. Since I believe that the environment we live in, even for a few days, is very important to our whole mood, I knew that the hotel I would choose would have to be something special and something equivalent to the beauty of the city I was going to visit. Il Guelfo Bianco: the name itself is mysterious and unusual. It follows the history of the city. Located in the centre of the city, I could just step out of the hotel and find myself directly in the heart of Florence. The entrance of the hotel and the reception can be misleading: they are rather small compared to what one would expect. But when you visit the other spaces of the hotel and the rooms, you get the feeling you have entered in a fairytale. Warm colors are everywhere, wood is everywhere, the old and reserved furniture takes you years back in the history. You feel relaxed before even using your comfort bed and hotel amenities. You cannot believe it that a few minutes ago you were in one of the busiest streets of the city! Take a moment and enjoy your cappuccino in the quiet room specifically made for you to read or to relax before or after a day full of walking! When you start talking to the people working there, the dream continues to fulfill! Those guys there have everything set up for you before you even ask for it! Believe me when I say that the smile I saw (from the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ maids to the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ manager) was a real one. Even if you have not organized anything, even if you have no clue on what to see and visit in Florence, they will prepare for you a program matching your days of staying, your needs, your desires. And believe me, they will be 100% correct on all their suggestions! They are not there just to work, they know every small corner of Florence and they want their visitors to discover the city√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ beauties. I do hope to be able to stay at the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Øuelfo Bianco√à√\u2020\u2022?very soon, because it is not just another hotel, it is an experience worth having√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>Ada TzetouAthens, Greece ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1076,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":1069},{"endOffset":1238,"mention":"cappuccino","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cappuccino"],"startOffset":1228}]}
