{"text":"Bit dark but good location Hotels are expensive in San Francisco, but this had a 4 nights for the price of 3 office with Expedia for when we needed to stay so it made quite a difference in terms of value for money.I would not have gone for a themed hotel anywhere, but it didn't make any difference for us. It has a nautical theme if you're interested...Staff were friendly and helpful, in contrast to another recent review I found the Concierge \/ Bell staff to be very helpful and ameniable to my many questions for help and advice.I failed to book the Alcatraz trip in advance and missed out, but that is nobodies fault but my own (book before you arrive!)The hotel is in the shell of an old wharf building, not designed for habitation and very dark (at least in the reception area). Our room was also fairly dark, but not one of the best in terms of position which I imagine could be rectified with a paid upgrade...The room was clean and appropriately kitted out for the hotel rating with no unpleasent discoveries, other than the TV\/Internet facility which was faulty, and the fridge that periodically made a humming\/vibrating noise, this was not that much of a big deal though. To my mind I would expect stuff like this unless I was staying in a 5 star + (but I am English). Good air con.Didn't eat in the restaurant.Free wine ('tasting') at about 5pm in reception every day was a nice touch and a chance to socialise with other guests.Biggest plus for this hotel is the location. Although Fishermans Wharf is a bit of a dump with limited charm or appeal, it is a good place to be based as a tourist. You have the Cable car next door to the hotel which takes you over the hills of the city down into Union Square (where the shops are), it is a good point to walk or cycle to the Golden Gate bridge (1.5 hours - 2 hours walk) along the bay. You can also walk to other places of interest. There is also a buzz about the place (Fishermans Wharf).
