{"text":"Good experience Hotel staff was courteous and spoke English, which were great. The room was small, but clean. Bathroom was newly renovated and was very clean. We had a good experience, mostly because we got a good deal through Expedia. Having the subway really close was nice. This hotel is by no means a 4 star by US standards. I think we have a much higher standards for hotels in America.What I cannot understand are three things they did. The rooms do NOT look like the great, grand rooms you see on the photos. Many other visitors have mentioned that before. Isn't this false advertising?Secondly, knowing that there are three of us staying in the junior suite, (by the way most of the rooms do NOT face the L'Arc) only one of us was offered a breakfast discount coupon which would reduce a regular breakfast fee of 26 euros to 10 euros. For my two companions, they would have to pay a regular fee of 26 euros if they want to have breakfast with me at the hotel!The worst restaurant was referred to us by the hotel staff. It the worst lunch we had in Paris and was close to $100 for three!... as a matter of fact, when we were at the restaurant, a group of American travelers walked out after they were seated. Worry not, there are lots of decent places to eat near the hotel, including MacDonalds, if you wanted something quickly. If you want a quick pastry in the morning, the subway station which is very close and clean has a place that looks like a small Au Bon Pain. Pastries in Paris are really good. Also, if you want a supermarket to pick up some supplies, go to Roosevelt subway stop which is two stops from the hotel subway and go to Mediplex on Champ Elysees. Also understand that a phone call at the hotel, even if it is a toll free call, will will be charged a fee.. in my case, a local toll free call of 30 sec was charged 2 euros. Internet connection for 24 hours is close to $30!Use your credit card as much as possible in Paris. Everyone accepts it. They charge you 9% commissions fee on exchange of dollars to euros.! Good luck.
