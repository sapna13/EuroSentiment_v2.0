{"text":"Great find We were taking a short break in Florence to see as much of the famous sites as we could in a short time. This hotel was just perfect, centrally located, easy for walking about with eateries close at hand. Many of the sites of interest are 2-5mins away (even a book shop selling english books). We could pop back for a rest when the feet needed a break. There was a fridge in the room for cold drinks\/picnic food and the bathroom was newly refurbished, clean and well equipped and there was constant hot water. Our room was spacious and we had a view of the Duomo. The hotel is family run and we received a warm welcome and brilliant service. English is spoken. Free internet connection was a bonus as was the loan of a bottle opener! Renovation work was going on on the ground floor, and the second, so keeping the place clean and keeping it running efficiently must have been a headache but they did it. The place was spotless. The only possible downside was that it was a bit noisier in the the day because of the work (a temporary problem) and the breakfast room is disrupted. The temporary accomodation is a little cramped with no natural light and the choice of food is adequate but would benefit from the addition of fruit and some whole grain bread\/crackers. This is a city hotel so don't expect the garden or the pool but do expect an oasis in the middle of a busy city. It is run by people who have travelled and who care for the comfort and happiness of their guests. Nothing is too much trouble.
