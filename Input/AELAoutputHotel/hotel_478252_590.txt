{"text":"Heaven...........not quite My family and I stayed here for 2 weeks from the 26th June 2007.I booked through Airtours and unfortunately we flew with Thomas Cook,seat pitch very small(29),small seats,poor food,poor service and in-flight entertainment. it got better when we landed,quickly through the airport and the 30 min. drive to the hotel. The hotel is beautiful.The lobby is stunning,the grounds are beautiful and the place is so clean. we stayed in villa 8,the room was spacious and clean,towel sculptures every where and champagne and fresh fruit waiting for us.We had been upgraded to diamond club which we were delighted with as we had a pool for use by this club which was quiet and relaxing.We found the other two pools and the beach fair too noisy and busy.The service around the pool was great and the drinks were good(try a chocolate or blue hawaii).Always plenty of beds. Buffet-The food at the buffet was generally very good-fresh pasta station was very good.the service was very good early in the evening but when it became busy,service was very poor. A la cartes-our favourite was the BBQ and the Steakhouse,service and food very good. japanese-was OK but nothing brilliant,set menu-the only choice was which you soup wanted.The deep fried ice cream was great. Italian-did not go on the night as we used this for breakfast and lunch(change from the buffet).as the menu on the night is the same as the lunch time menu,did not see the point in going. Fish-went one lunch time and did not enjoy it-service and food were poor.  The lobby bar was excellent,service and drinks were great,unfortunately it closes at 11pm.The keyboard players are a bit repetitive. The shows were OK,just remember they are not professional,go see Michael Jackson.  The shopping plaza is good for gifts,the barrow boys do get on yor nerves but just say no.haggle for everything,you can get it for peanuts. The language is not a problem,majority of the staff speak English,the only thing that annoyed us were the greeters at the buffet,you would tell them you were English and they still carried on speaking spanish. Overall,we had a great time and would return to this resort but i would not class it as a 5 star.
