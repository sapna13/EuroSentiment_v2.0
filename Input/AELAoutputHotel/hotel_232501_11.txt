{"text":"Singel Biggest Mistake I was in Amsterdam this past week for a few night stay celebrating a birthday and chose to stay at the Singel because it appeared, from the reviews, to be exactly what I was looking for: a clean place with a great location. While the location was ok, not great and will never stay in that area of Amsterdam again, the hotel was the worst hotel I have ever seen. There are hostels that are nicer and cleaner. This hotel claims to have 3 stars, well I would give it 0.Upon entering the hotel you can see that the downstairs area has not been updated since the 70's and most likely not really cleaned since then either. When I entered my room I almost got sick. The carpet was old, worn and had many stains, as did the walls. The bathroom was so small that the sink was acutally in the shower are. Now I know that bathrooms tend to be smaller in Europe, I lived there for 6 months, but this was ridiculous. In addition, the bedding had not been washed and I had to ask for it to be changed (which they were fighting as the maid had gone for the day). Even after the beddding was changed to supposedly new sheets their still remained hairs and other discusting matter on the sheets and blanket. There is nothing chic, hip, or clean about this hotel. After one night I left. The only reason I stayed for one night is that there were not hotel rooms left in the city. If is was not so cold, I would have slept on the streets!Be warned this is a DUMP!
