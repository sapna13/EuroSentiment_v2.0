{"text":"Never fails to disappoint This is the third time we have stayed in this hotel and it never fails to disappoint. It may not be in the centre of Barcelona but it is a 10-15 minute walk away from the centre. There is also 2 metro stops about 2 minutes walk from the hotel, thus making the hotel very accessible to see all of Barcelona.Would strongly recommend the metro to anyone. Trains run regularly and get you anywhere in the city much quicker than the sight seeing buses do. If using the metro there are automated ticket machines at all the stations. Would recommend that you buy a ticket for 10 journeys as it is better value for money than single trip tickets. You will be surprised how much you will hop on and off the metro.Check in was as straightforward as ever. All staff are very helpful and polite. Rooms are quite spacious for some European city hotels and are maintained to a high standard and cleaned on a daily basis.The rooms are lacking tea and coffee making facilities but with cafes and eateries near by you do not really miss this. The hotel also does not have a restaurant but there are that many eateries in Barcelona that this is not a problem.If eating out I would recommend that you eat away from las ramblas as this is much cheaper. There are many good places but my personal recommendation would be to eat at the maremagnum. There is an exceptional italian restaurant called Gino's. I have never been able to fault the quality of their food or the service. There is also a good all you can eat buffet at the maremagnum also.For those looking to relax, I would recommend a trip to the beach at barceloneta. If you want to go to some of the main attractions such as Gaudi's house I recommend you get there early as queues can be long.Another tip would be if you want to go to see the fountains in the evening I recommend you are there for about 9pm as this seems to be when the main show starts. All in all Barcelona is a city that never disappoints and neither does this hotel.
