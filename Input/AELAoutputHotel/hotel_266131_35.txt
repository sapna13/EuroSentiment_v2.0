{"text":"We loved it ! We just returned from Barcelona 5 days ago. We had 4 nights at the Gran Hotel La Florida. We absolutely loved it. We had hesitated in staying there, because it is on Mt. Tibidabo, a little away from the main parts of the city. Once we arrived, we were thrilled we had chosen this hotel. It was actually a pleasure being away from the city. Barcelona is teeming with people. La Ramblas is kind of seedy. We were disappointed in that area. Lots of guys at night were drunk or on drugs. We went once and then stayed away.Back to the hotel. They were extremely accommodating in getting us transportation anytime into Barcelona. They run a free shuttle throughout the day. We would usually take the shuttle into Barcelona, and then take a taxi home at night. It was easy to get a taxi either way, and cost about 15 Euros. The hotel is physically beautiful. I had read other reviews about the pool area, and it is magnificent. The outside pool area is terraced overlooking the city (the inside pool flows into the outside pool). Breakfast can be outside on the terrace which I highly recommend. The rooms were beautiful. The bathrooms were all beige marble, elegant and spacious. There was a separate shower and tub. The views from all the rooms are gorgeous. All rooms have flat screen TV's (not that we watched very much). The hotel is smaller and more intimate, yet large enough that we felt anonymous when we wanted to be. The staff were extremely helpful. We loved it and would stay again anytime. You would not make a mistake by staying here, even if it is a 15 - 25 min. drive into Barcelona. The drive was nothing and didn't detract in any way from our time in Barcelona. It was a plus. I only wish someone had saved me from agonizing over the decision to stay there vs. in Barcelona. We are very happy we chose this hotel!
