{"text":"It was good for relaxing but the food wasn't My Husband and I (We are newlyweds) went to DR and stayed at the PCP July 26th - August 3rd, 2006.The rooms were nice - we got block 5000 - it's a must if your staying there - it's by the pool and beach and has ocean view.The people are friendly as can be - Dominican Time translation 10 minutes can mean an hour - things are slow paced there. The grounds and the rooms were always kept clean. Weather great! Beach Great! We did the snorkeling tour and it was nice.The downside - THE FOOD IS NOT GOOD! You can eat it but it's not good -breakfasts were better than the rest of the day's meals for sure. Room Service Menu is very limited and the food on it stinks. The pool is big, beautiful and clean - wasn't crazy about the way the staff takes monkeys on leash's for the people to take pictures with - the monkeys are treated badly.Rio Grand - we ate there twice the food was better there. You have to make reservations MUCH MUCH in advance or forget it! Do all your reservations the first day you get there! Italian Restaurant was horrible (Mama Mia or something like that)Seafood wasn't that good either. Buffet or Rio Grand - whenever we went to another place to eat we would end up going to the buffet anyway cause we were starved! It wasn't a bad vacation but we wouldn't go again. ","annotations":[]}
