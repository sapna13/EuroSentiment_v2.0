{"text":"Helpful concierge This hotel has a fantastic location, walking distance from Retiro Park (our favorite spot in Madrid) , the Atocha train station and the major museums (if you're interested in them, which we weren't). A walk along the Paseo Del Prado is wonderfully relaxing, day or night.We asked for a room on the top floor to avoid street noise, and while we avoided noise, the view from our terrace was not quite as appealing the picture on the website. The room was air conditioned, but it had two floors and the top floor, where the bed is, was never cool and they didn't fix it while we were there. Fortunately we could keep the windows open and at night the air was cool, even though it smelled faintly of cigarette smoke, which we found was a constant unwelcome companion everywhere in Spain. Our room had one full bathroom upstairs and a half bath downstairs. This was a good idea, since two adults couldn't brush their teeth at the same time in the upstairs bathroom. The full bath had a wonderful HUGE bath tub\/shower big enough for both of us (it was our honeymoon after all). The room itself was a litle on the small side, and we had to keep one suitcase upstairs and one downstairs in order to move around. The bed was very comfortable. They offered fast internet service through the tv in the room at a charge, and a very slow computer with internet service in the lobby at no charge. The double room was two twin beds put side by side (this was our honeymoon!), but the beds were comfortable if you didn't want to snuggle or if you could both fit on one twin.The front desk was very helpful in giving directions, recommending restaurants and making reservations. They were sad but accomodating when our plans changed and we left a day earlier than our reservations called for.I would stay there again, but I would avoid the two-story room. ","annotations":[]}
