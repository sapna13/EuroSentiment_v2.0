{"text":"good for those on a budget We stayed at hotel rapallo for 3 nights. The hotel was a 15-20 min walk from the train station, once you find the road its very easy to find cause you just keep walking straight. On our arrival the staff (two men at front desk--one young, one old) got us settled and gave us maps. Our room did not look like anything that was presented on the website. It was very basic, two single beds, basic sheets, tv, tiny bathroom that divided the shower and toilet by just a shower curtain on a rod. The room could have been cleaner as for the carpet which was a dark brown but overall if your on a budget, this hotel did the trick. They did have internet but you would have to get a code and pay a fee. The computer room is downstairs in a tiny closet like room that can only fit one person BUT if you have a laptop you should put the code in and off you go. The breakfast was satisfactory. You got croissants, buns, ham, cheese, yogurt, juice, cereal, tea\/hot chocolate\/coffee --all luke warm. Definitly not hot like the coffee u get in the states or canada. We were able to get to all the main attractions by foot (bell tower, santa maria churck, uffizi, accademia-where David is etc). The hotel will recommend a traditional italian restaurant to go to--we went there twice for dinner and it was pretty good. Beware of the street vendors on that street trying to sell you sketchy items such as purses, belts, clothes etc. I felt really uncomfortable walking down that area at night with all the vendors present--all men saying 'prego' and staring at you. If your on a budget as for food, there is a grocery store on the main street you can buy snacks\/veggies\/fruit from and store in the minibar. Over all the hotel was good for us cause we didn' t want to spend too much money. The rooms could have been cleaner and more appealing--at one point when I went to open the window, it almost fell off the hinge. BUT in saying that, I wouldnt mind staying here again. \\It did the trick, it was close to everything and we were able to walk to everything we needed to. I dont think the staff were creepy at all...they were quite helpful.
