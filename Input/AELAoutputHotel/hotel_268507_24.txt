{"text":"Modern  We stayed at Hotel Le Germain for 6 nights in June 2007 - our first holiday to Toronto. In summary, the hotel was very clean, in a good location, the staff very helpful and overall, we were very happy with our stay. We stayed in a deluxe room (1006) which looked out of the back of the hotel which gave good views over the entertainment district. The room was very clean, tidy and of course the bathroom with the window into the room. We tried the room service which gave very large portions and well worth the money - especially after a hard day of sightseeing. Our rate included breakfast which was buffet style and always stocked plentifully with homecooked pastries, pancakes, muffins and also cereal, fruit, yogurt etc. During our stay, I celebrated my birthday. Upon our return to our room, there was a handwritten card from the conceirge and a handmade cake waiting for me. We didn't tell the hotel that it was birthday - it must have been the maid who noticed the birthday cards in the room.We used the conceirge to book a tour to Niagara Falls and a town car back to the airport. In both instances, they gave us the information and let us decide. They then organised everything on our behalf.The hotel is in a good location for the many restaurants and cafes of the entertainment district, the CN Tower, the Roger's Centre and the lake front.The Eaton Centre is within walking distance, and there are many streetcars that stop in the vicinity.We have stopped in many hotels around the world, and this is one of the best - highly recommended.
