{"text":"Amazing What can we say about the Laguna Spa! Amazing... Wonderful ... Everything we dreamt of... Upon arrival a friendly dong announces your arrival, with dancers and music hand played. Check in staff arrive to take your luggage, which you don't see again until already checked in and in your room! A welcome drink to cool you whilst you are guided to some lovely seats whilst they get all the paperwork ready. Room was fantastic, with a little treat organised for us for our honeymoon. The grounds are breath taking and whilst some people have recommended nearby hotels, nothing beats the two waterfalls, lagoon and peace and quiet. Staff are so friendly and go out of their way to help. Afternoon tea and cakes, provided free of charge, is a must and it always amused us that most of the guests appeared to not know about it! Due to sun seeking we used to pop down to the pool area around 7:00 am to pick the best spot, but there is plenty of sunbeds and I am not sure what people are on about when they state that they could not find a sunbed on the beach, as we had no problems at all, even when not getting there until mid morning. Food was delightful, but to keep costs down we often went out to the local restaurants - most of the time away from the Bali Collection section as this was a bit samey so we opted to take a stroll just outside the gates of Nusa Dua. Having said that, the breakfast was resfreshing in the hotel and it is worth looking at the in room dining, as this is actually a lot cheaper and just as tasty. We had a lovely meal on the balcony of our room on the last evening! Thank you to the staff and management of this hotel, who concentrate so hard on getting the basics so right and delivering a wonderful experience, you should be number one on the Bali list! Looking forward to coming back soon!
