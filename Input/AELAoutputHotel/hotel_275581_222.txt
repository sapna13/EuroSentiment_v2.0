{"text":"Good choice for short term stay Checked out the reviews about this hotel on TripAdvisor before booking and was greatly heartened by the comments from other users. I knew exactly what to expect and wasn't disappointed. From the moment we got out of the cab, one of the hotel staff, Philippe, was there to greet us with a cheery Hallo! and to assist with our bags. He waited patiently as we were checked in by the front desk. Service was swift, efficient, friendly and informative. I requested  immediately received the loan of a cable for the internet and a converter plug for my laptop. Later, I discovered that my laptop was unnecessary since there was complimentary internet access on public computers on each floor, as well as in the business centre. The room is a perfect size for a short stay since we were only there for 2 nights and didn't need to unpack our suitcases. Our friends were also able to book a room steps away from our own, so it was convenient. Although we didn't opt for the breakfast plan, our friends did, and they told us it was delicious. I was able to taste one of their spinach  feta muffins, and it was really yummy; made me wish I'd opted for the breakfast plan. If you think you might want breakfast, then it's better to book it online along with your room booking, especially if you can get the package deal. Otherwise, it's 17.50 pounds per person at the hotel. Everything was clean and well maintained. Bed is soft and not firm, so a bit of a back ache in the mornings. Shower is clean. Found a hair in our bed when we first got there, but no worries! Just brushed it off and good as new. One thing though, I think the bed was missing a bedspread since there was only the fitted sheet and the quilt. I prefer to have a bedspread between the quilt and the bedsheet. Also, there was no view from our window (we faced the other side of the hotel), but who cares?! We weren't there to stay in our rooms. They have a great DVD and CD selection that's complimentary for guests to borrow. If you find that the hotel's restaurant is a bit expensive, there's a Pizza Express restaurant right at the back, and just a short walk away on Horseferry Rd is a pub, and there's even a Gregg's bakery (it was closed when we were there) about a 10 minute walk away. We didn't want anything in the mini-fridge, plus it was too expensive, so we went to Costcutters instead. It's a convenience store just a 5 min walk away. The hotel is ideally situated about a 20 min walk from Westminster Abbey and Parliament. We took the Underground late on Saturday night and opted to walk from Westminster Station, which only took us about 20 mins (once we figured out which way to go). Check out was a breeze and literally took less than 5 minutes. I'd definitely stay at this hotel again. The service deserves more than 5 stars, especially since the staff remembered our names even on our last day! Especially Philippe who was such a dear throughout. The soft bed doesn't make this a good choice for a long term stay, but it's an excellent choice for a short term period. My friends recommended LondonTown and it had the best rates on the net. I also received a helpful welcome package with a London A-Z book included. I'd use that website again next time I visit London. Can't wait to go back. Love that city.
