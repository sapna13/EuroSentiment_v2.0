{"text":"A Honeymoon MUST Away from the Hands of Man My husband and I started our honeymoon in Bali at Ubud (3nights)...we really weren't too excited about the city initially because we are truly beach people (from Orange County California). After the long flight and taxi ride we arrived at the beautiful Alila. As we were checking in my husband noticed that we were upgraded to a villa and they later informed us of our free massages or guided hike. When we got there we could not believe our eyes we thought we were in a episode of MTV cribs. There was a breath taking sunken tub in a koi pond and a private outdoor shower. When you leave your room and do not put the do not disturb sign out you will return to little treats being left in your room (fruit platter, your bed turned down,or little desserts). There are no tvs and clocks in the room but they do have and Ipod...we personally loved being away from the hands of man. We highly recommend the breakfast deal when booking your room...it will not leave you disappointed. We opted for a romantic dinner which is only 100 US dollars. You will meet with Christian Alila's chef (he is so nice) and decide what kind of menu you'd like. They give you a bottle of wine that night and it is and experience you will never forget. The staff is very nice and helpful. There are only two computers in the business center but wireless internet can be accessed in lobby or business center. The only down side of Alila was being far from down town, but the up side is there is a free shuttle and taxi rides are only $6 roundtrip...plus you don't need to be going into town everyday if you are in Bali to relax and decompress. The spa was wonderful and the pool is amazing...we were so disappointed when we departed from this little piece of paradise. We continued our honeymoon in Jimbaran and Nusa Dua, no placed compared to Alila in Ubud. Our biggest mistake was not staying longer at Alila. ","annotations":[]}
