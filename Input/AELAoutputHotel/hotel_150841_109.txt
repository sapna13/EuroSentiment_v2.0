{"text":"The best vacation yet!!! I just came back from staying at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana. We stayed 7 nights, May 22-28th. I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews on here before deciding where to stay. I must admit I don't know why anyone would give a bad review for this place! I think people just like to complain. The food was excellent, drinks were great, people were very friendly, pools were huge- loved the swim up bar, and we did 2 excursions that were so much fun! We did the Stingray Bay Excursion where we went on a boat and got off to snorkel then we went farther out to an area to swim with sharks and stingrays! The 2nd excursion was an all day trip around the Dominican Island where we saw a dominican home, cigar factory,sugar cane plantation, school, had lunch on top of the mountain. You really don't need any money except for excursions or any gifts you want to buy, they dont expect any tips there although we tipped almost everyone because they were so friendly and helpful. We are already thinking of booking the same hotel next year. The front desk was very helpful and I suggest booking all your Al La Carte dinner reservations the night you get there, that is what we did. We stayed 7 nights so we got 3 places to try, although we went to 4 because they had a special couples night at one place which was very nice. The bufffet had great food too though, I wouldn't of minded eating there every night!Oh and the shows everynight were great, we weren't too into the dancing ones, but we loved the comedy nights. We are both 28, and my bf had his birthday while we were there so I asked the staff to celebrate his bday. They called him up on stage, sand happy birthday to him and gave him a t-shirt on stage. It was a great time, and I can't wait to go back. If you have any questions or anything just email me and ill be happy to help! ","annotations":[]}
