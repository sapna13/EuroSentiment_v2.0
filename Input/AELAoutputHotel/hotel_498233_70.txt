{"text":"a little lagniappe for everyone We are a couple of innkeepers from Bar Harbor, Maine and generally we prefer to stay in small, independently operated hotels or BB's but this hotel seemed charming, had a good location and was well-priced. We were very impressed with the cleanliness of the rooms and the cleaning staff in general (as all the staff at the hotel) were very friendly when we saw them in the hallways. The location of this hotel is ideal. It is two blocks into the Central Business District from the French Quarter which translates to walking distance from where you probably want to go in New Orleans, but far enough from the drunk frat boys on Bourbon Street to be quiet.Breakfast was sufficient, though repetitive for a long stay, however in a city like New Orleans it's a shame to not go out and eat at the wide variety of restaurants. We ate three breakfasts at the hotel and 4 out in town. The self-serve waffles are a nice touch and pretty popular and it's kinda fun to run the waffle iron.Service was attentive, but not in your face. Just what we like! If you needed something, the staff was prompt to get it. One manager even took a brief walk around the block to remind herself of the name of a salon for me -- very nice!The room was very clean and had high ceilings which made it feel more spacious than it was. The bed was comfortable. We wished there had been a window to open and we made a note to ourselves to look for a place with a balcony next time, but only if we are traveling in the spring or fall. In the summer, the climate-control would be very nice indeed! This wasn't a major issue at all and hardly impacted our stay as we were really only in our room to sleep or for a brief bit of work between being out in New Orleans.The building is a collection of 7 historic buildings and the architects did a nice job of highlighting historical architectural details. it gives this small chain hotel a lot of charm which we appreciated deeply.All in all, we were very pleased with this hotel!
