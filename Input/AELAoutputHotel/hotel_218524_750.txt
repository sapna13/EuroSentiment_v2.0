{"text":"Almost Excellent but will not return My wife and I stayed at Excellence from Dec 1 thru Dec 8. While we had a very nice time I will explain at the end why we would not return.. Lets list all the excellent features. The service staff is absolutely superb. They are so well trained, so caring and they always smile whether in the restaurants or activities. These employees truly enjoy what they do and that is not easy to accomplish. The food was generally good and among our favorites were going to Chez Isabelle. This is not high quality food as we know it in New York City but it was actually well prepared. The pastry chef was wonderful. The array of desserts and breads were baked fresh daily and they were wonderful. The pool area was very nice and staff was extremely accomodating whether you wanted drinks or just fresh towels. The beach was pretty but the big negative for us was the ocean water. The waves are so rough that it is very difficult to swim and I think we were there on a relatively calm weather week with nothing but perfect weather. If you walk about 1\/4 mile to the right you will find some pockets of calmer water but this is not on the Excellence property. The shows were actually fairly good for the most part and definitely better than a cruise ship.So here were our big negatives although the overall experience was fine. We were discappointed in the rooms, we thought for a 5 star property, the rooms would be more elegantly appointed which they were not. The buildings themselves were very mundane looking but as others have said, how much time do you really spend indoors when the weather is beautiful.The clientele was a true walk of all lives. My wife and I are fairly outgoing and like to make conversation with others, we found most people were not willing to speak but kept to themselves. I think we thought we would see more New Yorkers there, but in fact there were very few. Some simple request like a newspaper we were told was only for Excellent Club members and while I wanted to pay for it, I was not permitted to purchase it. My wife is a big drinker of decaffinated coffee and the Food  Beverage Manager told us they do not carry this, so bring your own if you want it brewed.All in all we had a relaxing week, but the big negative was the absence of a calm relaxing carribean waters which we so look forward to.
