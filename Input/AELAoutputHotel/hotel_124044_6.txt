{"text":"OVERPRICED! I stayed a week and regretted it. On the website it seemed modern, but when I got there I was seriously disappointed. It was trying to be something it obviously isn't. It said it was pet friendly, however, when I got there with my two dogs I had no place to walk them. They didnt even provide a patch of grass. So why the pet fee? If you want to go to walk your dog you better be prepared to either walk or drive 2 miles to Green Lake Park, which can be hassle to do in the morning before going to work. The toilet was backed up and despite calling the front desk the afternoon it happened they sent someone the next morning. The shower curtains are so short that the floors get easily wet. The wireless was non responsive...most of the time not even working. I called the internet service provider but even after doing so it never worked. I had to get an ethernet cable. They only offered about five channels and HBO so if you are there for an extended stay you may get a bit bored. The layout of the building was pretty bad too. You can't open the curtains to your room without everyone being able to see in there...no privacy at all. So i had to stay there with the curtains drawn which can get a bit sad. It is also located on a very busy street and I heard sirens mulitple times a day. On a positive note, the breakfast was good, front desk staff were very accomodating with faxes I needed sent or received and the housekeeping staff provided good service and friendly.I was expecting something more for almost $200 dollars a night with a govt rate. For overnight stays it is ok, but anything longer or a person with pets can do better elsewhere. ","annotations":[]}
