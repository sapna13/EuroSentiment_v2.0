{"text":"Great location for air travelers Planned and reserved 8 nights, stayed 1.Parking spaces are too close and barely allow enough room for a mid-size SUV to pull in, nonetheless have enough room to open your door far enough to be able to get out without hitting the vehicle next to you. The room we stayed in was on the first floor but not really. You have to step up from the lobby to get to the same level and you have to step up from the parking lot as well. This means you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ use a luggage cart to wheel your many pieces into your room, you have to do it manually. The outside exit door relocks when you leave so you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ reenter through it so you have to walk back to the side entrance to get in, and it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even locked even though there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a card reader to stop unwanted traffic. The bathroom had just a shower, no tub. The refrigerator wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even on a shelf or a table, it was on the floor. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not talking about one of those large refrigerators either; this is a small, RV-sized one. The closet was tiny and for a room with two full beds there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ barely enough room for one person to hang their clothes and a jacket let alone a second person in the room. The dresser has only 4 drawers, one of which had 4 phone books in it. The light by the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√¥esk√à√\u2020\u2022?can only be turned on if the switch on the wall by the main door to the room was on. This also turned on the light next to the television. Luckily it has its own separate switch so you can turn it off if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ need it while you work at the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√¥esk√à√\u2020\u2022? I say it that way because the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√¥esk√à√\u2020\u2022?is about 4√à√\u2020\u2022?x 2-1\/2√à√\u2020\u2022?and is merely a table. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ hardly large enough for my notebook computer and mouse then they stick the internet connection device and a large plastic pamphlet holder on it too. There is no surge protector for the AC plug where one would normally insert a laptop\/notebook plug and the CAT5e cable that is for the internet isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ connected to one either, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ just there laying on the floor hoping you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l find it instead of thinking the internet in this hotel is wireless √à√\u2020\u2022?LIKE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS. I mean really, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Seattle for Pete√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ sake. I would think that they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° have wireless in the rooms, heck I saw a bus drive by that said √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??I-FI HOTSPOT√à√\u2020\u2022?so if a moving bus can do it, why can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ they.The shower is not small, at least compared to the one I have to deal with at home. The water valve assembly isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ firmly attached to the wall studs so it moves around. The trim ring around the shower head pipe doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stay against the wall, even though it looks like someone caulked it in an attempt to get it to stay.For a dog-friendly hotel they truly suck. There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ virtually no grassy area and for the spots there are, are just mud. The hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ location isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ that great for walking your dog either. There are busy streets all around and no walking paths. The only option is to walk your dog around the building a few times and maybe on one pass you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l find the tiny spot of grass for them to use but since it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the only one, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect it to be as clean as the toilet in your room.If you smoke don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ plan on finding a place to smoke outside. Apparently there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a law about smoking within 25 feet of any entrance which may explain why there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ no ashtray near the doors. There is instead a nice few (thousand) piles of cigarette butts on the ground surrounding the hotel on the parking lot and in the rock gardens and in the bushes.The hotel backs onto the airport so it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a bit noisy at times. Luckily the runway is over a hill and passed a few buildings so when the large planes take off, the noise is somewhat muffled. If you like the noise, open the window and turn off your in-room air conditioner or heater, depending on the time of year.
