{"text":"Above and Beyond!! I travel to NYC 4-6 times a year for business and have stayed at more than 25 different hotels here over the last 10 years. The Omni Berkshire has always been at the top of my list, but my most recent stay here cemented it as an all-time favorite. Sure, the rooms here are very nice and clean. Comfortable beds, nice bathrooms, etc. Slightly better than other 4 star properties in mid-town. The lobby is pretty, restaurant is good and room service offers some ver y selections. But, what sets this hotel apart from all others is the service! REAL service that actually feels like you have friends and family at the front desk and with the concierge. It is sincere and genuine. During my recent stay, I became very ill with a horrible stomach flu. I've never been so sick. And, nothing is as bad as being very sick while on a business trip. The on-duty concierge, Beatrice, not only found a doctor and arranged an in-room appointment for me, she called several times to check on me and even insisted that I drink some gatorade to stay hydrated. She actually went to the store, bought me gatorade and personally brought it to my room! Beatrice was sincerely concerned about me and treated me as if I was a personal friend (or family member). It was almost like having my own mother here to take care of me. WOW! I've stayed in a lot of hotels, in a lot of places, and never experienced service like this... even at hotels that charge 5X as much. Thank you, Omni! Thank you, Beatrice. I will always return to this wonderful hotel with the most incredible staff in NYC!
