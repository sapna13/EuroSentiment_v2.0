{"text":"Hotel Continental Freebies, Fabulous, Functional, The location and freebies made this a wonderful experience along with the staff, free internet and clean rooms. For those that require perfection, don't book this hotel but for those that appreciate a reasonable comfort level with above-average attitude, you can't beat this hotel and the staff. The online pictures dress it up a bit but who doesn't do that? If you are not satisfied, you politely let the reception know what your problems are and they immediately go about correcting it. Rooms on La Rambla are a little more noisey unless you are used to city night sounds and people enjoying themselves so use earplugs or request an interior room and save a little money. We had four rooms and they all had a bathtub, frig, microwave, ac, fan. The food reception area has a balacony to view the activity outside and there's always lots of it! Perfect location for transportation. The metro steps away, the buses passing right by, the taxi stand steps away at the corner, the aerobus and tourist bus steps away from Placa Catalunya. Can't be beat. Across the street is a small opera house with very good performances of program of song and dance of Spain. Reasonable and entertaining. If you have a short stay, use the tourist bus one day and if you have 4-6 days, get the 2 day pass. You go to all the major sights with stops and see all of Barcelona. The info booth is across the street from the hotel down the La Rambla. Write any questions you have and I will be happy to answer you.
