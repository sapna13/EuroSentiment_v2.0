{"text":"Magical Hyatt We have just returned from our holiday at the Bali Hyatt and it was a holiday to remember. It started off with us arriving at the Bali Hyatt gates welcomed by two security guards doing a routined check of the vehicle because of the bombing that had happened. At first I thought that it was a bit intimidating but than understood and appreciated their reasons to keep their guests safe.As the routine ended we then proceeded towards the entrance way of the Hyatt and was welcomed with another warm greeting from the young ladies at the entrance and then got 'laid' (they put over us a lei made out of the flower fragipani, which is a very beautiful smell). Our luggage was taken from our vehicle and we were taken to the foyer. In the foyer we were greeted with two men playing a welcoming song on the Balinese instruments. So straight away we felt like we were in a very magical resort with out even seeing the whole of the resort. With the music playing we proceeded towards the reception. The young lady showed us our seats and we were given a nice cold pineapple and coconut drink served in an actual pineapple with ice and a cold face cloth to cool us down with. All this has happened with out us even checking in yet. Allowing us to drink our drinks and cool down a bit after an eleven hour plane ride the receptionist came and greeted us and checked us in.The staff are very friendly, well spoken and helpful. I had brought with me from home a few electrical appliances, camera, video camera cell phones etc... and the first adapter that was given to me didn't seem to work properly, so I rang the reception and he had a gentelman come to our room to see if he could help me out. He couldn't succeed so he rang an electrician. The electrician was there in a flash and fixed the problem. The staff there go that extra mile to please the customer which made our holiday even better.We stayed in the ocean view room and reading a few of the reviews on this site I feel that the people who say that the rooms are not to their standards must be a very high maintenance type of people and have to remember that you are in Bali, not Hawaii or Rarotonga where the economy there is higher than Bali. You can't tell me you went there because of the sun and surf, you went there because Bali is an affordable island we you get more than your monies worth.The Bali Hyatt is a very beautiful resort to stay at, and my partner and I are already planning a re-visit back there.Cheers guys,Me.
