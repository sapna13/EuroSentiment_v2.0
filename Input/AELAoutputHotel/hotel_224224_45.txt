{"text":"Has spoiled me such that I have trouble staying in other hotels. I have stayed here during most of my visits to NYC since moving away from NYC in '04. I am a native of Brooklyn but have lived in Manhattan for 15 years prior to having to move to the midwest. I return as often as possible. Quite simply, I cannot stay in other hotels. My work takes me to other cities and despite trying to find the 1st choice or best hotel, I am always disappointed. The staff at Ritz-Carlton CPS is dedicated, responsible, courteous and attempt to anticipate needs often very successfully.The rooms are spacious (I always stay in Park View), well appointed, in outstanding condition and spotlessly clean. They actually do look like the pictures on the website.The food is very good for hotel food and during my most recent stay they were re-doing the restaurant but still served a full menu in the lobby lounge.The security is outstanding with security staff at the entrance and card entry to both the floor and room a guest is assigned to. The location is perfect for tourists and business travelers as it is centrally located and the staff at the door are very helpful in getting taxi's even at difficult times for catching a cab in NYC. Also, public transportation is nearby.The tea service is wonderful and I adore the clotted creme. A long time ago I developed a habit of requiring heaps of clotted creme whenever I have a creme tea. Something the Ritz was not initially used to providing but now understands what I mean by heaps. The server's for the most part do an excellent job hiding their surprise regarding how much clotted creme one can get on a scone. But they accommodate me and remember from visit to visit my special request for heaps.The spa is so peaceful and clean and relaxing. The services are very good. The staff is soothing. And Rachel. She is the most nurturing person I have ever met in a spa and I am a spa junkie. She is like a dotting mother while you are with her and she gives the best pedicure in the whole world. Plus advice not to let anyone else clip your toe nails because she knows no one can do them as well as she can and she is right. Don't miss it. I had to miss her once when she was out ill after she had a fall on the subway but really all I cared about was her well being and not because of the pedicure. She just brings out good will in others. Which again speaks to the special staff at Ritz Carlton CPS. Her pedicure, alas, will also spoil you for any other pedicure because hers is the absolute best.Check-in and out is a breeze. I have never had problems. Special room requests have been met whenever possible and when they weren't the staff tried to make it up for it in some manner.The concierge staff will do anything possible for you. And no matter what celebrity is staying there (and there is usually some celebrity) you will only know it if you happen to see the celebrity entering or exiting or if there is a crowd outside the hotel waiting for a glimpse. But everyone is treated like a celebrity or more accurately all guests are treated the same. I always feel pampered beyond belief. The staff make me feel special. However, I am impressed that they do treat everyone alike.Room service is adequate. The food is good and really the only problem is that the food is luke warm by the time it gets served. But the presentation is lovely and they do not make mistakes with the order. The tray or table is collected within minutes of calling them. I have never seen a tray just set outside any guest room waiting to be picked up.Most importantly, I was concerned that in the few years I have been staying at this hotel things would change now that Marriott is the owner. However, not a thing has changed and I hope that Marriott continues to attract the outstanding staff at the Ritz Carlton CPS. Marriott is lucky to have the dedicated professionals they have attracted. It is truly a special hotel. A destination in and of itself in a city with plenty of competition for destinations.
