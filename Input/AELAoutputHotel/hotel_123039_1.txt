{"text":"Not the best, in fact the least hotel of our trip When we arrived we parked our car in front of the hotel to unload our luggage. I went inside to get a luggage cart, and saw two bellboys very busy talking to each other. They didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ offer any assistance until we were inside. And then we refused of course. At check-in we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get an upgrade for being Diamond HHonors members, slightly disappointing. They also didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ put us on the highest level. Our suite had two rooms, not very spacious, but still in reasonable order. There was a living area with sofa, easy chair, side table and working desk with chair, also a unit with refrigerator and microwave. The bathroom was very small, but it was clean and the sink was outside. The sleeping room had a good quality King bed. Here we had a window with a nice view on a park.The business center is an open area next to the sandwich shop. There were three computers, I had to wait several times, they were mostly in use as it was busy in the hotel. The swimming pool is inside and looks very old. Unfortunately there is no patio outside or whatever. The weather was sunny and I went to the park, just next to the hotel. There I could find nice seating to relax and read my book. There is a large Mall on walking distance and also a Target very close by. In the evening we had dinner in the restaurant and after that we were very sorry that we did. There were two waiters, acting very popular and making silly old jokes, so we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel comfortable and taken seriously or treated as welcoming guests. For instance, when we walked in, the restaurant was empty (except for one table) and when we wanted to sit down, a waiter came and told us: No, no, no, this table is reserved!!! Just after a minute or so, he continued: Yes, this table is specially reserved for you√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®√î??\u201A√á¬®√î??\u201A√á¬®√î??\u201A√á¬®?. and the whole evening was a continuation of these sick phrases. The food wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ of high quality either.The breakfast the next morning was even worse. It looked all very cheap, not much variety and all the hot items were far to fat. Although the hotel is not to blame for the standards of their guests, we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like it that many people came crisscross to the restaurant area on their way from and to the elevators. There were one or more groups who had their breakfast in the conference center; many people packed their items to bring it back to their room, they all went through the restaurant. We even saw people still in their pajamas, wearing a coat over it. So, in de end we regret choosing this hotel for our last night before our departure from Seattle airport. The rooms are slightly outdated, but further okay, for the rest there is much to be desired.
