{"text":"What a nice surprise! Would stay again... I was very surprised of the value and quality of this hotel for a regular room. For the same price elsewhere, for example in or near Hollywood, I would have not been able to get such a nice and quiet room. I would stay at this hotel again.Good:+Quiet and clean room+Reasonably priced+Room is great for singles, couples, etc+Wireless+Nice white duvet with down comforter+Subway station: 4.5 blocks to Civic Center Subway Station (can get to Hollywood\/Universal in 20mins)+Close to financial district√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√âan walk or take modern city shuttles for 25 cents+Unique area-Little Tokyo+Coffee shop within 1.5 blocks-Starbucks (at New Otani Hotel)+Japanese supermarkets nearby offering snacks, bottled water, alcohol and other foods+Staff were friendly and helpful+Nice lobby and corridors+Airport Flyaway Bus to\/from Union Station for $3 (Union is one stop from Civic Center Station or you can walk from the hotel in approx. 15 minutes. There is also a metro bus that can be taken close to the hotel that goes to Union station for $1.25)Poor:-Shower was not of hotel standard, although the rest of the washroom was fine. Later I didn't worry much about the shower-wasn't such a big problem.-Lack of restaurants except for Japanese ( but this is understandable for the area being Little Tokyo. Some of these restaurants were only so-so.Other notes:Some travelers mentioned about the homeless in the area. I did see about 4 a day walking by but they kept to themselves. Basically, the area is not that bad at all but I imagine the further east you go, for example East 4th street and San Pedro, it may be a different story yet there is really no need to go to that area. The funny thing is even in Beverly Hills I saw a homeless man, so go figure.Also, I read from others that the beds are very firm. The truth is that they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e a little on the firm side but not as much as one would think by reading these posts. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ definitely true for your back to sleep on more of a firm bed than an overly soft one. And, I actually did sleep very well. No problems at all with this.
