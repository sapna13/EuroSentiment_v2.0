{"text":"good little hotel My 13 year old daughter and I stayed here for 5 days in August. We had a deluxe twin room on the top floor (502). Good size room for Paris. Our toilet was in a separate little room (like a very small closet) and therest of the washroom was across the room. Odd and a little inconvenient (ie hand washing) but no problem. No shower curtain and water pressure was very poor in shower.Good points: location- was great, very close to RER B if coming in from Gare du Nord (Eurostar) or CDG- very easy even with luggage- no more than 5 mins easy walk with luggage. Also metro line 4 and line 10 very near and some main bus routes-lots of restaurants and cafes-Starbucks and Haagan Das ice cream cafe-staff was friendly and helpful except they failed to pass along a phone message to me (no voice mail)-internet available in basement lounge area for I think 8 euros per hour (we used it for about 15 mins but they said no charge!)rooms clean, smallish flat screen tv with BBC and CNNRoom was probably about 12 feet by 15 feet, (not counting bathroom area), and we were told we had one of the largest rooms. We saw a couple of other rooms and they looked very very small. This room defeintely had enough room to have 2 twin beds, table, and floor area for luggage, and you could still walk by.air conditioning worked well, and the large windows opened to a very quiet back street.No real negatives but I would note the following:1. breakfast is 14 euros\/person- very expensive2. in our room when it rained (as it did 3 days of our trip), there was a very very annoying dripping sound onto the roof above our room- so loud it would wake you in the middle of the night, as it did both my daughter and i.3. shower was poor water pressure, and no shower doorOverall I would likely stay again but get a deluxe room if you can.
