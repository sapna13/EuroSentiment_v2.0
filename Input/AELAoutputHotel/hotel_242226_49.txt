{"text":"Good not Great My husband and I stayed here for the week of my wedding, we were being married in nearby Rincon. We had almost 20 guestst coming in and felt it would be nice to book everyone in the same hotel. Upon seeing the pictures of the hotel on their website, we felt this place was a better choice than some of the other options available in Rincon. Here is what I didn't like about it: 1. location, sooo far from everything, it took almost 20 minutes to drive into the town where all the restaurants and surfing beaches are 2. a lot of kids. 3. as i mentioned earlier, it is far from restaurants you'd actually want to eat at, and their restaurant and bar closed way too early! 4. gift shop was constantly closed and the kayak rental guy left too earlyThings I liked: 1. nice hotel, simple and definetely not a 4 star, but a good solid 3 star 2. Free Parking and lots of it 3. friendly staff and were all bilingual 4. nice clean pool and neat pool bar 5. beach was semi-private and basically had it all to ourselves. 6. Delicious breakfast, order the omelet with everything, yum! :) Buffet was ok in a pinch too. Rincon is a neat little town with some great restaurants and great surfing beaches. If I were to go back in the near future I would opt for a rental house rather than this hotel. This hotel is great for families with small children. It worked for what we needed it for but had it been just my husband and I, i would not stay here again. Only because of how far it was to everything we enjoyed most about Rincon.
