{"text":"Cool hotel My wife and I stayed here, along with two friends, for a 5 night break. On arrival (only 35 euros and 20 minutes in a taxi..if that), we were impressed by the exterior of the hotel and the quiet but accessible location. The reception staff were friendly on arrival - we asked if we could have our rooms closer together and they upgraded us to deluxe rooms to make this possible, which was a nice bonus!Deluxe rooms are not exactly plush however. The room we were in had a split level, with the bed upstairs and (steep wooden) steps leading up to it. Downstairs had two leather armchairs, small table, the shower-room and a seperate toilet (handy in the mornings!).Our breakfast wasn't included but we opted out of buying any at the hotel - at 16 euros each, it was far too expensive. The restaurant looked really lovely but we didn't eat there at all....rather be out and about in the Dam! The hotel is situated fairly close to the centre - we walked it in about 35 minutes but, after that, opted from the tram as the stop was nearby and had a regular service. The fare one way is 1.60 euro, but you can buy strips of tickets which save you money.The only problem with our room was the steps leading to the mezanine level - they were steep and made of polished wood. My wife slipped on these slippery steps and injured her back, meaning she has been signed off work for weeks....Our last night was a Friday and their club (ToNight) was open - the bar and club seemed very popular and there was inevitable noise, well into the night. Not from the club but people drunkenly coming and going. We weren't bothered by this but some might be...Overall, a very cool hotel, extremely beautiful and friendly place in a good location. Will stay again!
