{"text":"Decent Waikiki Hotel Our stay at the Marriott Waikiki Beach Resort was my first stay in Waikiki, but my wife's second. We had read up on all the lodging choices both in our Oahu Revealed guidebook by Andrew Doughty (reccommended!) and here on TripAdvisor and were prepared for high prices and tired-looking rooms. We decided to try this property both based on the reviews here and because we've had good experiences at other Marriott locations.This hotel was, in comparison to our expectations and my wife's previous Waikiki stay, a bit better than we expected. There were several postive aspects and a few negatives, but overall we would choose this location again when staying in Waikiki.Most of the positives have already been mentioned, so I'll just sum up: very comfortable beds, nicely-appointed rooms, nice ocean views, plentiful bathroom amenities, very good location, great housekeeping, an ABC store right in the hotel, decently-sized lanai with two chairs and a small table, etc. We had a one king room in the K Tower on the 9th floor and a partial-ocean view (although it was a very nice view). The hotel staff we encountered were always nice and friendly.The two main negatives (although you ARE in Hawaii, so things like these should bug you less) were the parking situation and the elevators. While some come to Waikiki to lay out on the beach the whole time, my wife and I like to experience the area. So we did rent a car during our stay and paid the $18\/night for parking. I can understand the price, but almost every day the structure was full because the hotel allows restaurant patrons and others to also use the structure. When full, the hotel directs you to either use the valet parking service or some other offsite parking location. If you don't plan on renting a car, this would be a moot point. The other negative was the elevators in the K Tower, which sometimes took forever to arrive. We were on the 9th floor (a little to far to hoof it on the stairs... with an 8-month old child in a stroller) and we could hear elevators by the dozens flying by while we sometimes waited 5-8 minutes for one to stop for us.In all, though, we felt that for the price, we did get a reasonable value and what negatives we did find were offset by the fact that we were in Hawaii in February. We're already thinking of returning in the next couple years and the Waikiki Beach Marriott will be on our short list next time as well.
