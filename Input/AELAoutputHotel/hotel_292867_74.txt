{"text":"not worth the money, stay away I stayed with my family at Caribe Club Princess first week of December of 2007. I traveled with my husband (we are both 28), our 3 year old son and a couple in their 40s. We were tight on the budget and were not planning a vacation last year, however when I saw the Carible Club Princess deal I jumped on it with no hesitation. We arrived at the hotel from the airport few minutes after noon and were told that the room will be rady at 3:00. We decided to grab something to drink, I ordered pinacoladas and mohitos at the lobby bar, they were the worst drinks I have ever tasted. Both drinks were not made with fresh fuits and mint, but some artificial green syrup. Finally at three we went to get our room key, we were supposed to pick it up at the entranceto one of the hotel buildings. It took us 20 minutes in line, were all we were breathing was sewer, it was discusting.Our room was ok, nothing special, just a standard hotel room, bathroom was ok too. There was iron, hair dryer and remote control in the room. If you want to use the safe, you need to ask for a key at the front desk during check-in, and they are going to charge you around $25 during your check out. food: we went to two specialty restaurants, chinese and italian. Italian was good, the desert was delicious!, the chinese however, was really bad, but the desert was excellent if you like fried ice cream, if yougo there for the food you will be really disappointed, if you like fried ice cream then I recommend it highly. After these two we decided to try the main buffet for dinner and it was not bad at all. The food was exactly the same as at the specialty restaurants becasue they have a different theeme night every day, one day its mexican food, then italian, chinese and so on. There was something for everybody, the desers were good also.Drinks and Bars: bad, bad, bad no matter how much you tip. they might give you more alcohol but the way they mix the drinks is horrible. Pinacolatas were bad, mohitos, mamahuanas, miami vice, cosmo, dirty monkey, it did not matter what you ordered, I asked them for a slumer after everything else failed, they did not even know what it was ?! so if you are a drinker bring your own alcohol or stay awayEntertainment: bad, unprofessional, silly shows. The evening entertainment at the theater was not good. Very amateur, bed costumes, bad jokes , bad music. I love to attend these evening events and this was the first hotel that I did not like and first hotel that did not have a Michale Jackson showService: service was ok, rooms were cleaned nicely, the towels were always there, the waiteres were quick to clean up the table and every one was very friendly and nice, easpecially to the kids, I liked thatresort area and beach : beach was nice, huge waves, maybe it was just the season, we were always able to find a beach chair.Towels, however, was a problem, if you did not get them first thing in the morning, then you had to wait until 12 for the secod batch. There are few pools in the resort area, all vere nice, water was warm and clean ( except for the swim up bar).Overall I do nto recommend this hotel. We have traveled to PuntaCana twice before and stayed at the riu resorts, which were excellent. We have never stayed at a 5 star hotel. Riu Cancun in Mexico was the best hotel we ever styed in, so we are not not picky when it comess to accomodations or food, we try to travel on a budget, but if somebody was offering me to stay at this resort again for free, I would not go.
