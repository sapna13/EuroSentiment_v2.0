{"text":"Excellent holiday stayed at this resort nov 1-15,the complex is beautiful nice rooms and staff very friendly.we left a couple of dollars every day for the cleaner and she made sure the fridge was stock up and water . Always a good selection of meals to choose from. The beach with its soft white sands and palm trees are to die for. The weather was great apart from 2 days of rain but,still hot. Entertainment could do with improvement but by 10 pm we were ready for bed.The casino is small and beware the smell of cigarettes hits you as you walk through the door.CONSTRUCTION they are in the process of building a new hotel right next door to this one which will be a iberostar 5+ so expect noise for the next few years,we did not here much noise as they only started as we were about leave.Saona island a must ,fantastic day out and something you will always remember on this holiday.Remember to bring a clock because i could not find one anywhere,it may be a poor country but all the staff carry a cell phone?The only disapointment with this holiday is a 9 hour flight but we beleave it was worth it.We will visit this resort again once work has finished .This hotel is still one of the best and i did take the time to visit some hotels along the beach which i was not impressed with and so,if you can put up with a little noise i am sure you wont be disapointed.
