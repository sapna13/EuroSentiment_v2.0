{"text":"Great Midweek break My wife and I had a great Midweek stay at the Pullman Bercy at the begining of August. We were looking for somewhere comfortable just for one night before catching a train to Venice the following evening.The hotel is easy to get to from the Metro (about 5 mins walk) and being one of the newer lines were able to use escalators to get to street level rather than dragging heavy cases up steps. The hotel was conveniently situated close to the attractions of Bercy Village, a pedestrianised block or two of resturants and niche shops. We didn't try any of the local resturants but they seemed to be popular with the locals although they did look a little on the pricey side. Because we only had about 36 hours in the city we didn't spend much time in the area but headed off to the main attractions nearer the centre of the city. Some people mentioned the hotel as being a bit remote but we found that even watching the lights get switched on on the Eiffel Tower at 10 o'clock from the Trocadero we managed to be back at the hotel within 35 minutes. The hotel was very comfortable, the staff friendly and helpful and were happy for us to leave our bags for a few hours after checking out so that we didn't have to drag them round Paris before catching the train in the evening. We also didn't have breakfast. We too throught the E27 price charge was a bit steep but looking around Bercy Village a bit later most places were around the same price for breakfast. On the whole I would go back, certainly mid-week because we got a good rate, and would recommend it for a night or two.
