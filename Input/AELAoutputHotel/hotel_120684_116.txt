{"text":"A Good Experience I just returned earlier this week from a 10 day stay at the Outrigger on the Beach. Traveled with my 7 and 9 year old daughters and wife. We were in a city view room but had a fair view of the ocean...could even watch surfers and sailing going on from our room. Our experience was a very good one. The hotel staff was very professional and prompt. The hotel was very clean, and we enjoyed the tropical motif. The room was plenty large, two double beds, a couch, desk, etc. Restaurants were very good. Housekeeping was excellent. Loved Dukes. The little Sandwhich corner which they rent out has great sandwhiches and the kids loved the peanut butter and banana sandwhich. Another interesting surprise was the general shop in the hotel was actually cheaper price then the ABC stores down the street, we thought that was unusual for being in a hotel. Pool and Beach staff were professional and helpful. I took a surfing lesson from one of the vendors in front of the hotel and it was well taught and enjoyed.Our only comments on an improvement would (1) the room's beds (1009) were in real need of being changed out. They were pretty springy and soft. (2) It would be great if there were some tables outside on the deck during the day to use for work, kids doing homework, etc. Dukes is too busy to use for that purpose and our only alternative was to return to our room to do so.A comment for Outrigger Management if they review. I'd highly encourage you to join with other hoteliers in the area to push the city to reduce the Kalakalua Street entertainers who I bet don't even have permits to operate. We could hear the street musicians until fairly late at night (the drummer was particularly annoying).In general, we had a great experience. One of the best hotels we've stayed at in our travels and by far the best hotel we've stayed at in Hawaii (8 trips).
