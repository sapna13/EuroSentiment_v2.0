{"text":"brilliant stayed in the Westin for 5 nights in October, what a brilliant hotel!! we were met upon arrival and bags were taken from us. we were whisked to reception to check in. as it was 7am the room would not be available to a few hours. the receptionist took my mobile phone number and said she would call when the room was available and sure enough at 10am i got the phonecall.when i arrived in the room the bags were already there. the room was gorgeous! very big with a huge bed which was so comfy that everytime i sat on it i nearly fell asleep!! the bathroom was just as good with a huge shower and a rainforest showerhead too! (i struggled to get the rainforest showerhead to work but reception staff were very helpful) the bath was big enough for tow people and had a huge glass window looking out into the room. great if you were with a partner and were happy to be seen in the bath but if not there was an electronic blind that came down. the room was cleaned every day and the shampoos etc replaced every day. there was even free bottled water and ice every evening!staff were very helpful and polite. i did not eat in the hotel but the prices were quite high. a little tip, if you go down the stairs in reception there are a vast array of restaurants and bars that serve lunch. (i did not spot them until the final day and it looked very busy but i cannot comment on prices or quality of food). great location 10 min walk from harbour, 5 minutes to the right of the hotel was a huge food court with great choices of food at great prices!! also brilliant shops within 10 mins walking distance! i would def recommend this hotel to people and would def go back! worth the money i paid to stay there!
