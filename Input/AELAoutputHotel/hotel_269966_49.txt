{"text":"Nearly superb, 2 minor gripes Luxembourg Parc is well worthy of it's no. 1 rating on tripadvisor, the hotel is a beautiful, friendly, intimate gem in a superb location with shops, bars, restaurants and the fantastic Paris metro all within walking distance. The rooms are brilliant, tastefully decorated with a bright, clean bathrooms - only minor gripes and certainly this is something the hotel can't help, is that our room was on the narrow cobbled street down the side of the hotel, directly opposite a small Kiwi restaurant, no trouble with the restaurant itself, it's just that with the new smoking ban which seems to be sweeping across Europe, people now congregate outside of bars, hotels, restaurants etc to have a sly fag - and of course have a chat whilst having a few puffs. Perhaps because the street itself was so narrow and quiet the chat and laughter tended to echo and kept us awake for a couple of the nights until gone one in the morning - like I said, not a fault of the hotel but an unforeseen side effect of the smoke ban I guess.The only other gripe, and again, not serious, as to be honest didn't expect much more from a European hotel, is the average breakfast - it's not cheap so would expect a bit more than the bog standard euro breakfast of rolls, pastries, cold meats and cheese - ok there was fruit salad and yogurts but that's about it, you have to pay extra again for eggs of any sort - and to be honest the service wasn't brilliant as one morning there was no meats and cheese left which was no big deal as I didn't want any, but on the second day I had to ask for fruit salad as that wasn't available either - can't say the service was with a smile either - but then again it's Paris and if you don't get one or two Gallic shrugs and looks of disdain you're not experiencing the real Paris!What really ticks all the boxes though for this hotel has got to be the location, can't think of any where else in Paris which has so many great bars and restaurants on its doorstep - we travelled outside of the area for a couple of meals on the evenings (one to the Eiffel tower) and to be honest, wish we hadn't, as everything you could possibly want for a great night out is within walking distance - Latin Quarter, St Germain and Luxembourg Parc all mingle into one trendy area. It's also a doddle to get to the hotel from Charles de Gaulle airport - line B of the REF network takes about 45 minutes and deliveries you within a 10 minute walk of the hotel for just over 8 euros - and talk about regular, I think there were about 3 in a half hour period, and that was a Sunday - First Great Western (a poor excuse for a rail network in the UK) eat your heart out! Likewise there are 4 metro stations all within walking distance which will take you all over Paris for a fraction of the cost of City travel in the UK, again incredibly fast, safe and clean - makes the London underground look like it was built in the dark ages.
