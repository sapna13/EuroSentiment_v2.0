{"text":"Absolutely Loved the Excellence! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Excellence Punta Cana from 2\/8 to 2\/15 and had a wonderful time. We had friends coming in on that Sunday and they too had a great time, wished they could have stayed longer. I will say the ride to the resort was horrible, very scary, saw my life flash before my eyes a couple times, it was an hour and a half...BUT, once we got to the resort all the stresses from traveling faded away. We were greeted w\/a wet towel, and wonderful people. The resort is amazing. We stayed at the Club which was great, they gave us champagne while we checked in with the private concierge, there was a lobby with internet accessibility and food which was fabulous. The food was good. I loved breakfast at the buffet, you could make your own omelet. The Asian restuarant was our favorite and our friends raved about the French restaurant. Room service was great! You could call at anytime of night and get something, they were soo nice. I loved the pizza. The beach was a little rough, I didn't go in past my knees because it was too rough for me, but that didn't stop other people. My boyfriend asked me to marry him the very first night on the beach laying on a hammock...it was magical. We did dinner one night on the beach, it was very windy, romantic, but very windy. The pool was beautiful too. All the fruit hits you after a bit, bring some tums, you'll need it. Overall, we loved it. Definitely would go back even with the rough ride to the airport.
