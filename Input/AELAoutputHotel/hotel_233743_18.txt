{"text":"Lovely and fantastically located We had a wonderful time at the Residence Bassano. We stayed there for three nights including New Year's Eve and found it perfectly located for Paris sightseeing. The Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees about five minutes' walk away. The hotel was quiet, and our room, though modestly sized was beautifully appointed with chic French provincial furnishings. The bathroom was big and lavish with L'Occitaine toiletries and fluffy towels. There was also a PC behind the lobby with free 9medium speed) internet for guests which was handy for booking onward arrangements.Reception was quiet and unassuming; we had no outrageous requests but they were cordial and helped us book a couple of tours. Breakfast was not included in the price so we only ate in the hotel one morning - it was plentiful and well-prepared, if a little expensive. There were a couple of good restaurants nearby. As swish an area as Bassano is in, (and let's face it, as lovely as Paris is) I do NOT recommend Paris for New Year's Eve. Reception warned us against gathering at the Eiffel Tower at midnight because of crime and 'hooliganism.' Set menu dinners at any of the nearby restaurants was over 200 euros a head. We ended up staying in and toasting 07 with Champagne and ice cream and were awoken after 2am by drunk revellers, and the sound of breaking glass on the streets outside. On New Year's morning, there were broken liquor bottles and more than a few pools of vomit on the footpaths around the hotel, in addition to the requisite piles of dog poo. A real shame, given how beautiful the city is and how important tourism is to the Parisians that they don't make more of an effort to keep it clean. Nonetheless, the hotel was very pleasant and comfortable, and I would recommend it, especially for couples. I do not agree with the assessment that it's good for families with kids - it's pretty elegantly furnished, quiet, lots of light-coloured soft furnishings, and doesn't lend itself very well to a lot of noise and activity.
