{"text":"Great Accommodation with a reasonable price I went to Hong Kong to see a friend who was there for a study abroad program. I stayed a week and I must say this place is such a great place to stay. Room and bathroom were small but that's ok. There was a TV with 2 english channels on it, the beds were nice, and the place as a whole made up for it greatly. There was excellent service at the front desk and they made it so easy for me with the english they spoke very well. Shuttle was always on time and the maid tidied up the room every day. Bellman will push the elevator button for you and direct you out to the shuttle bus when it arrived. If I had any shopping, direction, or nightlife question they were always helpful by pulling out a map and pointing out all they knew (which was alot).They called taxis for me (one time the guest service guy went all the way up the road just to flag one down for me)! I was so very pleased with my stay and would stay there over and over again. Be careful, though, It's in Olympic City which is not an area where many other westerners stay. The place is still VERY safe, and was never in any worry that anything would be stolen. I was pretty much the only westerner at the hotel. But a 5 min. shuttle ride will get you to an MTR metro station which will open the doors to anywhere you want to go in Kowloon or Hong Kong Island. It's SUPER cheap! So are the taxis, but more expensive than the MTR.On the food end, there is a McDonalds just down the road, but who wants to go there? When you're in HK, do as the HKese do and eat at a local restaurant. There is a place very close by, to the left of the 7eleven I always called the Hot Pot place because it's real name was written in chinese, but it had THE best food from Vietnames, Chinese, and Indian you could get it there. Plus the bakery shops are also another thing to die for. I kept getting the raisin bread twists that were always sold there.Nightlife...not in Olympic City or the surrounding area. Take the MTR to TST (in Kowloon) or Central station (on HK island) and enjoy the nightlife there, it'll only cost you about $2 US to get you there and it's quick. Only trouble I had here was getting back. The MTR closes at 12:30am and to get back after that time you had to take a taxi. I was either in TST or on HK Island so to get back to my hotel it usually ran me between $4.50 US and $15 US depending on just how far away I was from my hotel.I would definitely stay here again without a hesitation.
