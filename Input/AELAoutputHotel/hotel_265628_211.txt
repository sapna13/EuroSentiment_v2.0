{"text":"An excellent value hotel I feel compelled to write something on this site after my stay due to having read some very mixed reviews about this hotel.The hotel probably isn't 5 star by our standards (more like a 3.5 *) but if it had been I'm sure I would have paid at least twice the amount. The hotel is a little dated in some places but they were doing some small renovations whilst we were there (around the pool side bar and blocks of apartments).The hotel and grounds were always constantly being cleaned \/ attented to. Had we had some of the complaints that people had mentioned on here, we would have definately asked to be moved - but gladly no need to because our room was fine.A couple of gripes were that as it seemed to be a failrly quiet time, a few bars were closed and sometimes in the evening they had some people selling necklaces and cigars that were far too pushy to get you to buy stuff.The day entertainment was great with loads to do, evening entertainment was ok with mainly dance shows (really great dancers - especially the guys). There's a club on site but you do have to pay for drinks in there.Here are a few tips for you if you're thinking of going:- take plenty of mosquito repellant - take plenty of suncream toiletries etc - there is an on site shop but is very expensive (it cost us √ä√£¬¢7 for indigestion tablets).- tip staff where possible as this is a very poor country- take care when using the cash machine - there is a scam going on where you put your card in and it seems to disappear then a guy appears and point to a stuck on sign telling you, you need to key in your card number 3 times.- take care if going on quad bikes - 2 people came off on our trip and also children will try and run along side you and for money (very dangerous) - don't give children money as you will be swarmed by them and the Domincan people ask you not to as it encourages their children to become beggars- take the trip to Saona beach, safari tour and acquatic tour Finally, if you go here expecting to be able to roam around with a promenade and large shopping centre in walking distance - you will be disappointed. But great for those who don't mind staying within a complex.LeanneManchester ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1068,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1064}]}
