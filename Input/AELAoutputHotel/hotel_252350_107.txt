{"text":"Pouring Rain - Great Hotel I stayed one night at the Watertown for a meeting at UW. Not sure where to start. The flight was terrible, weather wet, and meeting mediocre. The hotel was perfect.First, I drove into the secure underground parking lot - dry and out of the wind. Perfect.Next, upon checking in I was given a flight of wine at the hotel's lovely lounge. They also had a nice bowl of fresh, hot, organic and local soup with bread. Finished with warmed cookies. And a pick of a very nice local wine for a great price. Perfect.The room was simple with some nice touches. First they gave me the book lovers cart (free) with lots of fun books to read. When I come back with my baby, we'll get the art cart or kids cart (or both!). Coffee, tea and popcorn (unlike chains, they don't charge you $10 to touch the stuff, it's included). Filtered water, nice bathroom and a sink with drawers. Perfect.The rooms were business traveler AND kid friendly. Very bright and airy. Windows opened in a kid-safe manner, room was spacious, and my view was of the UW campus and bay.Lastly, they accommodated me by letting me keep my car in the garage rather than making me go find parking on campus after I checked out. They also gave me a nifty map with my room key. Staff were friendly locals who made sure everything I needed was available to me.I've been staying at Hyatts, W, Omni hotels for a month on travel and this one seemed to be the perfect blend of just what I needed without the fuss (and added expenses) of other hotels.I will absolutely return this summer with my family and next year for my annual meeting at UW.
