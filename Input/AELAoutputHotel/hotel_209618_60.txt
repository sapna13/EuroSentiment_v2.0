{"text":"Great Value The resort is a great place, especially when you take into account what you get for your money! The rooms are great spacious suites for the great price. The pool area is great and real close to a good, not great, beach area. The beach is not as small as other reviews stated. The golf course has a great layout with the back nine being much better than the front. My only comnplaint was they had an outing one day and would not let any guests go out! Saturday morning is very busy and I could not get a tee time early even though when I called from home they said the course would be empty and to just walk on. The course is also over priced, but I guess not for an island resort course. The resaurants at the resort did not look that great (although we did not opt to eat at them), but we got great reviews of other places from tripadvisor's other reviews and loved El Ladrillo and El Marinos. We got a recommendation about a place Alberto's and found it to be average at best. But the other two places were great. The breakfast was awesome. Some people criticized it, I don't know why. They cooked hot omelets or eggs, fresh pancakes and had waitresses asking if you needed anything - just ask for them to reheat your food and it was done. Fresh fruit, cereal, bagels, pasties, french toast, etc... I figure about a $40 value for free. Also the cocktail two hours was great - free cocktails (everything but frozen drinks). Really a nice deal to get a few drinks before dinner and keep from spending another $40 a night at dinner on drinks. We would definitely go back, especially with our yound kids. This time was a nice romantic getaway.
