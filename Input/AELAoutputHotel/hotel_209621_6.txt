{"text":"Stressful Stay My husband and I stayed at the Normandie from Oct. 28 through Nov. 3rd. We immediately noticed that the hotel was a bit run down, dirty carpets, furniture outdated and the refrigerator was not working properly. The room had an adjourning door to another room and later on in the evening the guest of that room had the television blaring We phoned the front desk to ask if security would at least come upstairs and ask that the television be lowered and to our amazement, nothing was done. Our first sleepless night in the Normandie. Early next morning, my husband requested that we be moved and a clerk behind the counter told us that that would be no problem. We are given new keys and we found ourselves changing to second room around midnight that evening. The following evening (Oct. 31) while getting ready to meet friends for dinner, a booming sound of a what appears to be a disco is over our new room. My husband goes downstairs and discovers that we have been moved to a room right underneath a party room. My husband very upset by now, so much so that I feared that he would get ill, goes down to the lobby and demands to know why if he requested a quiet room the night before, the clerk deliberately placed him in a room under the hotel disco. We were then moved a third time and this time it was to the smoking floor, needlessness to say that I am asthmatic. We spent the rest of our stay comint in the evening to sleep and leaving a window open for ventilation. We are looking into disputing the charges for our stay at this hotel. It is apparent that this hotel is mismanaged. Stay as far away from this hotel unless your idea of a fun time is moving from room to room within the hotel. Your vacation most definitely will be ruined if you stay at the Normandie. ","annotations":[]}
