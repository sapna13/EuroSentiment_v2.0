{"text":"5 Stars for location and service, 4 stars for room We booked a 3 night stay at the Hollywood Renaissance after reading tripadvisor. Tips from previous reviews on this website allowed me to get an unbelievable rate using a promo code, and info on 'club level access'. Shortly after I booked online, I received an email from Marriott confirming my reservation and asked for any additional requests. I then requested 2 double beds, a fridge, extra pillows, a room on the highest possible floor with a view of the Hollywood sign, and club level access for an additional $30\/night. We arrived on Sunday afternoon at 2pm. Upon arrival, the doormen\/valets eagerly helped us with our luggage and led us to the registration desk. The desk informed us that we did get a room on the 19th floor w\/ a view of the Hollywood sign, but it would not be ready for another hour. They gladly stored our luggage and gave us information on the shopping complex next door. The HollywoodHighland complex is pure fun for first time visitors to Hollywood -- Walk of Fame, the El Capitan, street vendors, Batman\/Wonder Woman\/Capt Jack Sparrow and other characters all at your doorstep -- made our 1 hour wait quite entertaining.While the hotel lobby and public areas are furnished in modern leather furniture which can be found in any department store, I was truly disappointed by the room itself. The brightly upholstered furniture and bed covers screamed cheap 10-year old Ikea and the moveable desk straight out of Staples. Also, while the pictures on the website showed floor-to-ceiling windows, our 19th floor windows were large but only half the height. Also, I didn't like that the lights in the room were very bright and your only option for a 'night light' is to prop the bathroom door open. The bathroom was also quite small. This is not what I would expect for a hotel which normally charges over $250\/night (even if I paid much less). However, this is only MY opinion. Our room did have a great view of the Hollywood sign, so I did not complain. My husband and 2 kids didn't mind or notice the furnishings and lighting and found them more than acceptable. The best part of our stay was the club level lounge, which happened to be 2 doors down from our room. My kids and husband found a variety of hors d'oeuvres and drinks served at the lounge shortly after 6pm that evening, and desserts and coffee served until late that night. In the morning, coffee, fresh juices, huge buffet breakfast and several newspapers (LA Times, NY Times, USA Today) were available for us to enjoy while we watched the morning news. Also, bottled water, soda and juices were available for us throughout the day. My kids were in the lounge constantly, and the staff was always friendly and accommodating. It made the hotel feel like home for only an additional $30\/night, which is a fantastic deal for a family of 4 with hungry, growing children.You'll never have to wait long for an elevator at this hotel, as they are very fast. The service we experienced during our stay was stellar -- in addition to everything I already asked for, I called for extra robes and toiletries and received them promptly. There was a computer and printer designated for boarding passes at the concierge desk that we could use for no extra charge. The doormen, staff at the concierge, check-in and especially the club lounge were always very friendly and helpful. We got a great deal at this hotel, and it was great introduction to Los Angeles and Hollywood. I highly recommend the Hollywood Renaissance and look forward to staying there again soon -- especially if they decide to refurnish the rooms.
