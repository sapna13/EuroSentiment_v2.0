{"text":"Excellent hotel, great value for money I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in February 2008 while visiting Tokyo with my boyfriend and his family.We had a wonderful stay here and I cannot think of a single thing I didn't like about this hotel.We paid what seemed to have been a very cheap rate, though whether this is because of the roadworks going on below (which did not affect us at all as we used the overhead walkways) plus being winter, or whether this is their usual rate I am not sure.It is an excellent location- a very short walk to the Ginza and not far from Shimbashi train station (which most\/all subway lines pass through), and Shiodome station is right next door (which has two subway lines). It is in the 25th to 33rd levels of Shiodome tower in a nice business district.The interior is very stylish, not what I expected at all for the price. The lobby is very comfortable and never seemed too full, and drinks aren't too expensive. Staff are very attentive. Rooms have a good view over Tokyo, beds are comfy, there is good lighting, good tea and coffee and minibar supplies, with drinks vending machines tucked away in some hallways. There is free internet next to the lobby and free secure wireless internet.Bathrooms are excellent, and well stocked with everything you could need, even razors and toothbrushes.The rooms are spacious enough (for a hotel room) with good lighting, radio and tv. There is a walkway leading from the 3rd floor of the tower so you don't need to walk to the street, which then blends in with all of the other walkways, so it is easy to get around.We had a wonderful stay here, it was one of the best hotels I've stayed in, and I can't think of anything I didn't like. Admittedly I didn't eat at the restaurant there, so cannot comment on it, but I don't usually see the point of staying in the hotel to eat anyway! It's only a short wlak to the many restaurants at Ginza, and it's a very safe area to walk around in at night.I highly recommend this hotel!
