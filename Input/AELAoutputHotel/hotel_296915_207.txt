{"text":"Centrally Located We originally booked this hotel via Clarion Hotels, but the hotel was sold before we made the trip. The new owners honored our rate without fail. The Hotel Pulitzer is on a side street off Placa Catalunya. The hotel is very clean in the lobby, restaurant, bar, and in the rooms. Although the rooms are small, they are very comfortable. There was a huge closet to store your luggage, many shelves and drawers. You can pack all your clothes away if you're here for a week or more. The bathroom was equally large with a nice large granite sink and the shower has sliding glass door. The door to the bathroom does not open on a hinge, but slides on tracks, which was not obvious (initially). Toiletries are provided such as shampoo\/conditioner, shower gel, razor w\/cream, hand lotion, comb, toothbrush, robes, disposable flipflops, shoe shiners, and cotton pads for makeup. Way more necessities than most hotels provide. We had a balcony with two door french doors that looked down into the street. The A\/C and heat worked fine and the rooms have a safe and LCD television. The room we had was on the second floor, close to the street so the noise level was louder than normal for most hotels. In Barcelona, trash is picked up at all hours of the night, but with the doors shut and the A\/C on, it was not an issue for us. If you require complete quiet, you should not get a room on the street side or near the bar area. The hotel staff was very helpful with side trip arrangements and getting our taxis. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The internet is available next door at the Hotel Regina for free. There are only two connections, so you might have to wait. The terrace on the top of the hotel was not open due to construction, but we did spend some time up there enjoying some views, but moreso the weather. Lastly, the hotel is centrally located to where all the action is. We walked to all the restaurants we ate at and it is a two minute walk to the Catalunya Metro stop which is one of the hubs of the metro system. Also, very close to Las Ramblas which is one of the main streets in Barcelona. You can't possibly go wrong with this hotel. Hope all this helps in your travels.
