{"text":"Good, but not perfect Location:In Kowloon, but out of the centre near Hung Hom train station and above the Metropolis shopping centre.Annoyingly tricky place to get to, although there is a free shuttle bus to the sister hotel near to Tsim Sha Tsui underground station.Taxi into the centre of HK will cost around HK$100, depending on traffic (which can be very heavy).Room:Had heard bad things about the size of the rooms, but ours (1993) was more than ample for two people, with a generous bathroom and shower.It also provided an excellent view across the harbour, allowing us to watch the famous light show every night at 8pm.Facilities:The outdoor pool is very nice, if somewhat chilly at times.I didn't use the gym but quite a few people were on the running machines at all times of the day.The hotel restaurant served decent food, albeit way more expensive than you will pay nearly anywhere else in HK.The shopping centre connected to the hotel also has a variety of restaurants that are well worth a look.Service:There were always plenty of staff on hand ready to help in any way possible.Overall:My only gripe with the Metropolis Plaza was getting there from the centre of HK.The easiest way is taking the shuttle bus from the Harbour Plaza hotel, but that stops running around 11pm.After that, you will need to take a taxi, or alternatively the 5c bus to Hung Hom station from the Star Ferry terminal and then 7mins walk up through the shopping centre.If I could get a room at the better located Harbour Plaza for a similar price, I would chose that in future.
