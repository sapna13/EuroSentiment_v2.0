{"text":"Perfection in a perfect city I recently stayed at the Hotel Pulitzer from April 30 - May 7th. I chose it originally through reviews on this site and I couldn't have been more pleased. I am a female who traveled to Spain solo and met a friend there, so I chose it first and foremost on its ease of getting there by myself. It's just literally a minute or two walk to the A1 airport bus which is hands down the best way to get back and forth to the airport.The staff at the front desk were very courteous and kind with my limited knowledge of Spanish. There was a tiny mix up in the bed configuration, but they solved it quickly and check-in was a breeze.I had requested a room with a balcony facing the street and I'm happy that I did. It lets in a nice amount of fresh air. We never found a problem with heat or air conditioning - it was always perfect and easy to control.The beds were very comfortable to me, and the linens were super clean and fresh. The bathroom was extremely spacious with nice touches and amenities. The shower was strong and hot water was never a problem. The whole room was very clean and smelled really nice. The design of it was very pretty with the dark colors and artwork and the flat screen on the wall was a plus, although the channels to choose from were not so great. But I didn't go to Spain to watch TV!While a lot of people have said the rooms are small, this is true but I never felt closed in at all. And Barcelona is a city to explore - not one to stay in the hotel room!! But upon return to it, it was a quiet calm haven to rest in. With two of us there, we didn't feel squeezed in at all. There's a spacious closet in which to place your suitcases and hang clothes.I didn't try the room service or the restaurants, as there are a bounty to choose from right outside the door. But I did get ice at the bar and they were happy to provide a bowl of it! I wouldn't hesitate at all to book this hotel again. It's location is far enough off of the Ramblas to be quiet, and close enough to walk two minutes and have your morning coffee there. It really couldn't be situated any better.
