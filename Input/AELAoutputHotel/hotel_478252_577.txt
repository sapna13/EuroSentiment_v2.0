{"text":"Highly recommended - English perspective My husband and I have just arrived back from the Gran Bahia Principe and I wanted to give a review from an English perspective as majority of the reviews are from the US.We booked through airtours, flew with MyTravel - upgraded to club class which I would always recommend on long haul for an extra √ä√£¬¢100pp, priority check in  baggage, larger leather seats, more leg room, free drinks, more food and generally much more comfortable especially for my husband who is very tall. We stayed at the Iberostar in Puerta Plata 4 years ago and there is a large difference between the North and East of the Island - the North is more popular with Brits, has Brit reps, lots of good excursions, the East side is more popular with Americans, Canadians and Spanish speakers, our rep was Canadian and worked for Coco tours who cover 3\/4 different travel agents, less choice of excursions however the beaches in the East are much nicer and more beautiful so depends what you want from your holiday.We stayed in the Bavaro side of the hotel - upon recommendation from a review on here I emailed the hotel in advance to request being near the diamond pool which we were (villa 32) so I would suggest you do this. It means you are half way down the resort so easily placed for both the beach at one end and the buffet  lobby at the other - both a 5 minute walk. Plus we got to use the Diamond pool which is exclusive to those who upgrade - it is quieter than the others, doesnt have music or games etc and beds are always available.Hotel grounds are fantastic, very clean, rooms are excellent - very spacious, clean, nice jacuzzi bath and we had a great view from the balcony of the diamond pool.Food was fantastic, not as much choice as we had at the Iberostar but we preferred this - always chicken, beef, fish, rice, pizza, chips, veg, salad, pasta and every night a theme night so always something to suit everyone. We ate in the Garden Grill, Italian and Mexican and I would highly recommend all 3.Service is fantastic, only problem we had was with the key card to the door not working after a few days but it only took them 1 hour to get somebody to fix it.Most of the workers do speak some degree of English so we never struggled but it does take a few days to understand what the buffet greeter is saying....basically welcoming you and asking how many people.Entertainment is ok - not professional but very good dancers, the circus night and Michael Jackson night are not to be missed.Beach is beautiful and sea very clear - pure paradise. We used to get to the beach at 10am every day and never had trouble getting a bed although parasols were usually taken quite early but that didnt bother us.We took Peso's instead of US Dollars as in the North everything was priced in Peso's but we found here they preferrred Dollars - didnt mind you paying in Peso but all prices were in Dollars so you then had to convert so probably easier to take dollars.I would highly recommend both the resort and the hotel if you want a nice beach holiday with the odd excursion and a 5* hotel, however if you want to do lots of excursions - history of island, swimming with dolphins, visiting  swimming in the waterfall etc I suggest you go to Puerta Plata which is more 'touristy'.
