{"text":"Wanted to stay longer! What a stunning property! I may be biased being an architect but it was certainly a thrill staying in a hotel Frank Lloyd Wright had a hand in.Everything lived up to expectations from the excellent and faultless check-in (helpful, gracious and willing staff) to the delightful, probably recently refurbished room we had in the Paradise Wing. It was very tastefully designed with some good period touches to keep the history and atmosphere alive. The bathroom was totally state of the art with a massive drencher shower head in the shower and quality toilteries from the Bitlmore Spa. The other public areas of the hotel were also beautifully designed and kept and the spirit of the original design was totally intact.We over looked the Paradise pool which was close to being just that! There was no noise, just a refined atmosphere - maybe the time of year?We dined in Wrights which had recently reopened after being smartly refurbished. This was a little disappointing in that the service was slow (but friendly and with a certain charm). The food was actually very good - went it arrived and at the correct temperature. My main course was tepid and was sent back. Must have caused a stir because not only did I get a fresh dish at the right temperature, but it was on the house as were any deserts of our choice. So in the end it turned out fine and they did go out of there way to rectify this shortcoming - could have been a different story.We also did valet parking which was going to be more convenient than self parking and it was and with excellent service. The outstanding reception staff also checked us in on line and printed our bording passes for our flight home the next day. ","annotations":[]}
