{"text":"Perfect Vacation !!! I stayed at the Bahia Principe Bavaro from Sept. 12 to the 19 and I Cannot Believe people could find something wrong with this resort√à√\u2020\u2022?I guess if you REALLY go out of your way to try√à√\u2020\u2022?but nope, I checked and not even if you try!!!It started out as a last minute vacation. Booked on Thursday afternoon and was leaving with Air Transat from Montreal Friday at 12:30√à√\u2020\u2022?could not be more last minute√à√\u2020\u2022?It was a recommendation from my travel agent and he was so right about this hotel!!!After booking, I emailed the hotel to ask for a 3rd floor room. 30 Minutes later, Mrs Laura Vogler, Sales Executive Gran Bah√à√¨√úa Pr√à√¨√úncipe B√ã?¬©varo-Punta Cana-Ambar was writing back!!! I thought, Hmmmm, I might be in for something good!!! And I was wrong√à√\u2020\u2022?It was just GREAT from start to finish!!! Reception was done in a flash with extremely nice and friendly staff, Cirillo took me to my room, again, with so much politeness and diligence in offering as much help possible.What can I say√à√\u2020\u2022?impeccable room and the maid did a great job with a big smile every time I saw her. Food was awesome, buffet had so many choices, fresh fruits, vegetables, salads, many different meals, deserts√à√\u2020\u2022?Again, very friendly staff to help and serve. I went to the 3 a la carte restaurants, Japanese, Grill and Mexican (My favourite) All were beyond good√à√\u2020\u2022?presentation, taste, freshness, service, great company made it perfect!!Beach was very clean, walking a lot on the beach from one end to the other I could compare with other resorts and Bahia Principe has top notch workers!!!Enjoying late dinners, I cannot talk much about the shows, but they had a different one every night and people seemed to enjoy them very much. The pools are beautiful!! I enjoy the beach too much to stay at the pool though but people seemed to be having fun!!!I HIGHLY recommend the Bahia Principe in Punta Cana and will DEFINITIVELY be back next year.Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questionBenoit St-Amand ","annotations":[{"endOffset":877,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":873},{"endOffset":1187,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":1181}]}
