{"text":"Relaxing weekend at the Stellaris We stayed in the hotel as part of a package deal with airfare. We shared the room with another couple. It was definitely a nice place. The beds were incredibly comfortable for a hotel. The rooms were clean, and even though we had a city view our room looked out over a quiet corner of the pool- not bad at all. The hotel had dancing at night in the bar. It was REALLY LOUD (although amazingly, we could not hear it in our room)- too loud to enjoy and dance at, which is too bad because we love salsa dancing. Just like everyone said, the food was super expensive and the drinks too- our first day we had our $13.00 hamburgers with $9.00 pina coladas, and that was enough. The good news is that the area is full of lots of restaurants and there's a Walgreen's down the street. We also found a liquor store and stocked up our own room and backpacks for the beach. The mojito mix was surprisingly decent, and the bottle of Bacardi was a whopping $5!!!The beach was lovely. There were plenty of waves, and a boogie board rental place on the beach next door. (Also, the lady sold DELICIOUS empanaditas for a snack) If you're looking for lapping little waves it isn't the beach for you, but the waves were fun for us to play in. The taxi trip downtown to Old San Juan (15 minutes in traffic) was a different price each time we rode. It ranged from $14 to $20, which we thought was a little pricey- and weird that the price fluctuated.No one goes out or eats there until very late on weekends- don't expect any nightlife until about 12 midnight. Best just find yourself a nice tapas bar and enjoy some sangria or a cafecito while you wait. We never found a restaurant that we didn't like.We took the bioluminescence tour on the east side of the island. It was a long bus ride, but well worth the trip. We heard the rainforest tour was great too, but we didn't have time. For the price, however, I might consider an all inclusive. Puerto Rico is not a cheap vacation.
