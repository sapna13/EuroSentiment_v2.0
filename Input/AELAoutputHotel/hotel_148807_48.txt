{"text":"Copamarina just okay My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in an ocean view room for $285\/nt. The room wasn't anything special, and the lighting is terrible, but it was clean. I agree with a previous review where they stated this is a 3-star trying to be a 5-star. I would definitely not take their all-inclusive (we didn't) as the food is not that good and there are places you can drive to, if you like to search out local restaurants. Most everyone in the area speaks some English - and with our very limited Spanish we never had a problem in this part of PR. We found a breakfast place (panderia) down the hill from here (on the main st in Guanica village area - which is behind McDonald's off Rte 116) and had either fried eggs or an omelet with coffee and toast for about $7 for the two of us, compared to the Copamarina's breakfast buffet for about $40 and their $42 lunch for a sandwich\/soft drink each. If you're squeamish about driving windy, hilly roads, don't go to the Copamarina - it's a very steep, narrow, curvy road for about 3 miles. The beach is full of sea grass - you can wade out to about mid-calf, and then you're in that slimy grass. We did go off the end of the boat pier where there is a ladder into the water, but it's only sandy just at the bottom of the ladder - the sea grass and muck is out there too. We weren't able to go over to Gilligan's Island because of previous storm damage, but they did take us out to another beach around a point via boat for $6 each. The people who went on the diving boat had to be towed back 6-7 mi, so I get the feeling that everything is not taken care of as it should be. I would look for another place before returning to the Copamarina.
