{"text":"Sofitel sooths Stayed here during peak Christmas season. There are many good writeups on here about this hotel. I agree with all the ones that define the hotel as an excellent one. Some pointers:Try to get upgraded to a king room. They are on the higher floor. We did so after one night in a standard room and were not disappointed. Had a nice view of the Chrysler building; close enough to see the gargoyles. As mentioned earlier, the higher you are in this hotel, the better. The staff here is very friendly and goes out of their way to make you happy. This statement does not apply to the inept servers at the hotel bar however. Go elsewhere for libations. Regarding the glowing writeups of the 'Red Flame Diner', I just don't get it. The place is o.k. for breakfast and they are certainly fast with delivery, but it is nothing special. A more interesting choice for breakfast and fast is 'Dishes'. Great quality food, even if the atmosphere is 'cafeteria-ish'; two blocks away. Ask the concierge. We ate at DB bistro (two doors down from hotel) and were sorely disappointed, especially after having eaten at the flagship Daniel two nights before. Of course it is much cheaper, but you can do much better for the money. For those from out of town, NYC water is terrific. It comes from upstate New York and does not have to be treated. Drink it from the taps, you are wasting money otherwise. Yes, it was expensive at $500 a night with tax, but my friends stayed at the Roosevelt for $300 and hated it. This hotel is so worth it. Planning to return in early summer; tres bon. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":343,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":339}]}
