{"text":"A good, characterful hotel, though some might find noise offputting Staying at the Holiday Inn Zocalo is not the usual kind of bland, reliable and forgettable experience associated with most Holiday Inns elsewhere. The place has a particular character that makes it memorable, largely (though not entirely) for the right reasons.The location is excellent, within effortless reach of all of the tourist sites in the Centrico Historico. By day, the liveliness of the surrounding streets makes casual meandering an enjoyable experience (and one that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ much less in-your-face than might be expected). By night, I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ say the area is at all threatening, but the crowds of tourists √à√\u2020\u2022?and the even bigger crowds of people trying to sell things to tourists √à√\u2020\u2022?tend to disappear after about 9pm. The hotel itself has a nice ambience, its communal areas lacking the usual sterility of the big chain hotels. It feels very much a Mexican undertaking √à√\u2020\u2022?rather than an American one. The bar is small and pretty lifeless, but a perfectly decent meeting place before heading off to the rather more lively offerings elsewhere. The restaurant is on the top floor, with an outdoor terrace with agreeable views of the city. I only sampled breakfast, but the food on offer was good and the cost, although high by Mexican standards, was low in comparison to North America or Europe. The rooms again are some way off the usual you-could-be-anywhere experience associated with Holiday Inns et al. Their stripped down simplicity was for me a plus point, though some might miss the availability of internet access or zillions of channels of unwatchable US television. The overall feel is not unlike a decent quality Mediterranean hotel. The only real downside is the endless daytime noise from the uniformed hurdy-gurdy player (and his monkey) perched on a daily basis outside the front of the hotel. If you plan to stay in your room for any length of time during the day, the barrel organ and its depressingly repetitive repertoire could well be a major irritant. Proximity to the Zocalo - the epicentre of protest for Mexico - can also create noise at by day or night (though that's offset by the incredible spectacle of watching these serial protesters at work). All in all, though, the Holiday Inn Zocalo is a perfectly good place to stay, whether as a tourist or on business.
