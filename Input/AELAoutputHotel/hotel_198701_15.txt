{"text":"Respite Definitely not the place to stay if what you're looking for is ultra-modern chic, the hotel exudes an air of fading glamour and days gone by. The lobby, bar and restaurant are as grand as you'd expect from such a place, though cosy enough to feel homely.Our room was suitably large with high ceilings to match. Although the decor seems woefully outdated, it actually made a refreshing change to be staying somewhere with a character of its own, a place that didn't feel like it might have been assembled entirely from flatpack kits from Ikea. Spotlessly clean, the room was fresh and temperatures perfectly set centrally to offset the climate outside. The bathroom was also immaculately kept, but I did notice one out of place tile that really should have been fixed long ago.There were only two things about the room I didn't like. Firstly, although they supply one complimentary bottle of mineral water a day, there are no tea \/ coffee making facilities. Secondly, one of our bedside cabinets had an old radio built into it that had strangely been disconnected. Was a bit of a shame, because listening to local stations on a retro radio would have added to the overall atmosphere greatly.Staff were extremely pleasant and almost stereotypically efficient. Room service was carried out with an exact professionalism I've never experienced anywhere else, though it's quite galling that they charge a √à√\u2020√ü? service charge - this really should be set at around 10 -15%.Other reviewers are right to say that there is a heavy smell of cigar smoke in the lobby, but for me this was just part of the quirky, yesteryears feel of the place.Another major plus for the hotel is the fact that it's so centrally located - the Zoological Garden station is just around the corner and only a few minutes away.All in all, a pretty impressive and rather luxurious stay. Not mind-blowingly great, but certainly a step above most hotels.
