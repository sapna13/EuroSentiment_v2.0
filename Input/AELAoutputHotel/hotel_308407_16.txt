{"text":"Fantastic Stay Just back from a 12 night stay at the Santika - it was wonderful! The grounds are stunning and a haven from the hustle and bustle outside. The hotel is also brilliantly situated and there are many bars and restaurants nearby. The staff are exceptional and go out of their way to make you feel welcome - nothing is too much trouble for them. Contrary to an earlier review we found the tour desk to be extremely helpful and booked all of our excursions through them at reasonable prices.The breakfast is varied and we never grew tired of the choice available.I had one massage at the hotel and did not really rate it. We found the spa at Febri's across the road to be far better value and its also worth doing a day spa trip in Ubud.We hardly took a taxi anywhere as everything was within walking distance and besides given the amount of traffic we walked quicker than the taxis' were driving!Despite the hotel being 99% full the hotel never felt crowded and there were plenty of sun loungers available round the pool.The only thing that has stopped me giving me a full 5 stars is the noise at night. We stayed in a premier room and some guests thought it acceptable to run screaming and knocking on the doors in the early hours of the morning. Further some guests also thought it acceptable to have their TV loud at all hours (why come to Bali to wacth TV?!!!). We would defintely stay at the Santika again but would pay the extra price for a bungalow. Lastly, we found quite a few of the other guests to be quite rude, especially to the staff and it would have been nice to have more Europeans rather than 80% Australians.All in all a fantastic holiday apart from the noise some nights!
