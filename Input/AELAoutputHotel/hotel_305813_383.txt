{"text":"Great Hotel and Service, Good Location Stayed here for 5 nights in Nov\/Dec. Used the hotel shuttle from the airport as we had 4 large bags and did not want to use the Express Train and handle the baggage. Room was smaller than expected but did have a great bed with a choice of pillows, great amenities and a wonderful view of Hong Kong. The washroom with glass walls takes a little getting used to but makes the room feel bigger and more contemporary.The service was great. About 3 days after checking in I went down to request another key. I spoke to the same agent who had checked me in and she remembered my name and the room number!On one night I wondered down to the buffet resteraunt to purchase a few crackers as I had an upset stomach. I was immediately given some crackers from the buffet and told not to worry when I offered to pay.As other reviews have stated, the pool and gym area are well maintained, very modern and offer great views of Hong Kong.I really liked the location. Mong Kok is only 2 MTR stops from Kowloon and a good base for any visitor. Wonderful shopping and resteraunts all around. When we were walking around Kowloon we were constantly being bothered with offers for suits etc. You will not find this in Mong Kok as I feel this is where many of the locals eat and shop (vs. the tourists). Make sure to try the Dim Sum resteraunt (on level 3) located in the mall next to the hotel. Some of the best Dim Sum I have ever tried! ","annotations":[]}
