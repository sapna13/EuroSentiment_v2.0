{"text":"Good real estate, mediocre service I just came back from a 4-night stay at the hotel. This really is a 3.5 star review but I am rounding it up! My generocity is driven by the general shortage of boutique hotels in Florence. Most hotels, restaurants, bars etc. in the city are of the fussy, old-Europe variety. So when this hotel opened 5 yrs ago or so at a perfect location within spitting distance from Ponte Vecchio it was an immediate hit and still is revered by the trendy set in the city.The hotel is part of a Ferragamo-owned mini chain of 4 properties. Hence the nice leather touches in the rooms. For example, the headboard and desk chair and armoir handles were all done in nice yellow leather. Bathroom was great and the details were solid. The bed was of the Euro side-by-side twin variety (which I hate) and was firm but not terribly comfortable. Still nothing unusual for Euro standards. Smallish room had a tiny balcony opening to a dark internal courtyard. None of the rooms have any views, really.The main lobby is too spartan but next to it is the Library lounge which is nice and comfy. Also at the hotel there is a fusion restaurant and bar which is nice but nothing to write home about. In short, the place is almost 1990's (passe) stereotype - minimalism,fusion food, lounge music - we've seen it all before. However, as I've said, the combination is rather refreshing in Florence.The real downside of the hotel is service. Don't expect any service from the front-desk staff and you shall not be disappointed. Most of the time, there is only 1 person who is supposed to check in people, answer the phone, give food recommendations, etc. No wonder that you get rushed and that phones don't get picked up. At best they will give you the bill and call you a taxi. One tip - make sure you go to the rooftop of the sister Continentale property next door for a drink and spectacular views.The verdict: great bathrooms, very good (if smallish room), nice designer details. Nothing breathtaking but all quite solid. Except for front-desk service. Why can't they hire 3 East Europeans to be around and cheerful at all times?
