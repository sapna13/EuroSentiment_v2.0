{"text":"Another excellent GHM Hotel We were in a pool villa #9 over the Easter period. This is a good villa to hopefully snag, because it has the best view of the rice paddy fields. It is also a little further away from the other villas and in the corner of the rice paddy field so it has more privacy from other guests staying at the hotel. Absolutely no other guests can see you. However, speaking of privacy...... This is a working paddy field. There are local workers tending to the field all day long and they do walk in front of your pool gate from time to time. They do not stop to talk or walk in on you, but you may get a shock if you try to go skinny dipping! You will also hear them making their 'crow' call to scare off other birds, and they will often pull a string connected to a rice filled can which makes a rattling noise, also to get rid of the birds. I found this very relaxing and enjoyable to watch. It gave the place such character!The room was lovely but one thing to note is that there is only a sliding door between the bathroom and the bedroom and this sliding door has big slits through the wood so one can still see you quite clearly if you have not had a chance to put your clothes on after a shower! I usually like a bit more privacy when I have just had a shower so if you are like me, this is something to note.The butler service was first class and every care was well attended to immediately. The laundry service was perfect, do not worry about those delicate items, they will be well taken care of.The property itself is well laid out. There are golf cars if you get stuck in the rain like we did to ferry you around. Take advantage of the afternoon tea, it is a lovely time of day to be lounging on those huge day beds, watching the paddy fields. However, we must advise you that we did not enjoy the room service lunch nor the dinner at the restaurant. The breakfast was fabulous though, so it is funny that we found the dinner so dire and overpriced. Perhaps we simply made the wrong choices off the menu.For foodies, please advise your butler to make a reservation for you at the famous Mozaic restaurant. It truly is exceptional in every arena, from the food itself, to the service and the ambience. Highly recommended.The Cafe Lotus is a lovely respite from those hideous motorcyles on the street and also makes for lovely photos by the lotus pond and temple. We also dined at Ary's Warung. I enjoyed my meal which was the veal, and the service was not bad except for a small glitch at the end when they brought to us the wrong bill (so make sure you check yours)Overall, I can highly recommend the Chedi Club. Just superb. Come here if you want total peace and quiet. This is not a place for small, noisy children.
