{"text":"Gorgeous Fantastic hotel! The receptionist was so helpful, and straight away advised us of the best places to go, by the best possible routes, etc. She actually marked it all out on a map for us too! The restaurant upstiars is a bit pricey, very al a carte, which we hadn't realised till we sat down, but again it was fantastic! We also tried the lounge restaurant, lovely pizza!  The room was just gorgeous, marble floors and bathroom, topped up minibar, fab view! It really was a dream for us, we felt so posh! Would recommend definetely! Again as with other reviews, get a travel pass(barcelona card), as you don't have to keep paying to get around, it just gets u everywhere! If you do get this card when you book your holiday, and you have to collect it, you can only get it from the tourisme in barcelona town, or the airport. don't try and get it on a bank holiday day at 3 in the afternoon, it won't happen! get the card straight away at the airport, so you don't have to spend money getting to the tourist building! you also get a discount book for many things, so it may be better to wait till you get that before pre-booking!Also, went to flamenco dancing show at Flamenco's. also fantastic! In a lovely setting, courtyard not far from hotel.Barcelona stadium also a good day out!Not many places in town speak english, so be warned, its not that easy to eat out!No faults to hotel. oh, also the spa is nice aswell, small but not busy and nice and private!
