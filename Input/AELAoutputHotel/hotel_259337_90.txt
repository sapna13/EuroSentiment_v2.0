{"text":"Well Worth the Money We stayed for seven nights in Feb 2008. The temperature was great, 75-85 degrees F with rain at night three of the nights. There are actually three resorts with about the same style rooms, the Palace, the Punta Cana and the Bavaro. Our room had a whirlpool bath in it along with a king size bed, coffee maker, hair dryer, mini-fridge, etc. It was immaculate all the time and well maintained. The bathroom was a bit small but very functional. Suites are available in the Royal Suites area of the resort and this area has its own pool, restaurant and a bit larger rooms. No children are allowed at the Royal Suites. My first impression was the sprawling nature of this resort with paved paths to everywhere with many of these covered to reduce the heat and protect from rain. A lot of walking is involved in anything you do but you quickly find your way around. Shuttles are available to reduce the walking but catching one requires waiting at one of the stops so we never used them. There are shopping areas and an internet cafe' on the resort and also a flea market shopping area just up the beach independently operated. The food was good with lots of variety and great service. The ala carte' restaurants are walk up type vs. having to use a reservationfrom your arrival packet while the many buffets are very accommodating and well done. This resorts seemed to cater to Canadian and French people but we met Polish, British, German and Italian people as well. Very few Americans were around and the staff knows very little English. Wine is served by the waiters at every meal as readily as purified water. I give this resort a 4.5 out of 5 and rate it down only because of its lack ofsufficient lounge chairs and long walking distances.
