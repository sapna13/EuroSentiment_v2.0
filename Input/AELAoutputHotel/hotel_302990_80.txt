{"text":"Ok Hotel I have now been to the Kowloon 3 times and will be going for a 4th in September. I stay there on business, because it is so convenient and cheap compared to some of the other hotels (Marco Polo group for one).The rooms are small - not really suitable for two persons and their luggage. Bathroom also small and not especially well attended.The bar is good but sometimes service is slow. Italian restaurant I would recommend and breakfast is excellent.You are 10 min walking away from the Star Ferry, 15 min from Ocean Terminal and ferry to Shenzhen and Zhuhai. You are 10 min taxi away from Hung HOm and trains to Shenzhen or to Guandong. But tip - if you are travelling into Guangdong, for instance Champing, buy your ticket the day before. Dont get caught like I did once, where there was the Canton Trade Fair on. MTR is on your doorstep.The hotel is busy but no more than any other centrally located hotel and many hotels have flight attendants turn up. The two Indian guys on the door are very pleasant and obliging.Local night life is OK, Delanys usually where I end up for a quiet night but for more lively action head off to Hong Kong Island and Jaffe Road Henessy Road areas. Good bars - Dusk til Dawn if you can handle it, China Town, Devils Advocate etc etc.Suit sellers can be a pain but after 10 visit I just ignore them. Did see a funny thing last time near the star ferry - two suit sellers having fight and I walked right through the middle of them before I realised what was happening.Temple street and Ladies markets are a must, as is Haipong road. Try the street food and make your way to the Stag Pub if you can find it.Oh yes and the Felix bar at the top of the Peninisula is worth saving up for - just across the road from the Kowloon. I was one with a croud and the bill was over √ä√£¬¢200. Gents it is worth the view from your urinal! and ladies you get special treatment by the service maid who turns on the taps and hands you a towel. ","annotations":[]}
