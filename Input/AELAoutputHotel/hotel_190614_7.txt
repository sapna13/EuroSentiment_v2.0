{"text":"Great Upscale Choice in Amsterdam Overall a very nice hotel. The room was fairly large by European city standards, and everything in the room was of the highest quality. Although, I must say that this hotel was actually a little √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢oo fancy√à√\u2020\u2022?for our tastes. Among the amenities offered was a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µillow menu√à√\u2020\u2022?with about 6 different options to chose from, overnight shoe polishing service, and nightly turn down that included some kind of linen mat to place on the floor next to the bed. There is a lobby bar, bistro, and world renowned restaurant on site, but we did not eat at any of them as we were usually out and about for lunch. As for dinner, I still haven√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ developed a taste for calf√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ tongue in goose fat so we ate elsewhere.We had some issues regarding the internet not working on one day, and another problem trying to buy pay per view movies on the television. In both instances, they sent the hotel manager to our suite within 5 minutes to try and resolve the problem. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe ever met a hotel manager before, and I met two just at this hotel. They were very proactive in trying to solve the problem or coming up with a suitable alternative.There have been some comments about the location of the hotel being a little bit isolated in some of the other reviews. On our first day there, we felt the same way. However, after talking to the concierge and seeing how easy it was to use the trams, we found the location to actually be very good. It was close enough to visit all the areas you want to see, but far enough away from the madness that it was quiet (you can actually get a good night of sleep). You can catch a tram directly to the museum area or downtown with about a 2 minute walk, followed by a 5 minute tram ride. You can also walk to either area in 20-30 minutes, and get a chance to see the city in the process. There are at least 50 restaurants within a 15 minute walk, but ask the concierge so you know which way to go.This hotel seemed to cater mostly to business clientele, obviously ones with large expense accounts (we were staying for free on points). We stayed for 6 days and aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ sure we saw any other tourist \/ leisure travelers the whole time. The recommendations of the concierge seemed to reflect this as well, since they were most familiar with only the best restaurants (most expensive) in the city.On a side note, the hotel is handicap accessible, but it requires a special lift for the stairs in front, which means you have to wait for them to get the ramps setup and it takes a couple of extra minutes.
