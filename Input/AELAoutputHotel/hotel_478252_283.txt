{"text":"Not for the American traveller I read nearly every review before booking this trip and understood the good and not-so-good about this place. As an American traveler who has been to a lot of destinations, I have to say that this trip was average and I would not return. I guess I was hoping that our experience would be like the great reviews and not like the bad ones. Bottom line is, this is a HUGE resort and the nice touches that many experienced travelers expect are just not going to be met. As everyone agrees, the grounds, pool and beach are stunningly beautiful and well-maintained. The accommodations are very nice and the maids were fantastic. We did tip $3\/day and also brought chocolate and clothes to give to them.The food was average, at best. We did enjoy our diner at the Japanese and Mediterranean restaurant and the French was decent (but took forever to get our food). The regular lunch and dinner buffets were well below the average American meal--my food in college was better! I am not at all a picky eater and found that the chicken was the only decent food. The breakfast each morning was the only good meal of the day--but we ate at the Italian restaurant which is only available to Club Diamond guests.In conclusion, if you don't mind big crowds, fair food and some disappointment, then book this resort. But, if you have certain expectations and want more than an average vacation, look elsewhere. Again, we didn't have a bad vacation, but it wasn't great either.
