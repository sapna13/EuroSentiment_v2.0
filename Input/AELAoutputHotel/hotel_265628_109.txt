{"text":"the pool kicks! Just got back from our Mar 6-13 stay at the Sirenis Tropical. The suite was spacious, with a TV in the bedroom and a 2nd in the living room - perfect for families. Not sure why a few of the reviewers complained about the mattresses, its stiffness worked for our backs. No issues with the A\/C either. Only peeve here is that they do not have a central filtration system for water in the rooms, so you always need to use bottled water to brush your teeth. (This is not an issue in their kitchens). The pool was by far the best we have ever seen anywhere - and we have been almost everywhere. An accomplished swimmer would be hard pressed to swim from one end to the other in less than 15 minutes. It had great parts for swimmers, kids, and yes, drinkers too. The only knock about the general layout of the resort is that this is a sprawling resort, with probably at least 20 buildings on the premises. If you have mobility issues, you will not like it.The staff was great. I was amazed how some of the entertainment staff was able to switch from English to French to Spanish and even German without missing a beat. Sure, a very small number of them did not speak english well, but if you are from Toronto, you will probably be used to that. Besides, its just courteous when you are in a foreign country to pick up some of the lingo in advance (2 cervezas por favor). The nightly shows were good, but the children's shows were awful. The beach was good, but it is not a snorkelers paradise, to say the least. The choppy waves kept throwing up too much sand to get a view of the limited coral reef. Mind you, it made riding the kayaks, hobie cats, wind surfers that much more fun. Bit annoying they would ask for a $20USD security deposit to use their snorkelling equipment when everything else was free (e.g. gym equipment, etc.). We had no problems getting huts on the beach. Oh, for all you parents with young children, although 5% of women there went topless, it did not distract our 7 year old son too much.The food, however, was not as amazing as the rest of the resort. Not sure why they have so many fancy espresso machines everywhere but can't make a decent capuccino. The buffet restaurants could use a little more variety. Management is miserly in handing out dinner reservations for their restaurants, yet they sit half empty at dinner time. The japanese restaurant put on a good show - but it did not actually serve any proper japanese food. The italian restaurant featured a tiramisu desert that, while delicious, was not tiramisu. Well, its not like there is a little Italy or Japan in DR like there is in the more cosmopolitan parts of the world. This was not a problem with the steak restaurant, but be warned they prepare their steaks in a more Latin American style, than say, The Keg. The churrasco steak was better than their sirloin, for example. We did not try the seafood or mexican restaurants there but the people we talked to there raved about them ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2829,"mention":"churrasco","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Churrasco"],"startOffset":2820},{"endOffset":2829,"mention":"churrasco","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Churrasco"],"startOffset":2820},{"endOffset":2829,"mention":"churrasco","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Churrasco"],"startOffset":2820}]}
