{"text":"Great Service, great location We stayed in room 136 on the first floor overlooking the courtyard at the back of the hotel. The room was very pleasant, large, airy, spotlessly clean and very quiet with a lovely view of the Duomo. It was also nice and cool and we had no need to use the aircon facility. The bathrrom was also spacious with lots of hot water. The location of the hotel is perfect for a trip to Florence, the Duomo is literally at the bottom of the street and the Medicci Palace across the road and only 5 minutes walk from the train station. We were a little unsure when we first arrived having to climb into a rickety old lift, but what a lovely surprise when we got out of the lift and entered the reception area to a warm and friendly welcome. What you need to remember is the building dates back to the 13th century and has the original frescoes still on the ceilings, cracks and all. Unfortunately I broke my foot the first night there so this did spoil our visit, however the hotel staff went out ot their way to make our stay as comfortable as possible - especially Miriam who even took the time to accompany my husband to the chemist so she could translate for him and ensure that the medication we were given at the hospital were administered correctly. She also rang around all possible suppliers of a wheelchair for us. We will definitely return to Florence and to the Hotel Europa.
