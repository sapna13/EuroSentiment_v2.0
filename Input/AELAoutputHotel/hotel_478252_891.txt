{"text":"What more could you ask for? Our party of four arrived at the Bahia Principe January 17 to 24, 2007. We read numerous reviews, all we can say is - this is a 5 star resort! We stayed in Jr Suites, booked throughTripcentral - Nolitours, their block of rooms is in an excellent location, near the beach\/pools and lunch. We welcomed the music, it usually didn't start till after 3:00 p.m. There was plenty to keep you busy (bingo, pool aerobics, contests, entertainment, etc.) nothing was too loud, the pools are huge, you can be out of the action easily. Snacks\/lunch\/fresh fruit at the beach\/pool was great during the day.Getting back to the resort, yes it is huge, but the shuttles are running every few minutes and till 3:00 a.m. The resort is spotless, inside and outside. Our rooms were huge, a\/c worked fine, shower, etc. and no we had no bugs of any kind. The buffets and a` la cartes were excellent, the staff try hard (don't forget to tip!)We went snorkelling with Marinarium, booked at the resort, we all had a great time from start to finish, the crew was excellent, we had a blast. We found enough to do in the evenings, from shopping - the little shops are great,, open till 11ish (also down the beach 25 min away(huts)go during the day) entertainment till midnight, karaoke, disco till after 2 a.m. and casino till 4:00 a.m., if you choose to have a quiet evening you can.Don't think twice about this resort, just go, I hope to return soon.
