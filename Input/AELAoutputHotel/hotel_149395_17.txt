{"text":"Not what we expected, not worth the price. Pluses - nice beach with beautiful white sand, nicely decorated and trimmed property, the pool is great, with a swim-up bar. Dinners in restaurants are OK, the Mediterranean and French restaurants are very decentMinuses - personnel is trying to be friendly, but they are very sloppy. For example, there was the housekeeper's or previous guests' hair all over the floor in our suite. So, my wife had to do extra cleaning herself. Also, the personnel are not fluent in English.Buffet is open only for breakfast, poor choice of tasteless food. Lunch in the restaurant by the beach is not bad, but same dishes every day. One day, my wife found a rubber band in her food at this restaurant! The main reason we chose this hotel was the all-inclusive activities, such as scuba diving. Howvever, because of the constant waves (and as we found out later, there are huge waves at this particular place of Punta Cana because of its location), I couldn't do any scuba diving. So, we had to book a separate trip to Catalina Island in the Caribbean sea (near La Romana), where I did scuba diving, and my family enjoyed snorkeling, both for extra charge, obviously. We did not feel safe at the beach, especially for our little daughter, because there are a lot of strangers there roaming around trying to sell you smth or sign you up for smth. The nightly entertainment shows are very poor and of low quality.We also had problems with our keys, twice. When we tried using them to open the door to our room, they did not work. And mind it - because of the huge hotel territory, it takes you 15 minutes to get to the lobby to fix them.Another thing - there is no alcohol in your room's bar, and the choice of alcoholic beverages on the hotel's property is very poor. One more thing - they are trying to promote the Reserve area of this hotel by booking you on a 90-minute tour (which in reality took three hours), with the purpose of making you sign up for some kind of a timeshare. Our concierge said that if we attend the tour, we will get a one week of free stay at the Reserve, valid for the next two years. So, we attended this three hour tour and totally wasted our time, and the people were puttting a lot of pressure on us trying to make us sign up for this program. We refused at the end, and guess what? They did not offer us any free stay at the Reserve! (And the concierge later said that they recently discontinued doing so). So, we really very much regretted wasting our precious vacation time on this.Here is our advice - stay away from this particular place, it is not worth your money, it is such a dissapointment. If you are planning a trip to the Dominican Republic, choose a hotel at the Caribbean coast. We decided for ourselves that Riviera Maya in Mexico is much-much better and costs less.
