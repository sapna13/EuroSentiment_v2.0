{"text":"Great! We stayed at the Fairmont for 5 nights in the middle of October. We were upgraded to a Deluxe corner room on the 6th floor. It was a very spacious room with a fake or use to be a fireplace. The beds were great and the room was very quiet.The location of the hotel is probably the best in the city as far as I'm concerned. Major shopping and transportation subway is right at your doorstep.We mainly found restaurants near the hotel that we could walk to. If the weather is bad you would need a taxi...but beware. ... The taxi drivers in Boston drive you completely AROUND everywhere until they get an expensive taxi ride. We were ripped off about 4 times. Especially from the airport and going to the North End for dinner one night.Weather permitting, you can walk to Funeul Hall in about 20 minutes and I would recommend doing so. You see a lot of sights along the way. We also took the subway to Harvard and it was a piece of cake. Harvard was beautiful and we spent several hours just meandering around. Restaurants: Joes American Grill over On Dartmouth Street just a few blocks from the hotel. Very nice place and fairly inexpensive food for lunch or dinner. Smith and Wollensky in the back bay for steak. Beautiful and historic castle. We asked to see where they hang and age the meat...amazing! Great meal! We ate lunch at Stephanie's on Newburys and wasn't very impressed. We had Davide's for Italian in the North End and it was our most expensive dinner...but not worth it. The concierge recommended it. We had dinner at Legal Seafood and that was very good. We walked down to the Funeul Hall for lunch one day and that was fun! Skipjacks for seafood and cocktails. Very lively place......popular..make reservations. They have Miller Drafts for $2.00.....one half block from hotel.The Duck Tours looked fun but we had done a tour our prior visit. I would have liked to take the boat out to Cape Cod one day...just not enough time. 90 minutes to get there. Wanted to go to the JFK museum as well.......subway route....but we planned on going in the afternoon and ran out of time so go in the morning.There is a starbucks right next door to the hotel, but you can get a coffee pot in your room with coffee for your entire stay for $10 total. There is a 7-11 or Rite Aid across the street to buy water and a liqueur store next door to that if you want to buy beer to have in your room.
