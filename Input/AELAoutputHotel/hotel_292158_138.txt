{"text":"Great Time At The Grand Palladium Punta Cana We've recently returned from our stay at the Grand Palladium (Punta Cana Section). We went from Feb. 21 - Feb. 28.2008. We had a great time. The resort is exactly what other reviews have said. They were kept very clean, bar fridge restocked every other day and yes there is a jacuzzi tub in all the rooms. It is very big because you have access to the other Grand Palladium sister hotels (the Bavaro and the Palace) and also access to all they're buffet restaurants and a la cartes. The little train that went by every 15 mins was very handy to hop on to get you were you needed to go. All restaurants were no more than a 10-15 walk anyways. The buffets where pretty good, but the a la cartes were the way to go. No reservations required, and If you were there at about 630-645 you had no problems being seated. We tried the Mexican, Italian and the Steakhouse. They were all amazing. Service was great. We used the buffets for breakfast and had lots of selection.The beach was the best part of the trip. White sand, turquoise water and big hunched over palm trees. And kept very clean.The things said about reserving your loungers early...All true.. You gotta get your butt out to the beach by 7am to get a nice spot. You put your towels on the loungers and you're good for the day. (the beach isn't more than 100 yards away from your room if your staying in the 2000, 3000 or 4000 building..) They are all pretty good. The nightime entertainment.. we went to the Michael Jackson show which was very unique and well done a must see for shure!! we also went to the adults only game show which was very funny and good entertainment. As far a excursions go. we did the Outback Safari which was awsome! Left our resort at 830 and returned by 430.Great tour guides. It gives you the true taste of how everyday Dominicans live and what they're country is all about. they also take you to a beautifull beach to try and Boogie board.. Did I mention the very beautifull beach!! The other excursion we did was a new one(6weeks old) called The Happy Hour. You board the Tropical Storm catamaran at 330 which takes you about 1\/4 mile out in the ocean to snorkel on a reef with the tropical fish...and the snorkeling is geared for rookies and veteran snorkelers. The hosts on the boat were fabulous and kept you laughing the whole time... Then 1\/2 hour later you board back on the boat and head to a private beach and are able to jump off into the ocean which is 3-4 feet deep. Grab your favourite drink and stand in the water and watch the most beautifull sunset...you're back at the resort by about 800. Both excursions were $85 a piece as most where...All in all.. I very much would recommend this resort to anyone.
