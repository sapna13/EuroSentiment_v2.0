{"text":"Charming hotel in a great location! This is a charming hotel and we loved the location. We stayed here for 3 nights in the month of October. We had communicated withAbdennour who helped us out in booking a nice room, and withdirections as well as other information about Paris. Fredericaand other staff was very helpful too. Advantages:- Location: Very close to RER station (Pont de Alma) as well as the Ecole Militaire station which can get you to any of the big attractions even though it has just a single metro line running through it.  Rue Cler is right behind the hotel which has wonderful  fruit shops and a very nice cheese store. It also has a couple of restaurants which are above average. Rue Cler also has general grocery stores which makes it easy for you to pick up water, snacks etc. Eiffel tower is a 10 minute walk..- Staff: Helpful, not overly-friendly, but professional.- Rooms: We had heard about small rooms in Paris, but found the room to be quite well sized. Not gargantuan, but adequate. The bathroom was nice, clean.- Free internet in the front lobby and across the hotel (wi-fi) which was helpful.The only disadvantage we found was the slightly expensivebreakfast which we did not end up taking. Pain d Epis, a bakery, onAvenue Bosquet is just wonderful and is right outside thehotel when you walk towards the Ecole Militaire station. Theirbaked goods were really delicious.As a previous guest has mentioned, do your research forrestaurants. They do make good recommendations, but nothingthat would wow you away.We really liked our stay here and would love to return back.Thanks for making our stay in Paris wonderful.
