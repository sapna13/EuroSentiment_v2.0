{"text":"Fantastic Hotel! Stayed in this hotel for four nights at the end of October and must say it is one of the best hotels I have come across. It is very modern and clean cut with little charm of character if thats what you like. What I couldn't get over about this hotel is how clean it is - absolutley spotless!! The rooms are very well equipped and quiet so we got a good nights sleep everynight (as the hotel is in a peaceful residential area). You will need to use the metro to get around as it is quite a bit from the city but there is a metro station around the corner called 'Selva de Mar' (it's on the yellow line and will bring you directly to Passeig de Gracia metro stop, which is a stroll from Placa Catalunya - heart of the city!) Didn't have much interaction with the staff but they seemed a little bit distant. I would not recommend eating breakfast in this hotel - it's a rip-off! Instead exit the hotel and go right, after 200 m there is a huge shopping centre 'Diagonal Mar' which has loads of little cafes and restaurants (and very good clothes shops!). I would say that this hotel is perfect if your looking for somewhere really peaceful and relaxing as we found the bar and restaurant a bit too quiet for our liking. All in all, had a great stay in this hotel, loved Barcelona but please be warned watch your wallet, bag, camera etc etc - pickpockets are everywhere ...you have been warned!!! ","annotations":[]}
