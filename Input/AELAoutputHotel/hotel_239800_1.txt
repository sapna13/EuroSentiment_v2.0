{"text":"Glad I Only Stayed One Night My husband (Hilton Gold) and I stayed for one night in early September. This hotel was selected for the price ($55) and its proximity to the airport (NOTE: it is not that close--it is almost 7 miles and a 20 minute trip, and their shuttle will not take you to the airport). The hotel public areas are fine, though a little odd and chopped up. Our concern was with the room and the bed. We received an upgraded room, which was quite large, but we had to lug our cumbersome luggage through two sets of non-automatic double doors, past the swimming pool, in 100 degree heat, to a separate building. The room was on the second floor and had absolutely no view except for the roof, which raised some security issues, as someone could have entered our room through the window. A bigger problem was the bed--it was so soft, with no support, that any movement made by one person could be felt by the other. I complained to the desk clerk about it the next morning (having gotten no sleep) and all she could say was that the beds were new. A car is an absolutely necessity here. There is a parking lot across the street, and the hotel will give out parking passes to present to the attendant. Otherwise, there is not much to do here. We had breakfast in the buffet, which was of good quality, with the usual fare of fruit, hot foods, and cereals. Cost is $10.95, but it is free to Hilton Golds and Diamonds. They will do omelets.
