{"text":"Top location and service but questionable deluxe rooms Dear reader,Here is my fresh experience of a 1-week stay at the Hotel Inglaterra in Barcelona, for you to consider if you wish. I chose this hotel for a holiday with my girlfriend, after having read promising reviews on this and other websites. We had a deluxe room with a terrace \/ patio and here is my experience of it.Strengths first. The hotel is very convenient to reach via bus (EUR 3.5) from the BCN airport to the Placa Universitat only 100 m away. The hotel service was impeccable, with very helpful and friendly staff. Breakfast buffet was affordable and of resonable quality at EUR 8 per person. Positives also include a clean hotel with nice decor and a superb location for easy access to the main tourist attractions. The room was reasonably clean (not under the bed !) and boasted a well-filled minibar and a modern SONY LCD TV. The patio was good to ventilate the smoke out of our clothes after restaurant visits.However. Deluxe rooms cost extra and I regret to write that our deluxe room with a terrace \/ patio was a minor disappointment. It was located on the ground floor, without any sunshine on the patio, and the room was nowhere near the 30 sqm as indicated on the hotel website. Around the double bed was only a 1m margin of free space. The bath was ca 3 sqm. The room also surprised us several times with a recurrent and quite unpleasant cloak-like odor. We even had problems with some loud and drunk neighbours who shouted for long in our corridor at 3.30 am. Had to call the reception to get those people quiet.Value for money ? Not for a deluxe room I would say. Take an ordinary room instead and save your money for something better. Or, alternatively, go all the way and book a suite. The hotel is a good one but somewhat misleading on the marketing side. Examples include the misleading room size, web pictures of the exterior looking way more grandiose and visible that reality (just a bit silly), and the promise that we could use the pool facility of their sister (luxury) hotel Majestic. It turned out to be closed for renovation. Again, silly, as it only takes a minute or two for them to adjust the hotel web to inform all customers about that.Some say the devil is in the detail. But there is space for improvement for the Inglaterra. This is only partly reflected in the hotel price. Beware of this and feel confident in booking another room type for a hopefully pleasant stay in Barcelona.
