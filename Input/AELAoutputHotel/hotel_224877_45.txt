{"text":"Mandarin Oriental, Miami We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for four nights last August. I have been meaning to write a review, so I figured a few months late is not too bad. We have previously stayed at the Ritz Carlton on South Beach, but wanted to try the Mandarin since we heard and read great things. Below is my feedback:** Lobby ** The hotel lobby is really nice. Has a beautiful view of the bay from anywhere you stand. There is also a coffee bar which is available in the mornings and an actual bar available in the evenings for pre\/post dinner drinks. ** Location ** This is probably the only complaint I have about the Mandarin. A cab ride to South Beach costs $30 each way and we went out to dinner every night, so it ran between $70 -$80 a night for cabs (this excludes other cab rides while in South Beach). So if you do actually plan to spend most of your time in South Beach, I would highly recommend not staying here. I would recommend the Ritz Carlton on South Beach as the alternative. ** Service ** The service was fairly good. If we had any request (no matter what time of day or night), they would accommodate without issues. The only minor complaint is that they are fairly slow at the restaurants. When we had lunch our first day there, it was so slow that we decided not to eat there again. In terms of the food, it is very Asian based so keep that in mind if you do or do not like Asian food. We thought we loved Asian food, but four days of Asian lunches will take their toll √à¬£¬∂?At the pool, food\/drink service was fairly quick, but I think it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ because the pool was small. We ordered room service each day for breakfast and they do a good job with that. On a side note, definitely check out Barton G restaurant in South Beach. They had a good scene and great food. ** Pool **The pool is actually not that great. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ very small and you only get sun all day in half the area. Other areas get covered with shade fairly quickly. Also, as you probably all know, it is not on the beach. They have a little sand area but it feels like a cheap park rather than a man-made beach. Quite random actually. They would have done better by making the pool larger and more luxurious.** Gym ** The gym was excellent. They have new equipment, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ very clean, and they provided water, juices, fruit, etc. They also have a path for jogging along the bay which was very nice. ** Spa ** Also excellent. If you are going to the Mandarin to get away and simply get spa treatments and stay at the hotel, I would definitely recommend it. But again, if you are planning on spending time at restaurants in South Beach, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a hassle.** Rooms ** We had a room with a view of the water and the city. For the most part, a majority of the rooms look like they would actually have views. The hotel is fairly new and well kept so that is another positive. It is also very clean. The bath products they provided were great. The only thing to keep in mind is that the bathroom has an open window to the sitting area\/bedroom. So if you are not with your spouse\/significant other, it may be uncomfortable. You can close it with a little pull-shade, but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ still somewhat intrusive. It didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother us since we are married, but if I was with a friend, it would have been a little uncomfortable.** American Express **For those of you who use the Amex Platinum travel service, the amenity you get is $100 credit towards lunch. You have to use it in the actual restaurant though (of course we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ so we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get the credit so keep that in mind). You also get the usual free breakfast and late check-out. In terms of the upgrade, we were supposedly upgraded two room types, but I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see that. Seemed like the same room we booked. So with all that said, if I was staying downtown for work and spending my time there, I would stay here again. If you plan to come to South Beach to go out and go to the beach you are better off at the Ritz Carlton or another hotel directly in South Beach.
