{"text":"Lovely Hotel - Great Location My girlfriend and I recently returned from a 3 night stay at the Atrium Palace and overall we enjoyed a pleasant say. The room was nice, quite spacious and clean. Bathrobes and slippers were supplied along with mini bar, extra pillows, iron and ironing board and in room safe. The TV had limited channels 3 of which were English language (BBC World, CNN  Eurosport). The mini bar was well stocked and included 2 free bottles of still and 2 free bottles of sparkling water in the room every day. We did have a few problems getting the in room safe to lock but the staff were very helpful with this and attended to it quickly.The bathroom was again spacious and clean lots of toiletries were supplied although the shampoo wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ great. The hotel pool was clean but quite small.Reception staff were great; they were very helpful and dealt with any questions to the best of their ability. The Hotel is in a great location - 5 mins walk to the top of La Rambla.A few things to note:There are a number of schools located directly behind the hotel. Kids start playing there at about eight in the morning and they create quite a bit on noise. So if you aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ an early riser ask for a room at the front of the hotel.Cleaning staff start around the same time and again they create quite a bit of noise especially if your room is located beside a store room as ours was.I noticed a few comments on trip advisor about empty cans of coke etc. in the mini bar and we had the same experience. Also the mini bar is quite expensive (3.50euro for a can of coke).Overall though our stay was enjoyable and we would recommend the Atrium Palace to friends travelling to Barcelona in the future.
