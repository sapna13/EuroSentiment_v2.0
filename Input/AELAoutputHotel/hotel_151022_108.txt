{"text":"Pretty darn close to Paradise We booked this resort through CAA. The agent did an awesome job getting all the extra requests in line before we even arrived at the resort. It was certainly nice to be greeted by the resorts√à√\u2020\u2022?own little bus at the airport instead of being on a bus which services numerous resorts. Our trip from the airport was 25 minutes with no wait time. Therefore there was also no wait time at check in and they took care of us impeccably. We had rooms side by side as per our request. The beach was absolutely wonderful, never any problems getting a beach chair at any time of the day and it was very clean. We did not utilize the pool very much because the beach was so beautiful. The grounds: beautifully sculptured keeping the natural vegetation as undisturbed as possible with beautiful ponds, bridges and walkways. The beach: always clean, lots of beach chairs available at all times, lots of water activities available at any time without having to go on wait listsThe rooms: very large and roomy, patio was edged to a beautiful garden, very clean, we never saw a single bug, the maids truly went the extra mile when being tipped appropriatelyWe were also able to keep our room until 7PM for an additional $25.00 US.The service: Exceptional; I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think these people know how to frown! The food: Selection at the buffet beyond imagination, specialty restaurants were out of this world with regard to food selection, service and ambiance. The pool: Not a spectacular pool as one might see in brochures, but as the beach was so wonderful, we truly never utilized the pool very much except to experience the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºwim-up-bar√à√\u2020\u2022? the only downfall was that the pool officially closed at 6PM so no late night swims (although I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think anyone would have stopped us if we would have ventured out for a swim)Security: It was nice to see security at the beach, within the walkways and with the maids mingling through the various buildings. They often stopped to chat and ensured that everything was going ok.Additional bonuses: Key for safe in room at no charge, internet services available throughout the day, additional excursions easily booked with lots of great input from booking agent(we went on a √à√¥√ú day trip snorkeling and swimming at StingRay Bay with Stingrays and Sharks√à√\u2020\u2022?TOTALLY AWESOME!), as the hotel had their own airport bus, we were dropped off at Punta Cana airport 1 √à√¥√ú hours prior to departure instead of the 3-4 hours we heard from other travelers.
