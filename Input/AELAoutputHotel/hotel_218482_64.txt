{"text":"Great for a relaxing getaway I'm a 27 year old male who travelled from Toronto to Catalonia Bavaro with my girlfriend for a weeks stay from July 4th - 11th. Overall, this place is great. I didn't want to do anything but relax and lay around in the sun and it was absolutely perfect for that. I didn't go on any excursions, or watch any shows or go to the disco, so I can't comment on that, but the beach, pool, weather and room were all excellent. All of the people working at the resort seemed to be enjoying themselves and it had a great vibe. I tipped usually when I received drinks from the bar, but unlike the US or Canada, the bartenders and people waiting the tables did not seem concerned with tips, and you didn't feel like that's all they cared about. Sometimes they even walked away while I was trying to tip them!In all of the buffet restaurants there are beer and soda taps that you can help youself too, so you don't even have to ask if you want to get a beer! I loved this so much. I would suggest bringing a thermos or your own large cup to drink out of as the cups they have are quite small. Some of the mixed drinks were weird, but once I found a couple that I liked I stuck to those. The Blue Hawaiian was my favorite, but sometimes they don't put rum in it unless you ask. So make sure you say with rum when you order it.The food was the only part of the trip that was less than perfect, which is why I gave this resort 4 out of 5. I think they have almost too much selection in the buffets, making it a little bit quantity over quality. I am a vegetarian and most of the non-meat options were average, but again, once I found a few awesome things I was set. The pizza at the pool is awesome, the omelette station is great (and they will make regular eggs fresh for you too), and all of the salads are yummy too. If you are a meat eater I'm sure you'll have no problem finding a whole bunch of great foods. There were a lot of europeans there, which makes me feel like the food was more catered to that style over the north american style I am used to.A la carte restaurants were good, but not excellent. The Italian was good, and the Teppanyakki (they cook in front of you) Japanese was great. Mexican was pretty average. I didn't try the steak house since I don't eat meat :)Room was totally awesome. I tipped $3 a day on the pillow and the maid brought me as much beer as I wanted for the mini fridge. We were in building 6, right near the pool which was a great location. I recommend asking for a room in 4, 6, or 8 as those are the best location to everything. This resort is the closest one to the airport, so it is a lot better than Sirenis which is like over an hour away. The resort feels totally safe, I didn't feel like anyone was going to jump me, or try to steal from me at all. There was also no mosquitoes, no wind (other than a nice breeze), and no bugs or anything that I saw. I brought bug spray but never used it. Make sure you bring a ton of sunscreen as if you run out, it's really expensive to buy more.I would go back here again for sure without a doubt. It's a great place.
