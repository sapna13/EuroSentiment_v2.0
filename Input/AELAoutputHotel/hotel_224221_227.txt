{"text":"Pleasant but cramped and overpriced. I booked the romance package as a goof with a friend for a two night three day weekend . This is a very pleasant hotel with an eager to please staff but there are caveats. The whole thing is quite small, only sixty rather smallish rooms, more like copious walk in closets rather than true hotel rooms. The tiny size means it really isn't a full service hotel either and may well not be able to provide you with all services, like late maid service for example.. One thing that isn't small is the price. I am not a tourist but a New Yorker and in some way I really resented the hotel. Basically very minuscule rooms are sold for a fortune, the gimmick being the clever library concepte, but weren't libraries free? Now a book motiff is used to help assure inordinate prices. A clever gimmick to a point, but that is what New York has become these days high, high prices for very, very, very little when you really are honest about it. In that sense the Library hotel fits right in with New York in 2007.  Incidentally on the romance package the perks: flowers, chocolate, etc. are only provided the first night but the full higher tarriff for the package was charged for each night of our two night stay. Furthermore, the champagne was not even champagne but a bubbly Italian wine. For the price I thought that just cheesy. Incidentally, on my second night I did find a bed bug crawling the sheets. Management's response was to offer another room but never offered any consideration from their hefty price. Still, if you don't expect too much for your money, this hotel may just charm you.
