{"text":"Would Definitely Stay Again I stayed at the Aqua Palms in late August along with my travel companion. We booked two of the superior deluxe rooms with diamond head\/ocean view (more like glimpses!). We shopped around online and found the best rate, then rang Aqua Palms and they beat it by 10% We ended up paying around $126 per night, with the fifth night free. Fantastic value! Our check-in experience was not the best - while the majority of staff are very friendly and go out of their way to be helpful, we found ourselves at the mercy of an older woman with glasses who didn't dein to look up and answer our rquest to check in 30 minutes early. She simply walked off into the back room and said they're not ready yet. The rest of the experience was fantastic. The room was spotless, and the decor, while typically bright colours, was first rate. There is a TV\/DVD player, small bathroom, kitchenette with minifridge. Our breakfast pastry was just fine, although it tended to be the same thing every day, which was no bother. We only had the 2-foot lanai but in truth it's so warm and the street below busy, you will not want to be sitting on the balcony below. The proximity to the beach is excellent, a 5 minute walk through the Hilton. The trolley to the Ala Moana mall (do not miss it!) stops right outside the hotel, or would be a 10 minute walk. The location is nice because you are just that little further out of the craziness of the main strip, whilst everything is in walking distance. Most days we walked to the other end of the beach and the surroundings are so nice, it's not a hassle at all. I would definitely go back if I could get a similar deal to previous. I have also recommended the hotel to others.
