{"text":"The best in Barcelona Truly great stay at Hotel 1898 - if you are headed to Barcelona there should be no other choice. Great location - easy access to all major tourist spots - neighborhoods and subways. Clean and chic interiors - great amenities - roof top pool and bar is incredibly cool with great views and stylish setting - indoor spa is unique and very chic with great mix of services - solid business center - rooms are not huge - but very well thought out decorated and clean. Two pane windows so even though we had a partial view of las rambla where on the 3rd floor and the hotel next door was under construction - noise never bothered us at all. The hotel is in the mix of Las Rambla - but it feels quiet and secluded while still being right in the mix of the city. And if you don't like crowds you should not go to Barcelona any way. Easy walking distance to the Boqeuria market - the contemporary art museum - the Gothic quarter and Picasso museum - Placa Catalan and all the other major neighborhoods - plus 2 minute walk to two major subway stations that can take you anywhere you else you might want to go. I travel all the time stay at 5 star (Four Seasons etc) - this is just as good as any 5 start hotel. When we get back to Barcelona - we will stay here without a doubt - its not cheap - but its well worth the money - cant think of a single thing I would change. The perfect place to say for a visit to this great city.
