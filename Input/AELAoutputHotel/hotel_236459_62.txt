{"text":"Fantastic location  I stayed here for 5 nights in early May, as part of my continuing search for a decent hotel for single travellers (i.e. small room acceptable) under EUR150\/night near St Germain. Though I got a great price (for Paris) on the hotel website, I was still disappointed in the overall quality of the hotel  would definitively not return.Pros: Absolutely fantastic location, within a 10 min walk of 3 metro lines, great restaurants\/bars\/cafes, shopping, 20 mins to major museums  the right bank. Room was of decent size  kept very clean, no smoking odors. Most of staff helpful  friendly. Quick check-in\/out procedure.Cons: Unprofessional staff behavior - when I arrived, the cleaning staff were having a huge screaming row downstairs, which could be clearly heard throughout the lobby. This continued for 30 mins; no one did anything to stop it. The staff (I never ate here but the guest computer is right next to the breakfast room) simply threw the silverware into the cutlery trays every morning, making an awful noise. The walls of my room were so thin I could hear every guest on my floor coming  going. The shower pressure was so weak as to be laughable,  the temperature fluctuations were painful. My minibar was only refilled 3 out of the 5 days (I was almost never in the room). The guest computer didn't work well  there was no printer, which was inconvenient.Overall the place just seemed a bit shabby  poorly managed, which is enough to put me off staying there again. I preferred the nearby Hotel de Fleurie, which is in the same price range, but I'd still try another hotel next time. ","annotations":[]}
