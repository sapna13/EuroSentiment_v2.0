{"text":"Great hotel - beware of renovation noise. We stayed in the Carlos V for a long weekend after reading the reviews on this website, and we would agree with all the positive comments made about the hotel.We stayed in room 216, which was a large room which had obviously been recently renovated - laminate floors, tasteful decor and a pristine bathroom. Staff were very friendly, from the front-desk man who rushed out to get our bags as soon as the taxi drew up outside the hotel, to the cheerful and attentive waiters in the lovely breakfast room.The only problem I can see with the Carlos V in the near future is the renovation work being carried out in the building next door. On our last morning we were wakened up at 7am by the noise of lorries delivering air-conditioning units, followed by VERY loud drilling in the wall behind our head. This went on all morning - if it had not been our last day, we would have had to move as we could barely hear each other speak. However, when we went to breakfast, there was no noise disturbance in the breakfast room, which is in the middle of the building. So I would say, go to the Carlos V - it really is as good as the reviews say - but specify that you do not wish to be anywhere near the renovation noise. I'd say, any room with -16 in the number would be a definite 'no'.We'd be happy to visit this hotel again, in a quieter room. ","annotations":[]}
