{"text":"very charming, great location At the Canalhouse Hotel on Keizersgracht, you won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ find an air conditioner, safe, television or mini-fridge in your guest room. However, you will receive a fan, use of the safe at the reception, and ice from the lobby bar (no charge for any of these), as well as character, charm and antiques in abundance everywhere in the hotel. The location is excellent: walking distance everywhere, and we loved the evening glow on the canal from the setting sun. Our room (#19 which faced the rear of the hotel) was very large and bright, and included two massive windows, wing-back style couch and chair, and an antique desk. We enjoyed listening to the frequent ringing of the carillon from the nearby Westerkerk (church) and birds singing. Our favourite restaurants included the Pancake Bakery for excellent pannekoekens (crepes) and poffertjes (tiny pancakes), Haesje Claes and Keuken Van for traditional food, Kantijl en de Tijger for rijsttafel (Indonesian food with a minimum of 11 courses), and Patisserie Pompadour (the Huidenstraat 12 location) for exquisite chocolates and tostis (grilled cheese sandwiches). We also enjoyed smoked eel and vlaamse frites (french fries) with mayo from the street vendors. The Albert Hein supermarket has the best chocolate bars and speculaas (gingerbread cookies) which make unique souvenirs for family and friends back home.For attractions, we recommend the Bloemenmarkt (floating flower market) for a variety of gorgeous flowers (our trip was in June 2006); the Rijksmuseum; the Saturday antique market at the Noorderkerk (church); walking the charming elm-lined canals in the Jordaan district (where our hotel is located) and browsing through the antique, book, and bakery shops; and for something different, a quick jaunt through the Red Light District.We took day trips by train to Alkmaar and Delft. The weekly (Friday) cheese market in Alkmaar is rather √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºtaged√à√\u2020\u2022? If you are interested in pottery, a visit to the DePorceleyne Fles (a factory) and the Lambert Van Meerten Museum in Delft are highly recommended. We enjoyed our day trip by bus to Marken and Volendam: the short ferry ride between these two small towns was relaxing, especially in the hot weather. During all these trips, we enjoyed the scenery of green pastures with grazing cows and sheep, the narrow canals, the occasional windmill, and people√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ immaculate looking homes with tiny, charming front-yard gardens and orange banners in support of the country√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ participation in the world soccer games. We thoroughly enjoyed our one week trip in Amsterdam and the Canalhouse Hotel.
