{"text":"not what you expect from Le Meridien brand 1. We have stayed at this place during our Bali\/Java tour - so we have comparison with other 5* properties in Bali2. We have stayed at many LM hotels around the world - so we can compare with LM Brand standards globallyResult = this hotel unfortunately does not come up to any of the standards.And it is really pitty because the location next to Tanah Lot temple is unique as well as natural setting and grounds of the hotel are very nice. Bales around the grounds are really nice to relax in and watch the ocean.Room (we stayed in exec. suite) - very worn out in condition and very very basic in design\/comfort, though spacious and clean.Service - though balinese smile was there it feels very amateurish and not 'world brand' adequate.Breakfast - well, we have had just coffee, fruit juices and omelette, the rest looked and smelled very unappealing. This might be also caused due to open air style of the restaurant allowing hot and humidity to influence the state of food. We saw some bugs on food additionaly. Choice of food rather basic.Lunch\/Dinner - contrary to bfast the food served at pool grill was tasty and good.In the evening is not much (nothing) happening in the hotel so we decided to take a cab to Seminyak even though it is loooong (45mins) ride, but still worth to leave and enjoy our time.To summarize we choose it for Tanah Lot experience and for this we used our 2 nights there, but we expected also something more, some 5* and Le Meridien experience and this was not delivered. We would not choose this place again and do not suggest others to be the only place for Bali vacations as there is so much more to choose from. Starwood should consider to spent some money on improving this property. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":821,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":815}]}
