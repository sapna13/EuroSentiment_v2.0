{"text":"Chancellor blows the chance to impress!! This hotel definitely caters to those who don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ care about their accommodations but simply need a place to drop off their luggage. The great location and quaint motif are sadly offset by the paper thin walls surrounding a sardine-small room and a lack of customer service. My wife and I decided to go to San Francisco for our five year anniversary. On our first night we were unable to sleep due to the rice paper thin walls. We were able to hear the neighbors√à√\u2020\u2022?television and the details of their conversation. A majority of the staff do not speak English but when you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e lucky to find someone who does they have no desire to help you. I asked for information and assistance to book a show. They simply gave me a couple of numbers and told me to help myself. On our second night my wife woke up at around midnight parched from the hustle and bustle of the day. I called the front desk to purchasesome bottled water. To my dismay they told me they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ offer that since they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have room service. The restaurant and convenience store were both closed. I asked if there was a vending machine nearbyand they replied that there were none on the premises. They directed me to go to a drugstore and begrudgingly I went in the middle of the night in my pajamas and a jacket I regretted doing so immediately when I was accosted by a vagrant asking for asking for money. He was relentless and wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ leave me alone. Needless to say this will be our last stay at Chancellor Hotel on Union Square. ","annotations":[]}
