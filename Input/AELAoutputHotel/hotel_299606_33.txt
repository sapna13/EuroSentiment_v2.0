{"text":"Very Happy at Rendezvous We stayed at the Rendezvous for 4 nights after a wonderful cruise on the Virgo. We were initially taken to a room on a smoking floor with 2 single beds. We instantly refused the room and our helpful porter rang reception and we were immediately taken to a non smoking room with a larger than normal king sized bed. It is a good idea to have the travel agent request a non smoking room when making the original booking. Our room was nice and clean with very high ceilings, with an excellent controllable airconditioner. The pool area is very inviting with a lovely spa. We found the hotel to be very conveniently located with a 7 Eleven and food court across the road. The stunning newly refurbished museum is a 5 minute walk away and well worth a visit - don't forget to have a coffee whilst there - it is the best we found in Singapore. Staff at the hotel were very pleasant and I would suggest prepaying for breakfast if possible as we found it quite good with a Chinese dim sum option. This was the only place where I found the staff a bit lacking. We also pre arranged a 4.00 pm late checkout which timed perfectly with our 7.30 pm flight home. My only negative would be that we were given a $30 spa voucher, when I tried to use it, I was told that prices had increased but surprise, surprise $30, so I cancelled my appointment - the staff were very unimpressive in this establishment. I would like to point out that the Spa is only situated in the hotel and not actually run by the hotel.Overall we enjoyed our stay very much. We paid A$558.00 for 4 nights with late checkout and full breakfast for 2 - not bad for $139.50 per night. We believe that the Rendezvous represented for us really good value for money, rembering that it is not a five star hotel with five star prices; we will definitely stay there again.
