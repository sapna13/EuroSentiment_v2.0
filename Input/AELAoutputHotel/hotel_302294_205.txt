{"text":"Well positioned, helpful staff. No nonsense business hotel based about 20 mins (and 20 dollars) away from airport. Hotel and area recommended by ex pat friend. Couldnt fault price or service. Rooms are immaculate and fairly spacious with plenty of little touches that help weary travellers (toothbrushes, washing powder sachet etc).Hotel is attached to Marina Square mall. From there you can get to the Suntec centre easily without venturing out into the tropical heat. Marina Square has wide range of shops and boutiques including useful large supermarket.Staff attentive when needed - we had them looking after various combinations of bags whilst we travelled. They also do 3pm checkouts for free where availability allows. The use of a room for three hours costs about 30 sing dollars if you need to freshen up on travel days.Internet access is expensive at around 8 sing dollars for 15 mins plus print costs on top.Stylish bar is expensive but is on par with similar hotels around the Island (beer about 14 dollars per bottle, cocktails about 16). It looks good but is one for those on expenses only. Cannot comment on hotel restaurants. Restaurants in Marina square are very good and very cheap. They are certainly not top end and there are a lot of chains (genki sushi etc) however the food is exemplary. For a really cheap meal venture to the food court especially the stall that specialises in the chinese meats.This hotels would suit business travellers and tourists who want a little bit more from a hotel and those who want to be away from the hub bub of Orchard Road. Would not suit those who expect ultra luxury ie the type who like to be carried to their rooms.
