{"text":"Elegant, clean and spacious My husband and I visited Barcelona and booked the Icaria through Hotel Connexions. I was worried that it would be a bit 'out of the way' but as we like to use public transport, we found the hotel after a 15 minute train journey to Passeig de Gracia with a change to the yellow metro line taking us the 4 stops to Ciutadella Vila Olimpica. It was still a 10 minute walk from there but once we found the hotel, we felt comfortable with our choice! Although we were quite early, we were offered a twin room which was ready or the keys to view it to help us decide, or we could wait for the double room we had booked. The receptionist rightly said that the twins were slightly larger and we were glad that we decided to take the twin room. We never had to queue for the reception as there was always plenty of staff on duty, especially booking out time! Food is available all day with some options available all night as well. Breakfast was included in our room rate which we were glad about because quite a few people seemed surprised at breakfast that breakfast wasn't included in their rate and it was an extra 15 Euros each. You can eat 'bar snack' type meals which are reasonable or opt for the restaurant meals. Breakfast was ok for a Spanish hotel with plenty of fresh fruit and pastries, not much choice of cereal and no chance of a decent cup of tea!!! We enjoyed our stay, found the staff very helpful and able to speak good English, comfy beds, good bathrooms....we would love to go there again!
