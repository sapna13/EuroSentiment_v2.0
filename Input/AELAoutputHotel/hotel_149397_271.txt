{"text":"Great trip!!! I just returned from a week long trip to the Bavaro Princess, and have virtually nothing negative to say. I had read the negative reviews on this resort prior to leaving for my trip, and was a little worried. But once there, I realized that I could disregard the negativity. This resort provides a different experience than one would expect in a North American resort, but if you go with an open mind (and a little extra patience), you will have an enjoyable trip!!!RECEPTION:This was the only area that I feel could be improved. It was a little slow to check in. Also, we arrived around 1pm, and our rooms weren't ready until 3pm which was a little frustrating. But no biggie really.ROOMS:No complaints here. The suites were spacious and clean. Housekeeping came every day and replenished towels, washcloths, beach towels, etc.Water pressure in the showers was a little light, but the temperature was always as hot or cold as desired.BEACH:Great beach!!! White sand, light blue water. Had a mixture of calm water and waves during the week I was there. Was great. Non-motorized water sports are included (snorkeling, boogie boards, etc.) and I rarely had to wait to use anything.ACTIVITIES:The night entertainment wasn't phenomenal, but the atmosphere more than made up for it. There is the opportunity to leave the resort to go to discos, but I never did that, so I can't comment on those. But I did hear that drinks were expensive there.FOOD:So-so. Best I've had at a caribbean resort, but not what the typical North American is used to. Good selection though. The beef wasn't too great ... very chewy. But the fruit selection was wonderful!!!!PLATINIUM CLUB:Our travel deal included an upgrade to Platinum, and if I were to return, I would do this again. The little perks that it provides are well worth the little extra cost. Among other things, these rooms are located right at the beach, free massage, free internet, room service is free and premium liquor are all included.
