{"text":"Very, very nice hotel The Harbour Plaza was splendid. The experience started at the airport, where they have their own info desk. They were able to double check the reservation and recommend transportation options to get into town. We wound up taking a taxi, which cost $300 HKD, about $40 US, but it was so much easier than any of the other option that it was worth it. Location is not perfect; the Harbour Plaza sits right on the waterfront in Hung Hom, a couple of miles east of Tsim Sha Tsui. Originally I thought this would be inconvenient. But there is a Star Ferry pier five minute walk from the hotel that runs to Central. The hotel offers a free shuttle to Tsim Sha Tsui, but we never had to use it. By then end of our stay, we were using taxis, which are so much easier than any other form of transit and are not that expensive. Also, Hung Hom\/Whampoa turned out to be a pretty interesting area. It is largely residential, but there are many, many shops, restaurants, etc with in a ten minute walk of the hotel. Food and shopping were not a problem. It is a bit less energetic than Tsim Sha Tsui, and I missed the buzz, but it was nowhere near as isolated as I was afraid it would be.The rooms were perfect, very nice, large, fully equipped. I have stayed in nicer, but not by much. The lobby is absolutely stunning; it is in fact a favorite place for weddings in Hong Kong. And the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ signature feature is a roof-top swimming pool that has a glass wall so that you can look out from the pool over Hong Kong Harbor from 21 floors up. Stunning. We did not eat in the hotel, but the food looked very good. Service was exceptional. Great concierge and bell staff. I whole heartedly recommend this hotel as a slightly quieter alternative to the chaos of Tsim Sha Tsui. Great value for the dollar.
