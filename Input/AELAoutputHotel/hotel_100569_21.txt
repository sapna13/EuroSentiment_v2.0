{"text":"Something special in Seattle We stayed two nights in separate stays at the beginning of September. This is a beautiful historic hotel with wood paneling in the lobby and bar. It is a little bit off the main tourist area up on a hill. The hotel has a very romantic atmosphere √à√\u2020\u2022?as was evidenced by the wedding parties checking in both times we visited. The views are not great since the hotel is not very tall and there are many newer tall buildings between it and the waterfront (an easy walk), but the location is very nice and convenient to the freeways. But who needs to look out the window with such beautifully appointed rooms? The beds are luxurious, with high count sheets and tons of pillows. The rooms include fresh local coffee with a french press and the bathroom amenities are excellent. The furnishings are very tasteful and high quality. We did have some traffic noise on our first stay - this hotel IS in a city. Also, the first room we had overlooked the parking lot, but the main concern was a generator noise that bothered my husband. I requested a room change, and after being made to wait a long time by an obviously new desk clerk, was given an upgrade to a suite by his more experienced co-worker. When we returned for the second stay later in the week, I requested a room on the other, quieter side of the building. And that is when I learned from the staff that the even numbered rooms have the king beds but are on the noisy side, the odd numbered rooms have the queen beds but are quiet. We had an odd numbered room the second time and had a peaceful, quiet evening.Do not miss having a drink in the wood paneled lobby bar - even if you don't stay here.
