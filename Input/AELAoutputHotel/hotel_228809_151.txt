{"text":"Very Disappointing! Have just returned from spending 3 nights at Royal Magda ,I cannot help wondering if I stayed in the same hotel as some of the other reviewers! I booked this hotel because of all the positive reviews I read on Tripadvisor but my experience has left me somewh\\t perplexed! Yes the hotel is spotlessly clean and the location is perfect but the Reception Staff ( Flore in particular) could not have been more unfriendly and unhelpful. The cleaning staff and breakfast staff were very friendly and polite and the gentleman on the reception desk at night was very helpful and obliging.The first problem arose when I asked Flore if she could suggest a restauramnt in the Pont Neuf area as we were gong on the Seine Cruise that evening and it departed from that area. I was amazed when her answer was no she did not know any restaurants in that area! Normally we would check out the net for restaurants but because I was led to believe that she was so helpful to other guests I decided to ask her. We eventually found our own restautant on the net!When we returned that evening I asked Flore if I could take a jug of iced water up to our room. She replied by asking me if I knew there was water in the minibar. Yes I did know but it was a jug of fresh water that I wanted and not bottled water as we had been drinking fresh water in the restaurants since we arrive. She returned with a litre bottle of water and said she would put it on our bill! She kept to her word and we were charged 3Euro on check out!The following evening I asked the night porter for the same jug of iced water and he duly obliged without hesitation!We are not loud or demanding customers and therefore I could not understand the indifference which we experienced. I have never felt so unwelcome in a hotel before and unfortunately although Paris was wonderful this experience has somewhat spoilt the memory.I was very angry when I returned home to discover my daughters were equally upset at our experience as they had arranged the trip for us to celebrate our wedding anniversary and had emailed the hotel to tell them this and to ask them if they could ensure that the trip was a good one. They recieved a reply from Yohan stating that they looked forward to welcoming us and would do their best to make our stay a pleasent one!!!!!!I will not be recommending this hotel to anyone in the future and when I return to Paris I am positive I will find an equally clean hotel with an equally good location but with a welcome!Just a few suggestions for anyone travelling to Paris. If you are taking a Seine Cruise the Vedettes du Pont Neuf are excellent and very good value. Two really good restaurants are Chez Clement (a chain of about 12 restaurants in various areas in Paris. We went twice to the one on the Champs Elysses and found excellend value and great food and if using the open top bus the Bus Rouge is great but the Open Bus (yellow one) is a bit dearer but stops in more places of interest to let passengers off.
