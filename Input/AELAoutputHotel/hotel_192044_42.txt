{"text":"Concierge and Location are Excellent We stayed at the London Bridge Hotel for one night. Our flights got switched around so we arrived at the hotel early in the morning instead of closer to the afternoon check in time. My friend and I both looked worse for wear, but when we got there we were told we could leave our luggage but they wouldnt check us in before the check in time of 2:00. Now after being on an international flight for 8 hrs, then hauling your luggage to figure out what platform the train station you need is on and riding that scary thing was quite the experience. We were hoping that they would find a room for us, but the front desk, had no intention of even checking to see if they could work that out for us. HOWEVER.. although the front desk is sadly lacking in customer service and friendliness, the Concierge is amazing! I cannot begin to tell you how many times we bothered them and asked questions and had them do things for us and they did so without complaint. They were the utmost friendly and so helpful it made me feel bad for asking them to do what they do. There were two men in particular that helped us. I wish I had gotten their names as I do intend to write the hotel and let them know how amazing they are and that the front desk could take some tips from them. An older gentleman.. not old by any means, just older.. gray haired shorter man and another younger man with brown hair and glasses.. very very helpful. They told us exactly what stops to go to for what sites, what type of tickets to buy at the underground so that it saved us money.. they were just extrememly helpful. The room was good. the beds were comfortable, but it was hard to sleep with the bar next door because we were there on Friday night so the music was loud.. but overall, it was a very good experience with this hotel and if I ever had the desire to go back to London (which I dont) I would definitely stay there again!
