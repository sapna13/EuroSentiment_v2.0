{"text":"Excellence was a nice vacation Excellence Punta Cana gave my boyfriend and I a nice vaction. Here is some info on each aspect:Arrival: Yes, the ride from the airport to the hotel is bumpy and there is not much to see but what can you really do about that? Once we got to the hotel we were impressed with how beautiful everything was. Check in was easy- our room wasn't quite ready when we got there so they told us to go eat right next door and it would be ready when we were done and it was.Rooms: I was impressed with the rooms. I thought they were beautifully decorated and very clean. We had a junior suite garden view on the first level so we had a private hammock next to the pond and a patio. The bath was amazing- it is big enough for two and the jets were wonderful. The only thing that was bad was the water pressure in the tub was very low so it took a while to fill. The bed was a little hard but not really a big deal. The minibar was nice too- it kept us hydrated with water, beer, and a small selection of sodas. Food: I thought the food was pretty good. There was always a nice selection. Toscana was our favorite. You could also get room service 24\/7 and that food was pretty good as well. I thought the desserts were fabulous. Great selection and great tasting!! Drinks were pretty good as well. There are bars everywhere!Beach: Beautiful!!!! It is huge and there was never many people there. The water is the atlantic ocean so it is a little rough but fun!!!Pool: Again, beautiful! It is huge so there is always somewhere to go if you wanna relax on a float, get a drink, or play volleyball. Even if you want to get away from everyone else you can! Also, very well maintained.Service: I would say the service was just ok. I've been to other countries in the carribean and was more impressed with the service there. The employees here didn't seem quite as happy or pleasant. It was never to the point where we were annoyed, just not impressed. Also, language barrier is NOT a problem. English is spoken everywhere and even those who you don't typically talk to like the maids speak a few words of english.Activities\/entertainment: Always something to do! The nighttime entertainment was the best, but for the big shows make sure you get there early or you will have to sit in the back with your view obstructed by a pole. The casino is very small, a few blackjack tables and some slots. We didn't really spend much time in there. You get a sheet everynight with a list of all the things to do the next day which was nice to have. The horseback riding was okay too- you get a free 30 minutes with your stay and it's nice but the horses are pretty sad looking.Last tip: Do not shop in the gift shops on site- the prices are very high and they will only come down a few dollars when pushed. There are shops down the beach that are nice. The people are pushy and will give you a ridiculous first offer but you can talk them down pretty much to whatever price you want. Never pay more than 50 percent of their first offer!!!
