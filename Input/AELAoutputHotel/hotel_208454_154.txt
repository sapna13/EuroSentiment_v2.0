{"text":"Decent place to stay I changed my reservation from the Library Hotel (where I have stayed before very happily) to the Sofitel, the week before I travelled, because the Tripadvisor Top 100 hotels list came out and put the Sofitel ahead of the Library and I wanted to see why. I snagged a rate on the hotel website that was comparable to the Library rate (it was cheaper but it did not include breakfast) for a lower floor queen bed room. I arrived at 6pm after 26 hours of travel from Australia and asked for a quiet room and was given an upgrade to the 19th floor. The room itself was a decent size and the bathroom was fabulous compared to the tiny bathrooms at the Library. The toiletries are fantastic and I loved the Orchid in the bathroom and the candle - nice touches. The bed was soooo soft that I woke in the morning with a sore back, but I remedied this by removing the feather-filled topper from the bed for the rest of the stay (its actually a duvet and not a mattress topper proper as far as I could tell). The concierge was fantastic (my bags did not the LA transfer with me and didn't arrive until 6pm the next day, and the Concierge rang to find out where they were for me, when they didn't arrive first thing in the morning as I had been promised at the airport. The location is great (but only a block over from the Library so I didn't see that as a deal breaker). I had room service my first night and it was fantastic although expensive - arrived promptly and was soooo huge (soup, grilled cheese sandwhich, fries and chocolate cake) that I kept half of it and had it when I woke up with jet-lagged promptness at 6am (ie 2am NYC time) hungry. I also had the continental breakfast one morning and that provided enough for lunch as well. My only complaints are that the ceiling of my bathroom was really icky - mouldy and stained. very unattractive. and i was charged for internet use on my first night when I could not have used it because my internet cables and plugs were in my bags somewhere in LA and my laptop battery was dead after the trip. Although I have brought it to the attention of management, no one has bothered to reply and no refund has been forthcoming, which I think is poor service.Next time I will head back to the Library because I like it there, but I would happily stay at the Sofitel again - it was a perfectly decent place to stay.
