{"text":"Not Impressed at all! Stayed at the Oasis Jan. 13 - 20Not Impressed at all.......Got to the Hotel and had to wait 3 hours for our room to be ready. 3 hour in the non-air conditioned heat waiting is not fun. Group of 8 of us, 4 rooms and not 1 was ready for our stay.Room was Ok, big and fairly clean but nothing special....stayed in building 3 close to the pool and beach. Location of the building was good, but very loud at nights due to the bar out the window. Had to call twice to get the air conditioning going, and it was unpredictable throughout the entire week.Beach was nothing like what i remember Punta Cana to be (stayed in Barcelo - Punta Cana last year and it was 100 x better) full of sea weed and the water was not clear. the further South you go the better.The entertainment was horrible, and I do not expect much from the all inclusive shows.....just bad, dont waste any of your time! Cant describe how bad it really was!If your going on an excursion dont buy from the booth poolside, although they are cheaper then the tour operators in within the hotel the product is inferior; Sona Island tour was ok but the boat was a little more run down then others, ATV's broke down every two seconds. Oh ya 20 min. drive = 2 hours!!!Not going to comment on the food b\/c it is pretty much what I expected, ok but not great.3 * at best, spend the extra money and go to barcelo - punta cana or baha principe, beaches, service and atmosphere far superior!I do not reccommend this place to anyone, ","annotations":[]}
