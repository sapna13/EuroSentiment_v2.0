{"text":"Pacific Club Rooms First stay at the Pan Pacific. I was travelling alone on Business. Since there are a number of reviews on the hotel I thought I would focus on the Pan Pacific Club Floor. Simply, the Hotel and Staff were excellent. The Club floor rooms are on upper floor of the Hotel providing outstanding views of the city. Upon arriving at the hotel you go the the Pacific Club Desk and are then escorted to a private checkin area on the 33rd floor. The elevators to the checkin desk are on the exterior face of the building offering spectacular views of the city. Upon checkin you will be greeted by the most hospitable of hosts who will remember you name the entire stay. You will recieve a cool fresh fruit drink and towel while being quickly checked in. Staying on the Pacific Club floor offers a number of ammenities that make it worth the additional price. First there are lounges on the 33rd and 34th floor for Pan Pacific Club guests. The 33rd Floor Lounge is open 24 hours with complimentary coffee, tea , juice and light snacks. Complimentary is the theme while staying on these floors... Choice of breakfast is served on the 33rd floor ( American) , the Lobby Lounge ( Continental) ; Global Kitchen Restaurant ( Buffet) or in-room dining. There is afternoon tea ( 3-5PM), Cocktails and Hors d'Oeuvres ( 5:30-7 PM) and Liquor Service ( 8-10) on the 34th Floor Club. In addition there is a complimentary in-room mini-bar stocked daily with beer, Liquor, water and soda. Internet access and local calls as well as the pressing of 3 garments are also complementary. The rooms are very spacious and well appointed. Plenty of storage as there are two closets and numerous dresser draws. There is an ironing board and iron in each room. The room has a large flat panel TV and DVD player. The Bathroom is very large and luxurious. Marble everywhere. L'occitane bath products , hair dryer, shaving kits , tooth brush and paste are included. There is a seperate shower and bath. There are a number of very good restaurants in the hotel. Even with all the ammenties the outstanding service throughout the hotel is what really stood out.
