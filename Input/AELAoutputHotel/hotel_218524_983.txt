{"text":"Amazing Honeymoon in Paradise My husband and I went to the Excellent Punta Cana Resort for our honeymoon between 7\/9\/07 and 7\/17\/07. We have nothing but good things to say about this place. The staff were absolutely excellent and the hotel accomidations were superb.You should have some general knowledge before coming to the DR, but it shouldn't be surprising for a 3rd world tourist country. When you arrive, there is a $10 entrance fee into the country, and the drive to the resort is about 1-1.5 hours (but the resort is well worth the drive).Once arriving at the resort we were greated with cold towels and champagne. We booked our room under the excellence club level, which has a separate check in\/ check out and seemed to get us into our rooms much quicker than standard guests. We stayed in building 7, facing the garden, which we really enjoyed because it was more private compared to the pool\/ ocean view rooms. The room was very nice, with a complementary fully stocked minibar (beer, soda, gatorade, water + vodka\/ rum\/ gin\/ wiskey for excellence level) which was refilled upon request and at least daily. The room had a 2 person sized jacuzzi tub, king sized bed, separate shower\/ toilet area, closet with safe, and balcony. In other reviews people complained about the air conditioning, but we never experienced a problem and the room was always cool and comfortable. The matress is VERY FIRM, which didn't bother us all that much. The resort was beautiful from corner to corner. The pools wrap around the entire resort and there were always available lounge chairs and towels. We were told the resort was 90% full on our stay, but we couldn't tell at all - the resort is so large there is always room for everyone without feeling crowded. The beach is made up of beautifully white sand and has hammocks and palm branch huts with two lounge chairs scattered down the beach front. The ocean was rough for all of our stay, but we had heard about this in other reviews and were expecting it.. besides the pool is perfect for cooling off; and my husband went in the ocean every day without any problems.The staff were great. The cleaning staff came twice per day, once to clean and once to turn down the bed. The resort is filled with waiters that serve drinks at the pool and beach. In the afternoons, they also served pizza\/ nachos\/ burgers\/ or fruit. Everyone was very friendly and there wasn't any pressure to give tips (although we did tip a few dollars everyday for good service).The restaurants were also very good. The resort has 7 restaurants with a bunch a variety for whatever your in the mood for (italian, french, mediterianian, mexican, japanese, american, and a lobster house). Our favorite was the mediterranian, but we enjoyed every meal (especially the desserts). We truely enjoyed this vacation and will definately return. It was a honeymoon in paradise and we highly recommend it for an all inclusive.
