{"text":"Excellent Charlesmark We have just returned from a week's holiday in Boston and stayed at the Charlesmark throughout.Having read the reviews on here we requested a Queen room on the 6th floor. This was perfect for our needs, we overlooked the Boston Public Library and the marathon finishing line. There was no noticeable noise and we were certainly not disturbed by anything.The room was not massive but plenty big enough and very comfortable. Not a lot of hanging space for clothes but loads of shelving space so that was not a problem, the iron and ironing board were a nice touch too. The shower room was excellent and a high quality range of toiletries were provided each day. TV\/audio facilities were brilliant, the DVD\/VHS library was a bonus - after a day's walking and sightseeing there were a couple of evenings when we did not feel like going out so just relaxed and watched a film in our room.The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, the rooms were very clean, there was tea\/coffee\/fresh orange availabe free of charge in the lounge 24\/7 and bottled water left in the room each morning. Breakfast was fine, staff were vigilant in keeping everything topped up. Bagels\/doughnuts\/muffins\/jams\/cream cheese\/oats\/fresh fruit\/coffee\/tea\/orange juice all very fresh and plentiful.Free use of internet and printer was very useful especially when it came to printing boarding passes for return journey.Very best of all though was the perfect location, right in the middle of everything with the green line T station just over the road. We loved Boston and cannot speak highly enough of the Charlesmark. We could not fault it or its staff in any way and would highly recommend it to everyone. If there was anything at all I could have wished for it would be a safe in the room but reception would have been happy for us to use their safe had we requested it.Go, go, go! Enjoy!!
