{"text":"Almost very good Stayed at the LB for three nights last week and it does what it says on the box. It is worth paying the money for the new rooms which run from x21 to x30. PositivesThese are among the largest rooms you will get for your money at this class of hotel in London. Clean bright and airy with an absolutely huge bed and great linen. Lots of wardrobe and cupboard space. Good writing desk with network node if you want to work.Good clean bathroom, complimentary bathrobes and slippers, first class towels.Staff are friendly and efficient as is check in and checkout.London Bridge station is a major asset as all the trains from Kent to Charing Cross stop there, - every 2 or 3 minutes. DO NOT TAKE THE TUBE if you want to go to theatreland. You will have to change at Waterloo for the Northern Line and walk about half a mile underground at the interchange. Instead catch the train from the main line station (Platform 6) to Charing Cross and you will be there in 5 minutes. Only √ä√£¬¢1.40 single rather than √ä√£¬¢4 tube fare!NegativesIf you have one of the new rooms do not stay on the first floor as you will be over an LA Fitness Gym. You will wake up to the sound of incessant drum and bass played at 120 decibels coming through your floor.Try to ensure that your room does not have a connecting door to another as they are not soundproofed and your conversations soon turn onto a quartet. Breakfast is the usual homogenised buffet - format crap that they serve up all over London. Fried eggs are like rubber balls and the scrambled eggs have the texture of cavity wall insulation. I asked if the kitchen could cook me two lightly fried (runny) eggs on toast, but got two more golf balls for my trouble. They can make a half decent double expresso if you ask for it.I would still recommend this hotel heartily, but make sure that to book a higher floor and eat breakfast at the little Italian cafe round the corner on Borough High Street ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1674,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1669},{"endOffset":1674,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1669},{"endOffset":1674,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1669}]}
