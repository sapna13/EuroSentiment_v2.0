{"text":"Fantastic stay at Dreams My mom and I just returned from our first visit to Punta Cana and we had an incredible stay at Dreams Punta Cana. Check in was quick and easy. It was great not having to wear a wrist band or use towel vouchers. Bottled water is available at no charge everywhere at the resort and in your room. Drink lots! The ala cart restaurants were also fantastic with no reservations required. They were all open every night, the menus were great, portions were perfect, and the meal presentation was always beautiful. The serenading three amigos singing happy or romantic songs made dinner extra fun. It would definitely not have been the same without them! Service at the ala cart restaurants was superb. We basically only ate at the main buffet for breakfast and it was excellent every day. We grabbed burgers and a brat from the beach grill a few times, good as well but a couple of burgers were served quite rare. I echo others√à√\u2020\u2022?comments on the Entertainment team; excellent, dedicated, and talented group. Rooms vary and we did change rooms initially, which was difficult and took over a day to accomplish. We were overall happy with the quality of both rooms, however the first room on the first floor of building 6 was noticeably very musty and we had wedding formalwear with us. The second room was very similar, not quite as nice but no musty smells lingering so we were happy to hang our dresses there. Note that it is a tropical climate and your clothes will have some odor when you return.Service everywhere in the resort was very friendly. They always have a smile and usually some song and dance. Drinks were sometimes an issue. Bartending across the resort is not consistent, but they are always friendly none-the-less. A couple of mornings we ordered mimosa at breakfast and it never arrived. We joined others in making our own on the last morning from the unattended cart of champagne and orange juice. The only consistent drinks were the drinks premixed in the machines and then it was a challenge to have the liquor added to the mix. Drinks were seldom shaken or mixed well. Most common was to have the liquor poured on top of the slushy drink and handed to you with a straw. We had to stir most of our drinks before we could drink. There is bottled beer in the lobby bar and they have Bud, Bud Light and MGD in the back. They are randomly out of these and then only offer the local Presidente beer. I found I could get a Bud Light about every other time I asked for one.Be very cautious about security. Honesty is not a forte, but the staff is super friendly none-the-less. I imagine lost and found is always empty. We had a quick disappearance of an envelope with $25 left at the check in counter and it was gone in a flash. When we called from our room to the front desk we were transferred back a forth and finally after about 20 minutes we just walked back to the front desk and no luck getting any answers. We went on to have a fabulous vacation, but it was a little reminder to be diligent with using the safe and keeping track of any valuables. Overall this is one of the best all inclusive resorts I have stayed and it was an incredible value. I definitely enjoyed every minute of my stay and was not quite ready to go home after seven nights.
