{"text":"Not what we had expected We stayed during the Christmas holiday after spending a wonderful week on Isla de Vieques. The hotel was pleasant enough at first, but then things got pretty bad. We had a room with 2 full size beds. After the first night, my husband was getting bitten by some sort of bug. I don't believe they were bed bugs. We spoke to housekeeping, and they said they would change the bedding  bedspread. This did not help. My husband asked to change rooms, and they wouldn't comply. They said they would change the mattress. This didn't happen. So after the 2nd night of being bitten up, we asked to change rooms again. The people at the front desk said they couldn't do this. It was only after we mentioned Trip Advisor, they finally agreed to change our room. After that the bug bites stopped. The hotel is pleasant enough for the price but be advised there is alot of walking to be done. There are no elevators but is is only a 2 floor hotel. We were traveling with our young children, so if you forgot something in your room, it's up the steps. It's also a distance to the washer  dryer, and if you use the larger pool with the slide next to the mini golf course, it's another LONG walk and a full flight of stairs down to the pool.So if you have a problem with stairs or traveling with small children, you may want to think twice! The staff was very pleasant but we started off on the wrong foot. We ate breakfast out at several different bakeries. Most served some sort of egg sandwhich or french toast (for the kids). It was cheaper than eating in the hotel restaurant. For dinner, try heading down to the seaport where there is a road lined with many restaurants.
