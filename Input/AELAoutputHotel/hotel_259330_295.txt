{"text":"Sketchy Resort But Awsome Vacation!!! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Grand Paradise Bavaro on April 24th through to the 1st of May. (Stay in either building 6 or 3)It was a wonderful vacation, however I do not reccommend staying at this resort if you have high standards. I have stayed in Punta Cana once before at the Bavaro Princess and had high expectations because of that.The beach was amazing and we could always find a good place to sit under a cabana or in the shade, so feel free to wake up at any time and there will still be enough room to find a nice place by the ocean. The pool seating however, is much harder to find a place. Food was not terrible, but not great. The heat made it difficult to eat so it didn't bother us too much anyway. We didn't make it to all of the a la carte restaraunts, but the Asian one is amazing!Rooms were clean, however lacked character. Definatly keep a room card in the air conditioner at all times! It was a life saver. If need be, you are able to change your rooms at the front desk easily.If you can, take the trolly to the Club section of the resort. There they have a swim up bar and a nice pool. We spent a couple of days there. It is definatly more quiet and you can always find room under an umbrella or at the pool bar.The other reviews were right about a couple things;- gift shop over priced and girls very rude. (go next door to the Barcelo resort their gift shop much cheaper)- service is not so great- drinks are VERY strong (especially their rum drinks I reccommend the Dupresa Dominica or the Sex on the Beach) Some tips: * Bring a travel mug for drinks (the cups are TINY and they get warm very quickly).* If you get an injury, even a scrape go to the medical centre (I didn't do this for blisters on my feet, then they got seriously infected and was put on IV for 5 days when i got home). not fun.* Tips Help a lot ($1 or $2 US for bartenders and maids)* NEVER take the first offer the market gives to you. I bought a ring down there for $20 CAD when they wanted $75 US. My boyfriend bought 25 Cigars for $70 US when they wanted $250. Enjoy! I miss it already!
