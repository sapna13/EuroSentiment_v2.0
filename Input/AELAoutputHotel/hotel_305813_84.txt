{"text":"Beautiful but major stressed me out twice! The hotel was clean, beautiful, convenient. Every detail from the scent to the paper to the bathroom mirror was executed with OC-ness. The hotel staff were very sincere, friendly, helpful  anticipated my needs. When the ref in the room was not cold, it was replaced within 5 minutes.EXCEPT, the reservations group badly needs improvement. And this caused me so much stress during my vacation.First, I emailed them to move my reservation forward by 1 day since my flight was cancelled due to Typhoon Nuri. They emailed back that this has been arranged. But when I checked in, they informed me that I was only booked for 1 night since I booked through a travel agency  they could only accept accomodation changes from the travel agency (hotels.com). It seems that I wasn't able to check another email they sent correcting their earlier email saying that it was all arranged. So I had to waste my precious vacation time emailing the travel agency  fretting over this. The next morning, the travel agency emailed me that they already extended my stay. I forwarded this email to the reservations group with a message that I hope everything is all cleared. It wasn't. After a whole day of shopping, tired and sore, the keys to the room weren't working! Had to go down to the front desk . They informed me that I was supposed to be checked out already! It seems that the reservations group was still waiting for further email confirmation from the travel agency. Couldn't they have just taken my forwarded email at face value? Or couldn't they just have called the agency? I spoke with the duty manager and said that I wasn't okay anymore. She sent me a new key right away and said they were sorry for the situation. I sent Langham an email regarding my experience but still no response 1 day later. ","annotations":[]}
