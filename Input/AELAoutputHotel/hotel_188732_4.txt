{"text":"Great Location, Lovely Hotel We stayed at the Meurice just before Thanksgiving in November 2007. The day we arrived in Paris a transportation strike had begun. It literally began the day we arrived--we had read about the impending strike the day before in the American newspapers. Luckily, the hotel had already booked someone to meet us at our gate. This person ushered us through customs, helped us retrieve our luggage and euros from the ATM and brought us right to our waiting car and driver. Thank goodness for that because there was no other way out of the airport! We arrived at the hotel in the very early a.m. and the staff was ready to greet us. We sat at the little desk in the reception area and they helped us through all of our plans in terms of museum tickets, etc.. We had planned to go to Versailles and also had made many restaurant reservations prior to our arrival. These were now in jeopardy because there were no taxis, trains or metro. The hotel was very helpful in ordering chauffered cars for us for everything. This was a huge added expense, but some of the pain was taking away by how wonderfully gracious they were in handling everything. Our room was prepared immediately and we were able to go in and rest right away. Room service was excellent, decor and cleanliness were top notch. Our view was of a courtyard which was as expected. The staff was friendly and helpful. When we had (many) technical problems with the DVD player and the stereo they came and replaced the entire system. The day we went to Versailles we were celebrating our anniversary and we returned to a lovely bottle of champagne with special treats.There are two wonderful things about this hotel: the location--can't beat it--and the staff. On our last day we were flying to Rome on an early (7 a.m.) flight. We had ordered the car for 4:30 a.m.. We came down, the car was packed and ready to go. As we were leaving, the concierge asked us if we would like him to confirm our flight to Rome. Guess what? The air traffic controllers at Orly had decided to join the transport strike. We were to be meeting some officials at the Vatican as we were renewing our wedding vows at the Vatican on Thanksgiving Day. The staff at the hotel literally got on the phone and started to see what they could do to get us out of Charles De Gaulle. They sent us back up to our room (free of charge) for hours while they booked us new flights. This saved our vacation.I have heard great things about the Four Seasons Georges V, but I must say The Meurice holds up in terms of service and location.
