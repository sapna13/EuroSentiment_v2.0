{"text":"Extremely helpful staff, Great location, Clean After staying at the Tourist House Liberty for three nights with my girlfriend and our friend, I couldn't believe some of the negative reviews I read here.First off, the manager, Max, was as helpful and friendly a person as we met on our entire vacation. His recommendations were flawless, andhis attention to detail and willingness to accomodate all requests were refreshing. My girlfriend also had made the reservations with him via email, very conveniently.As for the hotel itself, we were happy with the overall quality and even impressed, especially for the price. Our room was on the second floor of the building that houses Tourist House Liberty (the hotel occupies only the second floor of a 7 story building). Our bed was very comfortable, as were the clean sheets, and the cot that was arranged for our friend fit in the spacious room just fine, and was comfortable as well. The view of the neighborhood out the window was great, and the bathroom seemed almost new, with a large shower\/tub that had GREAT water pressure (always nice to find while traveling).The hotel was also centrally located, as other reviews mentioned, and felt very safe. (There were some rowdy partiers on the street at night, and as you got closer to the train station it was a bit sketchy at night too, but the hotel felt very secure.)Perhaps our expectations were set lower than other travelers, as we are young and were not looking for a luxury hotel, just a clean comfortable place to stay for a few nights...but I have stayed at various outstanding hotels in other cities in recent years, and if going back to Florence, would definitely stay at Tourist House Liberty again.
