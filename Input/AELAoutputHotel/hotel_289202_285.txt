{"text":"great-even for fussy travellers Well I think all the other reviews say it all. I have to say with such good reviews you get suspicious that the hotel is commissioning people to write reviews-but it does actually live up to its reputation! The hotel is a few minutes walk from the Piazza Roma (bus station) and there are convenient buses from the airport. It was a relief that we only had to wheel the suitcases a short distance -with only two small bridges (steps!). We had a room overlooking the canal which was magical -particularly opening the windows in the morning and seeing the buzz on the canal below. The room was beautifully decorated and of a good size. Minor gripe that the bathroom smelt a bit fusty but not because it wasn't clean as everything was spotless but more to do with the perils of shower curtains. The bed was really comfortable and this is coming from somebody who is obsessed with having proper cotton sheets and good pillows! The breakfast in the morning was great and well worth the 5euros (it costs that much for a coffee alone in some places!). It was approx 15 minute walk to St Marks Square but the walk was great-and it was nice to be away from the hectic atmosphere of the Square.Reception were really helpful with directions and recommended some great places to eat. For a special night we would definitely recommend  La Columbina-fantastic food (best steak ever!) and enthusiastic service.What more can I say-we will definitely be back!See you soon Antiche Figure!!
