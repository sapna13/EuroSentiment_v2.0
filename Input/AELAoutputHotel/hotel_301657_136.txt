{"text":"All Around Excellent The Park Hotel Tokyo is located in the new modern Shiodome section of Tokyo. You can walk underground to the train station, the subway station, and the new monorail station. The nearby train station is only two stops away from Tokyo Station where you can connect to all other lines. The hotel is also only a 15 minute walk from Ginza where the kabuki theater is located. The walk is a simple direct route and very safe and well lighted even late at night.The front desk staff and concierge speak excellent English and are very helpful and solicitious. The lobby is gorgeous and the room very nice although not large. The restroom is very nice and the toiletries nicely aromatic. There are two computers available for complimentary internet use. We were there in late August when the weather was still somewhat hot and humid and we really appreciated the ice machine on our floor which also dispensed cold water so we could always enjoy ice water in the room. Also very convenient was the Family Market on the building's ground floor, equivalent to a 7-Eleven, where you could buy snacks, drinks, hot food, medicine and toilietries. We would definitely stay at the Park Hotel again.We booked online and got a special rate of 18,000 yen for making our reservation early. The front desk advised me that special rates are only available online so making reservations at the hotel's website is recommended. If you are unable to book at the Park Hotel Tokyo, in the building next door is the Villa Fontaine Shiodome, also a good choice. The Villa Fontaine is a business class hotel chain and many of their locations are not so nice, but the Shiodome location is new and very nice. We stayed there for two nights when the Park Hotel was full. At the Villa Fontaine Shiodome we had a 13,000 yen weekend rate which included a simple breakfast. The Villa Fontaine has self service washing machines and dryers on every other floor.
