{"text":"Service Was Good! I think it's important to know what you want when you book a hotel in San Francisco. Me, I want grandiose!!! I thought with The Clift I was giving up grandiose for contemporary greatness. It was ok.I want a hotel that WOWs me when I walk in.. The Clift was dark, and just ok to me. The Redwood Room was just ok to me as well. I guess I didn't get it. Someone commented that at The Clift you give up comfort to be at the hip hotel. But, I didn't want hip, I wanted extravagence. I should have payed better attention to those other reviews.SERVICE: Upon arrival the doorman were great. I never opened a door for myself as other poster have stated. We even used the semi-limonsine service that parks out front to get around. Expensive, but we were celebrating our anniversary and didn't care about the cost, not for that, at least. The front desk was also helpful and even gave us a 2:30 late check outROOM: It was big, since we booked a junior suite, but the bed was very hard. The bedding was nice and the mirrors surrounding the bed are nice. But the rest of the furniture in the room is uncomfortable and cheap looking. There were two TV's in the room but they are pretty small. I didn't care so much about that, since I was not there to watch TV.REDWOOD ROOM: OK, here is where I don't get it. So to be hip you hang out at the Redwood Room. We arrived back to the hotel after seeing a play, and we got help from one of the ladies at the door in getting a drink. That was nice. What I didn't like was they played very loud hip music. I was on my anniversay, and wanted to dance, but no one was dancing, slow or fast. The dance floor was somewhere in the back with people standing on it and talking, I think. Never could make it back that far in the room. My daughter later told me that nowadays, they don't play slow music to dance, until right before closing, if even then. The people were all crowded around yelling at one another, since you can't hear cause the music is so loud. To get a table at The Clift you have to buy a bottle of some kind of booze, starting at $200.00+. It was the end of our evening, around midnight, and weren't going to pound down a bottle or even close, so we got no seat. My husband and I stood there and watched people. It's a younger crowd mainly, with a few old foogies trying to pick up on young women. Not my scene. No view, no seat, and I did not see one celebrity, just some young people with cute attire. I'm in SF and I want a view and some ambience, something, but at the Redwood room, I could have easily been been in someone's garage for what it was.OVERALL: I would give this hotel three stars. I should have booked the Fairmont or any other Hotel in Nob Hill, or maybe the St. Regis or the Hilton. Not sure how it can be identified as a Four star hotel, since that's just one star from being a fairmont, or St. Regis. This is a three star at best.
