{"text":"Fantastic vacation My family of four (2 adults, 2 teens) stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from 8\/21 to 8\/28\/07. The hotel is immaculate, always people cleaning, sweeping etc. Staff is very friendly. 1) food - there is so much food you could eat all day long if you wanted to. The breakfast buffet has pancakes, waffles, french toast. bacon, potatoes cereals, fresh fruit (the mango is delicious), muffins and danish, etc etc. We always had lunch at the buffet by the pool. Also plentiful - fish, burgers\/hotdogs, salads, pasta, and a variety of other things, too many to mention. Plus great desserts and an ice cream bar.Dinner - buffet was good, got alittle monotonous after a few nites.We ate at La Dorada (seafood) and the Gourmet restaurants.They were both very good.2) Beach\/Pool - very clean. Beautiful beach, silky sand, lots of palapas for shade at the pool and at the beach. Beach vendors a short walk from the hotel. Lots of fun, be sure to negociate your price. You can do well, but do not pay the asking price, they will bargain with you. Lots of activities at the pool \/ beach if you want to partake - beach volleyball, water aerobics, water polo, dance lessons, bingo etc. There was a live band also a few times during the day.3) rooms - very nice, comfortable. Bed alittle hard but not too bad.4) night life - it is what you make it - there are shows at night if you want to do that - or you can walk over to the Dominicana where there is a small casino. There are also lobby bars. Not too much night life, but we were so tired from being in the sun all day that it didn't matter much to us.5) Overall - one of the most beautiful places to visit. Hotel is landscaped beautifully, lush and tropical. Staff is friendly, service was always good. We were extremely happy with our vacation at the Iberostar Bavaro.
