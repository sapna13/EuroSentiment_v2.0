{"text":"Fanstic Hotel - Highly Recommened Went to Barcelon from the 11th -15th Aug. We chose to stay at Hotel Jazz after reading the reviews on trip advisor.The hotel we thought was great. Rooms are nice and spacious. The only downside to ours was that the main window\/door in the room faced the inner courtyard, which meant we didnt have a great view, but this didnt really bother us. Bathroom was really modern, with a good supply of toiletriees. When we booked we requested a double bed, which we got but later found out it was two singles pushed together. We also had a small tv in the room but this only had a few channels in english.You also get a mini bar in your room, but dont be fooled as you have to pay for what is inside it! There is also a safe in the room which is free to use.Staff at the hotel were very pleasent, always saying hello and were very helpful. The reception staff spoke very good English.We didnt eat at the hotel, but the resturant did look very nice, but always seemed empty. We did have a drink in the bar while waiting to use the internet, it is responably priced, unlike some places in the town. The pool was a great way of relaxing after a long, hot day sight seeing, but you need to get there early as there a very few sun loungers and chairs. The pool bar is also very good, offering soft drinks, beer and snacks, which you can either pay for there and then or have then charged to your room. Overall we found Barcelona a very pleasent city, but one which we would go to once as we saw everything we wanted to see.During the 4 days which we was there we went on the Bus touristic, the aquarium and the zoo. Being a young couple in our early 20's we wasnt to fussed about seeing the old buildings etc, but we found the Bus touristic very helpful as it takes you round three routes, which takes you to the main sites such as Sagrada Familia, the Olympic Staduim and Barcelona Football ground. The bus offers a hop on hop off services which means you can visit the sites you want to in one trip. We got our tickets from a information desk, and with them you get a massive booklet with discount vouchers for other attractions and for resturants (so its a good idea to do it at the beginning our you holiday)We also visted the aquaruim. This was good but not worth the money and queue to get in. The zoo was really good although is situated outside the main town which meant getting a train. The Metro was really handy and easy to use. One thing we did find in Barcelona was that it is VERY expensive! We also found it quite difficult to find a decent resturant to have dinner in and a nice bar to have a drink. One bit of advice we would give is to buy your snacks and drinks from the supermarket, situated on the Rambles. Here it is very cheap. On our last evening we went down to get some breakfast for the next morning and ended up paying 2euros for a packets of 8 Croissants and a few other bits. We were paying 12 euros a day for exactly the same in the cafes. The resturants that we would recommend would be the Hard Rock Cafe, which is at the top of the Rambles, by the main square. Stay away from Mickeys which is further down the Rambles by the port. This resturants sting you with the drinks. We paid 7euros for a glass of coke, which is a silly price to pay plus the food wasnt great! We found a really nice bar which was reasonably priced, just off the Rambles (in the street between Mcdonalds and KFC) it was called My Bar. Staff are mainly English and it had a really good atmosphere.
