{"text":"Recommended: high quality, good location The hotel is very nicely situated between Shaftesbury and Seven Dials on Monmouth St, right across the street from the Monmouth Coffee Shop and very near the Neals Yard cheese shop. It is within easy walking distance of Piccadilly, Soho, the West End theatres, Bloomsbury, and Fitzrovia. It is also close to the Covent Garden underground station and to buses.The hotel is extremely nicely furnished with original touches that take it out of the ordinary. It is a pleasure to walk into. The drawing room on the first floor is inviting. My room (212) was very tastefully furnished, with colors and patterns and textures that harmonized interestingly. The decoration scheme is thought out and individual. The room had high ceilings but was small. It was fine for one person; it would be uncomfortably small for two people. The room looked out onto Shaftesbury but the double-glazing kept street noise to a minimum during the 4 nights of my stay. There was no internal noise.Task lighting is minimal - two lamps with low wattage bulbs. No doubt they would have substituted higher wattage bulbs had I asked. The overhead chandelier cast a rather harsh light. There are no clocks in the room but they supplied one upon my request. The bedding was comfortable and firm, with high-quality linens. The armchair was somewhat rigid and less comfortable than one would like.The closet was supplied with enough hangers for one person for a 4-day stay; they of course will supply more upon request. There is somewhat minimal drawer space.There are the usual amenities, including a good quality bathrobe and absorbent towels. The tub is large, with an unusually strong shower - up to US standards - that the drain cannot quite keep up with. The toiletries are by Miller Harris - I would recommend a different brand or a different choice of perfume within the brand.The staff are young, accommodating, competent, and eager to be of service. They remember one's name and one's plans and follow through on requests. They are a plus of the hotelThere is a laptop with free internet access available for use in the front desk area. In one's room, wireless is not free and the cost seemed high.Upon being shown the honesty bar next to the drawing room I said, Oh, I read about this. The staff person said, nodding his head, The Trip Advisor comment. He showed me that the prices were clearly posted and said that people sometimes did not keep track of the number of times that they topped up their glasses. He noted that there was a video camera recording usage.I looked at their website and saw that their lowest price (220 pounds) was not listed as available for the time of my stay. I emailed them directly and asked for a room at that price and received it.London probably has the dreariest, most expensive, noisiest, and smallest hotel rooms of any major city. The Covent Garden Hotel is the one that I have most enjoyed staying at - with comparisons including the Connaught and Durrants. It has best maximized location and quality within its price range. I recommend it.
