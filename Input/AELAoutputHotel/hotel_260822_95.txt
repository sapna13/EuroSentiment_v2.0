{"text":"A Great Base in Central Florence The first good thing about this hotel is the location. It's a few minutes from the train station and right in the middle of Florence - without being noisy or smelly. No more than 2-3 minutes from the Duomo and within walking distance of all the sights. We stayed for 5 nights. The first night in a large room overlooking the road - this had a lovely view but was a little noisy. The next 4 we spent in a room on the rear side of the hotel. This didn't have much of a view but had plenty of natural light and you did overlook some lovely old buildings. Both rooms were large amd stylishly furnished with excellent bathrooms and were extremely clean. There was a public computer in the reception area and internet was free in your room with a laptop. Every evening the hotel puts on a happy hour with the first drink free. This was a good way to mix with other guests if so inclined. Breakfast is buffet style with cereal, coffee\/tea, cold meats, cheese etc. The food was fresh and plentiful.All of the staff were professional and friendly. One was of great help to me in working out where I could buy tickets for the Fiorentina game (Florence's Serie A soccer team). I wouldn't have managed this without their help. The husband\/wife team were helpful and obviously work hard to provide a quality operation. I would have no hesitation in staying here again and would certainly recommend the hotel without reservation. ","annotations":[]}
