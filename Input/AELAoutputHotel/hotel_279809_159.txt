{"text":"Excelente! alright so we stayed here for a week from feb 24 to march 3, and we thought everything was great!! for anyone who says the food was horrible...has no idea what they are talking about...some say it caters to Europeans...well if that means the food has flavor, then i guess you are all right! the lasagna at the italian a la carte is great, and themain buffet is great too...so yes they have the same food everyday...but when you complain about it, ask yourself when was the last you had bacon eggs (scrambled, boiled, sunny side and and omelette) sausage, pancakes, cereals, fruit for breakfast all at once...who wakes up 6 hours before they have to to make that kind of a breakfast? pace yourself and the variety is endless. The dinner at the main buffet is great, but i must say the seafood a la carte was the only dissapointment, only one main fish dish included in the All Inclusive price. the main buffet was dangerous...you must try the cheese table...oh my gawd the cheese table...the rooms were clean and comfortable with a huge picture window in the bathroom~! the grounds are spotless, the pool is great and the beach is beautiful, and yes wake up at 6AM if you want a good spot on the beach...and word of advice dont show up 10 and then steal someones shade...the animations team was good fun, the club with 80 poeple maximum is as good as you want to make it...never a big crowd (not that they could fit) but if you go with intention of dancing like fool then you will have a great time...drinks..great capuccinos at the lobby bar, great sex on the beach at the beach bar, great gin and tonics at Calypso, and most importantly great beer throughout the resort.overall had a great time and i would definately go back to this place. it was one the cheaper properties we could find, but it really exceeded all of our expectations. the worst part of a one week trip is, by day 6, you become comfortable with your resort..then sadly you need to leave...with the lti you feel at ease and home on day 1 so its a great place overall. Not a bad thing to say!
