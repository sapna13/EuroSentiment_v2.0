{"text":"A Gem of Barcelona My wife and I stayed in the H10 Universitat for 5 days during the end of july 2007. After much exploring ,this hotel appeared to have the least adverse remarks. Comments were made about various rooms and sizes. I booked through Hotelopia , I asked for a large outside room with bath and shower on floor 4 or above and received a very good deal. On arrival we were greeted with a glass of Cavas and a delightful attitude.Apologies were made that the floor requested was not available but we were allocated an excellent large room with bath and shower on floor 2. The general standard of the hotel is first class, the bedroom was of the highest standard (comments regarding the glass doors to bathroom and lack of privacy are unfounded) the bathroom does have a glass door but is totally opaque. The breakfast gives the most expansive choice I have ever seen in any hotel. Coming back on an afternoon there is a selection of tit-bits to eat available in the bar together with water and hot drinks. The position of the hotel is excellent and is just 500 metres from Las Ranbles which means there is no problems with noise.Overall this is the best value for money hotel I have stayed in. The decor is fresh and modern, the staff are efficient but cheerful, the rooms first class with a daily change of linen and the breakfast is out of this world and includes a full grill if this is your fancy. This hotel must be the gem of Barcelona.Just a little tip, the taxi fare from the hotel is more than 30 euro, the airport bus is 3.75. This hotel is 500 metres from Place Catalunya, the terminus for the bus. We paid for a taxi (33 euro) which includes a airport surcharge. My advice is take the bus, (we did on return and it only takes 20 mins from Catalunya Place) and if you have difficulty finding your hotel, then take a taxi from Catalunya place. But take my advice ,use the the H10 Universitat and enjoy a wonderful city from a gem of hotel. ","annotations":[]}
