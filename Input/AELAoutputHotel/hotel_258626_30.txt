{"text":"Service Not Galleria Quality Just because a hotel is across from the Galleria, does not mean it is an upscale hotel with upscale service. The hotel is a nice hotel, but for the price, it should be a lot better. The carpet in the halls and in the room we stayed in needs a good professional cleaning. The sofa bed needs to be re-upholstered. However, the beds were extremely comfortable. Our room had 2 TV's, however, the channel selection was extremely limited. The only kid-friendly channel was Cartoon Network. However, they do have games and movies you can order and have added to your bill.I did not like the fact that they charge $6.50 per night for parking without even asking for any vehicle information. In fact, the attendant at the desk saw my keys and assumed I had a rental car and charged me accordingly even though I never parked in their gated parking lot.The hotel has a business center where you can use the computer, internet and printer, but you must have a credit card to access any of it and they charge you per minute to surf, print, etc. (Just hope they don't have slow internet service or a slow printer). In my case, after several failed attempts to use the equipment in the business center to print out my airline boarding passes, hotel staff reluctantly allowed me to use the free computer at the consierge desk. It seems to me that such services should be free automatically for the price I paid for the room.The breakfast buffet (which is mediocre) is over priced at $14 per adult and about $7 per child plus tax (although the menu reads $12.95 per adult). I've been in hotels with similar rates and a full delicious breakfast buffet was included with the room.On the night we checked in, we had to request to have the linen changed on the sofa bed. There were crumbs in, on and around the sofa. In fact, we had to ask 3 times to have our room vaccuumed to remove snacks on the floor left by previous occupants. Also, twice we had to request an ample amount of towels and wash cloths be placed in our room.The hotels has a complimentary shuttle service within a limited area. However, they need to have their van detailed. Our driver and bellhop, Curtis, was very professional, polite, courteous, and always had a smile.Over all, for the money, I would stay some where else.
