{"text":"A great hotel On our recent trip we left the decision on which hotel to book for one night in Singapore to the end as there seemed to be plenty of rooms available. After reading reviews here I had already narrowed our first choices down to five hotels... The Intercontinental, The Fairmont, The Pan Pacific, The Marina Mandarin and the Hyatt. As a one-night stopover we wanted location and luxury for a reasonable charge. In london we booked though Wotif.com.au two days before we were to arrive.. simple, easy. FIRST IMPRESSIONS : Lovely exterior.. extremely friendly welcome from doormen.CHECK IN - no line .. fast, efficient. The best thing of all was that we were asked our departure flight the following day and were offered a 3pm checkout as our plane did not leave until 9pm. ROOMS: The deluxe room was large, modern and impressive with a full bath, and separate enclosed shower and toilets in the marbled bathroom. If we had booked a club room we would have had free WiFi (something all hotels should offer guests for a small one-off fee I think, not outlandish fees as some hotels seem to charge) We needed to check our flight itinerary. The executive level offered Internet acces at a small charge but as we were unable to check in our flight online after a few minutes the fee was waived by the lovely receptionist. ... another big tickEXTRA: a wander to the pool deck revealed a lovely lady named Irene who handed us our towels, a bottle of chilled water and a wonderful smile. Nearby a basket of apples sat next to an array of reading matter ..all conducive to a relaxing afternoon for those who like to relax poolside after a long flight.IN SUMMATION: We were impressed by the staff, the rooms and the hotel in general. We would definitely return to stay here again. Many large city hotels could learn a lot from the way things are done in Singapore.
