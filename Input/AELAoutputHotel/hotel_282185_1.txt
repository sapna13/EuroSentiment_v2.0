{"text":"Very Good Hotel We have stayed at the Paris Albion Hotel for 7 nights in December and found this hotel exactly as it was described in the website - Simple yet nice and comfortable and very clean. Prior to our arrival I confirmed my reservation with the hotel staff and asked whether we could have 2 double superior rooms instead of 2 twin superior rooms. The reception staff, which speaks very good English, quicly replied that our request could be met and everything was confirmed. Upon our arrival we found the rooms we requested and the receptionist gave us a map showing the metro and the many sights of Paris. Rooms aren't big, but have comfortable beds, a flat screen TV and a good bathroom. The only negative point on the rooms is that the 'closet' is very small especially for 2 persons. Other than that everything was very good, including central heating. The staff cleaned the room perfectly every day and changed the linen, towels, soap etc every day as well. During our stay the hotel had a small problem with the heating service which meant that the heating in the rooms (including water) was off during one night but by the morning the problem was solved and of course this was not the hotel's fault.Breakfast is served in the breakfast room downstairs and is worth the money. In fact you get a good english breakfast including scrambled eggs and bacon together with various types of cured meats, cheese, jams, juices, cereals, tea, coffee, etc. The staff here are also very helpful (although they know less English than the reception staff). The hotel is situated in a very good area which is full of good restaurants without being too busy nor noisy. There are 2 metro stations (ST George and Notre Dame de Lorette) which are practically 1 minute away from which you can get to all the attractions of Paris. By foot you can easily get to Montmatre, Sacre Ceur and Opera Garnier area.I would advise anyone who wants to stay in a simple very good hotel to visit Paris to go ahead and book the Albion.
