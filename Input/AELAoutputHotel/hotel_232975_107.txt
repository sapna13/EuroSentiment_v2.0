{"text":"Such a Nice Experience What a wonderful place! I'm not sure how the star rating system works, but we couldn't figure out why this only gets two stars. This was the first of four hotels we stayed at on our honeymoon, and it turned out to be the nicest experience at the most reasonable rate. Every single staff member we encountered was genuinely pleasant and helpful, including waitstaff and maidservice. They booked advance tickets for us at the Ufizzi, called cabs, recommended places, etc. The breakfast was cheerful though not extravagant and the espresso and cappucino were made to order - no self-service machine stuff. We purchased a great bottle of wine from their bar and they didn't gouge us on the price like most other hotels. The internet access was reasonable and available. The rooms were always clean, the bathroom was spacious, modern, and comfortable, and the technology (LCD TV, lights, climate control, etc) was contemporary and pleasantly in contrast with the vintage furnishings. You can walk to the hotel from the train station but don't bother if you've got big, unwieldy luggage because the streets are narrow and the sidewalks narrower. You can spend a lot more money at another hotel and get a lot less. If you're into big hotel lobbies with a lot of action, this place is probably not for you - it's a little more intimate, although by no means stuffy. We emailed a few questions to them before booking and the replies were quick and informative. Their website was great and the availability\/reservation tools worked without a hitch. We will definitely return someday and bring some friends with us.
