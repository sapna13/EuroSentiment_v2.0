{"text":"Nice Hotel, but... Stayed at NH Tropen for four nights in June. Overall it's a very nice hotel, comfortable room ( stayed in the 8th floor with a nice city and Tropen Museum view ) and great beds. The only problem was that we caught some days with 28, 29 degrees and the room didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ had air conditioning ( ! ). Also, there is one only balcony surrounding all the building in every stage, which makes an easy access from a room to another if anyone would want to, so we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even risk sleeping with the window open. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a little strange why they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ just create individual balconies separating it for each room. That should be so easy to do! I understand that usually Amsterdam it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not a typical hot weather city, but even so√à√\u2020\u2022?it's a pity such a nice hotel to fail in this area. So it was a bit difficult to get a good night sleep, what was a real shame in a comfortable room and bed.The staff was great, always answering our questions about the city and giving us directions.The hotel is a little bit off the centre but the tram stops right in front of it, so it turns out to be easy to reach the main sites. The only problem with this location is that the last tram runs at about midnight ( hey Amsterdam ! get more night friendly ! ) so if you want to stay downtown a little longer you have to catch a taxi to get back to the hotel.We loved Amsterdam. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a very lovely city, especially the area along the Herengracht, Singel and Prisengracht canals. Go to Seven Bridges and enjoy the beautiful and romantic ambiance. Would recommend this hotel, but out of the hot days of summer, or√à√\u2020\u2022?check out in detail the weather report before you go!
