{"text":"The best hotel in Europe We arrived at the hotel quite early since our flight was an early one, it's not far from the train station, situated within the red light district and was really easy to find.At check in, even though we were not expected until later in the day, Onno (one of the owners) made us feel very welcome, fresh coffee in the reception area whilst he gave us lots of useful information such as where to go, up coming events, safety rules and local law. Very helpful for a first stay in Amsterdam.Also available in the reception area are local guides and magazines promoting Amsterdam, Gay life and the local BDSM scene - all of this is included in the price but items to have to be returned so other guests can use them.The rooms are fantastic, we stayed in 33 which is a middle of the range room but every bit as exciting as the others. Free wifi is available for anyone with a laptop or other internet device, along with a large flat screen TV, DVD player, CD\/Radio stereo player.The room itself had a black rubber floor, leather sheets on the double (or queen) size bed which overlooks a leather sling overhead.Other equipment in the room comes in the form of 3 different bondage chairs and a wrist hoist - all of which make for interesting games you and another.There is plenty of storage space available for your clothing\/belongings as well as a desk area for your daily usage. The room comes with a nicely stocked mini bar and price list should you wish to use it.The style of the is dark (red and black) which fits in with the hotel's genre, it's possible to flood the room with daylight by simply opening the curtains to both windows.The bathroom featured a large (two person) bathtub which fills from the side (no taps where you head is) and a remote control whirlpool system, the bathroom also has a walk in power shower which has to be experienced to believe.Noise is not a problem as the hotel is slightly away from any external noise source.Breakfast is served between 10 and 12 and most guests will congregate together and share a breakfast, a civilised way to meet new people with similar interests to you. Breakfast comes with a choice of cereals, meat, bread, or cooked - (On my final day, I had the lot and it's delicious)!I was sorry to leave as I enjoyed my stay not only for the pleasures of Amsterdam but for the hospitality of our hosts and the quality of the hotel. I will be coming back on a regular basis - as no other hotel can come close to the experience of The Black Tulip.
