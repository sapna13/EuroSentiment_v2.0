{"text":"Great for a Weekend Break We've just got back from a city break in Berlin.While looking around for somewhere to stay on various websites I came across this hotel - which had been recommended to me by work colleagues - on several booking sites. Their own website though had a much better deal, so I would recommend you check out their own website before booking!The hotel is situated on a side street just off the Kurfuerstendamm, one of the main shopping streets in the former Western part of the city and is ideally located for all local transport (U-Bahn, S-Bahn and bus).We stayed in a standard double bedroom, which in typical German style had two mattresses and two duvets on the one bedframe. The bed was very comfortable and the room clean  tidy. The en-suite bathroom was small but had everything - bath with shower over, loo, sink, hair dryer and adjustable make-up mirror.The room had a mini bar with fairly reasonable priced drinks but no tea\/coffee making facilities.Free WLAN was also included if you happen to have your laptop or internet capable mobile phone.The hotel was in the middle of switching its TV system over the weekend we were there and there were a few teething problems meaning that the service was intermittant for ~36hrs but seemed to be working ok again on the day we checked out.The included breakfast catered for all tastes, from the typical German breakfast of cheese, meats and bread, to cereals, yogurt and fruit to scrambled eggs and bacon - all self service.The hotel's own restaurant the Knese is well worth a visit, serving both traditional German fayre as well as a more international selection.
