{"text":"No problems at all for the money. Happy to go back again soon I booked into the Botel for a 4 night break with my girlfriend at the begining of September 2009. I chose it purely on the price and was not dissappointed. Luckily we both love boats so the ferry crossing was not a problem. Compared with land based hotels on the other side of the river this place really is good value for your money. (OK the word luxury on the side of the boat perhaps shouldn't be there.) When we arrived we were greeted by a really friendly receptionist who explained all that we needed to know about getting to and from Centraal Station at any time of day or night. The ferries are free, and so is the Botel's shuttle bus at night once the direct ferry has stopped. We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for it.The room was exactly as it was described on the website, basic but clean and comfortable. Great view of a submarine from the window.The bar on the boat is fine, not over priced particularly and again friendly staff.Basically it's a fine place for a cheap stay, you get what you pay for in this life so if you want luxury accommodation go elsewhere, but if you want somewhere to get your head down, that's a bit different go to the Botel. There's a good restaurant \/ bar on the quayside too but it closes early in the evening (you have been warned). The only thing missing is tea  coffee facilities in the room, but you can always get the staf to make you one.
