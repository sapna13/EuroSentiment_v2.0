{"text":"Quirky but in a Groovy way This hotel is an older property that was refurbished in 2000. It is downtown Phoenix where there are no other eating establishments within walking distance. The hotel has a very good, moderately priced restaraunt on site which is open at 6 am for breakfast and stays open for late dinner thru 10pm. The buildings themselves are situated in a big square shape and in the center is an amazing pool and jacuzzi. The pool is well stocked with all kinds of water toys including water guns that all the teens seemed to enjoy. Music is piped into the area and there is even an underwater speaker in the pool! The nice thing about the pool being in the center of the property is that the sun goes behind the buildings in the late afternoon and one does not have to worry about sunscreen...I checked in for a medical conference arriving the evening before it started. Check in was smooth--luck of the draw, I had been upgraded to a two room suite. The rooms are enormous! Lots of funky furniture, a well stocked minibar, and crazy window coverings. The room itself was clean and the bathroom amenities nice. There are two robes hanging for use during your stay. Pool towels are available at the front desk. There is a HUGE flat screen television set in the bedroom. About the only complaint I have is the breakfast service in the dining room. There was one young, extremely overwhelmed gal who was trying to accomplish more that what one person was able to manage. Service was slow. Lunch and dinner weren't a problem. I would recommend Orbitz as a booking site since they had a price that was 1\/2 the properties web site.
