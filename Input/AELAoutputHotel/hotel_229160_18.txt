{"text":"Very Nice hotel and Location I will preface this review by noting that this was my first trip to Amsterdam and by reading previous numerous reviews of the hotels their I have come to the conclusion that rooms are SMALL. My room was very small by American standards but don't let me give you the wrong impression. For one person it was the perfect size. It was a standard single bed for which I payed 502 Euros for 3 nights. I realize that this may seem high but it was actually quite fair considering the prices of many many other hotels I looked into. So, on with the review. The hotel is very easily accessible via the tram from Central Station, the stop is directly across from the entrance. The room was exceptionally clean with a flat screen lcd tv, mini bar, desk, and comfortable bed. I will say that I was there in October so the weather was quite moderate....this room didn't have any type of air conditioning so I would ask first in the summer before staying. I can't imagine the heat then. As for the restaurant and bar, the service was impeccable as was the food. If you have never had a Heineken in Amsterdam, you must try one. The waiter convinced me and I could not believe the difference of taste. As for the location, this area is very nice for anyone who wants to walk downtown Amsterdam. The city is fairly small and you can walk it in about 30 minutes from one side to the next(I am 38 and out of shape and done it). I have a hard time comparing this to other hotels but I will say that after reading so many bad reviews of hotels in Amsterdam that I was very pleasantly surprised with this selection. I would recommend it to anyone other than handicapped.
