{"text":"Falls short of the mark Myself and my husband have just returned from spending 3 nights in this hotel. As the other reviewers say, the renovation of the hotel is lovely with great attention to detail, however, I thought a few things let it down.1. we booked a plus room, which is supposed to give you terrace\/balcony with incredible views. We got a lovely large room (611), with a great bathroom (2 sinks), bath and seperate shower. However the balcony was small, about 8ft by 8ft, surrounded by minimum 8ft hight walls - in other words, no view, and no sun2. The shower in the bathroom scalded us every 18 seconds! The cold water would turn off for about 5 seconds or so, and then turn back on - its just bad in a hotel of this calibre3. The heating did not work in our room on the first night and it was cold - the duvet was extremely thin - the following day we got 2 extra blankets and the AC fixed, so that was sorted4. The bar closes at 12.30 - officially 1am, but the surly barman would not take orders past 12.305. No coffee making facilities, iron or comp water in the room - there is a mini bar however.6. The hotel to my mind is very focussed on rooms and does not offer much extra - there is a library and a spa (locked when I went to investigate). The bar on the roof was never open when we were there.On the plus side, great location, nice towels and bathrobes too. Very clean, our sheets were changed every day. Would I go back? No, I'd try another hotel in the same area.
