{"text":"Great hotel if you have a car This is hands down the best hotel I have ever stayed at. I had nothing but good experiences with the hotel, my room, and the staff. I was on the 9th floor with a great view of the river. Hands down, if I had a car with me, this would be my hotel of choice in Boston. Problem was, I had no car.I booked this hotel through Priceline, which I will hesitate to do in the future. This hotel is not in Cambridge, but in Allston, MA. It is a solid 15 minute walk from the nearest T stop (Central), or $7 cab ride. Its a $20 cab ride to downtown. This added up to a significant expense over my trip, and a lot of wasted travel time getting where I wanted to go. Yes, there is a shuttle and the drivers are super nice, but it doesn't run continuously or late. There is a Whole Foods market about 5 minutes away and it was nice to go there and get food, but you do have to cross that intersection that others have mentioned. When I was reading reviews on here before my trip, I was like What's the big deal about crossing a busy intersection? After seeing it, I feel like I could write a book about it! Its the busiest intersection I've ever seen, with multiple highways all converging in one spot. I would look out my window in awe at that intersection. Its not easy to cross either....seriously, I guess you have to see it to believe it. Anyway, none of that should reflect on the hotel. It was a completely positive hotel experience. I have no complaints, just be wary of Priceline if you don't have a car. I would have saved money if i had stayed in town and not spent so much on transportation.
