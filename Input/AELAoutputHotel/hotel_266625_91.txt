{"text":"A Pleasant Relaxing Experience My husband and I spent 5 nights at Sirenis and I couldn't believe this was the same place I read about. We had an excellent experience at the hotel. The one downside for me was the bus ride there, with potholes and bumpy roads. I got a little car sick. But from the minute we arrived at the hotel, our trip was wonderful. Check-in was easy thanks to our Apple rep who conducted an information session right on the bus. What a great idea! We stayed in Building I which had a view of the pool and the ocean. We enjoyed our balcony and our maid. I followed a suggestion to tip her $5 at the beginning and she couldn't do enough for us. Every afternoon she would knock to see if we needed agua, Coke or cervesa. She placed flowers on our beds and arranged the bedspread in beautiful folds every day. She would re-make our beds if we napped and happened to be out to dinner. One thing to note is that the lightbulbs are 11 watts and not good to read by. I know they are into saving energy but ...We did not see all the mosquitoes everyone talked about. My husband usually is a mosquito magnet and he didn't get one bite here. We killed maybe 3 in our room the entire 5 days. The pool areas were wonderful. We did not pIay the 7 am towel game, but always found a shady spot for my husband while I was in the sun. In the afternoon we even found a palapa at the beach. The ocean water was rough but warm. The bars were great. I really liked the delicious coco loco drinks. Weather was nice with a rain shower in the evening. One day it rained but it was a welcome relief to read and take an extra long nap or just walk in the warm rain.Food was OK, not fabulous. I did enjoy the ice cream and the crepes. The seafood restaurant was great! But the steak place was horrible. The steak was way overdone and leathery. My husband says it was the worst meal he ever had at a restaurant. Order the chicken if you go. But the service in all the ala cartes were fantastic. One nice thing that our Apple vacation rep did was give us a sheet to sign up for all of the ala cartes we wanted with our desired times. So we did not have to stand in any lines EVER. All in all this was a pleasant experience. I did get a really good price and kept waiting for something bad to happen but nothing did! No rats, or mosquitoes; just a few geckos and birds. A fantastic room, plenty of towels, lots of lotions and shampoo, a full refrigerator. Who could ask for more? My limited Spanish was appreciated. I agree with others that a smile and a pleasant demeanor goes very far. I would go back if the opportunity arises. I am heading to Huatulco Mexico in 3 week. I have become a sunworshiper.
