{"text":"Great Position My wife and I stayed at the South Pacific in November 2006 for four nights. The hotel is situated on Hong Kong Island in an area where the Chinese workers live. Although not particularly a tourist area we found it facinating visiting street markets and such. The hotel was being renovated when we stayed there and to be fair it needed updating. The rooms were clean and about average for a three star hotel. We ate once in the hotel and found it to be a little more expensive than comparable nearby restaurants but the quality was good. The top floor of the hotel is the starlight lounge and overlooks Happy Valley Racecourse. We found it an ideal place for a night cap and to look out over the island.Getting to the hotel - use the airport express train - its excellent - and there are a numerous taxis available on your arrival at Hong Kong rail station. Hong Kong is the last stop of four on the track and, on your return, you can check your baggage at the railway station for your next flight - a brilliant idea!Our favourite day out was to the Po Lin Buddha on Lan Tau Island. The organised trips would have cost about √ä√£¬¢120 each but the MTR (about √ä√£¬¢10 for as many trips in a day as you want to take) stops at the skyrail (√ä√£¬¢20 for 2) that takes you to the buddha.Would I stay there again - probably not because it is a little far out from the attractions on a short stay - but thats the only reason why I wouldn't. I definitely would choose to stay on Hong Kong Island though, rather than Kowloon.
