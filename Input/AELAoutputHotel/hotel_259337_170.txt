{"text":"Great Vacation My wife and I booked a trip through Expedia for a week at the Grand Palladium Bavaro resort. We had an absolute blast, a great vacation. Through Expedia, we made sure to purchase the transfers from the airport to the hotel, it came in very handy. When we arrived at the airport we were whisked right through and in a van to the hotel before we knew it. It definetly saved time and hassle to have it prepaid. The first few days we were a bit lost, as the place is huge. (it is connected to two other resorts owned by the same company). This resort was BY FAR the best of the three. We also saw many other resorts on the way here, and the Grand palladium bavaro blew them all away. I saw a few resorts that were surrounded by homeless, and were not well maintained at all. I can understand why this place gets so many good reviews, as the grounds are kept SO well. There is a little trolley that goes around and can take you anywhere in 5 minutes, which was very useful. There is VERY limited english spoken here, so that was the hardest thing. I would recommend a room on a second floor of a villa, because when we arrived, our room had a small leak in the ceiling from the tub above us, and the room had a distinctive odor. We quickly went back out to the lobby, and after trying to explain the situation to a staff member who did not speak english, we were confronted by Hector, a staff member who did speak english. Hector explained that we could switch rooms the following day. Once we switched, we were put on the second floor and our room was IMMACULATE. Marble everything, and very clean., balcony with a great view of the pool. The food takes a bit to get use to, definetly not american food. Hector at the front desk helped us out a great deal by recommending things to do, such as the Captain Cook seafood place, which is right on the beach outside the resort (8 dollar cab ride). If we listened to the brochure, we would have paid 110 for dinner for 2 and a ride there. But Hector explained that you can get there on your own, and pay only 55 and eat for two. It was the best seafood we have ever eaten. The actual restaurant is basically cabanas on the beach, with a big grill. (Bill Clinton ate there a few years ago, and they use his face on everything). The menus are in spanish, so my wife just said we wanted a big plate, and they soon brought us out a large plate with grilled lobster, shrimp, crab, etc. that was more than enought for 2 people. Back to the resort, there is too much to do in a weeks time. We chose to go to the beach and pool all day, then dinner, followed by drinks in the lobby to live music, and then the disco which went on all night. I do recommend reserving chairs by the pool or beach, as most are taken by 9am. We would simply place our towels on two charis in the morning, then go back to bed and come out at 10 or 11 and they would still be there for us. The sports bar, which consists of memorabilla and a few large screen TV's was also a favorite. They serve pizza, burgers, a self-serve nacho machine, and soft serve ice cream and salad bar. We would stop in for a late night snack (open 24hours) and see Angel, the bartender. Angel spoke zero english, but we ended up becoming great friends. He knew us by name after the first night, and we stopped in each night to say hi. (6 years of spanish in high school and college paid off). The beach is BEAUTIFUL, the water is almost too warm. Topless beaches and pool too, which never hurts. Some Europeans can get nasty (budge lines, takes seats, etc.), but overall were fine. (I mistakenly navigated a catamaran into the swimming area on the beach, and a german man felt it necessary to scream at us in german like we did it on purpose, but other than that it was fine). LIke i said, english is minority down there, but it was not a big deal. We will definetly go back next year. This was a vacation to remember, and I HIGHLY recommend this resort.
