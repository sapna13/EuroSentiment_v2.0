{"text":"nice but not amazing my family and I just got back from punta cana, the 7 of us were a little disappointed by the service at the hotel and the rooms.{1} walking in the room was nothing special or new for us, when we went to put our key card in the little card holder to turn on the light the whole thing came down (1st night)we then decided to call someone to fix it, they said someone was going to come in the morning and take care of it.no one ever came, called again but no one seemed to be able to help us out so we jammed the switch and we just used the switches around the room for the lights.{2} one of my relatives was feeling a little cold one day and he decided to shut off the ceiling fan, baddd idea the whole thing came down on his head almost injuring him.we decided to call someone and the guy came in the room, looked at the gaping hole in the ceiling, smiled, took the fan and got out of the room.......{3} my cousines and I decided to go to the beach one night to enjoy some music and relax, at 1 in the morning, walking back to the room my cousine fell in a hole filled with concrete near the beach and scratched her knees badly, we went back to the room called and the person said that they were sending someone with a first aid kit to help us out, but....guesss what, no one ever came and we had to deal with the problem using the few things we had, to keep the blood from coming out till the morning when we brought her to the infirmary.{4} the food was really good, drinks were amazing and the bartenders were funny and always made people smile.{5} rooms were cleaned very well and the mini fridge was refillled everyday.{6} the shows at night were cool,during our stay there, they had a michael jackson show that was really good.{7} the pool was amazing the only thing that ruined it was that every morning there were people trying to sell us timeshare......(i came here on vacation,not on a business trip, i am ok with sitting for the first day for 45 minutes to hear about it but please let me enjoy the sun during the day.){8} the fun activities were good but when we asked about off road go karts the guy kept on telling us about the atv rides and repeated us not to go for the karts....(this kind of irritaded me).{9} all in all it was a good trip I was kind of disappointed to have to deal with the few room problems we had for the whole duration of the trip but, whats a good trip without some adventure?
