{"text":"Fabulous - the softest bed ever in a great location I booked the sofitel at the last minute after getting a bit of a discount after doing a little bit of searching  joining the hotel's privilege club. The reception area is very nice with friendly receptionists. It is a french hotel chain, you are always welcomed with Bonjour or bonsoir, which personally annoyed me, but others may find this sophisticated!We had upgraded to a room with a king size bed, which on the web was only up to the 14th floor but as I had previously joined the privilege club online (do this at least 2 months before as it takes ages for the card to come through) we were upgraded to the 20th floor and had a view of the Chrysler building which is nice BUT I would say this is also at the back of the hotel - but who cares you are not in your room all day, so looking out of the window and seeing the lit up chrysler definitely made me realised I was in NYC. The bed though was the most fantastic thing in the room (which was normal New York size - small, the benjamin is a lot bigger) it was so soft it was heaven after a heavy day walking around the city.In the room every night was a box of 4 chocolates  2 small bottles of water which were free and appreciated.I had also happened to mention that it was our anniversary and like others who had stayed at the hotel before us who were also celebrating we had a bottle of champagne on ice waiting for us when we got there.The Gaby bar - was very nice which also served a small selection of bar food\/sandwiches but it is expensive $11+tip for a beer and a juice.The location of the hotel is very handy just 2 streets over from times square so close enough to walk to with no effort at all and also far enough away so you do not hear the Times Sq bustle.For breakfast I had read that others had eaten at the Red Flame diner just past the hotel and I would agree that this was very nice, quick service and very good food at a decent price.One thing I must say is the taxes are not included normally in the prices on the hotels website which were a little bit more than I expected but still ok in the scheme of things.Overall we will definitely be staying at this hotel again without any hesitation at all just for the nights sleep alone - in fact now looking into changing my own bedding at home to match it!
