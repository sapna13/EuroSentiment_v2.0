{"text":"Excellent...! I had read some reviews so made sure i booked my room in the North tower and once i got tot he check in desk i was told that we had been upgraded to a junior penthouse suite, not sure if this was completely random or because we were on our honeymoon, either way it was a nice surprise, a minute later the person checking me in said oh i am sorry sir i made a mistake you were not upgraded toa junior penthouse suite but a penthouse suite! So up we wentm nit sure what to expect, the room was an apartment, we had 2 sitting areas, a huge dingin table, remote control curtains all round, huge bathroom, extra storage room, it was an amazing surprise and balconies all round with a beautiful view as we were on the top floor of the hotel, i then regretted that we were only there for 2nights! The hotel staff were most helpful with any information we needed or any assistance, i didn't experience the $5 charge for the texi service we would just go to the front of the hotel and wait for a taxi, and there was no extra charge we knew of, also the hotel is right on top of a mall, and the bar makes some pretty interesting cocktails, you have the famous long bar across the road and a whole bnch of other bars and restaurants a couple od minutes away, over all i was very happy with the location and helpfulnes of the staff, i would highly reccommend this hotel although i am not sure how the south tower is as i had made sure i was booked in the north tower as was told it was a little dated...
