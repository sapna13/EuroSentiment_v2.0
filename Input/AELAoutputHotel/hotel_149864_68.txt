{"text":"Club Med Punta Cana a hit! It's now been several months since we spent our 2 week Spring Break at the Club Med, our first all inclusive land vacation. My husband, myself and our 3 kids ages 10\/12\/15 were absolutely delighted and the kids are begging to go back again! We picked Club Med as they had the best pricing for a family of 5 (the world is built for a family of 4!), and the Dominican Republic for the international flavour. A non stop charter from Vancouver helped a lot too!The grounds are lovely and well maintained. Contrary to other areas of the Dominican, there are no other resorts close by. We could leave our stuff on the lounge chairs on the beach while we went to lunch and felt totally secure that everything would be untouched. As well, absolutely no problem getting lounge chairs at any time of day - saving chairs was not an issue, at least not at the beach. Loved the palm trees on the beach which gave some shade, if desired. The beach and water were postcard perfect! Tons of activities to choose from. My husband sailed every day including in the regatta and was very pleased with the personnel there. We were also really impressed that we never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a sailboat, kayak or windsurfer as guests were respectful of the time limits. Our kids participated in the kids clubs. They were old enough to come and go as they pleased so could pick and choose being with the kids group or hanging out with mom and dad. The trapeze program is excellent and the GO's really spent time teaching our kids. Adults participated as well. Really all the staff we encountered were excellent. French did seem to be the dominant language but it never posed a problem for us as everyone was at least bilingual and only added to the int'l flair.Evening shows - went on the first evening we arrived, the show was rather an embarrassment to watch (we went on a cruise last year and you just can't compare the quality of entertainment) so we didn't go to many more. The circus and trapeze shows however, were outstanding, and the kids show, since our kids were in it, was cute.Food - was good, again doesn't hold a candle to cruise ship fare but there was lots of variety and there was always something we liked. However except for maybe 2 nights, both restaurants served the same menu (a different theme each of the 7 nights). With kids, I must say I love the buffet style as there is no waiting involved, no major dressing up to do (tho there are theme nights, maybe 1\/3 of the people participated), and no particular time we have to be seated. It was lovely to get to know new people at the communal tables, and we certainly met dozens of families who have been to Club Meds, and even this particular one, many times. Rooms were good, totally adequate with a separate toilet room from the sink\/shower. Also a HUGE walk in closet, nice balcony, comfortable beds. There is a TV but stations available vary from day to day! This irritated our 15 y\/o sports fan but hey, the idea is not to hang out in the room but to get out and enjoy the beach, tennis, volleyball, aerobics, sailing, etc etc! This is a huge property and if you are staying in one of the outlying units, with young kids, it is a bit of a hike to get to the pool. If you're in a unit right by the reception area, then you're more central but I imagine it might be noisy at times when groups arrive. We were in Columbus Isle - perfect for us.This was not Hawaii but if you want a change and go with an open mind you will have a great time. Different things are important to different people and for us - the scenery, weather, activities, staff, overall feel made this a hit with us. We would definitely go back to Punta Cana and this also gives us a lot of confidence in trying other Club Meds.
