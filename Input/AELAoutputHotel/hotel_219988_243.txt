{"text":"Good Choice for Paris We stayed at the Grands Hommes in September, for 6 nights. This was our first trip to Paris. The location in the Latin Quarter is excellent, right across the street from the Pantheon. Easy access (three blocks) to the RER B, for quick travel to anywhere in Paris on the excellent subway system. No need for a cab. Felt safe in the neighborhood at all times, and we were out late every night. Our hotel room was the size of a college dorm room, but the shower was always hot, the air conditioning always worked, and we could not hear our neighbors. We took the stairs down in the morning, and rode the elevator up at night. We did not need help from the staff as we planned most of our events on our own. We also are foodies, and made our own dinner reservations, including at Le Trufferie (a 5 minute walk from the hotel), Le Train Bleu, and Guy Savoy. Notre Dame is a short walk away. We also walked to the Louvre, Orsay, and all of the other big ones. We picked this hotel based on reviews on Trip Advisor, and can easily recommend it. We did not do the hotel breakfast, as we are believers in getting out and eating at the patisseries and other shops along the way. Cheese stores and wine stores are close, as is an excellent crepe shop -- Crepes a go-go. We would buy champagne on way back to hotel prior to dinner and have a few glasses in the room. Staff was very friendly, and spoke english. We spent a few months learning some basic french before we traveled, and highly recommend doing the same. We would stay here again.
