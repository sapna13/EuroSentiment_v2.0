{"text":"Wonderful experience My two teenage children and I shifted to the Hyde Park Inn after spending a week in unsatisfactory accommodation elsewhere. From the moment we entered the lobby the experience was a complete contrast to our previous one. The staff were friendly, helpful and keen to oblige. They insisted on helping us carry our bags to the room, and popped in a few minutes after we checked in to ensure everything was okay. The room, with kitchenette, was very well appointed, tastefully decorated, comfortable, very clean and beds were quality. The bathroom was lovely, and exceptionally clean with all the necessities provvided. We had an upper level room with balcony, and loved being able to pop out to absorb the city atmosphere. After the first day the city noise became quite soothing, almost 'background' noise.Having a continental breakfast provided was a bonus, with cereal, toast, fruit and juice, a more than adequate start to each day. As we stayed a week we cooked some basic meals in the room and found the utensils provided to be adequate. There is a Coles and number of seven elevens just moments away to provide any supermarket needs.The flatscreen tv and free movie channel was a bonus for the end of day when needing to unwind. Having family I utilized the free on site washing machines and dryers, and despite being peak tourist time I never had to wait to access them. I was further impressed by the level of security and 24 hour reception, which many places I've stayed has lacked. Traveling with teenagers, and being a woman, this gave me an added sense of security. The location was perfect for staying in Sydney. An abundance of restaurants are within a small radius of the hotel. All the major city attractions were a short walk away, and for those who are unable or not wishing to walk, there is a fantastic public service network at the doorstep. At no time did I feel unsafe in the vicinity of the hotel at night.I highly recommend the Hyde park Inn and will be using it again.
