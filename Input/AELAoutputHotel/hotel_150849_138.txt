{"text":"Good value for money - very relaxing We booked this hol through Tomson and couldnt fault their service. We stayed for 2 weeks (arrived back 1\/2\/8) at the Riu Bambu and had a very relaxing time. Here are some of our comments:Beach - lovely white sandy and natural beach, clear sea and the tractor is on the beach early to clear any seeweed that has been washed up. No snorkelling from this beach and would need to take a trip out. Plenty of sunbeds available and plenty of palm trees which offer natural shade.Hotel -Location - set back from the beach and protected from the wind whn it is windy. Set amongst palm trees and spread out nicely.Rooms - would only give the rooms 3 star. However, we didnt spend much time in the room and therefore was perfectly adequate. Had 2 small double beds which were pushed together and therefore would have preferred one bed, rather than sleeping in 2 seperate ones. This is standard for every room i am told. Bed linen is poor, bed sheets did not fit the size of the beds and no mattress protector. Hot water though, mini bar, TV and good size room. Rooms fairly quiet too. Rooms decor a bit dated. Rooms were well cleaned.Food - couldnt fault the food and neither of us got ill in the 2 weeks. Plenty of variety, beautiful fresh fruit and smoothies, lovely salads, i ate the fresh prawns and mussells, fillet of fish etc. Plenty of pasta, pizza, chips, vegetables, meats, burgers cheeses, rice. We didnt get bored. 3 Al a carte restaurantes and we tried all 2. Caribe was lovely and a bit different being in a different location, steak house was tasty, italian - give it a miss - not worth it. Plenty for everyone and as with all all inclusives, use your judgement.Drinks - plenty of drinks, beer was a bit watered down which was a shame but soon got used to it and then couldnt tell! Lots of cocktails. If you want posh wine you wont find it here but the local bottle was fine. Lots of cocktails.Entertainment - these staff worked amazingly hard and their energy is inspiring. We didnt get bored in the 2 weeks and plenty of interactive night entertainment for those who are brave enough! (Can sit back and watch though which we did). We dont have kids but could see that they were kept active in the day and could get involved in a nightly show if they wanted to. During the day, staff put on different activities at the beach and the pool if you want to get involved.Staff - in general we couldnt fault the staff. They were effiecient, happy and looked like they enjoy their job. We tipped sporadically.Pool - 2 pools and plenty of sunbeds which offer a lot of shade from palm trees. Swim up bar. Other activities - We did a snorkel trip to Dive Site 10, was worth going for the 31 US we paid, for at least to see the coastline. Snorkelling was ok, about 5m depth. Coral poor and not a lot of fish but made a change.We learnt to use the catamaran which was good fun and was easy to book.We played tennis once and the court was easy to bookWe both did an introductory dive, i have done my PADI before but my partner hadnt. I would say its a great place to learn if you are nervous as the depths are between 6 and 12m. The coral and fish are ok but again it was worth doing. The intructors are very good.We both did a parasail which was expensive but worth it.Overall, we would give this hotel a 4 star, with 5 star for effort. The manager was seen around on a regular basis and im sure if we needed to, we could find her very easily. If you want a relaxing time, good value for money and fantastic food, we could recommend this hotel.
