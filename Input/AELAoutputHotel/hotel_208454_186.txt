{"text":"Great Location, as good as the reviews say I took my GF here for Christmas as a romantic suprise, (and to propose to her - thankfully she said yes :), naturally I wanted a great hotel with a perfect location to set the mood for a magical christmas.we arrived well before booking out (3pm), as as expected our room wast ready. after having lunch and exploring a little, our room wasn't ready an hour and a half later, so they upgraded us to a bigger room, which was greatly appreciated.our room was immaculately clean, and well detailed. we returned to our room ever night to a box of chocolates and 2 bottles of water, which was a nice touch. the bed was in a league of its own - every bit as amazing as people have mentioned! I knew they were reknowned for their comfortable beds, but they were dangerously comfortable - often you'd lie down and find you didn't want to get up again!we abstained from the hotel breakfasts, instead opting for a more American style breakfast at the Red Flame Diner (a few doors down), which turned out to be very affordable, with tasty food and generous portions. We hadn't booked any restaurants, and the concierge were of great help. every question asked and request we made was dealt with efficiently and accurately.Location wise, its between 5th and 6th ave - 2 blocks from Times Square, which is very central indeed. we walked most places, and caught the subway to Macy's and other shopping areas like Prince St and even Century 21. (line R) we caught cabs to various restaurants around Manhattan and on average spent between $10 and $15 each way.Our 5am checkout took all of 2 minutes, so overall a very happy stay at the Sofitel Hotel . We will definitely be back next time we go to New York.
