{"text":"Amazing Experience! My girlfriend and I just got back from 7 nights at Gran Bahia Principe Bavaro and we had a wonderful time.The thing that stood out the most for us was the absolute cleanliness of the place. There was no garbage, no dirt, no tree debris after a stormy night. The grounds and the landscape was kept immaculate. Even the beach was combed daily and all the garbage was removed. We could literally walk along the beach and know when we had come back to the Bavaro property b\/c the garbage abruptly stopped.The breakfast and dinner buffets were excellent. I haven't been to too many Carribean resorts, but they were comparable to any Canadian breakfast or dinner buffet that I have gone to. Lunch on the other hand was rather mediocre. However, what they lack in variety during lunch they make up for in convenience by having two lunch buffets right at the pools by the beach that are open from 12 to 4. I stuck with the hamburgers, hot dogs, and fries - I found it generally satisfying until the dinner.During the week, we were given three a la carte dinners. We went to the Mexican restaurant, the steak house, and the Japanese restaurant. Unlike some reviewers, I loved the option of having a buffet along with what you could order on the menu. That way I was able to try lots of different things and still have higher quality food and the personal attention of a waiter. The food at all three was great. They put a lot of care into the food.On the other hand, we were given a fourth free a la carte on Christmas eve, and that was torture. It was an 8 course meal, that provided zero choice and lots of shellfish which I'm allergic to. It was really frustrating to sit through that without being accomodated, but we went to the buffet afterwards and the food there was AMAZING - best food at the buffet that week.The rooms were spacious and clean. The bathroom was large and the bath tub had jacuzzi jets. Nice touch.It's hard to comment on the night life because we only went out once. All the other nights we were too tired after waking up early to lie on the beach or go on an excursion. The one night we did go to the nightclub, we were pretty happy with the crowd, the drinks, and the music. The strobe lights got pretty irritating, but that might just be a personal intolerance.Overall, the place was amazing and I would definitely go back. Go and have an amazing time!
