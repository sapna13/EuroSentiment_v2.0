{"text":"Nice hotel My husband stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in March. I selected it based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. I enjoyed my stay at the hotel but to be honest I was expecting a little bit more from the hotel based on the over the top reviews. We booked a canal view room (Room 111). It was a fairly large room with a view of the Grand Canal. It was clean  nicely decorated. The room looked just like it shows on the website. The bed we had was 2 twin beds pushed together (very normal in Europe) however the beds were not quite an equal height. The side closest to the door way was slightly lower and a bit worn. In fact the foot of the bed had a rather big indentation. I wanted to mention this to the hotel but my husband wouldn't let me (it was his side of the bed). I was just a little disappointed considering we paid 239 euros for the first night  299 euros for each of the next two nights.I want to clarify that the hotel is nice but I didn't see why the reviews are as incredible as they are. I must give props to the staff. They were very helpful when we checked in - providing us with information about the vaperatos and also when we needed a water taxi for our very early flights home. I am in no way bad mouthing this hotel as it is a nice 3 star hotel. The location is perfect for those who have lots of luggage  don't want to haul them on a vaperato or pay for a water taxi.
