{"text":"We could not of asked for a better stay! My wife and I just got back this past weekend from 7 fantastic days at this beautiful resort. I have never written on any such site before, but I read so many reviews to help me chose our destination that I felt it important to share. This resort is as first class as you can get without paying crazy amounts of money. Yes... it is true that it takes a little over an hour in an air-conditioned bus to get to the hotel, (which bis only about 30mins more than the majority of places) but when you get there and they hand you a cool cloth and a glass of cold champagne you will be so glad you picked this spot.I could go on for pages about what was great, but the reality is.. the food is great, the staff are great, the rooms are great, the beach is great....the pool is great... on and on we were in heaven !If I had to give a few negatives....the currents are strong, so if you go for a swim in the ocean be careful not to get too far out, and if you are not a swimmer, stay close to shore. I would also have to say that the adult only nature of this resort draws a nice crowd. We met a few couples that honestly helped make this such a special time... Final words... if you are thinking about this place... GO ! If it is a couple extra bucks.... pay them !
