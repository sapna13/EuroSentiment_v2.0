{"text":"Very good overall experience, minus noise issue We have just returned from a week at hostal Barrera. The place is exactly what we expected after looking at the hostal website and TA reviews. The location is great, close to Atocha station, Reina Sofia and Prado museums the great area of Barrio de las Lettras and plaza Santa Ana. Our two rooms were newly refurbished: nicely decorated and very clean; I appreciate particularly the nice personal touch regarding bed sheets and pillowcases. The staff is very nice, Nieves is very welcoming and friendly (we did not need much help though as we visited our son who currently studies in Madrid). The hostal does not offer breakfast but there are a lot of caf√ã√\u2022√ñs in the neighborhood and we enjoyed great breakfasts, every day at a different place, from trendy caf√ã√\u2022√ñ to small local taverna. The only weak point to be mentionned is a noise issue. Curious that most recent reviews point this out whereas previous reviews did not (therefore we were not prepared to this inconvenience). We have not been disturbed by the street noise (the double glazing is efficient for most noises except horns), but by the inside noises from other rooms and from the corridor: early birds being really noisy one day, people coming back in the middle of the night... The walls seems to be paperthin as you can hear the water noises, not only the shower one but also the drops falling when the shower is done. I think the noises are amplified because the tiled floor is resounding. It was not too disturbing for us though, except one night, as we are not light sleepers.Overall a very good experience, Hostal Barrera is definitively great value for the money and we would stay there again, but light sleepers should be aware of the noise issue.
