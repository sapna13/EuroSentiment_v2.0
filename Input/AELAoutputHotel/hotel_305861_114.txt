{"text":"Decent hotel I stayed at this hotel with my husband for three nights in May 07. We had a disappointing start with this hotel. We arrived in Hong Kong quite late at night. We checked in to our room gone midnight to find that we had been given a room with two separated singles beds. When we booked our holiday we had specifically requested a double room. My husband went back to reception to request a double room and was told that they had all been given away. We were told we could be moved the next morning. The annoying part was that we were not informed of this when we checked in and we got the impression that they had hoped we would not notice. True to their word though they did move us and our luggage the next day. The hotel itself was very nice and clean. At first I thought the hotel was not in an ideal location but after spending the day in the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong it was nice to get away from the crowds. The train service in Hong Kong is fantastic, so as long as you use that then location should not be a problem. Room service was fantastic, and the buffet breakfast was also good. Overall the staff were friendly and helpful and I would stay there again. If you want a room with a room make sure you ask for it as parts of the hotel overlook a residential area. ","annotations":[]}
