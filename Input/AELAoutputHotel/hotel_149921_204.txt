{"text":"We loved the Caribe Hilton! My family and I have just returned, reluctantly, from a week at the Caribe Hilton. We had a wonderful and relaxed week, with consistently excellent service, beautiful food, and comfortable surroundings. We arrived after midnight and checked into a room on the Executive level of the main building. Our room was simply decorated, with the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Even though we were traveling on Hilton points, we had complimentary chocolates and Evian waiting for us. The room was clean, but the carpets and upholstered furniture were rather worn and water-stained, and the room was a bit small for two adults and two teenagers. The next day, we stopped by the HHonors desk and asked if there were a larger room available. Our request was handled with grace and efficiency by Mr. Luis Sanchez √à√\u2020\u2022?he moved us into an enormous one bedroom suite at the top of the Garden building. We quadrupled our space!The Hilton is not new, and there are areas that are in need of updating. Both our first and our upgraded room had need of a bit of attention (a missing drawer pull, a shower fixture that squirted a bit), but we were clear that we were spending a week, not moving in, and had a clean and comfortable place to sleep and change and have a bit of down time. Our room was immaculately cleaned daily, with an abundance of towels. The furniture was colorful and comfortable and again, the bed was sublime.Unlike the previous reviewer, we had a beautiful meal at Morton√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂. Our dinner at Lemongrass was phenomenal. We also thought the tapas at Madrid were rather uninspired, although the service was friendly, helpful, and speedy. Even the cheeseburgers at the poolside restaurant, Atlantico, were excellent. And the fruit! Lovely fresh fruit salads everyday. We generally skipped breakfast, and waited for poolside lunches at 11:00. When we needed breakfast, however, the HHonors lounge continental spread was sufficient. Room service breakfast one early morning was expensive, but VAST √à√\u2020\u2022?two orders more than fed four of us. We only enjoyed the buffet dinner at Palmeras once, and found it excellent √à√\u2020\u2022?with possibly the best lamb chops (chuletas) I have ever had. Yes, the food  beverage service is relatively expensive, but anyone who lives or travels in New York will find this Hilton no steeper. The drinks were $8, but we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e paying more than $10 in New York (and even Providence) restaurants. Considering that we were traveling on Hilton points, we were happy to pay for good food and drinks.The grounds, gardens, pools, and beach are all beautiful and well cared for. I was dubious about the beach, since it looks very small in all the photos I saw, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it big enough, with plenty of room to drift off on a raft without bumping anyone. Most people seemed to prefer the pools, which were also big enough for all of us.I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° be happy to return to the Caribe Hilton, even without points!
