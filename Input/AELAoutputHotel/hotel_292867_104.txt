{"text":"Loved everything about it! My husband and I stayed at the Caribe Club Princess for 2 weeks in Oct 2007 and we had a great time!! The hotel was beautiful, colourful and the vegetation looked amazing. They had all kinds of birds around the hotel site (white ducks, little ducks, peacocks, roosters, herons, little black birds, etc) which you could feed. The walk from the front desk to the hotel was about 8 minutes but they had shuttle services for those who didn't want to walk. The lobby was beautiful and they offer internet services ($10\/hour). The food was delicious and had something for everyone! Their buffet was great (and had a wide variety-they had a section where the food was always different but also had a couple of other sections where they served pizza and pasta everyday at every meal) and they also had 5 a la carte restaurants. We tried 4 out of 5 restaurants (mexican, brazilian, italian and chinese) and were happy with each one fo them. They also have a beach bar which starts serving food at 11:30 a.m. for those who can't wait until the buffet opens at 12:30 pm. The beach was beautiful and well maintained. There was plenty of chairs for everyone but of course, we were there during the slow season. If you walk 20 minutes to the left of the hotel or 40 minutes to the right of the hotel, you get to little shops on the beach were you can buy souvenirs. The only thing that we found annoying with those is that the vendors will come and grab you right off the beach to come see their shops and they will not take no for an anwser... When they would do that, I would ask if they would give me what I wanted for free as I didn't have any money, then they would let us go!The staff at the the hotel was very friendly and helpful. They always had a smile on their face and were always happy to assist you in any way they could. If you tip them (bartenders, buffet servers, restaurants servers) $1 US, they will remember you. We didn't even have time to order a beer that it would be sitting in front of us. My parents came with us for the first week. They usually travel in 5 stars hotels so I was scared they would not enjoy a 4 star as much. To theirs and our surprise, they loved it. The only thing they didn't like is that they bought the VIP package, which was a waste of money for them. The package gives you 1 hour of banana boat, 1 hour of internet (which needs to be used in one time or else you loose the remainder of the hour), 20 minutes massage, free premium liquor and a free dinner in a paying restaurant (value of $25\/person - steakhouse or seafood). All of that for an additional $200\/person. To them, it wasn't worth it and they do not recommend it to anyone. I would go back to that hotel in a heartbeat! We were afraid that 2 weeks might be too long in one resort, but it wasn't long enough! I would have stayed another 2 weeks! Have fun if you decide to go there!
