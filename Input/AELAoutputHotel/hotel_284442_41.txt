{"text":"Fleas and Cockroaches This place was depressing. Our room was like a college dorm without the colorful posters. It was dirty and musty with a film on every surface. We had cockroaches crawling on our stuff and fleas biting our ankles in the first hour. *The toilet didn't work.*The landscaping was probably lovely ten years ago, but now they hack at the mature plants and brutally top trees instead of removing them. Our lanai was tiny and dirty. It looked like it hadn't been hosed off in a year. The pool was milky looking and chained-off for everyone's benefit. I felt bad for the poor woman at the desk. She was one of two employees we encountered and she was very helpful and had a genuine alohaspirit. The lovely valley was ruined by a ridiculously intrusive and ugly multi-story condo complex set up against the mountain wall. The local beaches had scary homeless camps elbow-to-elbow for miles, and the town was an ugly third-world looking stretch of gas stations and liquor stores. Needless to say, we bailed, and were fortunate enough to get into the amazing Marriott Ihilani down the road in Ko Olina. If you're going to fly from the mainland - and especially if you have children - do not under any circumstances try to save a buck by staying at this miserable place. There are plenty of quiet guesthouses in nice towns (like Kailua) at the same price point with decent suites, kitchens and appliances, and have clean pools.
