{"text":"Big disappointment Booked a last minute stay at the Occidental Grand Puna Cana Sept 7 -14\/08. We found the resort to be almost deserted (probably because of the week we travelled and also hurricane season). The hotel's services were somewhat limited to reflect the number of people staying there. We stayed in one of their updated rooms which was actually very nice except for the bathroom. It didn't seem to be part of the refurbishing plan. The shower head sprayed water all over the floor no matter how you positioned it. Most days we didn't have more than two bath towels and when we did request more, they came with a small hand towel at 11:00 pm. The floor was always very wet and we had to lay our merger towels down so it didn't travel out the bathroom. Poor lighting, no counterspace, toilet flushed sometimes...luke warm shower. Unless you bought into their special Club package offered at an additional fee of $20-40 per person a day, there was absolutely no service either. We spoke to people that did upgrade and the room service, food and drinks changed dramatically. If you are looking for a higher star rating, the upgrade probably will probably do it. Remember, this is a 3rd world country and their standards are different than ours. There was a lot of staff around; they were tripping over each other but perhaps only available to club members?? Communication was a huge problem - the staff didn't appear to speak a lot of English and our spanish was no better. It was almost useless to talk to them about any problem. We have never had such a problem before. The concierge in our building was constantly begging us to go to their 2 hour time share information meeting. It was awkward having to get by him as he was positioned right at the 2nd stair landing. It had rained the five days before we arrived and there were piles of towels on the tile floor in the main foyer and main restaurant entrance most of the time we were there. It seemed the ceilings leaked and the tile floor was very, very slippery. We saw quite a few people had casts and bandages for some reason or another.We didn't starve but the food got pretty mundane quickly. The a la carte were a little hard schedule as the gals at the front desk were only there a few hours each day to book. There never more than 20 people any sitting we went to and it really was no better than the regular buffet.The beach was very nice and the water beautiful...good variety of water sports. Very entertaining to watch a couple of girls having nude pictures taken by a photographer with hotel staff monitouring it. Can't say I've every seen that at a family resort before! We did go on a couple excursions including the Safari Jungle and a catamaran ride which were enjoyable. Favorite drinking hole was Steve's Bar for the coldest ever beer (right by hotel). We have done 8 trips in the past 5 years to Mexico, Cuba and one other trip to Puarta Plata, DR. This was by far our worst trip ever, 2nd only to our experience in Puarta Plata.Make sure you bring at least some school supplies, toothbrushes or something for Safari Jungle or one of the other groups to distribute to the schools directly. If you are an animal lover, you may want to donate to one of the animal societies to help all the stray animals. The local people are very nice but really struggling until the tourist season it's back in full swing. Life is sure different off the resort!Sometimes a deal isn't a deal - I guess we got what we paid for!
