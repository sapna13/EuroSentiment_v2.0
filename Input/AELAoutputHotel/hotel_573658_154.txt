{"text":"nice hotel just got back from Toronto yesterday and had a great time at the Suites. Have been on several city breaks and usually spend about √ä√£¬¢70-80 a night for a room and the suites was the best room we have stayed in so far. Got there on evening so early check in was not a problem for us. The desk staff were helpful throughout the stay , helping us with things we forgot to bring with us from uk and giving directions etc. Stayed onthe 27th floor and the view was fabulous. Looked across to the Harbourfront and the Islands and the CN Tower , couldn't ask for more. No street noise but each floor does have air vents on the outside wall which makes a low humming noise( got used to it after one night)The rooms are decorated nicely and the beds are big ( king or larger?). There is a desk and leather chair and big wardrobe and big tv with dvd player and fully equiped kitchenette with dishwasher and washer\/dryer( hotel does laundry pack with machine powder and tumble dryer sheets etc for only $3 or √ä√£¬¢1.50 and lots of other hotel packs e.g refreshments and movies)Bathroom is medium in size with a shower( no bath) and nice tolietries. Hotel has restaurant which we used on first night as too tired to go out and thr food was lovely and a really good price. Did not use gym or pool as out all day but had a look and the gym had good equipment but the pool is only small enough to bathe in not swim.Hotel is right next to the King subway which can get you to most places and there are loads of restaurants and shops in the area.
