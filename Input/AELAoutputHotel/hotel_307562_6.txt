{"text":"Case Study in Poor Customer Service My husband and I recently stayed at the Ramada during a trip to Bali to celebrate our anniversary. I had read Trip Advisor and was a bit wary of the negative comments for the hotel, but decided to give this hotel a try considering its reasonable rates. (Our stay was planned for the end of a long trip in which we were staying at other hotels ranging from $225 to $250 a night, vs. $90 a night at the Ramada.)Overall, the hotel is better than the Ramadas in the US - the rooms while not luxurious are comfortable. We had already been to the gorgeous beaches of Canggu, Seminyak, Jimbaran, and Nusa Lemongan, so we did not mind that the beach attached to the Ramada isn't the nicest (per the other reviewers, it is indeed mired with boats and jet skiis, and during low tide, is covered in seaweed rather than clean sand). The Tao restaurant has a nice pool and the food was reasonably priced as well (~$50 per meal for 2 people with drinks). However, the experience breaks down when customer service is involved. First of all, I had booked our room online, and when I tried to email the hotel at the email listed on their web site to confirm our reservation and to find out about when their late check out is, no one answered. I had emailed 6 times, and no answer. In fact, I had to get the concierge at another (far better) hotel in Bali to confirm my reservation with the Ramada. Then there was the fact that the Ramada would not help me book alternative transportation to the airport. They charge $15 per trip using their hotel shuttle, when a taxi should cost only $7. When I asked them to book a car with a private driver we had found, they charged me $2 just to make the call. I was really appalled that they would be so cheap considering we had not made any other customer service request of them. Booking a car for the airport should be the least that they could do for their customers.Finally, there was a bill dispute that they failed miserably at handling (they charged us a full third day's rate when they should have only charged us for a late check out on the third day). The manager was completely unwilling to budge on this, giving absolutely no concessions or even a discount considering it was fully the hotel's mistake. My husband and I discussed this and realized it was probably a directive from Ramada's central management not to let junior managers do what they need to to help their customers and ensure complete satisfaction. The difference between a full day and a half day's rate was only $45, but because they were unwilling to even consider this, they have lost us as customers for life. I am planning to write a strongly worded letter to Ramada central management about this issue, and would definitely never recommend Ramada to any of my friends and associates. My husband is planning to use our experience at the Ramada in his company presentation of how NOT to manage customer service, and I am planning to submit this case to my business school as well as a case study in poor customer service management.In short - if you wish to truly experience the luxury, comfort, and amazing customer service that Bali has to offer, pay a little more and stay at the myriad other hotels in South Bali - not the Ramada.
