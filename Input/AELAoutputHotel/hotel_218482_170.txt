{"text":"Rain or Sun..still alot of fun!! MY husband and I were at this resort Jan 17-24. With alot of research on the different resorts in Punta Cana, we decided to go with this one for many different but one important reason..The reason is and the main reason was it had a bit of everything to offer especially GOLF. My hubbie is addicted to golf and for me all i was interested in was a fab beach. Oh yes, not to mention the price was right as well!!We had a great flight from toronto. We left the cold and the best feeling ever was walking out of the plane in Punta Cana to feel the warmth. Got through the airport smoothly and off we were to find the bus to take us to the resort. That had to be the most confusing thing ever, We were told atleast 3 different numbers for the buses and they are all numbered. Each bus for eachresort. Finally we got to the bus and went on. All the other buses were leaving and there we were sitting there with no idea as to why we have not left. Long story short...I still dont know to this day,but lets jsut say it took much longer then it should have. Finally we were on our way. Its a very short bus ride to the resort. Upon arrival to this resort I was completely impressed with the open, bright lobby! We checked in and within 10 minutes we got our keys to our room. The staff took our bags and placed them into the cart. I WAS SHOCKED that they took our bags, but hey what about us? Where is our room? Oh yes, one thing I did not like was the fact we had to attempt to find our room on our own. It was interesting to find our villa as I forgot to m ention that we arrived late night. The resort is brightly lit, however if u dont know where u r going, it can be a fraustrating why to start off. FINALLY got to our room 3127. Walked in and once again I was shocked to see the state of the room...one word to explain the room...PERFECT! Very bright,large and most importuntly CLEAN! The shower and the toilet where in the same room, and the 2 sitter bathtub was on the otherside from where the shower was. I was super excited to see how nice the rooms were as the other half and I have had some horrible experiences in the past. We decided to drop our things and make our way through the resort to see whats where and find something to eat. No problems, th hubbie found some hotdogs and we then found the casino. Lets just say we were not so lucky to win anything.To get to the point of my thoughts of this resort, I will list everything good and bad briefly:**PRO***-Clean and spacious rooms-A ceiling fan to keep u extreamly cool and comfy-Fab and clean beach with tons of chairs. To get a hut,must go super early to place ur towels downs. Not a big deal if u dont get one,very breezy cominbg from the beautiful blue ocean-Swimming pool another beauty,large and veryy clean. Lots of chairs so there is no issue. The bar is near by and does not take long to get a cold drink-We had some rain durning our trip and was stuck under a tent by the pool to keep dry. The staff were there,ready to get the party started regardless of the weatgher. This is loved the most. -Pool side restaurant..AMAZING!! The best pizza ever,all the soda's and beer u wish to have. All u can eat at this place..try the icecream, one thing I did not but heard its great!-U have choices between 4 different restaurants, which unfortuntly we did not go as the main reason is I AM A PICKY EATER. We did eat every day breakfast  dinner. I am notsure if there can possibly be anyother person out there as picky as I am...so dont worry about the buffet. U forsure will find something to your liking!-the grounds of the resort was sooooo clean and inviting!-majority of the staff were always smiling and saying hello. The odd ones some interesting personalities if I can put it that way!Well as u can see no cons to right. I highly recommend this resort. Remember, u go with a positive attitude something good always comes ur way. U go negitive, well then u mine have well stayed home to complain!
