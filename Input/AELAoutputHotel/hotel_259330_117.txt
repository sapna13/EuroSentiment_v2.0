{"text":"Could of been nice........... We stayed at Grand paradise from april 20-27.The first look at the hotel was very nice.First of all, at the check-in nobody gave us a remote control for the TV in the rooms, papers for the a la carte restaurants were missing in our check-in enveloppes.The room at the sunquest sections were very nice and clean with very comfortable beds with flat screen TV's..........but the fridge in the room is a SCAM!They give you 4 bottles of pop and you have to pay for the rest which they over charge you when it is time to check-out for stuff you never took.....it happened to half of the bus that was leaving(40 people about) and the worst is that you can't do anything about it because they won't let you in the bus if you don't pay!!!!!!!!!!The beach was very nice but VERY crowded for this time of year....can't imagine what it can be in febuary!!!!You have to wake up at 6 am to get a palapa on the beach and when you get one people accuse you of stealing it!The complexe is WAY to big for the size of the beach...it's like 3 complexes for 1 beach.The sunquest section is pretty far from the beach...about 10 minutes walk...there's a train available but you have to wait somtimes 20-25 min. till it comes and most of the time it's FULL!The buffet food is pretty ordinary...especially after a couple days....one morning the cheese for the omelettes was ROTTEN and that was pretty discusting!!!The washrooms by the beach were often pretty dirty....broken doors, plugged up toilets, no toilet paper, dirty flooors ect............!!!We had planned to enjoy the water sports at the hotel but it turned out different.....when you went to book time for the catamaran they ask you for a credit card which we didi not like leaving because we did'nt trust them very much......and finally when they had the card they never had any available for us to take but they were pretty much always on the beach and it really depended to who you talked to and who went to have a space for the catamaran...they would even invent room numbers to pretend they were booked and then mark them off with liquid paper when THEY felt like it!!!!!!Hard to beleive but VERY true!!!!!They just opened up a new bar shaped like a boat near the sunquest room section when we were there.........but nobody ever went because they decided you had to pay your drinks to go there.....this is a all inclusive or WHAT!!!!!To get people to go there....they CLOSED all the other closest bars which were working very good.For the music......it's always the same CD playing alll week long and that kinda of got very annoying after a couple days(Creole Family).Also, we decided to go to Saona Island for one day.....first of all they tell you that it takes 1h30 to get there but that DOMINICAN time because it's a good 2h30-3hr to get there. So you spend at least a good 5 hrs in the bus for not much....saona was not so great....I think the beach in punta cana is much nicer...saona had broken glass on the beach, the food was very basic, lots of rocks seashells in the water and the VENDORS were VERY annoying (there was 1 every 2 min.). The sunquest people at the hotel were not very helpful.....whe tried to reach them but no answer!!There is no telephone or time in our room.(building #7).The best employee whe met was RICARDO at the buffet by the sunquest section...he really cheered up our vacation!I would think twice before booking there even if it's VERY cheap.....we payed 750$ and were still disapointed!!!!
