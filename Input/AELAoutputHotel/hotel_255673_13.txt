{"text":"Don't bother with the executive lounge I booked this hotel through wotif.com.au for my husbands birthday. We chose the executive room with access to the executive lounge. The rooms are clean and beds comfortable. Great location. Don't bother to book the executive lounge rooms, below are the problems. . I booked the executive level room and we were placed in room 1706 not on the top 2 floors as stated in the booking. When we checked in we were given no information about the executive lounge and had to look it up in the hotel directory. We then had to wait 30 minutes for our luggage to be delivered to our room. I had to ring to find out where our luggage was. We also received no evening turndown on either night nor were there any bathrobes in the room. These are all listed items on the hotel website. The wesite also states that there is a cooktop and pans in the executive room which was not there. During our stay the top level was closed for renovations so no spa, pool etc access. This should be stated on the website. The hotel also states that cocktails are available in the executive lounge. This was not the case as there was only one staff member and nowhere set up to have a cocktail made. There was also no cutlery set up for the evening canapes or breakfast. When we arrived for breakfast at 9am there was a very limited selection left and we were told that was all that was available. As breakfast was until 10am the plates should have been replenished with enough selection until 10am when breakfast finished. This is an executive lounge in a 5 star hotel and the service was not good enough. ","annotations":[]}
