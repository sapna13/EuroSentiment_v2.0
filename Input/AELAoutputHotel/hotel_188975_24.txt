{"text":"Flawless! We stayed at the George V for 3 nights in July 2008, it is by all standards spectacular, it has an excellent location just off the Champs Elysee. Upon arrival the service level is second to none, very professional and attentive, the lobby is beautiful, incredible arrangement of flowers. We were personally escorted to our room by the manager on duty, the rooms were spacious (especially considering the size of normal Parisian Hotels), clean and well appointed. The drapes completely blocked out the light (great!), iPod docking station, the beds were so comfortable and the bathroom was a very good size with nice amenities. The hotel provided us with a bottle of Champagne and dessert for my wife's birthday.The staff are extremely professional, they are very customer focused (honestly some of the best that we have encountered anywhere). As we were traveling all day we went to the spa to relax, the staff were very pleasant, all the amenities that you could ask for were present. The only negative for the entire stay was the hot tub which was more lukewarm.The concierge was very helpful and efficient - thoroughly professional. We had lunch at Le Cinq and again service was excellent, attentive yet not stuffy, friendly and engaging. Food was superb, beautiful surroundings, loved the wine list (incredible offerings) however it was so expensive (especially with the dollar - $155.00 for breast of chicken... not kidding). Nice touch of taking our photo (their camera) and had a memento five minutes later in a George V card.Expensive but worth it, overall, wonderful experience!
