{"text":"Very Satisfied We stayed in this hotel at the front end and tail end of a cruise. This is a beautiful hotel with unbelievable service - from their custom pillow menu to their bed turndown service. (note- do not use the do not disturb sign on the door if you want to take advantage turndown service , because they will not disturb you for any reason...PERIOD!! The room, although smaller than comparible American hotel rooms, was impecibly decorated and furnished. The room bar was fully furnished (but a tad expensive - even by European standards)We traveled with relatives but they didn't share the same experience (some construction jackhammering was occurring outside their room during the day) , but I'm sure the hotel would have changed their room if they would have complained to the hotel staff. All staff were fluent in english as well as other languages. The doorman even greeted us by name when we went out for dinner (amazing since we never gave him our names)! When we requested to have a 7:00am taxi night before we departed (which can be difficult in Barcelona as there is sometimes up to a two hour wait for Taxis), they had two of them right on time - waiting for us (about 30 Euros from the hotel to the airport and visa versa)This hotel, while not being on La Rambla, is in a perfect location. It is only a few hundred meters to many architectural landmarks - yet is not on a busy street. Walk out the doors and you can immediately shop for Gucci bags or Valentino dresses (Yea, right! - but it is nice to window shop - as they are truly beautiful garmets). is only a 20 minute romantic stroll along outdoor cafe's, bakeries, eateries and shops to reach La Rambla.The food from their resturant was fantastic, however the breakfast buffet was probably the best I have ever experienced. Imported cheeses, specialty hams, sausages, breads, coffees - even specialty diet foods (low fat preserves, crackers, cereals), etc., or you could just have a normal cooked to order meal such as an omlet. We had a most pleasant stay there and will definately stay there again when we return to Barcelona.
