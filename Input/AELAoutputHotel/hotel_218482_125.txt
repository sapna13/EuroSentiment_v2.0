{"text":"Fabulous Vacation We stayed at the Catalonia Bavaro in Punta Cana from March 27 to April 3, 2008. It was the best vacation we ever had. The atmosphere was so welcoming. The staff were all very friendly and acommodating. We read the reviews on a weeky basis until we left for our vacation and they are true, the Catalonia is an excellent place to stay. The food was great, the main buffet was better than the beach buffet, more selection and excellent service. The restaurants were good, our favourite was the Mexican restaurant , the French restaurant was very elegant and the food was good as well. The beach was fabulous but you have to get there by 6:30 a.m to save a cabana or you will not have one for the day. We visited the vendors on the beach and found some wonderful artwork at the vendor to the left on the beach. The shows at night were pretty good, they have the children's show on for 45 mins starting at 8:30 pm and the disco opens at 11 pm after the last show is over. The pool was huge and the drinks at the pool bar were good. We enjoyed the animation team, they made everyone feel welcome and encouraged everyone to take part in the activities. The beach party on Monday evening was fabulous, alot of time and effort is put into the party and it is evident. We are going back in December and highly recommend it to everyone.
