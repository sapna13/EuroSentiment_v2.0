{"text":"Loved the LTI Fantastic Holiday My husband and I, both in our 50's, stayed at the LTI for 2 weeks from 25th Sept, 07 we had a fantastic holiday. We went on this holiday with some trepidation after reading some of the reports, we need not have worried, we thought we had arrived in paradise. The LTI is small in comparison to some of the other hotels but we found it very comfortable and the staff all very friendly (tips or no tips). The grounds and the pool area are kept very clean as were the bars and restaurants which there are, the buffet restaurant open for breakfast, lunch and evening meal, the Italian and the fish restaurants are open alternative evenings. Our room was in block 4 again this was kept clean and towels changed daily, mini fridge restocked daily also. All staff work very hard in keeping everywhere clean. The food was good, I am a fussy eater but even I always found something to my liking I was very satisfied. The whole time we were there we had no upset stomachs etc no nothing to complain about, only the rain but no one can do anything about that. Gardens around the complex are a pleasure to look at and very well kept. The beach is something else, wonderful white sand so fine it's like talc. We walked for miles in both directions, when we weren't lied on sun beds ( which there are plenty of ) either by the pool or on the beach. No need to take your own beach towels as these are provided. We went on the outback safari trip this was a brill day out ,our guide Omar was good fun and so interesting in his knowledge of the island. We would recommend this trip, we had a fantastic time. A boat trip booked at the watersport hut was also excellant it was only for 1 hour, and went out to the ship wreck then along the coast of Punta Cana in both directions. What a wonderful place we would definitely return to both this hotel and the resort of Punt Cana.
