{"text":"Disappointed We booked the hotel for a work retreat partly on the basis of the reviews here and I must say that we were somewhat disappointed. There were around 10 of us and I must say the service of the hotel was just not up to stratch.1. We arrived at the hotel around 6.30 pm and attempted to check in. This took 30 mins because some of our rooms were still not available. Given check out time is around midday, I find it somewhat strange that the rooms are still not available at that hour. 2. We had upgraded one of the rooms to the executive floor because they wanted to charge SG500 for the use of the room for a couple of hours. This charge seemed rather high given we had a group of 10 persons staying at their hotel - could they not offer us a discount? Anyway, by getting an upgrade we could use the executive floor facilities, which included free use of the room for 2 hours. But when we tried to check in, we were informed that there was no reckon of our upgrade, despite the fact that we had phoned up twice in advance to confirm.3. We got to the executive floor room, which really was just ordinary. It was a nice well decorated modern hotel room, but quite small for a 5 star hotel room. In fact, this room turned out to be smaller than another colleague's room, which was on the ordinary floor. Go figure. 4. On the whole, we did not find the staff to be very friendly. During check in, while the whole group was left waiting at the lobby, they could not even muster a smile or look apologetic about keeping us waiting. 5. The hotel is far from the city center. There is lots of shopping Suntec, but coming back from the city center does involve a cab ride, which during peak hour can be quite difficult to find (I've been told Singapore cabbies are prone to hiding waiting for people to call for bookings).On the other hand, the pool was lovely, as were the staff there. The Melt also has an awesome buffet. Given the number of other lovely, centrally located hotels, I do not think I would stay here again.
