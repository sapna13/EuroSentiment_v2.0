{"text":"QT Multiple Stays My business has taken me to NYC twice in the past month and Hotel QT is on their preferred vendor list. I was so pleased with my stay the first time around I begged to have them book it the second time for my week stay. The location is stellar. Pubs for a night cap right next door, Duane Reade for essentials right up the block...and most importantly Times Square a stone's throw from the front door. The staff was freindly and helpful, the complimentary breakfast...while light...is still a good value and beats the egg wedge and crusty potato cake you get at most free breakfasts. The pool was the discussion of my trip the whole time. My business associates who stayed at other hotels did not believe I had a swim-up bar at the hotel and it took a google search to prove it. The best part of the pool area for me is that they had underwater speakers and they CARED about the music. Most places hit the radio and forget about it. You can tell that the music is suited for the arc of the day. Very quiet and calming early morning and gradually increasing in energy until nighttime when it is bumpin. Certainly not a place for the modest! All of the lobby and bar area can see you in pool (what polar bears must feel like at zoo) and my shower on the 11th floor had a HUGE bay window looking out to offices across...half was frosted...but anyone with binoculars and some time could get quite a show looking at that hotel. The bed was TOO comfortable...it was quite hard to get out of it each morning! Once I did however, had a swim, had a steam, had free breakfast, enjoyed my rain shower, got dressed and hit the city...I felt rested, relaxed, and rejuvinated...all signs of a good hotel. Love the QT....charming...inventive...quirky...fun!!! Try something new...you will love it. ","annotations":[]}
