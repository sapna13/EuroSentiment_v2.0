{"text":"Comfortable and Friendly We have stayed at this hotel twice. On the first occasion, the Junior Suite we had booked was so small that there was insufficient space to unpack 2 suitcases, let alone set up a laptop. What was otherwise a very high standard in all the hotel departments was let down by the room size. This was not a Junior Suite at all, in fact it was no larger than a small single room. I wrote to the management after our stay, and received an immediate and apologetic response stating that they had now downgraded the description of the room in question and offered us a complimentary stay in another suite, which we took up in October 2008. The suite on our second visit was adequate in size, very comfortable with excellent bedding, separate shower unit plus full sized tub, plenty of hanging space and a pleasant seating area. I believe they may have 'upgraded' us to a full suite in view of our comments after the first stay.In every other respect, the Chesterfield Mayfair is a fine hotel, offering service levels well above the norm for London. The doorman parked my car, returning it punctually when requested. The room service was incredibly fast. The Butler restaurant served us an excellent dinner and the breakfast offerings were of the highest standard. If you are travelling 'light', I would recommend this hotel without hesitation, situated in a quiet and elegant part of London within an easy walk of the West End. ","annotations":[]}
