{"text":"The Good and Bad This is a nice and small hotel. Not too many rooms. Quite quaint.The staff are very helpful and polite. Getting the valet service is well worth the time of not having to look for a parking spot.They have Wifi and a PC in the lobby for guests to use. If you need to print, they will let you to their printer. I needed to get my flight itinerary and that was really helpful.I had a connecting room (a room that has a door between another room). There was unfortunately quite a bit of noise coming from the other room. I would have expected it to have had much better noise insulation. There wasn't much of any noise from the streets, only once when a really noisy Harley went by did I notice.Also, the bathroom tub\/shower barely drained. At the end of a short shower, I was ankle deep in stagnant water.But the washroom didn't fog up much. Even after my girlfriend's LONG and HOT shower, the steam was pretty much gone in 4-5 minutes.A package that arrived before me was no where to be found. I still haven't been able to locate where it is. It would have been refused, according to the front desk staff (it was sent via a different name than what the room was booked under). Unfortunately USPS can not find any records of it still.But that aside, it's a great location. All the shopping centres are close by.......and the staff are great. There's also a bar connected through the lobby from which you can bring drinks up to your room.I would definately stay here again.
