{"text":"Ronda Hotel Barcelona is a great deal for visiting a city Ronda Hotel Barcelona room number 305It is really a great deal. I can√à?√¨t understand what others expect from a 3 star hotel, because some visitors wrote bad critics of this hotel.Perhaps they had another room or they expect more than the price could offer.The hotel is situated near the center, 10 minutes to walk to the ramblas, 3 minutes go walk to the next metro station, surrounded by coffe shops. What else do you need for visiting a city?The reception was opened for 24 hours, very helpfull and friendly of corse english speaking. I booked by one RatesToGo.com but it would be a little cheaper to book it directly. They have rooms with double bed and french beds. Just tell them, what you prefer. If you book by RatesToGo, your credit card is only charged for about 20% of the rate. If you book directly it would be charged for the full rate.When you arrive you have to pay for the whole.I payed √à√\u2020√ü?56 for a double per day without breakfast.The breakfast is a buffet for about √à√\u2020√ü?10. I didn√à?√¨t need it, because dinnertime in spain starts after 9 pm. What to do with a buffet in the morning? Allthough it looked good.my room? I had everything I needed. Two clean beds, safe to rent, Tv with international channels (in german only 3 sat) clean bathroom with toilet, bidet and bathtube. Every day fresh towels.Hairdryer - soap and shampoo renewed every day.At our arrival, a lamp was not working, but it was renewed after some minutes.I had a room looking not to the street. Perhaps this is the reason why we didn√à?√¨t have any noise of the street. Somethimes I heared the elevator, when the wondow was opened. They have also climatronic or heating, but I didn√à?√¨t use it in november.I was very lucky with this hotel. It is a great deal for this money and a great deal to visit barcelona. ","annotations":[]}
