{"text":"4th time around Me and my boyfriend have made amsterdam a yearly break and we always stay at the Nadia. Its perfect for us!Dam square is a 10 minute walk away ( a lady never rushes! ) and its on an easy to find road - this is a bonus when its your first time in amsterdam and you've got lost and your trying to find your hotel. Its round the corner from the anne Frank house and there is a canal bus stop opposite- bonus!The staff are friendly and there is always someone at the desk. The stairs are really steep to get up to the hotel so i wouldnt suggest going there if you have a disability or have troubles with stairs.The rooms are clean. Small but cosy. They are en suite and the bathroos are also small but again clean, and the shower doesnt trickle. The double beds are huge and really comfy and you have a safety deposit box, a fridge and a TV in your room. You also have tea facilities in your room, and as every self respecting brit knows a good cup of tea at the end of a long day is well appreciated. Breakfast is served in a quaint little room with a view over the canal and the church. You have a choice of juice, tea, coffee, croissants, bread, toast, cheese, cakes and jams. Its not a full english, but its continental and adds to the experience of a european break.I could not fault this hotel and could not ask for more from a hotel- its safe, friendly, clean, cosy, reasonably priced in an excellent location - i would highly recomend it.
