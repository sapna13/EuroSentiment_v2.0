{"text":"Great Hotel And Location spent 3 nights at the senator gran via hotel 16th nov - 19th nov 2007 and found it to be excellent. in a great position on the gran via which is one of the main streets in the city centre and therefore very handy for all the city sightseeing locations, restaurants and bars. the hotel was nicely decorated, very clean with well appointed rooms with all sorts of bathroom extras and best of all a free mini-bar with beer etc which was refilled every day. we had 2 rooms 706 which had two balconies and looked right up the gran via and 705 which also had a view of the gran via from its one balcony - both rooms i would highly recommend. after making your booking e-mail the hotel direct as i did and request high corner rooms overlooking the gran via. breakfast is first class with eggs, bacon sausages cooked to order along with loads of cold meats, cerals,yogarts, breads, juices etc. spent two days on the hop on hop off open top tourist bus which you can catch across the road from the hotel, its a great way to see the city. the royal palace is a must with the throne room unbelievable, i would suggest you rent a walking commentary phone rather than a guide, and if you are a football fan the real madrid stadium is not to be missed - what a stadium - 15 euros entrance fee is well worth it.on sunday there is a massive market in the city centre which is spread over a large area and is great for either buying or browsing.also if you can explore at least of the main parks, especially on a sunday when there is all sorts going on. airport transfers by taxi for four of us were 30 euros coming but 37 euros going back for some reason, i reckon we were conned. you could always try the metro from the airport as there is a station right next to the hotel.go to madrid, go to the senator gran via you will enjoy yourself, however take plenty of warm clothes in winter as it is very cold in Madrid even with the sun shinning as it does every day.
