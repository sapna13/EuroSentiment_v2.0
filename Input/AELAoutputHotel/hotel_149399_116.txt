{"text":"One Time Only and Not Again.... The Room...Late check in, only one person at the Front Desk. Room requested was not ready. Gave us another room. The room was dirty and had roaches. Maintenance showed up late afternoon to spray the room. We were always short of towels and one day the housekeeper forgot the toilet tissue too, so we had to call for service. Housekeepers do not vaccumm the rooms, they just sweep and mop. There was hair every where. One day they forgot to turn the room, so we had to call for service again. Each housekeeper carries 16 rooms per day...The Spa...The steam room was out of service, the sauna did not work and the jacuzzi was cold and dirty. The attendant answer was we are waiting for parts to complete repairs. We had to go Barcelo Palace Resort next door for Spa Services and for half of the price...The Restaurants...Dinner Reservations are very limited and you will be lucky if someone answers the phone after 9AM every day. The food overall is good but not great. If you do not get a dinner reservation, then you will end up eating at the Market Place Buffet, and good luck again...The Golf...Very expensive for the quality of service and condition of the course. Do not even try the practice range, the balls are so hard and heavy that my #5 club broke on impact during practice. I brought my son's and mine clubs in one bag; but the attendant tried to force me to rent another bag so the ranger would not get upset...all they want is your money. The Golf Shop was selling 3 balls for US$16.00. I came fully prepared to have a good time with my son; but it was hell in paradise, employees had no sense of customer service whatsoever, all they wanted was to sell us more and more poor services. I got upset and left the course; but fully refunded...The entire resort personnel is in Vacation Packages Sales and you feel under constant pressure during your stay. The Sales Personnel also enjoy the breakfast buffet with the resort guests and they not even say good morning to you; But they want your money big time. Be careful....Very Poor Management.This experience was a ONE TIME ONLY and NOT AGAIN.
