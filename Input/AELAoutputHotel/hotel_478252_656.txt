{"text":"Fantastic, Toronto, Canada My husband and I just came back from Bahia Principe. We stayed there from June, 2 to June,9. The resort was very big. They divided into 3 section. Bahia Principe Bavaro, Bahia Principe Punta Cana and Club Premier. We were on the Punta Cana side. The resort was well maintain. Our room was clean and nice. Our flight with Air Canada was good. The check -in was quick. Our tour rep, Kim was quite helpfulRestaurants: We went to the French restaurant on both sides (Bavaro and PUnta Cana) . The menu looks exactly the same. I had lobster and my husband had lamb chop. The only thing is DR lobster tasted a little bit different than our lobster but it was alright. The lamb chop was good as well. We also went to the Seafoods restaurtant. We had lobster and it was good as well. You are only allow to book 3 restaurants per stay even though there are 7 restaurants in the resortBeach: White sand and blue water, very clean, some seaweeds floating but it didn't bother us.We did the outback Safari trip. We visited a typical country side DR family. Then went to the rum shack and cigar maker. At the end, we went to Macao beach. This beach is beautiful, white sand and blue water, no seaweeds. We did boogies board there.SHOPPING: We found that the gift shop in the resort has a reasonable price. There are also about 10 vendors on the resort. With these guys, you have to bargain. The vendor told me that $145 for a Dominican Kiss statue. He ended up sold it to me for $35.At the Duty free shop in the airport: too expensive, the price is almost double the price in the resort. So if you want to buy something, just get them at the resort.The washroom at the airport was terrible, so dirty, and disgusting. I had to hold myself until we got into the airplane.Overall, I would definitely recommend this resort to any one who wants to go to the Carribean for vacation.
