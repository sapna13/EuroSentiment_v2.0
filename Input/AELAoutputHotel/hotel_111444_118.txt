{"text":"Very nice stay I should preface this by noting that we used Rewards Points to pay for our stay, so the only cost to us was the parking.We chose the Fairmont because it was part of our points package and it was within walking distance to the Wang Theatre (about 15-20 minutes). As well, they also welcomed our dog.The valet and doorman were nice and friendly when we drove up. And we were very pleasantly surprised with an upgrade to a king suite when we checked in, so the visit got off to a great start. It was pretty busy in the hotel at the time - looked like there was some sort of seminar or something going on - so it took a while for the few bags we had to make it upstairs.The room was excellent! The bathroom was very spacious - two smaller rooms (toilet\/bidet\/large shower stall in one and vanity and large tub in the other) - and the rest of the room was very large (spacious enough for the king bed, a couple of bedside tables, the armoire, a couch, a bench at the end of the bed, a coffee table - you get the picture). I did check out the fitness center - it was small, but seemed to have the basics - 2 or 3 treadmills, a couple of eliptical machines, a good stack of weights, as well as a universal. The equipment looked pretty new. It appeared to be very clean and well-maintained - just as the rest of the hotel appears to be.We were in and out of the hotel and the staff was always very friendly\/helpful the few times we had questions. Our only complaint was that the shower stall ended up leaking water profusely on the floor - I felt bad about it and we cleaned it up as best we could and left the towels in the tub.According to our bill, the hotel would have cost $260\/night, which considering it's a four star, nicely located, and the room was actually a suite, probably isn't too bad. (We'll be staying at the Onyx soon, which will cost us more.) Money permitting, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!
