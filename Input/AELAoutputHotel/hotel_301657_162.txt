{"text":"Fantastic value and great location We stayed at the Park Hotel Tokyo for 3 nights and thought it was great. It was in a very safe location which was just 5 mins walk away from the shops in Ginza. Our room was on the 29th floor and had great views. The room was a good size, considering it cost only √ä√£¬¢80 per night for a double room. The toiletries provided were great, as were the free toothbrush, hairbrush, razor, and also the tea\/coffee. We did hear some faint noise from the train station but it didn't bother us.We found it quite easy to navigate our way from the room to the main streets. Simply take the lift to the Lobby, then walk across the Lobby, and take either one lift to the main entrance of the building or the other lift to the subway. Even jetlagged we were able to work it out. My only complaint was the breakfast we bought on our first morning in the Hotel Lobby restaurant. It cost 5000 Yen for 2 continental breakfasts, which was more expensive than any other meal we had in Japan! The next morning we went to the cheaper 'News Art Cafe' on the ground floor of the building, which cost 650 Yen for a coffee and croissant.We also appreciated the free internet access on 2 computers and didn't have any problem accessing them.Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Tokyo. It is a modern, well located and well priced hotel.
