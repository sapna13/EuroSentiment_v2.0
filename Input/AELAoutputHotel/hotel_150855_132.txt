{"text":"We'd go back We were there from Dec.7 to 14 ,2006.We were pleasantly surprised since we paid so little through a last minute travel site on the web. Room was a little musty but if you feel the constant humidity it's no surprise. It was always clean and everything worked well. Bed and pillows were hard but we have become accustomed to this at all-inclusives. We took a couple of pillows with us and left them for the maid at end of trip.(we just sucked the air from them in those vaccuum bags and they took up little space - $5.00 pillows) Food was good in the buffet- we ate breakfast there and one supper. We easily booked a sit down restaurant every other night and they were very good- the Steakhouse, the Mexican, the Caribbean and twice in the Italian since it was sooo good.The beach is to die for- lots of Palms for those who don't want constant sun. Walked for miles along that beautiful beach.Lots of Europeans stay here and are not shy about shedding their tops so if you don't like the female breast, go elsewhere. Personally, I had eye-strain at the end of the week.Staff was friendly although there isn't a lot of English spoken here we could always make our thoughts known to staff.Our only complaint was with other guests at times. Many of the europeans seem to be lacking in a few necessary manners like saying please and thankyou to staff and by not moving when walking the paths of the complex. I used a few hockey skills at times and put a stiff shoulder into more that one man who would not move over for my wife and myself as we walked single file to give them room.We were also impressed with the cleanliness of the washrooms in and around all of the public places like the restaurants and bars. The grounds were also immaculate.We will be looking for some great deals to go back there again next year or to the Riu Bambu which also looked great. The Riu Macao Palace and the Riu Palace were beautiful but I'm sure the price just went up about 200% and they looked a little more stiff shirted if you didn't wear a $400.00 bathing suit.
