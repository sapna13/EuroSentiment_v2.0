{"text":"Clean, Comfortable, Great location My boyfriend and I stayed at the Marriot December 27 - December 31, 2007.I am originally from the Bay Area (East Bay) and enjoy flying back to San Francisco for the fun city\/tourist attractions.That being said, I did not want to stay near Fisherman's Wharf as it is a little 'too touristy' for me...but I didn't want to stay in a desolate part of the city either.I was EXTREMELY impressed with the Courtyard Marriot. The lobby is clean, modern, and feels brand new. Starbucks also shares the lobby with the hotel which is convenient and an added bonus. The rooms are spacious with a King bed, loveseat, desk, coffee table, dresser, etc. I had no complaints with the room.It was only a 5-7 minute walk to Union Square and other attractions. We walked down the street and found plenty to eat also. Bodin bread bowls, local taverns, etc. It took us only 10 minutes to walk to the W hotel for a trendy cocktail for happy hour and other upscale martini bars. It is easy walking places because there is so much to see while doing so. Late at night we took a taxi back to the hotel which is very inexpensive.It is a great hotel considering you will pay the same amount of money (if not more) for an older, rundown, outdated hotel near the wharf\/Union Square areas. This hotel is extremely clean and well worth the price.I will definitely stay here again when returning to the city!
