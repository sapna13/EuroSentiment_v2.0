{"text":"Good hotel but why all the hype? There is no doubt that 'de las letras' is a chic hotel but rather too trendy. The location is excellent, a short walk from the main areas and the metro is a short stroll away. Lifts, rooms and the bar are all dimly lit and the trendy colours are a little too much, particularly if you get dark red with only spotlights for company! The bathroom was large and modern with a wide range of accessories. My wife was very frustrated by the lack of a full length mirror in the room and commented that putting makeup on in the fairly dim bathroom with the mirror making you look two metres away was a challenge. The bar was pricey but the young glamorous folk filled it every night yet the restaurant was almost empty. We booked one of the standard rooms which looked into a central small courtyard - this added to the darkness but meant a peaceful night's sleep once the windows were closed despite being in the centre of the city. If coming from the airport don't bother with a taxi, take the metro. Once you get your head around the routes and colours it is very easy and airport to the hotel cost about 40p. We took a day trip to Segovia, worth seeing but be prepared for a 2 hour train journey each way with trains running every two hours. The city bus tour is worth doing to get an overview of the city but we only booked a one day ticket, using the metro for the second day to get around else you are stuck with the circular route of the tour bus. All in all a pleasant stay at 'de las letras' but if returning to Madrid we would probably try a more traditional hotel - that's probably just our age!!
