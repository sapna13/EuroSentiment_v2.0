{"text":"Londra Hotel - Great Stay  During our recent trip to Italy, among the hotels we stayed at, Londra was the best. Coming from the states, where finding a hotel with large rooms or suites, which can accomodate two very active little girls and us, is so easy, it was a shocker to us at the first hotel we stayed in Bergamo, when they mentioned that we need two rooms for four of us. It didnt matter the children were 5 year and 9 months old. We had to fight tooth and nails to get a one big room with a King size bed and a crib(our own portable one that we bought). We had to pay extra 60 euros a night for that arrangement. I was expecting the same kind of argument when we checked into Londra, but to our surprise, there were no issues  on the contrary, everyone was very nice  the rooms were amazing with every little little ameneties you would expect of a four star hotel. Something very diffcult to find in Europe. The AC wasnt very cool in the first room and they upgraded us to even better room right away. The crib(theirs) was very comformtable, with kid books, toys etc.Room service has american choices like burger and alfredo pasta(yeah ...alfredo :-)). Restaurant, bar, breakfast room, everything is really nice and the staff is extra nice. I would recomend anyone to stay here. dont worry about the construction thats going on outside, as everything else totally outweighs that minor issue. Just make sure to ask for a renovated room. I havnt seen the other rooms, but i took that advice from one of the trip advisor reviews and i was happy. At Milan we statyed at the Le Meriadian Galia - that was nice too. They gave us an extra room for free :-). ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1120,"mention":"burger","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1114}]}
