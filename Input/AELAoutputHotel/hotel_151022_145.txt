{"text":"great place for your money What a great resort .We arrive March 15 around 11:00am or so. Rooms weren't ready so we left our luggage at the front entry and hit the bar. Got our rooms around 2pm. Put the luggage in the rooms and hit the beach to explore. Don't understand where those negative reviews come from. This resort is great. Rooms were large and very clean. Buffet had a lot of choices and very good. All 3 A LA Carte was great so was the service. Lots of seaweeds but they do a great job cleaning it up. We did tip them and boy was our spot clean. What a great bunch of people. We did the Saona Island trip. What a great day the speed boat ride back was a ride from hell but we manage to laugh all the way got off the boat soak and wet.What an experience. Juan Carlos took us to Santo Domingo we took a taxi . Edwardo the driver was a great guy. We had a wonderful day. Just the 6 of us in the taxi drinking Preisdente what else can you ask for.$50.00US each.We thought that was reasonable. Left the resort at 7:30am arrived back at 8:00pm. We did have to get up early around 6:00am to get chairs at the beach but at 7:30am there still were some left . We are early risers so that does not bother us. I would definitly go back to this resort.Pablo at the front desk was great.If you need something just go and see him. ","annotations":[]}
