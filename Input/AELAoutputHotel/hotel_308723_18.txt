{"text":"This is not Bali Having great faith in Tripadvisor, I booked this hotel in an instant, for our last 3 days in Bali, as it was rated number 1, of all the hotels here on tripadvisor, in Kuta Bali.Also, after checking their web site, I decided it looked very nice also, so went ahead and booked.Arriving at the hotel after already being in and around Bali for 11 days, we had somewhat of an idea, of how Bali hotels are, and I can say, that anyone staying in this hotel, is not experiencing Bali.The rooms (if you don't happen to be staying in an expensive villa (as seen on their web site)) are no better than standard 'hilton' quality. The building housing these rooms, is something like a hospital building. The grounds, were small and few plants, the pools were fine, but the main pool was like a sports swimming pool and very unattractive.Overall the feeling was something like a pretend Bali experience, from the constantly piped music which sounded like from a lift, to the bad location (yes, it is ON the beach, but as with most hotels in Kuta, is separated by a main road, and the is not hotel bar of even chairs for hotel use)The breakfast, standard hotel buffet, was offering choice, but not a lot of taste or quality.If you like hotels with no personality, that are overpriced and bland, you will love this place, but why stay in such a place in Bali, which is about culture, nature, beautiful gardens and personal service. Here I felt afraid to touch anything, as there were warnings everywhere that breakages must be paid for (complete with a full price list of every item in the room).In the end, we checked out after one night (even though we should stay 3) to go somewhere more personal. And this incurred a one night's charge for cancellation (who makes these hotel rules?)I think the term 'Boutique' is here stretched to the limits of its definition.Bland. And frankly, very disappointing. ","annotations":[]}
