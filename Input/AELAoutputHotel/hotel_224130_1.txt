{"text":"AWESOME--highly recommended I stayed for two nights as I interviewed at the Parkland and Baylor Dallas hospitals. The location was a bit tricky to find even with GPS. However, once I was there, i was not disappointed. The hotel is in the heart of downtown, right next to the AA center.Check in service by the staff was excellent. In fact, every time I walked by, they were attentive and ready to answer any questions I had. I stayed in an executive king. One bed, one pull out sofa, mini kitchen. The furniture was new and clean and had a modern look to it. There was wifi and a flat screen tv in my room. The bed was nice, high, comfy, with down comforter. Everything you would need in the mini kitchen, including pots\/pans, utensils provided. It was amazing. I went to the newly renovated fitness center and I thought it didn't have a tv at first but then I realized that the tvs were on the equipment! You just hook in your headphones and you're good to go. there is a treadmill, elipitcal and a bike. Some free weights too. They may be adding more since they were still renovating. I found out that they were changing from the Bradford to the Hyatt during my stay. This did not impact me at all. In fact, I thought I got a bargain for the price I paid. The food was also very good. There is complimentary breakfast everyday with starbucks coffee. There is warm bar, bread, bagels, fruit, yogurt and coffee\/tea. Everything was great. Overall, this hotel was fabulous. I didn't mind paying an extra 15 dollars\/night compared to the other hotels that were offered to me for my interviews because the service and quallity can't be beat. I highly recommend this hotel. (may now be called the hyatt).  The shuttle service will take you anywhere within a 3 mile ","annotations":[{"endOffset":622,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":618},{"endOffset":1349,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1343},{"endOffset":1375,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1370},{"endOffset":1383,"mention":"bagels","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bagel"],"startOffset":1377},{"endOffset":1398,"mention":"yogurt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Yogurt"],"startOffset":1392}]}
