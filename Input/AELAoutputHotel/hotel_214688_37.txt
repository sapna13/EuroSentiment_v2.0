{"text":"loved this hotel\/condo highly recommend it! had trouble deciding where to stay as we had never been to hawaii before-unable to get clear picture of things from all my research prior to the trip. wanted kitchen facilities as we often prefer simple meals.this place was fantastic and really met our needs.i must admit it is a little tired and could to with new a little freshening up but was spotlessly clean-no cockroaches or ants as mentioned in other posts!we stayed in a studio room with kitchenette-on the 16th floor-had views of the park\/city and also could see the ocean! there were 3 of us and we shared 2 queen size beds! very comfortable beds at that!the rooms are quite large so we did not feel cramped but we really only were in the room to sleep, shower and change and occasionally eat.this hotel\/condo is very close to everything you need-1 block from beach-easy 5 minute stroll.easy walking to great restaurants and shopping-we walked to ala moana shopping centre twice and found this an easy walk also but the bus is just on the next corner if you're not into walking.kim, the most wonderful, friendliest concierge, ever was a delight and couldn't do enough for us-as were the rest of the staff.the pool has been described as very small but i found it great for relaxing and cooling off and the deck chairs were very comfortable and plentiful-pool no good for lap swimmers however there is an excellently equipped gym if you need exercise and fort de russy park next door which had a great path around the perimeter to run around.we will definately stay here again-we are not into resort accommodation so if that is what you are looking for you will be disappointed but dont overlook this place if you want everything else for much less than similar hotels charge ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1148,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":1141},{"endOffset":1148,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":1141},{"endOffset":1148,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":1141},{"endOffset":1148,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":1141},{"endOffset":1148,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":1141},{"endOffset":1148,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":1141}]}
