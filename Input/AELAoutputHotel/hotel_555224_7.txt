{"text":"Great Hotel except for Checkin Staff Overall, the hotel is really nice, clean, very easy walk to the subway.The only negative I would have to stay was our experience checking in. We arrived on a red-eye flight on Saturday, 8\/9. I wanted a room to check in that early so I made reservations for Friday, 8\/8. I sent the Courtyard Marriott an email back in July that although we have a room for 8\/8, we wouldn't be checking in until very early 8\/9 so NOT to cancel our room.I then called the hotel directly on Monday, 8\/4 to confirm our 'late' arrival. We received written and verbal confirmation that they would make a note of our early Sat. arrival and that they would not cancel our room.Upon arriving to the Courtyard South Boston on the morning of 8\/9, we checked in with the night supervisor (wish I wrote down his name) and another employee named Dan. I said Good Morning to them and neither acknowledge my greeting. The Night Supervisor looked up my info and said coldly, You were supposed to check in yesterday so we canceled your room. I told him I called AND have written confirmation (which I showed him) that we were checking in early 8\/9 instead of 8\/8. They did eventually get us a room but neither employees were apologetic or courteous. While this did not ruin our trip, it left a negative feeling about the hotel since they were the 1st 2 people we encountered. They treated me as if it was all my fault.If anyone does what we did re: getting 2 nights with late check-in due to a redeye flight, make sure you confirm at least THREE times. Obviously, one written email  one phone call is not enough. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":731,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":725}]}
