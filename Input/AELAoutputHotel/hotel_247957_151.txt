{"text":"Beauty only goes skin deep on the surface this resort and all its amenities looks like it could be compared to heaven. the open air lobby hits you with a perfect breeze. the lush gardens are well maintained and bring out the beauty of the resort. the beach is without a doubt as good as it gets. from comfy lounge chairs to shady palm trees and numerous beach activities for the action\/adventurous type. although no wave runner rentals was a HUGE disappointment for me.accomodations: check in was smooth. we asked for a king sized bed during booking process and at check in, but what we received was two full sized beds pushed together and during the night the two beds would separate causing a canyon that was very uncomfortable we stayed seven days and complained each day with no results. on the 2nd day a very large storm moved inand when we came back from breakfast our room was flooded from a leaking roof. look was cleaned up in about 2 hours. interestingly enough when we reported the flood at the front desk I saw the lady write down our room number on a piece of paper with several other room numbers causing mrese to believe alot of rooms at this resort have this problem all the time. tv had plenty of stations spanish and english. gym on site is small but adequate. tennis and basketball courts were in good condition.FOOD: at breakfast buffet is your only food option and after a week was I was sick of it. Because the buffet is your only optionat breakfast it became very crowded with long lines for crepes and omelets. request for ot sauce and ketchup took forever if at all. at lunch their buffet at the beach is excellent with lots of cooked to order items. snack bar has great burgers ranking the 4 a al carte restaurants;1.mexican 2.italian3.asian4.brazilianmake your reservations early to avoid sellouts.taco shops and pizza parlor are very good alternatives to a a carte. no waiter service at the beach or pool.entertainment: there were no off site tours sponsored by occidental. and the travel agencies' tours were extremely overpriced. I would like to thank the hard work of the hotel staff that put together games at thebeach and pool. and these same employees put together a stage show nightly, they easily put in 12 hours per day. the shows were of corny variety but my wife enjoyed them and looked forward to them nightly. mostly audience participation. my favorite part of the trip besides the beach was taking a 10 minute walk to the plaza and goofing off with the locals. the plaza has good shopping for women and a sportsbetting parlor for men.OVERALL: this resort is gorgeous and has some positives, you'll have to be able to overlook the glitches to enjoy yourself, And the positives of OCCIDENTAL GRAND FLAMENCO PUNTA CANA.
