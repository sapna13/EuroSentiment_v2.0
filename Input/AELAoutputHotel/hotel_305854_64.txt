{"text":"A Pleasant Stay at Harbout Plaza Metropolis We stayed at the Harbour Plaza Metropolis from Dec 18 to Jan 1 and find it overall a pleasant experience. We booked a suite because we have 2 small children (age 7  4). I must admit I was a little worried because of some of the negative reviews posted on this website. When we checked in, we were upgraded to the Harbourview floor with a beautiful view of the Victoria Harbour and that was a nice beginning of the stay. The suite was spacious and clean, the kitchen well equipped. (I did find the hair dryer in the writing desk, a somewhat odd location). There was no bathtub but a nice shower stall ( that did cause some problem with my younger daughter since she hated showers). House keeping was efficient, but room service could improve a bit. However, every person we encountered at the hotel were friendly and helpful, it did not matter that we were Chinese speaking tourists, the Conciege was extremely helpful and efficient. The mall attached to the hotel was very convenient,(there was a laundry service at the mall which opened every day including X'mas and New Year Day with express service and at reasonable price, they even deliver to the hotel and that was a great plus). We ate at a couple of restaurants at the mall and they were OK.The one compliant I have was the toilet, the water that used to flush the toilet sometimes seems to be brown and muddy and smelly, I usually flushed it more than once to get clear water. I think there is an issue and it seems from the other review that the hotel is doing something about, although we were not aware of any water disruption the whole time we were there and if thats the case, then hotel management should communicate the issue better with the guests.
