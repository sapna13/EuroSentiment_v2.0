{"text":"Mixed bag While it's location and price are reasonable, I had anmixed experience at this hotel. My boyfriend and I booked this hotel as a romantic weekend getaway. The Joie de Vivre addition was obviously still in the awkward teenage years of a redo. The lobby was wonderfully Zen in its decor. We paid for a King bed with a balcony and a view of the city. I was less than impressed with what the reality was. The balcony was a concrete slab and wall that extended less than a foot from the room and connected with the next room over (no privacy). It looked less than updated. The view wasn't bad...a generic city view... nothing to write home about. And while the room we booked, and most of the rooms at the Kabuki tout their traditional Japanese soaking tubs... they were laughable. If you weigh over 140 pounds (like me), fitting into one of these tubs is a tough sell. The shower head was broken and the shower door was not sealed (so water got everywhere on the floor). The pouring bucket proved to be more useful than the shower head. As for the hotel staff, I would say they were giving about 50%. Every time I called downstairs for a taxi it took 10-20 rings for them to pick up. When my boyfriend called from the airport it took 18 rings for them to pick up- which was more than frustrating. When we finally got hold of them, they were very helpful in giving direction and restaurant advice. The beds and bedding were the most impressive thing about the whole experience. They were perfect. The room was very small, there was barely enough room to move around it. There were no curtains per se, just sliding wooden panels (which did not do a good job of keeping out the morning sunlight). A few things to keep in mind, before you arrive, bring earplugs (it's a noisy part of town) and bring your own room service (as they haven't gotten to that part of the renovations yet).
