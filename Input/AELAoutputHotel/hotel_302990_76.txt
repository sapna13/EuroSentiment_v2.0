{"text":"great service, amenities, tiny rooms I booked my room and checked in on the same day, which got me a discounted rate (save ~200 HKD, for a final rate of ~1450 HKD). The agent who checked me in was very helpful. She even showed me another room (on the top floor, for the same price) with a harbor view so I could consider my options.In the end I got a room with two beds. Both that room and the other with 1 bed were the same size. (just barely large enough for the beds and the desk) The view out the windows was nice even though it wasn't a harbor view. (it was a south room across from the peninsula hotel) The rooms were nicely furnished with a desk for working, including a fax machine, and computer\/TV display. The TV had a number of chinese and english channels and movies.The internet was 120 HKD for a 24 hour card. (I didn't avail myself of the option.) The room had a fruit plate and a couple of free water bottles, and also a refrigerator. (no microwave) The air conditioning worked well and the lighting was good. The bed was comfortable (not too firm or soft). There were two outlets supplying 120V power (two prong USA-type plugs), one in the room near the desk and the other in the bathroom. The bathroom included a shower\/bath which was of reasonable size. The shower was comfortable. (sufficient water flow and temperature)The hotel itself is nice with open hallways and a comfortable lobby with doormen. There is also a bar and restaurant, which are as pricy as you might expect in a hotel.Since the room is pretty small I wouldn't recommend this for someone who is planning to spend a lot of time in the room. Assuming that you are going to be out and about though, you couldn't pick a much better location than this (Tsim Sha Tsui, on Nathan road). Great restaurants, shopping, clubs, and bars are all at your doorstep.
