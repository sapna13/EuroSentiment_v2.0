{"text":"Incredible, just very big! This was a great resort!CONS-The resort was WAY too big. It is about a 20 minute walk to the beach from the lobby, although they do provide a train every 15 minutes.-If you get a room near the beach, you have to get a train to get to any of the diner resturants, and if you get a room near the restaurants, you usually need the train to get to the beach and the pools.-There is only two pools and they are tucked down beside the beach.-There are too many salesman on the beach that get very annoying, although if you say no thanks they usually dont hassle you anymore.-The rooms probably are closer to a 4 rather than 5 star, but are still nice.-The casino is fairly small, but still nice.PROS-Excellent and a large variety of food. I recomend the capri and the italien for dinner.-incredible landscaping, some of the best anywhere.-The staff are friendly, but some struggle with english.-The golf course is across the road and has a free shuttle.(ask to play the hibiscus and bouganville courses, they are awesome, but the benjimina course is awful)-nice, clean beach.-The entertainment at night is good, there is two stage shows and several bands around the lobbies.-Very Clean.-Great water sports.-There is one of the most unbelevable malls which is a two minute walk away and is part of the rsorts gated in area. There is also armed guards at the entrance of the mall.We took the ATV adventure and it was the best experience of my lifetime, you have to do it. (You go to a private beach and a really cool little town.) I also reccomend upgrading to royal service, because the rooms are fabulous and there is a private pool, restaurant, bar, beach and a VIP lounge. Royal service is like staying at a 5+++++++ star! If you dont get royal service, ask to stay on the tropical side because it is less busy in the lobby and on the beach. Also, for lunch make sure your either go to the agora or la gondola beacuse th turrey grill is SO BUSY! Overall this is a great resort worth staying at.
