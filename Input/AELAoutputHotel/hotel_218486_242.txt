{"text":"Good vacation We had stayed at this resort Feb 13 - Feb 20. 4 of us at the age of 24. After reading all of the reviews I was kinda scared of what to expect from the resort. But after being there I thought it was great.The first day we arrived it was around 11:00pm and we got checked into our hotel room right away. Block 96. It was not a bad room at all, it had all we needed. 2 beds, shower, tv, and a toilet. We also had great airconditioning. Later that night we got wasted and went to the resort disco, which wasnt bad at all. It was packed full of people, who were all dancing and having a great time.The buffet was good, kinda different but was good. There is a italian side to the reort, make sure you go to there buffet because the food was a bit better.Getting drinks was no problem from any of the bars, and we always had a great time sitting at them during the day.The beach did have seaweed, but didnt bother me at all. The sand was very soft and nice ( white sand ). If you like to look for shells and stuff like that, you wont really find anything here. The ocean was a nice color, but was kinda rough. You couldnt really do any snorkling, because of all the boats and because of how rough the water was. We had very good and hot wheather all week except for one day we had a bit of rain, but I liked it.The restaraunts we checked out were the italian, japanese, spanish. We all hated the italian. Loved the japanese and the spanish though. Snack bar was good as well and we always went there late at night.The shows were great and I enjoyed them alot. Some of them were soo funny. One night we payed $10 U.S. to take a bus off the resort the a disco called trpicana or the cave. You get 1 free drink and entry into the disco. It was soo cool, because it was in a huge cave with bats flying around. Beers were $4 , but I was ordering vodka and redbulls which were about$13 U.S. It was safe and alot of people were there from different resorts. The had two rooms, one played rap, dance, resort music. While the other room played techno. All in all it was a great night.Another night we went to a beach party, where they had a huge bon fire. We drank and partyed all night.If you were looking to buy something go down the beach a bit and you will find a row of shops, make sure you dont pay full price as you can bargain down alot cheaper. There is also a little town off the beach were they have a grocery store and alot more shops. The shop workers were soo anoying and always wanted you to see there shops. I also heard about some peoples rooms being broken into, soo make sure you get a room were there is alot of taffic. Also lock your balcony doors and close the curtains with the tv and lights on. So it seems as though someone is there.There were alot of couples , but I met a couple of single guys and girls. We all had fun and partyed together.I only got sick one day, in the middle of the night. Luckly I brought some pepto bismal , and some diahria pills. Or I would have been in trouble.By the last day I was ready to go home. I was getting sick of eating the buffet and all I wanted was mcdonalds. haha.There is probably alot of things I didnt missed in this review but thats because there was soo much to do and see. It was a fairly big resort, and definitly a 3.5 - 4 star resort.We all had a great week, and would do it again.
