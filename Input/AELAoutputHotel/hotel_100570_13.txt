{"text":"Great Place and Location We just came back from our trip to Seattle and stayed at the Westin. First of all, great location to restaurants and to Pike Place Fish Market. Just a few minutes walk, and we were at the Westlake center mall where the monorail is at. Who needs a car, when there are free bus rides around the downtown area. When we arrived to the check in desk, the front desk attendent asked us if we wanted a room at a higher floor with a good view. Of course, we jumped at the chance of getting a room with a nice view. When we opened the door, the room was very nicely decorated and comfortable and from our room we got a view of the space needle. We were wondering such an expensive hotel that they would charge for internet connection up in the room. However, we found out that they provided free wifi in the lobby which makes up for it. One thing to watch out, don't jostle the mini vending machine that is underneath the tv. I must have moved the tv or bumped into the dresser that we got charged for something that we didn't even eat. All the food in the vending machine is electronically sensored so I guess that even a little bump can knock an item off the sensor which charges the patron for it. However, we spoke to the front desk and it got resolved very quickly. Overall, we will stay here again.
