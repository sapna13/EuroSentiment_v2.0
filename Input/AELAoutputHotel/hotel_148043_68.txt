{"text":"Charming Hotel, Enhanced by Superior Service by Staff We selected El Convento, with no prior knowledge of Puerto Rico or the hotel, using Trip Advisor...and we were very well advised indeed. The hotel is not a beach resort. It is wonderfully located in the most historic part of Old San Juan. The location across from the cathedral and very near to the primary shopping areas allows for walking nearly everywhere in the old city--the museums, restaurants, historic buildings and waterfront. There is a free shuttle bus loop should you tire of walking, or want to begin your day at the far end of town.The hotel is an historic building begun in the 17th century, and was one of the early historic preservation efforts in the old town when it was converted from commercial use to hotel in the 1960s by a member of the Woolworth family. Today it has just over 50 rooms, plus a lovely terrace and plunge pool on the roof with harbor and town views, a nice gathering area where wine and cheese are generously served each evening, restaurants and meeting facilities. Our room was not large, but we had access to so many other facilities--including nice tables in the open air hallways of the hotel--that it did not much matter. The bathroom was also quite small, as is often the case with historic hotels. If you are looking for space, this is not the place for you. The furniture was dated, but the room was clean and had doors that opened to a harbor view. There was an up-to-date flat screen TV and complimentary hard-wire internet access (as well as a computer in the library for those not traveling with their own). Linens were clean, and towels were promptly replaced during turn down service. Air conditioning was just adequate, and would definitely be a concern in warmer months. The hotel building and furnishings are comfortable, not lavish, but the staff is exceptional. The evening wine reception was truly a chance to meet and interact with staff and other guests, not the usual one glass of cheap wine and run. We enjoyed our fellow travelers and talking with staff, and we got lots of pointers on restaurants and things to do. Judith, the front desk manager who is originally from Sweden but has 17 years in Puerto Rico, was particularly welcoming as well as wonderfully efficient. She and the entire staff team never failed to be welcoming, courteous and helpful. That put the real luxury into the stay.There is access to a beach club at Isla Verde, which is actually the Marriott Courtyard Hotel, adjacent to the airport. This requires a $20+tip taxi ride each way, but once there we were treated very well and the beach was superb. You can sign for food expenses at the Marriott that are billed back to your El Convento account, so you need not carry much money or credit cards for your time on the beach.We dined twice at the in-house Tapas restaurant, a nice follow-up to the healthy serving of cheeses at the wine reception. Breakfast in the courtyard was very good with good service, but the morning kitchen is very slow. Our 5 night stay was at rack rate in high season, so it was not inexpensive. The hotel is used by cruise lines for pre-departure stays, and some travelers reported much-discounted room rates...but only for one night. We felt that we received good value due to location, historic ambience and the very special treatment given by all of the staff. If you want a beach resort, or the most up to date interior design, El Convento is not for you. If you want to be in Old San Juan with easy access to cultural sites and wonderful dining, and with an atmosphere that reflects a very historic place very well, then select El Convento. We are very glad that we did.
