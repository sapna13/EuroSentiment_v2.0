{"text":"Amazing Stay We stayed at this hotel for 10 days with our family and nanny. I got to see several rooms all of them being beautiful and cozy. Our room was the two story loft style room, the other rooms were well appointed and yes kinda small. Do not forget honey you are in Europe. After all JK Place is a converted mansion. Our room was the biggest by farof the three I saw. It was pricey but we certainly felt we got our money worth. The staff were super attentive and very pleasant in helping us with places to eat and getting the trains and tours going. The breakfast was great and the lounge\/ lobby area is amazing, comfortable and so well decorated. You felt as though you just stepped into a magazine photo shoot. There were a lot of little corners to relax in and you do not fell as though you were in a hotel. They have a great library to relax with after a long day of sightseeing. The rooms were clean and fairly well maintained. The bummer is that the Santa Maria Novella square is under renovation so the construction noise was a little loud in our two story room in the morning. It didn't bother me but it did my husband. There is a great yummy place around the corner serving good salads and pizza called El GRILLO. A nice pharmacy and all this (hotel) is close to the shopping street and the piazza republica. As we talked to people around town, mostly locals -everyone agreed that the hotel was one of the chicest -nicest places to stay in Florence. There are a lot of hotels in Florence, true but I think JK Place in a gem in the rough.
