{"text":"Simply... WOW I booked this through Meriton'sown website, as they are usually a few bucks cheaper than anywhere else. I have stayed here around 10 times in the last year, so am probably well positioned for a fair review.Location: you can't get much better than this!Parking: Very confusing. There are no clear signs on the street. World Centre is on the block of Liverpool, George, Pitt and Goulburn streets. There are car park entrances on all four streets - parking for Meriton enters on Goulburn Street.The check in was pretty average, the staff seem to be disinterested and pretty humourless. Bear with them, they have dull jobs at the end of the day.I have found that a last minute deal is usually the best way to get a well appointed apartment - they seem to 'fill up from the ground up' - selling the cheaper, low floor apartments first, then selling the higher ticket ones for less when they haven't sold at their 'rack rates'.All the apartments are of excellent quality. Appliances are good quality - it's easily possible to whip up a great meal with everything in the kitchens. Entertainment - All rooms have Foxtel, so plenty of TV to chhose from. Failing that, there is a DVD player and stereo too, so if you have your iPod, you're in business!Most of my visits have been in the 1 or 2 bed apartments, and usually on a high floor. North and North -East facing apartments have the best views of Darling Harbour and The Rocks. Comforts are above average, and the beds are usually two single beds joined together. In spite of this, they make for a good night's sleep. The bathrooms are great - the showers are powerful and the baths (sometimes spa baths) are enormous.All in all, definitely well worth the extra few bucks. ","annotations":[]}
