{"text":"6 Nights at the ParkCity As with everyone else it seems, I picked the ParkCity based on the reviews on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. I traveled to London with my wife and two daughters (ages 8 and 15). We booked a special package, called the Summer Sensation Package (or something like that). Each deluxe room was 165bp's per night per room including VAT, and a continental breakfast for each person each morning. We booked two rooms, and they were the only hotel I checked with that would confirm and guaranty that the rooms would be connecting (rooms 108 and 110). We were also given coupons for 4 drinks in the bar. I also booked high speed internet access in advance for 6.50bp's per day, relatively cheap for London. Saved about 3pounds per day by prebooking. Still no wireless though!The location is ideal. The neighborhood is totally safe, and we never felt uneasy no matter what the day or night. A grocery store is a 2 minute walk away, and many restaurants and other services are within a 10 minute walk. We frequented the Earls Court Tube station, which is less than a 10 minute walk through very nice neighborhoods. From that Tube station, all of London is a short journey away. It seemed much nicer than the Gloucester Road station. The hotel itself is very nice, and very different from a chain hotel like the Marriott, or Holiday Inn, in my opinion. Very much more English, which I can't really explain. The lobby is immaculate. The little bar is just OK; very much a quiet little place. In fact, the whole hotel is VERY quiet. We kidded that we seemed to be the only people in the entire place! It would have been nice to have a bit more interaction with some other guests, but I'll take the peace and quiet any day. The rooms were decent: probably about the size of a normal US hotel room. Bathrooms were very nice as were the beds. The air conditioning in our rooms was very quiet and COLD. One nuisance is the light switches on the outside of the bathrooms. Our rooms were right next to the lift, but we never were bothered by that. Windows opened as well for some fresh air. We never made it down to the restaurant, Lessandro's, for breakfast. We always had our free continental breakfast via room service, which was always delivered promptly at the time we requested the previous evening. I was expecting Lessandro's to have a dinner menu, which they did not, so you have to go out for lunch's and dinners. This was fine with us, but the first night we would have rather had room service. The continental breakfast was really good; fresh rolls\/toast\/croissants; yogurt; coffee\/tea; cereals; fruit plate. Very filling and delivered to your room if you'd like! Regularly 13.50bp's per person...A couple of restaurants we tried in the area included Bella Vista (on Cromwell); il Borgo (on Glouchester); and the a chinese place, The Dragon, I believe, near the Earls Court Tube. All were excellent! We also tried Giraffe on Kensington High, but weren't impressed. The service at this hotel is decent, not exceptional. Everyone is friendly, and they execute well, but there is something missing. Not sure what it is. This wasn't a big deal, as we don't require alot of hand holding and really spent a minimal amount of time in our rooms. And there wasn't alot that we needed anyway. I would recommend getting a car from Heathrow, as I can't imagine lugging our luggage through the Tube and then to the hotel (my ladies pack alot of stuff). We used Londonheathrowcars.com; about half the price than the hotel's car service and they did a good job and were reliable. Still about $90 USD each way though.Checking out was a breeze. The bill was perfect with no surprises. All in all, a great home base for exploring London. Not cheap if you are getting two rooms, but a good alternative that gave the kids their own place, and us parents some privacy too!
