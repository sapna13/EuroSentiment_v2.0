{"text":"Still Got It. I had completely forgotten about the Sheraton Towers in Singapore whenI needed a place to stay for the New Year holiday. My brother-in-law recommended it, and I was quite hesitant at first, thinking I preferred to stay at the Intercontinental instead. The architecture of the outside of the Sheraton Tower is rather dated, and has a distinct '70s appearance. But once I got into the lobby I completely changed my opinion. The space inside is magnificent; acres of marble, soaring ceilings, and a huge glass wall looking out onto a waterfall.Yes, it was also rather '70s in design, but it is very well maintained, and looks just as great as it did when I visited it the hotel back in the mid 1990's for a wedding dinner. This trip we stayed in one of their suites (the Cambridge on the17th floor), and found it to be very well appointed. Breakfast in the ground floor restaurant came with the room, and offered a nice spread that included local favorites as well as more exotic fare such as baked beans and roasted tomatoes (aka, The Full English). I highly recommend the basement Chinese restaurant Li Bai for Dim Sum. I'm always on the lookout for good Dim Sum, and this has to be mynew favorite in Singapore (also, check out the Dim Sum at Lei Gardenin Chijmes for another excellent offering). All-in-all, I think this fine hotel has been forgotten in Singapore's craze for all things that are new, and the Sheraton Towers will be onethat I will consider staying with in the future.
