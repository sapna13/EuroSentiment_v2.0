{"text":"Very good resort I stayed there with my family from July 2nd to July 16th and it was actually a great vacation.We got rooms in building 5 which is not the newest one. The rooms were very large and comfortable. The bathrooms seem to be a little bit old and need some refurbishment but nothing dramatic. We asked to be on the second floor with sea view and they made arrangements for us.The beach is excellent but there are not plenty of places with shade. So it is tru that you may need to wake up at 6am to reserve a good seat. We stayed a few years ago at the Catalonia Bavaro and it was the same. What is really different here is that you can really swim in the sea. Almost nobody does it but the sea is deep enough. On the contrary the pool was a bit disappointing because the maximum depth was 1.25m... and a lot of people were just sitting in the beach and drinking cocktails.Her we come to the bars. The bartenders seem to be used to serving only beers. But there are very good cocktails : coco loco, caipirina.... There is no need to tip to get enough alcohol. Just ask them!The buffet was really amazing. It was different every evening with a lot of special themes. There was plenty of choice and the food was excellent.The animation staff works hard but they are only 6 and seem to organize the same activities everyday : stretching, shuffleboard and volleyball. The good thing is that you can win some bottles of rhum.At the water sports house you can borrow canoes, catamarans, windsurfs for free. They also give lessons for free whereas you have to pay in the other resorts. Scuba diving is also great with an ewcellent divemaster (Frankie).To sum up : do not hesitate to reserve, this resort is great even if it is not very expensive. ","annotations":[]}
