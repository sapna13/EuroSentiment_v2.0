{"text":"Great balconies, poor service We have recently returned from the Barcelona Princess. Having read other reviews regarding problems at check in, it wasn't a total surprise that the hotel had no record of the reservation despite doing so through the hotel's own website.After finally getting checked in, we were shown up to the room, which was extremely hot. The air conditioning did not appear to work, so after a call to reception we were informed that the air conditioning system is switched off in the winter. This was despite an efficient system in the public areas of the hotel. This room had some very dubious marks on the wall and was not completely clean. As a result we requested a room change. Eventually the reception staff agreed to show us another room on the same floor which was clean. The second room had a good shower although like other reviewers found, it becomes tedious mopping up the floor everytime. The room had a good if somewhat small balcony overlooking the sea. The hotel pools were open however none were heated contrary to the hotel website. Transport links were good into the city centre with a tram and bus stop directly outside the hotel although it does take sometime to get into the tourist areas.The mini bar is free however, it is only stocked once a day with 1 beer, 2 small bottles of water and a soda!The breakfast was average so no complaints there however on checkout the hotel had charged for breakfast despite the website clearly stating this was included in the tariff. We even queried this with staff on check in. After contact from my credit card company this was refunded but yet another example of poor organisation. ","annotations":[]}
