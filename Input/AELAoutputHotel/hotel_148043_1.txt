{"text":"Beware great internet rates during busy weekends We stayed at El Convento in early November over Veteran's Day weekend after booking a queen room with limited view three months in advance. We got a great discount rate online for booking three months in advance and paid a 50% deposit at that time. Therefore we were dismayed to arrive in November and learn we had been moved to a room with double beds. The matter was not adequately handled by the manager on duty, but we moved the second night to the room type we had reserved and enjoyed the balance of our stay.After our return, I emailed a complaint to the manager and was impressed with the manner in which he handled the situation and the prompt response to my complaint. We would have been very satisfied if the same level of concern had been exhibited when we discovered the problem after check-in. The problem should have been acknowledged and handled at check-in rather than left for us to discover, complain about, and then not be resolved to our satisfaction.However, El Convento is a beautiful hotel. The restaurants on-site were some of the best meals we enjoyed in Old San Juan. Cana offers a great lunch value and it's lovely to enjoy tapas and wine on the balcony patio outside El Picoteo. Additionally, the wine and cheese reception is well done and we appreciated the complimentary coffee in the morning. We also enjoyed using the beach facilities at a sister hotel and appreciated the tip from the bellman regarding catching the city bus back to Old San Juan.The only other complaint I have is the quality of the mattresses. The mattresses in both rooms were beginning to sag in the middle and were not especially comfortable given the overall quality of the hotel.I would not dissuade people from staying at El Convento as it is beautiful. I would, however, doublecheck and confirm your room type before arrival, especially if you've gotten a really great rate and might get bumped in favor of those paying more.
