{"text":"Unique Luxury, Intimate feel for a High Rise Hotel I stayed in a corner room that had ceiling to floor windows on two walls and views of the famous lighted street in Ginza. It was spectacular at night. The rooms are contemporary and comfortable with electronic shades, lights and original artwork. There are great down comforters and superior linens on the beds. I loved the in room tea service with several authentic Japanese tea selections. Bathrobes provided were light and comfortable. The bathroom was modern and sleek with a great bathtub set between the tricked out toilet (with heated seat and other fun features) and the shower. The towel rack was heated! The room service was a tad slow but the stuffed french toast was so good that I still think about it. The in room internet service was annoying, as it was hard to maneuver the mouse and took a long time to load. The maid service was constant and one walked in on me while I was in a state of undress. The spa is just a couple of uninviting rooms with no amenities, although the massage was divine. The hotel is located on a couple of floors in a high rise building and does not have many rooms. Asking for directions and recommendations for dining was not easy. They kept sending us to restaurants designed for tourists. It is very expensive and very exclusive. It is unique considering that it is in a huge building yet retains a feeling of intimacy and beauty. The doorman always greeted me by name with a bow. They provide free pastries and coffee in the lobby in the early am (4-6) which is great if you are heading out to the fish market and need a wake up coffee. It is something to experience at least once in a lifetime. I was equally pleased with the Mandarin Oriental which was half the price and liked the rooms and spa better; although the personal service was not at the same level. You will feel like royalty while at the Four Seasons and may possibly become too accustomed to privilege for your own good. Enjoy!
