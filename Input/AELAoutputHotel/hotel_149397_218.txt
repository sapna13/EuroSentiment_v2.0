{"text":"Liked the Bavaro Princess (Montreal) We were at the Bavaro Princess week of August 5. The beach was wonderful. We always managed to find a hut. The people are friendly.And since the grounds are large, they have a tram that was quite frequent and we never had to wait long. You just have to get used to the smell of exhaust (gas).Our bungalow was midway between the beach and the main hall. It is a 7 minute walk to the beach. A little more to get the the main hall but you get to pass through the small bird sanctuary which is very nice.The food at the buffet is okay and the √ã√ë√∏ la carte restaurants are all very good. We went to Chopin (deluxe buffet), the Bella Pasta, El Gaucho and the Japanese. We also enjoyed the evening buffets, especially the Mi Tierra night buffet.At the buffet restaurants, service is always a challenge. But that is what we made it out to be, a challenge. And instead of being annoyed and irritated, we were determined to get our red wine... and we did.We did not like the fact that the water sports centre is operated by a third party (Scuba Caribe). There are few kayaks and saw one pedalo which nobody ever took out because of the waves. We went snorkling by booking directly at the watersports centre for a 1 1\/2 hour outing. They take you by motor boat to a reef (located in front of the Barcelo hotel). Unfortunately the guide was in a hurry and we snorkled for barely 40 minutes before returning. This was not worth our while at all. And all of the excursions we were interested in were very expensive.On the beach, many people get up early to reserve their hut and never end up showing up and we find this practice to be rude. We saw that the beach was cleaned daily and someone was always there to pick up garbage and glasses.When travelling outside the compound (to and from the airport) that there are lots of garbage everywhere.The room is quite nice, but is in need of some paint and thorough cleaning. Sheets were once dirty and face cloths are non existent. Air conditioning barely makes it but the outside temperature was so warm, you appreciate what you can get. We are relatively pleased with our trip. We did not get to snorkel to our satisfaction however. The vegetation in the DR is beautiful and green, especially compared to Cuba. The night that features the beach party is not to be missed.
