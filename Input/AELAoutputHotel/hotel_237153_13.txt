{"text":"Clean, well run Budget Hotel in Barcelona We stayed two nights in mid October 2007 after emailing the hotel a few weeks in advance of our arival. The reservation process went smoothly.1. LOCATION: The hotel is located on a side street, about 100 yards off the Ramblas, near the Opera Building. Rick Steve's review mentioned the street as a little bit Seedy at night. In my opinion it is fine. It's well lit, and yes, there are some oung kids walking up and down it that look a little tough, but they are harmless. There is alot of traffic and I wasn't worried. 2. ROOM. Our room was just great. Room 114 on the 1st floor, which is also the lobby floor with all the chairs and tables, which I didn't really see many people using. There were notes posted saying that the table area was not to be used after 9pm, to keep the talking noise down. Our room had a window that looked our onto this lobby area, with a solid shutter to close for privacy. We didn't want or need a window that looked out on to the street. We simply walked up some stairs from the main entance floor to our room. The lift is available, but slow and smallish. I think you would want a room on a lower floor. Thier were two town beds that my partner and I slid together, worked just fine. Air Conditioning worked when we got the remote form the front desk. Bathroom was clean and had soap available. Large Armoire, desk and night stand were just fine. I thought our room was a perfect size. InSuite bath.3. AMMENITIES: A very well run breakfast of 3 kinds of rolls, butter, jams, juices, and coffee is avalable 8-10am in a nice dining area, which is well attended. Front desk help was very courteous and helpful...I very was impressed. One internet terminal is available, but I didn't use.In my opinion, for 75 Euros this is a great deal in Barcelona. The place is a former nun's convent, so it just adds to the charm and mystique of the place. Very clean I would Highly Reccommend of for teh budget concious traveler. Email me any questions you may have. ~Bart ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1541,"mention":"butter","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Butter_chicken","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Butterscotch"],"startOffset":1535},{"endOffset":1567,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1561},{"endOffset":1596,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1592}]}
