{"text":"Go Across the Street to the David Jones Food Court... Just got back from staying at the Sheraton On the Park in Sydney (4 nites) and had a very wonderful stay. Yes, the views of Hyde Park were fabulous, wish I had looked out the window when they set off the fireworks the first night we arrived (it was Anzac Day, a Big Deal for the Aussies\/Kiwis) because it was probably spectacular, but was too tired. The bell staff was wonderful, we were part of a tour group (tons of luggage!) and they were very efficient, polite, and patient.The bed was great, my husband would have taken his pillows home with us if we had room in the luggage, but alas...and the brekkie was delish (fortunately it was included in our package, otherwise a bit spendy, as all the food seemed to be in Sydney). We got a hot tip from a tour guide who said that the best-kept secret in town was the food court in the lower level of the mall across the street (David Jones, off Castlereagh St.). It was Foodie Heaven! I was swept away to Culinary Paradise with all the offerings one can find down there. Good prices, too! You can pick and choose from all sorts of foods (a deli counter, a noodle bar, a Grill or two, gourmet cheeses, an olive bar, and a killer wines section...and did I forget to mention an absolutely amazing patisserie?) so instead of paying a lot of $$ on restaurant food, you can gather up quite a feast in the Food Court and bring it back to your room. Yum. I am jealous of the Sydney residents that can go there and shop for their own kitchens as they also had tons of gourmet food items and a butcher shop, beautiful fruits\/veggies, and all sorts of just gorgeous food. But get there early if you want to get the best selections on breads and other goodies. And they start shutting down after 4:30 or so, and close at 6 PM. Don't miss it!
