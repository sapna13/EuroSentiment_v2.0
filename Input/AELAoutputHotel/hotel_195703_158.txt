{"text":"Paolo was awesome!...Pierre was cool, too! Upon our arrival at Hotel Casci we were greeted by a very helpful and pleasant Pierre. Upon entering our room (Room #6), we were pleased to find a nice note and a bottle of champagne waiting for us as we were on our honeymoon. Pierre made a great recommendation for dinner at Za Za which is right around the corner in the market area. The next morning, we enjoyed a nice breakfast and were particularly impressed with the outstanding service provided by Paolo. Paolo was instrumental in securing two museum reservations for us; to Uffizi and Accademia. By asking for assistance, he saved us HOURS as we missed all of the long lines for entry and could really enjoy the history and art that we were in Florence to see. We stayed at Hotel Casci for two nights. On the morning of our departure, Paolo was again at our service. He called our next hotel in Amalfi to make sure that we had transportation from the train station to the hotel and also recommended a travel agent around the corner from Casci to help up book the remainder of our train tickets for our journey. Although the rooms are modest in size and decor, the friendliness of the staff more than compensates. Hotel Casci is an excellent value for the money - to have safe and clean accomodations in a location that is excellent for tourists to enjoy the cultural highlights of Florence. We would definitely recommend Hotel Casci -=- you will be treated as an old friend.
