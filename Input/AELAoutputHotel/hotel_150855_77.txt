{"text":"Had A Fabulous Time, Returning in August We have just returned from a one week vacation at the Riu Taino. We stayed from June 23-30. We had such a great time we are returning on August 25.We arrived late at night, after 10pm and were greeted with a welcome drink upon arrival in the Lobby. We got to the counter and they presented us with our room key, and a form to fill out. Rather than keep us, they advised we could fill it out and return it to them the next morning. That was great, as after a long day of travel we just wanted to get rid of our luggage and relax.FoodWe are picky eaters so I was a little worried but we were fine. There was always something on the buffet that we liked and we did not get sick. It does get repetetive after a few days, but we never did go hungry. We did not try any of the a la carte restaurants because we were busy with activities, but I heard from others that they weren't that great. The Rooms were bright and clean. Could use some updating and new pillows, but really how much time do you spend in your room. We left a $5.00 tip for the maid every day and always had some nice towel art to return to. The room was always thoroughly cleaned and there was never an issue with hot water.Our fridge was stocked every couple of days with water, beer and soft drinks. Animacion staff were excellent, especially Charley, Kathy, Choco Andy, David and Rafael. The show's were very entertaining and we had a lot of fun participating in the daily dance classes. There was always something to do if you wanted and they didn't push you if you said no. These guys work so hard to keep everyone happy and entertained. The street party on Thursdays nights is a blast.The beach I would have to say is the most beautiful I have ever seen. Clean clear water and soft white sand. Just gorgeous.I would recommend the Monster Truck tour. It is a great way to see the real Dominican Life. Make sure to bring gifts for the children as they are always waiting at every stop. I would recommend the tour guide Joselito, he was great.We also did a speed boat\/snorkelling tour through Bavaro Splash. It was a lot of fun getting to drive our own boat and the snorkelling spot was amazing, lots of fish. Make sure to bring an underwater camera.Great value for the money. You can also use the facilities at the Bambu and Naiboa, the casino at the Palace Macao and the Pacha disco (drinks are not included but the prices are not bad).As I said we had a wonderful stay, met some great people and are looking forward to our return on August 25.
