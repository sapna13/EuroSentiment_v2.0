{"text":"Excellent rooms, v. easy access of US 101 The Rennaisance was an excellent hotel for the price. The room (a twin double) was large, and easily accommodated four of us. The decor was fairly stylish and the windows were floor to ceiling and we were lucky enough to get a 17th floor room from which we could see the Hollywood sign, Capitol records tower and the L.A business district skyline. A selling point for us was the fact that as Brits we were driving on the wrong side of the road and didn't want to do too much driving in the hustle and bustle of L.A. This hotel was 1\/4 mile off US 101 (which were travelling on from the North) and was really easy to access. Valet parking was reasonable, worked out as √ä√£¬¢15 per night - but where else are you going to park?!Great shopping centre attached to the hotel, and the Manns Chinese Theatre and Kodak theatre make up part of the complex.The area itself isn't as glamorous as you'd imagine (considering it's where the Oscars are held) but it's just one of the places you must see if you're on a driving holiday of the Western USA. Be sure to check out the small eatery\/deli in the Highland shopping centre owned by Ken Davitian (Azamat Bagatov in Borat).We got a taxi from the Renaissance to Universal Studios - BE AWARE- the taxis (not affiliated with the hotel) that park up outside the lobby are expensive: were charged $30 (inc tip) to go the 3 or 4 miles to Universal. We got a far more honest taxi driver on the way back which was $16.
