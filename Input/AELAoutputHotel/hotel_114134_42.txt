{"text":"Great hotel We stayed at the Lenox July 6-13, 2008 for our first visit to Boston. The location is great. Our room was very clean and spacious, except the bathroom was a bit small. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Children receive a stuffed Lenox the Lion when they check in--a nice touch. One highlight was the peanut butter chocolate kiss cookies that appeared every night with turn down service! Boston has great restaurants. Knowing that we would be enjoying delicious lunches and dinners, we decided to go light at breakfast time. On the other side of Lord and Taylor, which is right next to the Lenox, there is a supermarket. We bought some breakfast items and kept them in our room (there is a large mini refrigerator in the room) and didn't have to shell out for expensive room service breakfasts--$6.00 for a bowl of Rice Krispies is a bit much. We didn't eat at the fine dining restaurant, Azure. We did eat at the Irish Pub connected to the hotel. It was very good and a nice place to watch the Sox win. The subway is very close by. Copley Square and Prudential Center are just down the street. Newbury Street is a block away. The hotel is at Exeter and Boylston. There are many shops and restaurants on Boylston, including a Starbucks for your morning coffee. Be sure to try Atlantic Fish Co. just down the street from the hotel (on Boylston). We ate there for lunch and I had an awesome lobster roll. We had a fantastic time in Boston and would stay at the Lenox again without hesitation!
