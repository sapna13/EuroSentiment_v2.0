{"text":"We had a great time! We stayed at the Ocean Blue from June 5-12. I, like most, was a little worried after reading some not so pleasant reviews.The transfer to the hotel took approximately 40 minutes. We stopped at one other hotel before arriving at Ocean Blue. The check in time for my in-laws was 10 minutes, however they told us to go to the other side of the lobby for check-in which was the elite club. Long story short we had not paid for elite club and we admitted to that (they had messed our reservation up), so it was straightened out but took about 30 minutes. We stayed in villa 10 which was the closest to the beach and pool. Our room was nice, clean. The housekeeper sometimes did not make it to our room until 3 or 4 and that was family nap time so we skipped out on cleaning a couple of days! When she did make it, she kept the fridge stocked. We had a hard time getting and keeping washclothes for some reason. We got the same service if we left a couple of dollars or not! We had a lizard in our room almost everyday but that was entertainment for my husband and son to catch and release. Bugs... we never seen any in our room, of course they were outside. It is the caribbean!The food was good, no one went hungry and I consider myself and my son incredibly picky eaters! We ate the indoor buffett everyday for breakfast and about half the time for lunch. We never ate at the buffet for dinner.The kids enjoyed the bowling alley although they played only two games they loved the ping pong and pool tables. They stayed out later than my husband and I most of the time. It was sometimes difficult to communicate with the employees especially the housekeepers, but you muddle through it.We went on the outback safari which was a fun trip. Drink lots of rum and diet coke. Our guide and driver were great! Our children swam with the dolphins, it was a 30 minute bus ride and a 5 minute boat ride. I had previously swam with the dolphins in Jamaica and they definetely had a better experience. They played basketball and volleyball with the locals while waiting for our bus to take us back to the hotel.The pool water was clear although it looked like it could use a good scrubbing, but if it was closed for cleaning one would be pist off and if it is dirty you were still pist off. The smaller pool was closed for a day for cleaning.There was a trolley, but we NEVER used it. My in-laws did. It was essentially no more than a 10 minute walk to go anywhere, so why not just walk! We did see it often however.The bartenders would give cuervo in your margaritas upon request or any other american liquor. Our 13 year old daughter did get served (by accident) one time. She did have a kiddie bracelet on and I pointed that out to the bartender. He apologized. To his defense she does not look 13.There are wild dogs but we walked along the beach where they were and they never came near us. They were never near the resort beach chairs. They hang out there because tourists were always feeding them. Duh!
