{"text":"Good Food, Great Staff, rather noisy though. First time in a Riu hotel but 3rd time to the Dominican, stayed in the North and also at the Gran Bahia Principe which is next door to the Palace. The Riu Bambu is a well run and family orientated hotel. Rooms and grounds very clean. Staff, maids, gardeners everyone who worked there were first class, no waiting, always willing to help, no pressure to tip which we have found at other complexes all over the carribean. You wanted to tip the staff here because they were so enthusiastic and helpful and it was so nice to recieve such excellent service wether you tipped or not.Food was absolutely fantastic, we couldn't fault any of the meals we had and you can use the al a carte restaurants as often as you like, we went to each of the three other restaurants, international, italian and grill twice. The buffet was always hot and the salad always fresh, no complaints, no funny tummys and we were overall extremely happy. Didn't think we would use the mini bar and optics in the room, but they were used every night, sitting on patio having a couple of drinks. Our patio did became our evening out on quite a few nights. The only couple of faults we found at the Hotel were the lack of a quiet bar for those not looking for the noise of the evening programme. Both bars are by the entertainment stage. Don't go to the Riu if you are looking for peace and relaxation the entertainment staff have bounds of energy and are on the go all over the hotel and beach for at least 12 hours a day. Perfect if that is what you like but it's not for everyone. (please don't think we are boring, it's just that hotel entertainment isn't always to your taste, especially when you have already watched the shows in the first week and they are repeated in the second, some evenings it would have been nice to just have a few drinks in a quieter atmosphere). Also the pool area is very small and extremely shaded. You were so tightly packed in with your sunbed and couldn't move it anywhere. We therefore never used it but the beach is lovely, the pool is also extremely noisy as it is such a small area.The hotel is predominantly european however English speaking is not the main, the hotel was probably less than 10% english speaking guests. Not really a problem but worth mentioning. We went to this hotel on a cheap late deal and were very happy with what we paid for. The Riu Bambu is probably best for families with young children, plenty to keep them occupied.Peace,quiet and relaxation is not whats on offer at the Bambu however, it was still a great place to Holiday and Fantastic value for money.The Riu Bambu is a four star hotel and if you are looking for something more upmarket and classy then pay more and go to one of the Palaces next door, If we do return then l think we would definitely choose the quieter palaces.
