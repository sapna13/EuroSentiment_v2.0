{"text":"Great location and friendy helpful staff ! For my 4th visit to Hawaii I stayed for 2 weeks Aug. 7-21 as a solo traveller and paid $85 a night through www.vrbo.com. so it was booked as a private room as some are owned like condos. Had a view to ocean and then to Diamond Head.Lobby is clean welcoming with free daily newspaper and at one stage I saw a basket of apples as well as free tea and coffee ! On the desk ,I believe Mark is his name, was great as they don't have to assist people in private rooms like I had but he did as 1. my luggage didn't arrive 2. my check in was a bit wierd and then on the last day the shuttle didn't arrive so he called them and then a cab. Every other day always smiling and a hello ! Roberto, the Expedia agent is the BEST and he loves choc chip cookies from the Doubletree up the road and he got me a great deal so he got the warm choc chip cookie as a thank you !Didn't use pool, carpark, ice machine, spa facilities, free breakfast or laundry sorry can't comment.Road construction not their fault either is HHV construction across the road but on the 10th floor you still hear it but hey you get used to it esp if you are a city dweller ! Ala Moana Blvd is a very busy road ! I saw 40inch LG screens beng unloaded, location is 10-15mins walk t Ala Moana and 20 to center of Waikiki (best along beach cutting through HHV). Sit in the cafes at HHV if you want resort feel w\/out price.Great 24 hour Wailana diner next door. Lifts ok and longest wait was 5 mins at 11.30am there are 3 of them. Corridors are stuffy but again don't sweat the small stuff esp at the great price ! Internet in lobby is 25c a minute with $5 minimum so if you don't take laptop to make use of free internet access in your room this is your option.See trip report in the forum !If the hotel has Airline crew staying there is has to be good ! I enjoyed it and 2 weeks is a long time in Paradise!
