{"text":"Amazing - Love this hotel! I recently stayed here again for a few days leading up to the Christmas holidays. I love this hotel and will keep coming back. It's hip, modern, fashionable and VERY well located - cant have a better location in Florence than perched right above the Ponte Vecchio over the Arno river! The rooms are white and soft... very clean modern furnishings, baths\/showers and beds. Hotel staff at the front desk is VERY helpful and willing to find solutions to your needs. They even do small favors such as have a pair of pants hemmed for me at the last minute by the hotel staff. They made excellent recommendations for non-touristy restaurants nearby as well, and they arranged for a private car and driver to take us to the nearby outlets. Thsi hotel has a warm, friendly and inviting atmosphere. The staff is very welcoming and you feel like a gest in someon's home in many ways. It was not terribly crowded during the Christmas holiday week so it was a nice break from the crowds seen there in the summer. One thing to note - they close their incredible rooftop terrace during the cold months which is a shame - nothing a few outdoor heaters couldnt solve so you can appreciate the incredible view! The wi-fi internet connection was also included in the room. We did not have breakfast in our rate and did not eat in the restaurant on this recent trip, but they do have a nice place to eat inside the hotel. They also have a small gym with modern equipment right on property and a sauna for hotel guests. Overall, a GREAT experience. Will be back for sure!
