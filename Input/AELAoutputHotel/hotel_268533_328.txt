{"text":"A great choice! Stayed at the Argonaut from the 7th - 10th Sepember '07 on the second leg of our honeymoon in the states. We loved it. I booked through Expedia and got a pretty good rate, however I realised after making the booking that I could have got it slightly cheaper booking direct with Kimpton Hotels (the parent co). So shop around for the best rate.On arrival, the doormen and check-in staff were very friendly and efficient. We found a bottle of champagne in an ice-bucket waiting for us in our room, as it was our honeymoon, which was a very nice touch. The room was pretty large and beautifully decorated in a nautical theme.It was an inward facing room (i.e. no bay view) but it was bright and anyway, who looks out the window all holiday. It was well furnished with k\/s bed, fridge and minibar, tv and dvd, safe, and leopard print bath-robes! The bathroom was large, modern and spotless. All hotel decor and furnishings seemed clean and new. Wine tasting hour 5pm to 6pm was great. Complimentary Californian wine - delicous, gets your evening off to a flying start and it's a really nice way to meet other guests. Anything we wanted to know about the area, restaurants etc, we just asked the doormen. They're very knowledgeable and helpful. They even stopped the traffic for us to cross the road!Dining out : Great seafood restaurant opposite the hotel and we can recommend Bodins a couple of hundred yards down the waterfront for clam chowder in a sourdough breadbowl. Something of a speciality- you get to eat the dishes! Take a cable-car outside the hotel to Chinatown. Lots of restaurants with cheap deals.Sightseeing: Take a bus to the Golden Gate Bridge. Walk across to the other side, follow the turn off to the right to Sausolito (about 25 min. walk). It's a lovely little town and you can get a ferry straight across the bay (great views of Alcatraz, Golden Gate and SF) back to Fisherman's Wharf.Alcatraz trip excellent value at $16. I suggest booking in advance yourself. We booked with the hotel concierge and were charged an extra $10 for the privillage!Airport transfers. We used 'Lorry's' airport shuttle, excellent value at $25 each return, door to door service. Get a price list at the airport information desk.Finally take warm clothes. San Francisco is chilly!Rod the dog.
