{"text":"Football match was main attraction This was my first time going to Barcelona, and the main attraction was to watch the football match, so the hunt for a hotel began.Reading through alot of reviews on hotels, I luckily came across Gravina and took the chance. My personal opinions of Gravina are positive; the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the food tasted great and modestly priced, the beer on draft was a constant regular for me (yea, I'm Irish). There is free internet access if you needed it, and a laundry service which obviously comes with a cost. You have the option of charging to the room or cash.You are greeted on entry to the reception through sliding automatic doors which they are multi-lingual, a security guard is patroling entrance during the evening\/night time. Also there is no carrying luggage up flights of stairs (woohoo)... two lifts are in operation.I got a single room each, for myself and a friend, on my initial impression it was pretty small, but later thought I wouldn't have needed anything bigger. It was catered with a wardrobe with hangers inside, really good air conditioning, a room safe (which you need to buy a key for), a television, room bar, wooden flooring, desk and chair, marble bathroom with a shower and flowing hot water ready for use. If you need an iron, you can simply as reception.The location is very quiet, and is just a 4minute walk away from the Las Ramblas. Unfortunately I didn't use the Metro much, only on my way back from the match at the Nou Camp, but a taxi up there costs about 10 euro, it's about 7 euro to the beach using taxi (but I walked it in 25minutes when I knew where exactly it was). The metros and a train station is just outside the hotel and is easily spotted.I enjoyed my first experience of Barcelona and the stay in Gravina enhanced that. Would most likely welcome myself back again if I make a return to Barcelona. ","annotations":[]}
