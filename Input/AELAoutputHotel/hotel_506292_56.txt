{"text":"A breed apart Stayed in a Garden Room at the Uma Ubud for a 3-night stay earlier this month as part of their 'Festive Package'. Upon arrival, I was impressed by the landscaping and the serenity of the place. True, this is far from being uncommon in Bali, but I found the place to be even more relaxed and welcoming than usual. The hostess who was waiting for us upon arrival made us feel very comfortable and took the time to show us our room and to explain everything to us - a nice touch!The room had a nice private courtyard and although it was very tastefully done, there was no place to sit in the room except for the one desk chair (and the bed, of course!). I particularly liked the design of the garden shower: it was 'semi-outdoor', very difficult to explain the concept but when taking a shower, you had the best of both worlds! Of all the outdoor showers I've tried in Bali, this is the most brilliantly done, in my opinion.I could go on about this place, telling you how peaceful it was, how great the food was (if you like to eat spicy, don't be shy and try out their more exotic offerings, you won't regret it!) and how lovely and quiet the pool is during the day... But what sets this place apart is the graciousness of the staff, their big smiles and their eagerness to please. They bent over backwards for us, they accommodated our demands in every little way that they could, and even though our room was half of the price of our suite at the Four Seasons Sayan (where we stayed right after leaving Uma Ubud), we found the place absolutely top-notch!Now what I'd like to know is this: all are other properties owned by the Como Shambala group as wonderful as Uma Ubud? I'll make sure to try one and let you know next time around.
