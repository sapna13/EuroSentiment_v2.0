{"text":"Paradise!!!! We LOVED the Elgance.We also went with an open mind, kind of expecting the worst after all the reviews, and were very pleasantly surprised.We booked a Jr. Colonial Suite and ended up being bumped to the Elegance Club Oceanview room. It was gorgeous. Top grade materials, and a beautiful Jacuzzi. Twice we came back to the room and the maids had drawn a Jacuzzi bath for us with flowers and bubbles floating. We also had a beautiful fruit tray in our room, a bottle of champagne, a bottle of Bailey's, Run and Rye allw aiting for us. It was beautiful.The only problem we had with our room was the shower leaking out from under the door.....We stuck a towel down on the inside and it was fine.The food was great! We loved the Steakhouse - Chateaubriand is sooo tender and ceasar salad is great too. The beakfast and lunch buffets have a ton of variety.The beach is beautiful and the pools are crystal clean.The staff is UNBELIEVABLE!!!! We were so sad to leave them. We are not social people and were just looking for a nice quiet vacation away from our 1.5 year old son - well there were a few nights that we shut down the lobby bar because everyone is so nice, accomodating and friendly!!!! They wouldn't allow my wine glass to get below half...Franklin anf Daniel in the japanese are great, Francis at the Lobby Bar and Rose by the pool. Brenda is the greet at the Sea and Sea buffet at Lunch. Miss them all tons!!!!We made great friends and can't wait to go back to the Elegance next year!!!!
