{"text":"Probably the best hotel we ever stayed. I have booked this hotel for my husband's special birthday treat, so my expectations were very high, I wanted everything to be perfect. And to be frank, it probably was. Although quite pricey, the location is fantastic, the hotel is very modern and furbished in elegant, understated style. We stayed in the standard room, which was not large, but still a decent size and airy, certainly not pokey or dinky. I was worried about the noise from La Rambla, so asked for quiet room at the back when booking and our room (No 404) fitted the bill perfectly. In fact, we got really good night's sleep (the bed was large and very comfortable) and did not wake up before 9 am. We skipped the breakfast, at 20 euros, it's expensive and you can eat like a king at plenty of cafes in the neighbourhood or at the Bouqeria market. The rooftop pool and terrace are just fantastic, great to unwind in late afternoon to catch the last of sunshine before going out in the evening. The same goes for the grotto pool, sauna and the gym in the cellar. The reception staff was very helpful, they secured us a last minute reservation at Hisop on Saturday night. I cannot fault the cleaning or other services either. The toiletries in the bahroom also contained complimentary toothpaste and shaving kit, which was a nice touch, now when you have all these flight hand luggage restrictions on liquids and sharp objects. If you can afford it, this is the ultimate choice.
