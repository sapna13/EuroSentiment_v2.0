{"text":"Dreams Punta cana We visited this resort last year when it was Sunscape the beach we loved it then and we were looking forward to seeing the changes as it was upgraded.Firstly we flew First choice which was great, on arrival at the resort we never recevied any cold towels like last year although I did see them giving them out for coach loads later on, but it would have been nice.I had requested certain rooms, we were given a room in block 2 middle floor, the first room had a connecting door which was a nightmare as you could hear every word the people next door were saying, even if they coughed!! So I went to reception after 3 days and requested a move, we moved two doors down and that was much better, we still had a pool view.The food in my opinion was not as hot as it used to be, I felt the food cold at times and as in a previous reviews alot of the restraunts were not opened on certain nights especially the adults only. I must admit last year the oceana etc was buffet style through the day but it has been done up and now you are served. The world cafe suited us with 5 children!!!, it was fine they all work so hard and the lady(can't remeber her name) she greeted us every day last year and was pleased to see us, she was lovely, she worked in the world cafe for breakfast and the oceana for lunch, she made my holiday!!!!The weather was horrid for around 6 days and that was not nice, it poured and poured!!!!!The entertainment team were fab and worked so hard, I remembered alot of the shows from last year.Mickey mouse was our idol and if all the kids had their way he would be home with us!!!! My daughter has not stopped talking about him!!! Glenda  Carrie were so good with the girls and would dance with them and always chat away.Chocolate, well my husband and his friend thought he was great, the only night my friend and I went to the top bar I felt he was very rude to us, he totally ignored us and we waited ages, he even served somone infront of us.We never got to do any excursions due to the weather, I was so excited about returning and I guess I was disappointed maybe because this was our second time there, or the weather, not sure?The gym was great and the guy who works there was very very helpful and chatted away!!!!Well worth a visit!!!!!!!!!!! A few days before we left boys were jumping on the ice berg, pushing the wee ones off it and using foul language, i think that also put a damper on things nothing worse than having to move just beacuse people can't control their children, or are too busy at the bar!!!I may sound negative but our friends who came with us so loved it (there first time).I spoke to other people who stated they did not get the wow factor, they had visited other hotels in the area which they felt were much better?
