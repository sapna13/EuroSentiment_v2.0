{"text":"Great Find! Loved this hotel! Don't Pass this One Up! Hotel Benivieni in Florence went above and beyond my expectations!The LOCATION was ideal! It is literally right around the corner from DUOMO, which is where you absolutely want to be. I booked this hotel because I took my parents to Florence and my father has bad feet, so I needed to have a great location, very close to all attractions. Well, you couldn't get any better than Hotel Benivieni! It's RIGHT NEXT TO, easy walking distance, to all the attractions, yet on a quiet, cobblestone sidestreet. There are great restaurants next door and down the street. There's also a great convenience store down the block with a great selection of Italian cookies and reasonably priced iced teas and sodas for you to bring to your room after a day of sight-seeing, which was nice. However, there are no refrigerators in the room, so don't stock up.We were welcomed as family there at reception- very great, warm service at this hotel. It was also VERY CLEAN and tastefully decorated with Old World charm. You can tell that this hotel was recently renovated. The bathrooms were spotless as well. The breakfast was nice - similar to a Continental breakfast (cereal, rolls, pastries, yogurts, mini-sandwiches, coffee, tea), but no bacon\/scrambled eggs\/sausage or American-type breakfast. However, this was fine with me personally, It hit the spot and the quiet, cozy dining room was a perfect way to start the day.What stands out with Hotel Benivieni was that its GREAT LOCATION, WARM HOSPITALITY, and CLEAN, COMFORTABLE ROOMS. Really, what more can you ask for?Advice: If you could get tickets online for Uffizzi Gallery before the trip it would save you hours in line!Any other questions, my email is jerseybrit06@yahoo.co.ukARRIVEDERCI!
