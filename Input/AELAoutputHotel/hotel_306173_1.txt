{"text":"Bad start but finished well My wife and I stayed at the Fullerton for two nights as a stopover on a trip back from Rome.We stayed at the Fullerton last year with our two young children on a stopover on a trip back from the Maldives. The service was superb on all fronts and as a result we elected to stay again.We arrived early in the morning after an overnight flight. This was naturally before check in so we were quite relaxed and understanding that our room might not be ready. Mind you on the last visit we arrived similarly early and they happily put us in a temporary room.At the check in desk, it seemed that the lady handling our check in had a room ready and was going to put us in it and when she sought to, clear it or whatever they do, with her supervisor. Unfortunately the lady on the desk saw it as an √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬∂psell√à√\u2020\u2022?opportunity and highlighted that our room was unavailable, but a higher quality room was if we would like to book it. The extra cost was to be around S$500 compared to the room we had booked that was S$400 per night. For a few hours this didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ seem all that worthwhile and we declined. Sensing something a little odd with how this unfolded, I asked if the hotel was 100% full and I was told yes.My wife and I then went and rested on the couches in the lobby. Very comfy they were and in 5-10 minutes my wife was out like a light. A further 10-15 minutes later, I guess this was noticed and a room was made available straight away.So with a little delay we were in a room and after a short nap we headed out.On return we were in our room, it was on the 7th floor with a balcony and view over the Boat Quay. The fit out of the rooms is superb and styling is very nice. Seems to me the styling of the rooms is a little more in keeping with the colonial\/heritage nature of the hotel as compared to the lobby, which seems a bit out of kilter with the colonial\/heritage nature of the hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?a bit more modern when a heritage\/colonial approach would have suited more.The view from the room and the balcony was also good. Breakfast was included in our rate and was very good as well.We used the pool and gym, both excellent, and the pool with a great view of the Boat Quay.We think the heritage nature of the building coupled with the location (particularly if in town for business which we were not) is what sets the hotel apart from many others. It also seemed to be pretty good value.A really good hotel, just the one annoyance at check in.Would we return. Yes. Might stay somewhere else for a change, but not because the hotel was a problem.
