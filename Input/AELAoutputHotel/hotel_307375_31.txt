{"text":"Excellent Choice! My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights on our most recent trip to Tokyo. I am so glad we did! The hotel was attached to the TCAT (Tokyo City Air Terminal) which has direct limousine bus service from Narita airport (50 minutes). We upgraded to the Executive Floor which gave us a nice room on the 18th floor with sweeping views of the city skyline. The Executive Floor option, which was a few dollars more than a standard room, gave us access to the Executive Lounge on the 16th floor. They have a full-time concierge there who was very helpful and very friendly. We had access to a full American-style breakfast in the morning on the 20th floor (complimetary) which included a stunning view and cooked-to-order eggs and good coffee! In the evening, they had small appetizers and a nice selection of cocktails and wines available for you. The room was small, but the ammenities were nice, including an in-room personal computer with free internet access (wireless was available if you opt to use your own laptop -free too!). The service and staff was excellent. Always a smile and a bow. As a gay couple, I never once felt uncomfortable and the Japanese went out of their way to make certain we were comfortable as well. The hotel is on the Hanzomon line with easy connections to all the other lines and with the subway in the basement of the hotel, travel was very easy. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great hotel in a great location! Would definitely stay again.
