{"text":"Loved the place A friend, my partner and I were in Amsterdam for five nights. We booked both a single and a double-bedded room. My bias is to stay in small properties (less than 30 rooms) and Chic and Basic was more than a pleasant surprise. This is my third trip to Amsterdam and I have stayed in the Grand Tulip (200+) and in a canal house on previous trips. One of the gems of the hotel is its staff - more about that later. With the exception of housekeeping, everyone was fluent in English - my native language and some were fluent in spanish - the native language of my partner and my friend. Housekeeping had a perfectly good understanding of english - significantly better than my non-existent dutch!First the location. CB is conveniently positioned facing the second canal - Herengracht - within a short walk to Cental Station and the major tram\/bus routes in the city. The character of the neighborhood in which CB is located is very quiet residential yet within two blocks are an excellent restaurant (just across the pedestrian bridge on Broeweurgraht (sp)) and a neighborhood coffee shop. Two more blocks and there is a secondary shopping area with an abundance of restaurants\/retail locations (but not the cookie cutter stores seen in most major cities that cater primarily to tourists). And the location of the hotel is within a ten to twenty minute walk to any of the active night life, restuarants, museums and typical shopping fare.As indicated in other posts, the rooms are smallish. If you plan on staying in your room most of your stay in Amsterdam, then this is not the property for you. Neither of the two rooms we booked had an area separate from the bed for writing or reading - less of a problem when traveling alone but problematic if traveling with another person and on different sleep schedules. The ability to read in bed is futher limited by an absence of reading lights - the room is either fully lit or dark with no in between possibilities. A common area is available for guests to take advantage of flat writing spaces as well as providing complimentary wifi if you have your own computer. Adjacent to the common area is a computer with high-speed and complimentary internet connectivity. The rooms and bathrooms were spotlessly clean - kudos to the housekeeping team. And each of our rooms had excellent hot water heat, plenty of water pressure and large windows that opened easily. The windows included both sheer curtains for filtered light and a curtain to darken the room considerably when sleeping during the occassional afternoon nap. The only weathered look in the hotel was the carpet leading to the rooms. It appears the carpet has remnants of last winter's snow and boot traffic. The carpet appears to be in good shape but not as clean as it could be and certainly not as spotless as are the rooms. And while speaking of stairs - they are typically Amsterdam - a cross between stairs and a vertical ladder. The self-serve breakfast offers an ample selection of fresh fruits, cheese, juices, hard boiled eggs, cold cuts, etc. The bread an role variety was exceptional and an apple tart can only be described as european - excellent flavor, texture and not ruined with sugary sweetness.But for the three of us, the most important element of our stay was the staff in the hotel. They were extraordinarily helpful and friendly - it was as if we were staying with friends and not interacting with the typical stadoffish clerks in larger hotels. Indeed, one evening we were invited to go local with a member of the staff. We in turn have invited their staff to visit with us whenever they come to Costa Rica.If going to Amsterdam again, this would be my first choice.
