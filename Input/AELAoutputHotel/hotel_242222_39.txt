{"text":"not good I want to start off my criticism by telling you that I am not a hard person to please, and that I am generally very tolerant of bad service. Esj towers is on a very beautiful beach. The rooms here at the towers all have very nice views. The building looks absolutely beautiful from a distance. It takes a good picture is what I am trying to say. And that is about all the nice things that I can say. I am not usually dissatisfied with a hotel or condo, but this place had so many bad things about it that I had to review. DO NOT BOOK HERE!!!! YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. I have stayed in hotels in Jamaica, St. Martin, Aruba, and finally here. I paid by far the most money to stay here, and was the least satisfied.This place is mainly a time share rental. This place is a horribly run down. It is all old people here. I felt like I was staying in a nursing home. No activities (accept bingo). Here is what I saw that was so bad. The restaurant (Happy Apple) has horrible food. Soggy hash browns, tasteless eggs, I could go on for a while. The happy apple has a leak in the roof, and their solution is a bucket. The ceiling panels are falling apart\/discolored. Nothing was good about this restaurant. The service at the front desk has an attitude that they just don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ care. Check in took 2 hours. Maid service did not come every day. 2 out of the 6 elevators did not work. If you are a guest you have to park your car in a dungeon. THERE IS NO BEACH ACCESS FROM LOBBY. YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PARKING GARAGE (DUNGEON). Every room has their ac unit on the back porch, and they are loud and windy. (My towel blew off the balcony). The shower only had cold water in my friend√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ room. Everything smells. This place is in terrible need of a makeover. There are many other things but I am just tired of writing. DON√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©? BOOK HERE.
