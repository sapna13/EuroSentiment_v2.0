{"text":"not great My family and I stayed here from December 31-January 7. We wanted a beach holiday, and fortunately the beaches were beautiful and it was sunny and hot every day. This resort was a disappointment though. I'm sure it was nice when it was newer, but it is in need of a spruce-up. This is a 3 star at best. Although the people were really sweet, the service was not good. We had to phone for toilet paper and towels! The food was err...acceptable at meal time (not great, but none of us got sick), and the snacks were bad. Note to families with teenagers!We took our two kids ages 16  19. New Years Eve was a blast, they met a lot of kids, but there really wasn't much for them to do at night. They were in bed early. Unusual. Note to parents again, poor security at night.The first two rooms that they gave us were not ocean-view as requested. We were assigned ground floor rooms facing grass. After several trips to the front desk and a cash bribe to the manager, we were given primo rooms facing the ocean and pool in building G. I know it's wrong to have to do that, but we love to sit out at night and enjoy a nice view. There were still problems with the rooms, but we chose our battles. It wasn't worth begging for extra pillows, AC repairs, bulb replacements, hand soap etc. Bottom line...the DR is beautiful. Go there, but first check out trip advisor reviews and choose a 5 star resort in the top 5. We have friends that have stayed at Iberostar, and Club Med and they absolutely loved it. I'm sorry to be negative, but we didn't like this resort. I should have done my homework. You can do much better.
