{"text":"Avoid this place if you are American, 5 stars my ***! I went to this hotel for three nights for a friend's wedding and was rather disappointed. The beach was beautiful and the pools were rather nice, everything else..... not so nice. Check-in: JACKHAMMERS!!!!!!!!!!!! It was insane, I mean like a war zone and it went on all day and for hours on end. It's probably done by now (Pray it is if you made the mistake of coming here soon) but how could you put people through that, this is supposed to be a vacation. You have to come to the lobby for most of your meals, and being hungover and hearing deafening jackhammers (i am not exaggerating, our group just started laughing at how insanely loud it the noise was.) Facilities: Lack of AC in lobby or most hang out areas really was unpleasant in that heat, especially at night when you want to relax and have some drinks. The resort is also way too big, hard to keep a big group together, and who wants to have to ride a tram from one end of the resort to the other. They also have way too many bracelet types and it is extremely confusing. I had a Golden Club bracelet which got me 15 minutes internet access in some random Hut (not kidding) and 24 hour room service (which was so gross, ugh, feeling sick thinking about the food)Staff: This place does not really cater to English speaking people. I understand when visiting a country to speak their language as much as possible but people in key positions such as receptions should speak English fluently. I found the staff to be downright rude and nasty at some points. Other times they were very friendly, a mixed bag I guess.Rooms: Awful beds, like a rock. I know multiple people who had sore backs. AC-does not work very well, took my room almost two days to get somewhat cool. You have to leave a card in a slot when you walk-in (Hint any card will work) to keep the power on and they also make you pay to use the safe in your room which is just silly. Beach\/Pools: Really beautiful. Nice water, couple of bars easily accessible, plenty of shade. We were there in June and finding a chair or spot in the shade was fairly easy. Only complaint is the activities people who blast what they are doing on giant loudspeakers so the whole beach can hear them and takes away from relaxing. Didn't really hang out in the pool too much but had swim-up bars and was really nice.Wedding: I felt awful for my friend who had his wedding here. There were so many screw-ups by the staff that were inexcusable, and they didn't seem to care at all about screwing up. I could go into more details, but in general I would strongly recommend that you do not have a wedding here.Food: Disgusting, inedible,....... I could go on and on.....Lunch food makes you long for cafeteria quality food. I really do not know how anyone could like the food here. No one on our trip liked the food. When we left and found a Wendy's at the airport, we were all so excited (I normally hate fast food, but Wendy's kicked [----] compared to the 5 star Bahia Principe).Warning: My friend had his camera stolen from his checked bag, somewhere btw checking in at the United States and when he checked into his room, so keep anything valuable on you.
