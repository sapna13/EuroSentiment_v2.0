{"text":"Great location, the room's a bit cramped though. Overall, I give the hotel a B- I was actually a bit apprehensive, with the not so rosy reviews posted by some of the travellers who stayed at Hotel 81 Bencoolen. But surprisingly, my parents and I had a pretty okay time at the hotel. Of course, we knew that we were not getting first class service, unlike those who previously stayed there. Anyway, we were actually impressed with the location of the hotel since it is right in the middle of the city. Most of the fancy museums, schools and decent eateries cafes are within easy reach. Orchard Road is practically 10 to 15 minutes away by foot. Regarding the room were we slept (we stayed on the 9th floor), it was VERY basic and quite cramped, considering that we chose the Triple, which was good for three adults. However, it was still okay since the amenities were complete and thank god, in okay condition. The bathroom was alright, bigger than what we've expected. Needs a little maneuvering though if you want to take a bath since the shower is handheld.Overall, we had a decent stay, but housekeeping, UNFORTUNATELY, was a big letdown. I'm not really sure if they know how to clean as the beddings were ALWAYS haphazardly arranged, and the floors, not properly swept. Another thing, the walls are kinnda thin, so we sort of heard the footsteps and converstaions of those staying next door. But the noise did not bother us that much as we only went back late at night at we're just too tired and sleepy to complain. ","annotations":[]}
