{"text":"Pleasant and Clean Hotel I have to agree with all the other reviews about the location of this hotel. Less than 5 minutes walk from both the railway and bus stations and waterbuses just across the bridge.I spent the weekend there with my 13 year old son and we had a first floor room overlooking the canal. The views were terrific and being just above street level gave us a great feel of being in the thick of it. However the Water buses run through the night so if you need complete silence to sleep perhaps a room higher up or not over looking the canal would be better. But you can't have your cake and eat it and for our part the hustle and bustle was part of the overall great experience.The room was clean tidy and well equipped for a 3* Hotel - my son thought the chocolate each night on the pillow was really cool. As has been said many times the staff were friendly and helpful, even to the extent of phoning the transport department to find out what the orange travel card could be used for.We both thought the breakfast was just right, typical continental and plenty of it. The waitress was diligent in making sure everything was topped up and I thought the orange juice was fine (so full marks to the hotel for taking note of previous reviews).I would wholeheartedly recommend the hotel and should I be lucky enough to visit Venice again I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.Stuart (UK) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":602,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":598},{"endOffset":602,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":598}]}
