{"text":"Absolutely the best choice for Hotels in San Juan! If you are searching for a place to stay in San Juan, you can stop your searching now and book at this magnificent hotel! After reading all of the reviews, we decided to trust tripadvisor and book this hotel and we could not be happier about our choice. I could not possibly describe what a wonderful place this is with words, but I will try. From the moment you walk in the front doors of the hotel, you feel at home. The doorman greets you and sends you on to the concierge. While checking in, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They gave us suggestions of what to do around the area, where to eat, what beach to visit, and a map of the area. El Convento is not on the beach, but it has a sister hotel, La Concha that is. Just take a cab over to the sister hotel and you can use their beach chairs, towels, and pool for free!The room was large and the bathroom looked clean and updated. The room had a flat screen TV, hair dryer, radio, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and mouthwash. On the 3rd floor of the hotel, they offered free bottled water anytime you wanted it. This is great to have when walking around downtown or going over to the beach for the day. The wine and cheese hour was amazing! For one hour, you get to mingle with fellow guests and enjoy red wine, white wine, and a variety of delicious cheeses and grapes. The location of the hotel cannot be beat. It is in Old San Juan within walking distance to El Morro (the fort) and a lot of shopping, restaurants, and bars. We found all of the people in San Juan to be very friendly and welcoming also. We were very impressed with how fluently everyone we encountered spoke both Spanish and English. We felt very safe walking around during the day as well as at night. I have stayed at another hotel in San Juan and did not enjoy my stay nearly as much as I did this time. The atmosphere, amazing attentive helpful friendly staff members, and location of this hotel make this hotel number 1 for a reason. I can't wait to go back for a much longer stay in the future.
