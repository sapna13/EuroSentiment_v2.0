{"text":"Amazing Hotel, In a Fantastic Location Hello All,Before i booked this hotel, I noticed there were a few bad reviews on trip advisor. but i just thought id write a small review, to say that this is a fantastic hotel. Not sure why there are any bad reviews. The hotel is located approximately 15 mins drive from the airport (no you cant hear any jets overhead). in south Kuta, and is situated approx 20 metres away from the beach. The beach directly outside the hotel isnt very good, but if you walk 50 metres either way, then it is much better. If you head out right along the beach, then you come to Legian or seminyak beach which are amazing at night. You can watch the surfers whilst the sunsets are truely breathtaking. Because you are in south Kuta, you are only 5 minutes walk from the truely hectic nightlife of Kuta. The good thing is, you cant hear a thing when you are in or around the hotel. It is really well protected, with great security. Our vehicles were searched before entering the compound, which was good to see. We booked a deluxe room, but to our surprise, when we arrived and checked into the hotel room, we had sea views. Truely awesome. The perfect picture postcard. Palm trees, Ocen views, amazing. The hotel was extremely clean, as is the rooms. Everytime we went for breakfast, by the time we got back our room had been cleaned and sheets and towels changed. So efficient. Speaking of breakfasts, well, they catered for every tastes. They had western food, chinese foods, fruit, selection of meats, fish, eggs, breads, fantastic. We never left hungry. They had a different type of evening meal on every night, like bbq's, pasta, Seafood and Roast Nights. Although we did find these to be quite expensive. It was much cheaper to head into Kuta to visit one of hundreds of local and international bars or restaurants. To get around Bali, i recommend using one of the many private drivers that you can hire. They normally charge around 200,000 rupiahs for half a day, or 300,000 rupiahs for a full day (dont pay more than this), and they will take you anywhere you want to go, whether it be to the north of the island to the volcanoes, or east to the beach resorts, monkey forest, or the zoo's. They will then wait for you, and bring you back to the hotel, great. Be careful when booking a driver, be firm and tell him where you want to go, as sometimes they will tell you they can take you to a wood carving place, but you go to probably the most expensive place, and the same with the local art places. I think they get a commission. Just a warning, be careful with the guys on the street corners giving away scratch card type promotions. They ask you to scratch a card, you obviously win, then you get free transport to the desired hotel to have a socalled look around, and then they try and sell you a holiday for the next year. In my opinion just say no. The sellers on the street can be quite aggressive, but just be firm and say no thanks if you are not interested. If you are after a fantastic hotel, in probably the best location in Kuta, with great views, great food, and fantastic staff, then this hotel is definately the one you should pick. I looked at many of the 3 and 4 star hotels in and around Kuta, and im so glad i didnt pick them, as i saw many of the moving around Kuta. Yuk. Pick this hotel, you will not be disappointed. The tourists are slowly starting to come back to Bali (after the truely horrendous bombings here) which is great for the balinese people. They really do need help. Well thats is. We had a fantastic holiday here, im so glad we picked this hotel, it made our stay so much more enjoyable. Highly recommended.
