{"text":"funky hip quirky hotel I recently stayed at the Kirketon for 2 nights when on a business trip. the hotel has been refurbished to be very modern, sleek, minimalist in design - but it is not expensive looking - more like clever use of paint, tiles and package furniture.unfortunately you can't park on site - they do have a small number of secure parking spaces available in a nearby carpark (and I saw a number of broken into cars in the streets nearby - so i was glad for the secure parking - even though I had to walk around the block).There is a restuarant\/bar next door - unfortunately not open the 2 days I was there so I went out for all meals.The lock on my door was a bit dodgy but the really friendly staff taught me how to slam the door shut to lock it. Although they hadn't taught the cleaners that - but fortunately nothing was missing from room when I came back and discovered the door unlocked.The window blind was broken, the bathroom shelf was too narrow to balance the electric jug or the professional sized hairdryer. the pillows were really uncomfortable - BUT I was in a premium room which was an OK size. I overlooked the street and with double glazing the room was very quiet, the mattress was great, the TV (incl a couple of cable channels) was fine. Great rainforest HUGE showerhead. welcome choccies (yum) nice toiletries. Great placement - right near the Coke sign - one block walk to the action in Kings Cross. 2 blocks to the railway station and buses and taxis readily available. the staff were great - friendly helpful etc. I bought a special package - and thought that price was fair for the quality of the room. I do think their rack rate is HORRIBLY over priced - you could do WAY better in sydney if you have to pay their full price. Great location make it worthwhile.OH and no lift - I had to carry my luggage up 2 flights. OH - and I got free wireless internet as part of my package.
