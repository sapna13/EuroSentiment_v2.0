{"text":"More than happy There were several mixed opinions from the reviews I looked at prior to booking. I went ahead and booked anyway, and was pleasantly surpised with what I got.When staying in an Italian City (or any European city for that matter) you can not expect the rooms to be huge! If you do, wherever you stay, you'll likely be disappointed. With that in mind...The Room: big enough to walk around, getting changed etc without bumping in to each other - that's all I need in a room, so great! Clean, airy, the aircon worked great, beds were comfy (I need 2 pillows to sleep and the hotel were happy to oblige with extra pillows) free safe in the wardrobe (space for clothes was not abundent, but fine for a few-day stay) and we had a balcony!!The bathroom: again, big enough, the shower wasn't huge, but the pressure was decent and it was warm (it succeeded in making us clean everyday - job done!) Hotel staff were friendly and accomodating. A little tip: learn a little Italian, doesn't have to be much, but make an effort and it is very much appreciated by all staff (this includes shops\/restaurants etc)Florence itself was just fabulous! Food is great - as you'd expect. One thing to look out for, if you want pizza - go to a pizzaria. In other restaurants, chances are pizza will be made with a frozen base (this is always marked on the menu - look out for the *) Prices for ice-cream varies enormously! I got fleased for 16euro for pretty standard size cones, which we'd paid about 3-4euro each for the previous day. Ask the price before you buy! (in Italian if poss!!)The big bonus of this hotel for me, was the sun terrace! I know you shouldn't go to Florence to sun-bathe, but I was after some RR more than anything. We had the place to ourselves and could lie out on the sunloungers with a book...bliss.All in all, the hotel was ideal for our purposes - the location was great (although we did wonder around a bit too far and got lost most days - ask for directions to the station and people will know where to direct you - again, ask in Italian if you can) My only complaint was the holiday was too short!
