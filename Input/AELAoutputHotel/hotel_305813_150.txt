{"text":"Langham Suite 3620. Having been to Hong Kong for the past 30 years and stayed at numerous 3, 4 and 5 star hotels, we chose this hotel based mainly on Tripadvisor's top ratings - and we were happy that we did so for a 2 night stay, from 9 to 11 April. Booked their Langham suite and requested for a higher floor room with good views of the Victoria Harbour. Upon check in at 7pm, we were given room 3620, on the same level as its Club Lounge - very convenient to drop by the Lounge for both checking in and out. View wise, yes, it was quite good too but the Victoria Harbour was a far distance away (nothing as compared to the Hotel Intercontinental and Hotel Peninsula). Though we knew from its website that the suite was 600 square feet in total area, our first impression was - is this really 600 square feet? Though in reality, the suite had appeared smaller than its website pictures, the suite was, nevertheless, cosy and very comfy, good enough for a few nights stay. There are two toilets in the suite - one main one with both shower and large tub while the other merely has a toilet and a single sink. There is also a kitchennette with a coffee maker, a water kettle, mini bar with free ice creams!, bread toaster etcChocolate coated biscuits were also placed in our suite upon arrival, a well appreciated gesture after a long day in Guangzhou! Two bottles of distilled water were also replenished daily in the main toilet. Besides an easy to use safe, there is also an iron and ironing board, two flat screen TVs (of the Haier brand that has somewhat poorer resolution), 2 seater sofa (very hard and uncomfortable though!), single seater and a small dinning table with two chairs for small meals. Our separated bedroom (with a lock for extra security) comes with two twin beds, as requested. The beds were, in our opinions, comfy enough but not of the Westin quality. And each person were given 3 different types of pillows (even with a small bolster, very rare in hotels!). However, all the pillows were too soft for us to provide enough neck support ....resulting in us having neck strain the next morning. Breakfast was either at the Club Lounge (nice Western varieties but somewhat limited in range) or at the Restaurant on Lobby level. We opted for the latter cos it provided a much wider range, which includes dim sum (though its quality were not up to par with those served in HK restaurants and cafes). On the second day, we ''sacrificed'' breakfasts at the Hotel totally and had good dim sum at a nearby Restuarant on Nathan Road (the name is Dou Heung, quite good quality I must say). The roof top swimming pool is a sight to behold, really. Went for an early morning swim and had a memorable time there. The only complaint was, being an open air pool on such a high rise building, it can be quite cold and windy in the mornings.  Our only three glitches here were - 1. on the first day of our stay, our room was not made up even though we were out at 8am and back by 1.30pm 2. even after asking for harder pillows on the phone, they never seem to show up ...? 3. the shopping and local area of Mongkok only offers low to mid range shopping, as higher end brands are almost located on the Hong Kong island side. Though Central was only 5 MTR stops away (a 10 minutes ride), do beware of pickpockets while in the train and while moving up and down the narrow escalator ... My husband's hind trousers pocket were cut open, but luckily, nothing was taken. Lastly, having asked to see the next higher suite category, the Harbour suites (was told that there were only 3 such suites in the hotel), I felt we were glad we didn't opt for that suite category - being at only HK$1,000 more per night (Good value for the extra space), it offers 800 square feet of space with an extra big bathroom, changing room and a small study room. However, the views were nothing as compared to our Langham suite! All in all, we had a wonderful stay at this hotel. Would return to the Langham suite or Residence suite (the same 600 square feet at the same price but with a bigger kitchennette) again.
