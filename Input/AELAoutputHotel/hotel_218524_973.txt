{"text":"Amazing Honeymoon!!! We stayed here for 7 night for our honeymoon and we had a great time. The food was great, the service staff was friendly and the room we got on the 3rd floor was really big. Rooms on the top floor have a cathedral ceiling and they really look bigger. Plus the hot tubs\/jacuzzi in each room is definitely a plus. We only used it 2 or 3 times while we were there, but it was great to have that option when we wanted to just relax. The beach is amazing and the water is wonderful. Just FYI, the hotel is located on the Atlantic Ocean side of Punta Cana so you won't have the blue water, but it is still clean and warm non the less.One complain I have is that the Ocean Grill restaurant food is not that great. I was really hoping to have some amazing fresh fish there, being by the water and a grill, but I was less than impressed. All other restaurants though were really good.Overall we had a great experience and we definitely plan to go back there. I think if you really want to, you can always find something to complain about, but we're not that kind of couple so it's not even worth mentioning the little things we didn't like here and there.I would highly recommend Secrets, specially for honeymooners. It's couples only, so there weren't any single ppl or children, so that will make you vacation much more relaxing and stress free. ","annotations":[]}
