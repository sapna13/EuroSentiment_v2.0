{"text":"I love this hotel I go to one of the online sites where you bid on hotel rooms when I travel to NYC. I'm always *so* happy when my bids land me at the Millenium Hilton. I really can't believe it --I used to live in NY so feel odd staying in hotels there, and I consider myself more of a boutique hotel person than someone who frequents a big chain. But I'll say in all honesty the the bright, professional, competent and considerate Millenium staff treat you like it's a boutique hotel. Each time I've come in on the red eye from the west coast, the staff has suggested that I go freshen up in the spa and then store my luggage until my room is ready. That a.m. shower alone sets this place apart from others which (simply, reasonably) expect you to wait until check-in time. But I have also had splendid luck with my rooms at the Millenium --I'm always on a high floor, and the views over the Hudson or the Brooklyn Bridge are magic. The hotel is also very close to nearly every subway line you would want to travel on, and it's walking distance to great restaurants and sweet parks. The WTC construction is ongoing, but noise has not been a problem when I've stayed at the hotel. Just in case, each room I've been in has carried a letter from the general manager explaining the construction plan. The letter comes with a set of earplugs (so far, I've used them on the plane and in other hotels!) ","annotations":[]}
