{"text":"Great Stay at the Shangri-La We stayed at the Shangri-La's Valley Wing over Christmas 2007. The rooms were great and everything worked really well - breakfast, lounge area, laundry service, room service, housekeeping, business centre internet access - the staff were really helpful and extremely efficient. We stayed here before some years ago and knew it was a 10 minute walk to Orchard Road. We used the MRT - getting the oyster like cards on the first day at Orchard and topping them up once with cash at the same desk. The MRT and buses are easy to use. It's worth checking the websites of places you want to go as they are very precise about combinations of MRT and bus to get there. The Zoo is fantastic, as is the Jurong Bird Park. Sentosa is massively developed since our last trip but our teenager is studying WW2 so a trip to Fort Siloso helped his understanding. We attended St Andrew's Cathedral on Christmas Day and they were very welcoming.There's loads of brilliant places to eat in SIngapore - we would recommend Bombay Woodland in Tanglin Road Shopping Centre, just down the road. The Straits Kitchen at the Hyatt in Scotts Road is OK - obviously lots of Singaporeans celebrate their birthday there. We were at the Line on Christmas day for one of their excellent Festive Buffets - probably like one of their unfestive buffets but with turkey and a very good local choral group singing Christmas music. We never got to the pool but it looked inviting. The Valley Wing was great - we'd recommend it.
