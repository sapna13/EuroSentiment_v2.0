{"text":"Better then Average :-) I just stayed at the Fortune House Hotel earlier this week. The check in was fast and easy. The desk staff as well as the Security staff (Yes, They have their own security which is nice :-) were always nice and willing to help with any questions I had. The Reservations Department were also professional at all times. I had a one bedroom executive suite with a city view which was nice. I wont lie and say it was perfect as it was not. This condo showed some wear and tear but did serve our needs well and I did get a great last minute rate on this condo. If I had paid $350.00 a night, I would be FAR MORE vocal not that the Hotel itself is not nice enough as it is, But this unit #1213 would have had to have a make over for that kind of $.. But as I stated I didnt pay that and myself and my lady felt the room was fine. The only thing I missed on this property was on on-site lounge to go down and relax or have a night cap. Their is a deli in the lobby that sells beer and wine to take up stairs to your condo but it's not the same.. Another BIG plus for this Hotel is for you people with nice cars to worry about. The Fortune House has a Gated indoor garage with Security guards in it which can only be opened with a sensor on your room key. VERY NICE for me as I had a 2008 Covette rental car which once you enter the garage you realize that the residents of this Condo \/Hotel have even nicer cars then that and don't have any problems and I did not either while I stayed there..For another good rate, I would not think twice about staying again at the Fortune House as it was just a few minute ride to everything and away from the hustle of the Beach crowd. I enjoyed my stay and hope to stay again in the Future.
