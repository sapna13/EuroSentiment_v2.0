{"text":"Nice, simple, clean and convenient. Booked directly with the hotel's website for a very good 110 EUROS a night, which included a decent breakfast. The room I stayed in was very spacious, if a bit spartan. Still, the bathroom was immaculate, included a deep tub and had marble tiling. One thing that was a bit annoying - no shower curtain so you had to be very timid when showering to avoid splashing water onto the floors. It's a European thing, perhaps, but I didnt' care to mop up the floor after every shower. The towels were fluffy and the bidet was a nice touch. Great air conditioner and nice antique furniture in the room. There was a large wooden wardrobe and a small nightstand with drawers - so if you like lots of drawers, be warned.The innkeeper everyone raves about was indeed very nice - I arranged to have the hotel reserve tickets to the Uffizi (10 min walk from hotel) and the Accademia (which is just a couple blocks from the hotel), which was a god send since it really did cut down my wait to get into the museums considerably. It's worth the few Euros the hotel charges.Breakfasts were served out in the patio, which I loved, since you got to enjoy some peaceful nibblings (and ask for a fresh cappucino from the server when you enter the dining room) and watch the birds flutter around the tables in search for crumbs.Overall, for 110 EUROs\/nt, I would definitely return to this hotel. The hotel is outside of the bustle of the Duomo but walkable to every sight. There is an internet place about 1-1\/2 blocks away. I even found a great restaurant just a couple blocks away...
