{"text":"My Home Away From Home I just completed an 11 night stay at this hotel (business and vacation mixed.) Having been to Paris three times previously, I have decided that nowhere could be better than the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel in the 7th Arr. (neighborhood area). I read a lot of reviews on Trip Advisor and decided this time on the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel--and I didn't go wrong! It is a charming hotel located across from the Ecole Militaire and about a block from Les Invalides in a beautiful area of boulevards, trees, and lovely cafes. Cross the boulevard, and walk directly to the Champs du Mars, the gorgeous park in which sits the Eiffel Tower! Just two blocks from the hotel is the Rue Cler market street (think chocolate, wine, flowers). Julie, the hotel's manager is a dream to work with. She helped me make the reservation directly with the hotel (and didn't get frustrated at all when my travel dates had to change). All of the staff are fluent in English and were most helpful in making reservations, taxi services, and offering directions. As an addicted-to-ice American, I even had that available from the lower-level kitchen! My room was lovely, and large compared to other places I have stayed in Paris. Of course, I was most fortunate to have a room on the 5th floor with a gorgeous view of the Eiffel Tower, glittering at night like a diamond pendant hanging from the sky. The hotel has recently undergone a decor change (from most online photos). The subtle tones of ecru, plum, green, and burgundy are most relaxing after a long day of working, walking, and sight seeing. The rooms are cleaned daily and everything in my room and bath was always spotless! Breakfast at the hotel is a bargain, particularly with a large pot of coffee, juice, eggs, and all of the wonderful pastries of Paris. Convenient to the hotel is the metro stop---the easiest and fastest way to get around Paris. From my metro I could travel with no difficulty to the area of the Louvre, Grand Boulevards, the Marais, Latin Quarter, and the outer areas of Paris. If you are going to Paris, make sure not to overlook the Hotel Duquesne. Although listed as a 3 star hotel, I give this darling spot a 5 star rating in every way!
