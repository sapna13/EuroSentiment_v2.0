{"text":"Great location, convenient to transportation The best thing about this hotel is its extremely convenient location. Some people in a few other reviews commented that it was a bit far from a JR line, but it can't be more than five underground minutes away walking leisurely. That's hard to beat, really. It's also even closer to the Toei Oedo line, monorail line, and also a tokyo metro ginza line. That, and you can walk to the fish markets, ginza, and shimbashi easily. We ate once at the hotel, for breakfast, and wouldn't recommend it. They only had pretty disgusting western buffet style stuff, no japanese breakfast, and it was overpriced. You don't need to rely on the hotel though because there are tons of restaurants within walking distance in all directions.There is nothing spectacular about the hotel itself, but for this price you wouldn't expect there to be. It was clean, the staff were polite, and the views were nice(but most tokyo hotels I've seen are high up in buildings, so views arn't that rare in tokyo hotels). If you want to luxuriate for a little bit walk next door to the conrad and have a drink in the bar, the Conrad is supposed to be one of the best hotels in Tokyo. Oh, one word of caution. We were in a double room with two very small beds, and both my brother and myself were pretty much hanging off the beds.I'd stay here again as the location is hard to beat, but if I was after super luxury or really hip, I'd go elsewhere. It depends why you're in tokyo and how much time you plan to spend in the hotel, and who's paying. ","annotations":[]}
