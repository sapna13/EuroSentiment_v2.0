{"text":"Vacation Getaway First off, you have to know that my trip was ruined from the beginning with the horrible news of a friends death the day I was leaving for vacation. But, overall, the trip was a nice relaxing vacation which is what I needed right before school started again.The beach was beautiful. It had a bit of seaweed in it but other than that, the water was very nice.The hotel staff at the main bar was AMAZING. Boni was our favorite. The other workers seemed to love their job and were always willing to assist us with anything.The rooms were small but whocares. We used the hotel for sleep so it was not that much of a problem.The maids did NOT restock our water and that was a problem for me. We had to call down to the front desk several times before we just went down ourself and got bottled water for the room.On our last morning there, it was unfortunate and sad to have a man pass away on the beach. My concern with this was the speed at which the Scuba Caribe staff (the water sports people on the beach) and the paramedics moved to help this man. I'm not exactly sure how he drowned, I saw them pull him onto the beach and start giving him CPR. The paramedics were walking and I think they should have been running, I'm sure in America, they would have ran. There was no rain except one night so it was nice to have sun during our stay.As you can see, there were many things that made this vacation one that I will not forget. My boyfriend and I will not be going back to the Dominican Republic. Not because we did not have a good time but because it was just a bit much to handle. ","annotations":[]}
