{"text":"Wonderful clean hotel We just returned from a 4 night stay at the Fairfield Seattle Seatac. I found the hotel and rooms to be very clean and in great condition. The sink is outside the bathroom but this was not a problem for us as one could shower while the other finished getting ready at the sink\/mirrors. The bathroom is a little tight but for a hotel it is fine. We always had hot water and the pressure on the shower was fine. The bed was comfortable and they use all white linens\/duvet with just a removable runner that is a pattern at the bottom of the bed (this was the main reason I picked the Fairfield, no nasty dark comforters that are hardly ever washed). You can hear the jets taking off but it stops around midnight. The noise did not bother me as I grew up hearing planes take off from Philly Inter'l. The hotel itself was very quiet at night. In the morning you could hear the neighbors water go on but not obnoxiously loud, but that is par for the course at most hotels.The room looks exactly like the picture on the website. I requested a top floor king room based on prior reviews. We had a beautiful view of Mt. Rainer (we stayed in room 432). The breakfast was good and they kept it stocked and fresh. They had waffles, hard boiled eggs, Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches, toast, bagels, muffins, yogurt, cereal and oatmeal. There is also a 24 coffee\/tea\/hot chocolate\/hot cider available in the lobby.The front desk staff was very friendly and sad hello to you each time you passed through the lobby. Upon check in they asked if we needed an internet wire, which we did. They have wired internet in the rooms and also a computer in the lobby available for use and printing needs. The only problem there was people not obeying the 10 minute limit. We wanted to print directions and a man was there for 20 minutes typing an email. We finally gave up and left. They do have a sign posted to restrict time to 10 minutes but obviously some people can not be considerate of others. Also, as a side note to the reviewer who talked about barbed wire outside the first floor rooms. When I was looking out the window at Mt Rainer I glanced down and noticed a fence separating the Fairfield from what looked like a car facility (possibly rental cars) next door. The barbed wire was on the top of the fence. My guess is the barbed wire is there to stop people from scaling the fence to try to steal cars from the place next door. It has nothing to do with the safety of the Fairfield. We felt very safe and comfortable at the Fairfield and would definitely stay there in the future.
