{"text":"A Gem in Barcelona Recently stayed for 2 nights post cruise at this wonderful property. As mentioned in previous reviews, the hotel has a contrast of personalities-old world exterior, sleek , modern interior. We pre-paid for our room, which allowed for a generous discount on a Superior Room. The earlier you book, the lower the rate. We paid 135 Euro per Superior Room per night incl. all taxes and fees. A terrific rate considering the location and accomodations. Our room, 201, was very generous in size, sleek, modern, almost Pottery Barn like. A large door opened to a small balcony overlooking the street below. The bathroom was large and modern, with good shower pressure and hot water. A 24 in.flat screen TV had several English speaking channels including SKY News. The triple glazed windows kept out the noise from the street.The location can't be beat Steps to Las Ramblas, Hop On\/Hop Off bus, Placa de Cataluna and metro stops. Hint: If using the HO\/HO buses, bring your own comfortable earphones or headsets. The one' s offered on the bus fit improperly.We took advantage of a discounted breakfast offering in the downstairs restaurant. Very good selection of hot and cold offerings, and unlimited espresso, cappuccino, and coffee. At this point on our trip, we paid extra for the convenience of breakfast rather than searching out a better deal.Staff, for the most part were very helpful and courteous. The Manager even came out to give me all the latest suggestions on new dining venues.All in all, a GREAT stay. We definitely will be back, and will tell as many as possible about this wonderful Barcelona gem.
