{"text":"Staff requires intensive training The hotel itself is average OK, no great shakes for a 5 star hotel. My room was probably the smallest in the hotel, tiny window with a bad view of the courtyard √à√\u2020\u2022?not much bigger then the size of the bed. And make sure you are not placed too close to the lifts as I could hear them all night. Granted, the hotel is near the center and right on a canal, but these facts certainly don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ make it 5 Star. My biggest complaint and the reason I am writing this is that I found the staff to be untrained, unhelpful and snooty. The issue was that I requested checkout one day prior to my scheduled departure, the person behind the counter told this was OK and no charge would be levied. However, when I did checkout the extra night charge was placed on my bill √à√\u2020\u2022?along with the fee for the entire mini bar, which I did not use. When I mentioned the mini bar the women said this happens all the time. Also, when I complained to two of the managers about the extra night no refund was offered √à√\u2020\u2022?even though I pointed out that this was discussed the previous day. To date no refund has been given and no apologies either. Now I have heard the Dutch can be cheap √à√\u2020\u2022?but bad at business? So if you decide to stay here, make sure your bill is correct AND that the information you are receiving from the staff is accurate! If you want luxury, you had better look elsewhere!
