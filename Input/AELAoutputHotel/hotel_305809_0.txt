{"text":"Worse hotel EVER!!! Not even a hotel, should call it a MOTEL!! We also booked this hotel through travel agent in Sydney and was told this is a good place to stay. But when I arrived at this hotel back in March 08, my kids and I was shocked, this can't be a 3 star hotel, I have checked through their website and there was not much information!! First of all, they showed us this room in level 7 that took about 6 steps from the lift and the room smelt [their explanation was because of the renovation then they should fix this problem before they open their business!!], the wall paper was dark, wet and stained, the room was also very small and the most worrisome problem is that there was another wooden door that was broken to the room next door! The toilet and shower door was broken too!! That is unbelievable! You could practically kick the door and it would open! After my complaint, they took me up to level 12 to another room, that room is a little bit better but still have the same problems. I ended up not even staying there and went to my family's place and went back there 3 days later to pick up my luggages and the worse thing was that all my clothes had absorbed the smell and I had to take all my clothes to dry clean!!! It was the worse experience that I even had. I definitely will not go there again or recommend anyone either. ","annotations":[]}
