{"text":"Ok but we had some problems..... We booked our stay through our Timeshare with Interval International. It was our first time in Punta Cana...we had a very nice time, my husband and I. The food is good, we recommend the Italian Restaurant...you have to make reservations ...The restaurant right across from it is really good too, we recommend the duck...delicious! The staff is really friendly everywhere you go, willing to help you in anything...specially at Restaurant El Cano....we were there every day...the food is good . The rooms are cleaned daily and they re-fill your refrigerator also, my husband asked for them to fill it up with more beer instead of so much soda...and they did, they were really accomodating. The beach is to die for....that's were we spent our days......Everuthing was fine up to the moment when we booked our tour to Saona Island...the tour was nice, we enjoyed it . It was when we got back.... that we realized that we had been robbed. We found our safe open and some money was missing. Granted it was only $50.00, but we were really mad, specially at their attitude. The person that we spoke to ( Issac our Isaias...something like that, he runs the reception area or something like that...)....about our problem made it seem like it was no big deal, explaining that they do not make themselves responsible for anything. He let us know that each safe has a unique key and that no one could've done it, and I have to add that twice we asked for a duplicate key , which they made....but do not know what they did with the one we gave back to them. Then he had the nerve to say that we probably left it open, which was an easy way out we thought....It is an absolut shame about that incident......because everybody else at the resort was really friendly....Alex at the reception, Leonora at the restaurant El Cano, Camacho who was all over the place, very active and helpful, anything you need.... he is your man.....he makes it happen! Overall we had a good experience except for that money problem, after that of course we took our money everywhere.....even to the beach.....
