{"text":"First-Class Service for Economy Price!! My mother and I traveled to Italy for Thanksgiving week in November, and stayed the first part of our trip at the Meridiana in Florence. What a wonderful surprise!The only time I've had service this gracious and helpful, and always correct, was when I've stayed at a Ritz-Carlton. The front-desk staff was wonderful in helping us- check-in early  leave our luggage safely, so that we could go out and enjoy the day in the heart of the city- stay on top of our luggage that was lost by the airline- call taxis quickly (essential when not staying on top of the Duomo in Florence)- provide (!) appropriate postage for overseas postcards, etc.They even offered to make us martinis when we were rather desperate for a cocktail after a long day. The internet available in the lobby is easy to use, and the staff (again) quite helpful in connecting you. While we had already made day tour arrangements and other plans, options were available and easy to peruse\/compare, and it was nice to know that, had we not been able to do all that in advance, we could have done so there quite easily.I worried that our Italian was pathetic (which it still is) and yet the staff at the Meridiana was patient and helpful, and wonderfully fluent in English when we faltered in our Italian attepmts. The breakfast was generous, and started early enough in the day so you could really be out and about early enough to beat the crowds. Our room was clean, the bathroom large and generously appointed (especially with extra toiletries, thanks again for that lost luggage Alitalia!), and we had a lovely window to open out onto the boulevard.Truly a wonderful stay for a great price, and we would definitely go back again! Thank you, Meridiana! ","annotations":[]}
