{"text":"Great Hotel, Great City Service by hotel staff is fantastic eg our bags were out of the boot of the taxi and inside the hotel before I'd had a chance to pay the driver! Also very helpful desk staff for booking taxis etc.The lobby area is a cocktail lounge which has its own jazz band playing most nights, but you really need to get out and get on it elsewhere ... Room spotless, and okay size, with great view out over city. Bathroom something else: heated toilet seat, with all sorts of apparatus! a condensation-proof mirror ... with all your usual 'boutique' bathroom stuff refreshed daily.As stated elsewhere, at the bottom of the building is a small mart where you can get some essentials in eg water. Also tube stops are right there for both subway and Yamanote 'circle' line. Tubes - spotless too - run until about 1 am - worth bearing in mind as taxis are relatively expensive, and can be hard to get late at night, though there are seemingly millions of them about!Oh - if first time there, forget Rappongi - Shibuya and Shinjuku are where it's at. (So only 'improvement' on Park Hotel I can think of is to find a similar quality hotel in those areas.)Time Out Tokyo really good too for info on where to go, but sometimes you just have to take the plunge ie you find a bar is up on the 4th floor, accessible by lift, so you have no idea what it'll be like. But we were only stiffed the once ie charged for food put out for us that we didn't request (thus a √ä√£¬¢15 drink!) ... otherwise really great cool bars, people friendly . Lastly, the food is fanatstic - and not expensive. How? Use your eyes, and eat where the locals go! Drinkswise the beer is London prices ... and Asahi won my taste contest. ","annotations":[]}
