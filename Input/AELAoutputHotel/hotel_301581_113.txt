{"text":"Good choice: comfortable, decent price, great location I struggled a lot with my hotel choice in Singapore - trying to find a good mix of price, location, cleanliness, etc from the reviews on TripAdvisor and deals on various websites. We ended up at the Raffles Plaza, because I read in Frommers online that it was nicely located and it got good reviews here. It was a bit more than I wanted to pay in Singapore, given that there are so many hotels, but it turned out to be worth it.First of all, the woman who checked us in was so friendly and accommodating. We only had one night booked with a very late (midnight) flight the next day. She agreed to give us a late check out of 4pm...which I felt was really generous and kind! I have never been granted such a late checkout at any other hotel.The location IS good, as long as you don't mind being attached to a mall (most hotels in Singapore are close, if not attached, to shopping anyway). We walked from our hotel to the Boat Quay, then on to the Asian Civilizations Museum, over to Orchard Road (shopping area) and back in a little more than a half a day at a lesiurely pace. There is a lot of foot traffic in the hotel. Seemingly a lot of business people, but that didn't bother us at all. Our room was nice, nothing incredibly special but clean and overlooking the Raffles Hotel.Another benefit of the Plaza: the Amrita spa is amazing. I had a wonderful facial, the gym is great, and the variety of services, products (Dermologica) and amenities at the spa are excellent. They didn't rush me out at all, which I also liked very much and felt was different than some other spas I've been to recently.You could pay a lot more and I think a lot less in Singapore for a hotel. But the Raffles was just really comfortable and middle of the range in price, and so a real winner for my husband and me.
