{"text":"Calculated Compromise Formerly a Renaissance Hotel, formerly a condo, formerly a timeshare√à√\u2020\u2022?The Illikai is also a condo\/hotel\/owner occp\/multi-use property. In my opinion, it is not in the center of Waikiki as it is closer to Ala Moana and the Hilton Hawaiian Village. To some, that may be a bonus. But to me (a walking shopping beachgoer) it is a too far from everything else. The building itself is in fine repair, but the condition of each unit will depend on from whom you are renting (time share, condo, hotel, etc). With nice pool deck and bars overlooking a marina and the Hilton, the room views can be great or average (and noisy) depending on which way you face. Most units are kitchen or kitchenette. I recommend upgrading to a higher level ocean view room, but then you would get into several hundred $$ a night. Above $300\/nt I would really recommend staying somewhere else. For pictures and location information go to their website ilikaihotel then Google to find better rates. As always; I travel to Waikiki several times a year, I can advise that Waikiki is a nice tropical urban adventure. The city comes with the negatives of a big city, along with the overwhelming benefits of a beautiful beachfront resort. Generally, everything in Waikiki is √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Ö little tired√à√\u2020\u2022?although there have been continuous improvements in the last few years. If you are traveling solo, take Roberts Hawaii from the airport for $10 (no rsvr rqd).Two or more people, take a taxi from the airport to the hotel (should be under $30). In Waikiki, nearly everything is walking distance or a short shuttle\/bus away. If you need a car for the day, you can rent one in Waikiki.
