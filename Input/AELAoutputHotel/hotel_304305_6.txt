{"text":"No Air Circulation in hotel room during X'mas We stayed at this hotel, from Dec 19 to Dec 21, then we come back again on Dec 23, and stayed in this hotel for one more night on the 33rd floor . We found out that, there is no air-conditioning in this hotel. We could not have slept and We complained at 00:30. It was very hot inside the room. we complained, and they only provide us fan for the night. we hardly slept during our stay. we complained to the manager and the manager said that's what it is. However, we stayed here 2 nights before and it was not the case. We found out that, they are not honest and when there is complain, only will said that, sorry, we asked what they can do, they still said that's what it is. I never stayed in a hotel that need to use fan to sleep and with no air circulation. We got up at 7:00 in the mornig, and we complained again, still the same answer, they did not change the room to us for a better sleep. I would not recommend anyone to stay in this hotel. They should not sell a room with below standards to clients, I guess that, they do not know what does service mean. Just cannot believe that, it will happen in Japan with such land mark hotel in Tokyo.We did not enjoy our stay in this hotel and got a bad experience of this hotel for the holiday. ","annotations":[]}
