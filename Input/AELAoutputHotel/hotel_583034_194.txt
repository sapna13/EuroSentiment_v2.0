{"text":"Worst Hotel Service My husband and I decided to do our wedding and stay in this hotel as it was regarded as the newest and best hotel in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and by the way, it is the most expensive.This hotel and its staff managed to ruin my wedding, which was supposedly the most important day of our lives. I caution anyone not to have their wedding at this Hotel. For starters, my husband and I paid for the royal service which was supposedly the most exclusive service of the hotel and they provide a Butler to attend to our needs. Upon arrival, the butler took my wedding dress and assured me that it was going to be delivered to my room with my luggage. When I got to my room, the luggage was there and my dress wasn't. I called the royal conceirge and inquired about the whereabouts of my dress. They said they would call me back in a few minutes, which they never did. I waited 45 minutes for a return phone call. I went down to the lobby myself in order to locate my dress as no one was willing to help me find my dress. I finally found my dress on a rack on the sidewalk of the hotel where people are waiting to depart the hotel on the bus. Can you believe that?!!! I got no apologies and no explanation for this occurrence.On the day of my wedding, I was one hour late becasue it was 5:00 p.m. and my room was not cleaned byhousekeeping; thereby delaying the photographer from being able to take pictures. I called numerous times to housekeeping and the concierge and nothing was done. The photographer had to pull one of the cleaning ladies out of another room in order to clean mine. Consequently, I was one hour late and my husband and guests were frustrated. I got no apologies and no help.Finally, at the wedding receiption they brought out the cake for pictures but never served the cake to my guests. The hotel kept my wedding cake!!!!!!!!!!! When I complained about it, the chef looked at me like I had two heads. I spoke to the manager of the hotel and they only apologized. They never offered to refund me the money I paid for the cake. Also, they did not provide me with the decorations I paid for. I had 75 guests and they were all dissappointed at the service.The next day, they were supposed to serve us with a honeymoon breakfast, which never came. This hotel was supposed to be a 5 star hotel and it is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and I am an avid traveller. I brought over $100,000.00 worth of business and never got a sincere apology. I made so many friends with so many other disgruntled guests. My guests were not pleased either. DO NOT PLAN A WEDDING THERE OR STAY THERE!!!!! THEIR SERVICE IS APPALLING.
