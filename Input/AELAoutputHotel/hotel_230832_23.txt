{"text":"Agree, it has a good location My husband was traveling to Barcelona for business and I had the priviledge of coming along. The hotels that his work had recomended didn't look appealing to me so I found this along with 2 or 3 others in tripadvisor. I left it up to his work to make the reservation hence the choice. It is funny how some things will bother one person and not another. The church bells that we hear from the distance are driving my husband crazy. For me, why is it in a day and age of satelites I am stuck with CNN from London as my only english language TV choice? Silly I know but other than that, I agree that the rooms are small but they are immaculate. Apparently it has been unseasonably warm here so the air conditioning has not been turned on yet. To keep it temperate here on the sixth floor we have had to sleep with the window open since we arrived. When we inquired about the warm temperature in the room, we were told the AC is going on next week. It is a drag to need another shower after your shower never mind your makeup melting before you finish putting it on. Another thing to be aware about is that don't discard the envelope that your room keys come in. You need it to gain entrance to the hotel restaurant despite what appears to be a list of guests and their corresponding room numbers.The restaurant staff are short of obsessive in seeing it to let you in in the morning. One morning, my husband showed his license with the room key and you could see them starting to stress about it. Needless to say I got another one (without an issue). It just seems strange when we have come in at varying times at night and no one is at the desk although I am sure we are on a camera\/video somehwere but are OCD about breakfast. But it does have a good location once you get oriented. We are right behind La Rambla behind the Citidines hotel. If you are a shopaholic then this is the place for you. ","annotations":[]}
