{"text":"Managers need lessons in Customer Service We booked our trip using Sky Auction. We got vouchers with our confirmed reservation at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach Hotel. We called the Hotel ahead of time to once more confirm our reservation and we were assured all was fine. We had 12 people in our Party. This was a gift to our children for Christmas. After 12 hours of traveling we arrived at the Barcelo Beach Hotel and encountered a very unfriendly manager who said we had no reservations at that Hotel. After showing him our proof of reservations, he insisted our reservation was at the Casino Hotel. We showed him our vouchers again that very specifically said confirmed at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach Hotel. Paid in full back in October. Meanwhile as we argued with him several other travelers came up to the desk and were upgraded to different Hotels on the Beach because they had over booked the rooms. After a futile effort to talk to his supervisor we had to go to the Casino Hotel with a promise of rooms the next day. They made us carry all our own luggage and did not offer us any assistance as I did hear him say impossible Americans! Perhaps this man need to know that Tourism in that country is his bread and butter and without us impossible Americans spending american money in his country he would not be able to feed his family. We had to check out of the Casino Hotel by 11Am the next day only to ounce again slep our own luggage back to the Barcelo Beach Hotel and find that they had no rooms for us yet but would by 3PM. Now we have lost 2 full days of vacation. You guesssed it no rooms at 3PM either. Finally at 4PM they had our rooms. They totally ruined what was suppose to be a nice relaxing family vacation and felt no need to apologize for the inconvenience to us. The food was awful the beach beautiful but very crowded and very hard to find chairs. Ants all over the bread on the buffet. Beware of what you eat.
