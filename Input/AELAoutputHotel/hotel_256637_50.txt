{"text":"Good Hotel I stayed 10 nights at the Sheraton on the Park. The hotel is located in the center of the city (central business district)--convenient for both business and pleasure. It is about a 10 minute walk to both Darling Harbour and the Sydney Opera house area. Very convenient to shopping, with major shopping areas just a couple blocks away.Rooms are nice size, with walk-in closets and a very large bathrooom. Rooms aren't ultra-fancy, but are a step up from most Sheratons. Rooms were well kept and clean, and beds were very comfortable. Some rooms have view of Hyde Park (mine did not), and there is a faily good gym at the hotel. I had access to the Executive Lounge, which offers a buffet breakfast in the morning and some snacks in the evening. It also offers coffee, tea and drinks (although you need to ask a server to bring you tea and drinks--it would be a lot more convenient if you could just help yourself, as is common at most other executive lounges). The lounge also offers free wireless internet access, although reception is somewhat spotty--I think the signal is intentionally weak to prevent neighboring rooms from getting internet access for free--the hotel charges $39 a day for internet access is you're not in the lounge (although it does have free computer access in the lobby).Staff were very accomodating, especially those in the lounge. All around service was good and workers had a very positive attitude and welcoming attitude.All in all a good hotel, and I would recommend it.
