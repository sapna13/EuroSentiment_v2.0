{"text":"Relaxing Holiday at Palace Macao My husband  I have just returned from Riu Palace Macao... 10th October 2007.It has been a wonderful relaxing holiday. The hotel staff are very friendly always smiling and ready to help you in a trice.Anything that you need is no problem for them.Checking in was friendly, professional and very welcoming. Jimmy on the front desk was a real character!Our room was very well presented altho the air conditioning is not as effecient as we have experienced at other hotels elsewhere.The maid service is excellent, clean linen daily and a turn down service at night which was very nice. Flowers on your pillow or chocolate treats on the turned down covers!!The mini bar was stocked religiously each day and such jolly guy that does the job. There are ice stations at the end of the corridors to fill up your ice bucket from your room, nice touch!The food was excellent in the main buffet and at the Caribbe Grill, couldn't say the same for the Steak House tho, very mediocre.The Caribbe Grill is right on the beach and has a fantastic view of the sea and the selection of fish at lunch was excellent. The shrimps in garlic butter...MMMmmm!!!!!!The guys serving there are really friendly, smiley people and all seem genuinely pleased to see you, especially when you turn up again the next day!The beach bar is a great place to say 'Hi' to people and see what Jonny Bravo is up to, either Salsa lessons or Aerobics and have your favourite drink served by Antonito, he is so happy and has a great selection of hats!! His top saying 'Oh my God, I love my job!!'Champagne is available from morning til night and it is sooo... lovely!With regards to 5 Star Hotel I would definately say NOT.Maybe 3.5 or 4 Star, the hotel is a little tired.But the staff are definately 5 Star with 5 Star effort consistently!The location is superb, blue sea, fine white sand, what more is there?All in all we have had a great holiday doing very little, which is what we intended and the Riu Palace Macao served us well.Would we go back?..... Yes we would ","annotations":[{"endOffset":81,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":75},{"endOffset":81,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":75},{"endOffset":81,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":75},{"endOffset":650,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":641},{"endOffset":1873,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1868},{"endOffset":2001,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":1995}]}
