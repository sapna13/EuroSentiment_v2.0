{"text":"Something for everyone After traveling to Mexico the last five years our family was ready to try something different. I research mostly through tripadvisor and the Royal Service feature of the Paradisius was very attractive to us. I will begin by saying the resort has many wonderful qualities. Our check out started at the wrong place. I thought after telling them we had royal service that we were at royal service check in but after completing all the paperwork found out royal service check in is in a completely different building. Once at the proper place, a very lovely VIP buiding, we sat down at a nice desk with champagne and air conditioning and did the check in all over again. We made dinner reservations and were then transported by a golf cart trolley to our rooms. We had two rooms as requested side by side. Our bellboy\/butler was very informative and our rooms were spacious and clean. We found out during our stay our made Francescia our maid was wonderful! each day she spent time dusting, cleaning, washing the floors and anything else that needed to be done to make our rooms spotless. We were happy to have brought some fun school supplies for her 6(!) kids. The first night we ate at the Hibiscus buffet. Big mistake. the food was horrible!! If you have to eat there order the pasta. Its only thing edible. It did get better after that. We had reservations at the Japensese (great), French (good but you will leave hungry), Chinese (Great food horrible service), and Mexican (great), Italian (great and open until 3am), we had lunch once at the italian and a late night snack once also, the minetrone soup and eggplant parm is delicious. We had breakfast and most lunches in the Royal service Lounge. The breakfast was buffet but they will make omelets if you ask. The lunches were very good especially the chicken marsela. There are no sandwiches though so try another place if you want something on that idea. My biggest complaint though was the drink service at the Royal Service beach. The royal service beach is a bit of a farce. No one checks to see who goes in an out of the royal service beach or pool and people save chairs the night before. There is no drink service on that part of the beach. When I inquired they said there is and introduced me to the beach runner, he however stayed at the pool bar and we had to walk up almost everytime we wanted a drink. When I did complain at the royal service front desk, another guest overheard me and said she was served one drink on the beach the whole week she was there. I did notice the beachrunners on the other side working very hard. Someone from management needs to spend a few hours watching and correcting this situation. Any other resort we stayed at we had drink service and only had to tell them once what you wanted and they served us all day. The beach runners are only hurting themselves because we as many others were tipping consticently for service. This is the most expensive vacation we have taking which would have been fine had we been able to at least been served a drink on the beach.I would not return to the Paradisus until that and a few other customer service problems were solved. We traveled with our 1816 year olds who did meet plenty of other teens and had a ball. the shows are very good. The Las Vegas show and Michael Jackson Show were excellent. This is a big resort so you will need to take the trolleys. They ran regularly but when they didnot we walked and that was fine. It also rained for two days. We heard this was unusual for this time of year though. If you have reservations to travel here you will enjoy the wonderful beach and water!! Plan your dinners, stay away from the Hibicus restraunt and be prepared to walk up the beach bar for drinks!! You will enjoy it!!!
