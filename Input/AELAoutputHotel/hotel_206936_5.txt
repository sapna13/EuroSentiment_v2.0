{"text":"Brilliant hotel ..........if they fix the air con ! Booked a 3 night stay through last minute .com. on a room only basis. Very impressed with the hotel on arrival. Sometimes, photos on a website can be a bit overstating but the Avenida Palace was just like the photos and the lobby \/ public area is beautiful. The Hotel's location is excellent (no more that 5 minutes liesurely walk to placa Catalunya and las Ramblas)Friendly staff checked us in and took us up to a room on the top floor. (We had requested an upper floor for quietness due to its city centre location.). The room was at the rear of the hotel, was spotless and lovely with a huge bed ,TV and mini bar and a nice large clean bathroom.There was one problem, the Air conditioning didn't work and the room was very stuffy and too hot. (about 30 degrees) I mentioned this to the guy on the desk and he was quite flippant ,saying that it didnt work in any of the rooms and that we should just open the window. which is what we did and it sorted the problemOn the second day, after returning to the hotel shattered from a day walking and seeing the sights, we went to get our key and were told that we would have to change rooms as there was no water on the top floor. we re packed and moved to a larger and nicer room on the 7th floor at the front of the building.This room was just as hot as the other and we opened the window to hear a din of the traffic below . After a sleepless night with the noise from the street we got some earplugs and cured the problem for the next night.As I said before, The Hotel's location is brilliant Just 5 mins walk from the main tourist areas. There are some lovely restaurants nearby which offer better quality and Value for money than those on the RamblasThere is a Metro station right outside the door of the hotel (we didnt notice any rumbling noises from this by the way)Only a very short walk to the placa de Catalunya where you can get the Airport bus (4 euros) or the open top Tourist bus (20 euros)Overall, i would say that this hotel is great but would recommend the following to anyone planning to stay there.1. Request a room at the rear of the hotel. (no view but quieter)2. Take earplugs in case you need to have windows open.3 Breakfast is expensive at 20 euros, but there is a great place called Fargo two minutes around the corner that does a fine selection breakfasts from 2 euros up to 10 euros and has a lovely Spanish atmosphere about it. 4. there is a sweet shop right next door to the hotel where you can buy bottled water for about a euro for a large bottle to save paying the 3 euros for the tiny bottle in the mini bar (you'll need it if they haven't sorted the air con) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":242,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":236},{"endOffset":242,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":236},{"endOffset":242,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":236},{"endOffset":678,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":674}]}
