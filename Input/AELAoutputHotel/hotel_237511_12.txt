{"text":"Best innkeepers in Florence After reading reviews of the Hotel Giglio in Florence on Trip Advisor, my traveling partners and I decided to stay there during our week stay in that city. It was one of the best decisions of our trip. The Hotel Giglio is a delightful hotel which is well situated within easy walking distance of the center of Florence. We arrived to find a gracious reception desk and gracious hosts behind it. The hotel is owned and run by a lovely family who acquired it just 6 months ago. It is in good hands. Roberto and his brother, Eduardo, spoke English very well. They were very helpful with suggestions for restaurants and attractions and shopping. Beyond that, however, because of their hospitality our stay in Florence became much more than a sightseeing tour. The hotel became a wonderful part of the experience of the city.Our triple room was exceptionally clean with great ensuite facilities that included a walk-in shower. The beds were freshly made each day and the room kept orderly. We had a nice view over the inner courtyard of the former Victorian era residence. Free internet service is available to guests. However, we found it to be constantly busy. Roberto and Eduardo were gracious and kind enough to provide their own personal laptops to use as long as we needed to in order to keep in touch with family and work situations in the U.S. That was service beyond the norm.Breakfast is included in the stay at the Hotel Giglo. It included typical continental breakfast fare with the addition of homemade Italian pastries and fresh made morning cappuchinos and espressos. The dining room is cozy but comfortable and lends itself to visiting with other visitors to the hotel. Another service which we didn't expect but enjoyed was the free lift to the train station at the end of our stay. Roberto kindly loaded and unloaded our luggage and gave us the friendly advice to watch our surroundings in the train station and be careful. He sent us off with such a kindly, friendly touch that we felt that we had become part of the family during our too brief stay.The Hotel Giglio is reached from the ground floor by a staircase to the 2nd floor. There is a small lift, however, to help those who need help with baggage or have difficulty climbing the stairs. We had no problem negotiating the wide, attractive staircase. The location is on the Via Cavour which is just a few minutes walk straight to Duomo square. There are numerous restaurants and the city market in the area. It is a lively, safe area with many students and professional people living in the area. The rooms were quiet and a nice respite from the day.We recommend the Hotel Giglio highly. You will find it to be one of the best values and best experiences in Florence.
