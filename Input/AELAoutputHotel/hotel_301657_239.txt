{"text":"Very Nice Stay We stayed at the Park Hotel Shiodome October 27-30, 2006. We generally agree with the positive reviews. High quality room (not large but this is Japan), and we had great city views of the Tokyo Tower and surroundings from the 28th floor. Found a very high level of service from greeting us at ground level and taking us to check in on the 25th floor. Staff at desk had fluent English. The room has nice amenities, and as said by others nice to get an English newspaper (International Herald Tribune combined with English version of Asahi Shimbun.) We booked over the internet for 17500 yen per night, not particularly cheap but not bad for Tokyo.It is a bit confusing to find (especially at ground level) because of construction right now, and it is across from the somewhat similarly named Royal Park Hotel. Like others we had some trouble navigating at first until we found that if you exit at the 3rd floor, you can exit turning left to reach an upper level walkway that takes you past the Royal Park on your right, then you turn left to reach Shimbashi station which has the Yamanote rail and Ginza subway lines. If you take the escalator down near the Royal Park there are restaurants and shopping. Also on the 3rd level if you go right past the new yurakicho sky train station you reach the Pedi Shiodome which has some very nice restaurants and coffee shops which we frequented. We also ate in the underground by Shimbashi station. We did not eat in the hotel, though on the ground level there is nice cafe, Cafe Des Artes.We have stayed at Keio Plaza in Shinjuku previously and the ANA in Roppongi. While the ANA is a superior hotel, we found the Park to be good value for the money. Unlike another reviewer we did mind being a little out of the action, and having a bit of a quiet retreat in a smaller more boutique like hotel. We would happily stay there again.
