{"text":"Very Nice The location of the hotel is wondeful, very close to the center of Firenza. When you first arrive at the hotel you will be a little shocked as the entrance is only a dingy lobby with an elevator to the second floor where the hotel is. The owner is a very nice woman who makes sure that you get exactly what is coming to you. The rooms are very basic but very clean. The towels will also shock you as they have no fluff, but we like them so much we bought six of them at their cost. Breakfast was very good but be warned if you get near the automatic expresso maker you will have your hands cut off. (can't blame her it probably cost $10,000). The hotel recommended a couple of close restaurants that were very good (we ate at Semidivino twice). Also have them book your tickets to the Museums before you arive. Overall for the price you cannot beat Hotel Casci would definetly return but not in the summer as prices are very high and way to crowded.One word of caution, if you rent a car driving around Florence is impossible. We rented one to drive to Tuscany for four days and it took me an hour to get from the Florence train station back to the car rental office which was about four blocks away. Problem is many of the streets are for taxi's and buses only so even with a good GPS I had to go totally around the city and have a someone on a scooter actually take me to the car rental return. Renting at the airport would probably have been a better idea. ","annotations":[]}
