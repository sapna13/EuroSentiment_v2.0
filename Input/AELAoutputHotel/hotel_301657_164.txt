{"text":"Great hotel, good location We (parents and 12 year old boy) stayed twice in the Park Hotel in July, for a total of 5 nights. We had a corner room and it was plenty big - from the other reviews, sound like these are a lot bigger than the regular rooms. The bathroom was good, with plenty of toiletries, tootbrushes, razors etc. First introduction to heated toilet seats... We stayed on the 30th and 33rd floors with no noise from the trains, even though we were above the train lines. The hotel was great, and we throughly recommend it. For a first visit, the Airport Limousine from Narita stops right outside making travel easy - if you're more confident, its easy enough to take JR to Shimbashi, and then follow the pedestrian walkways to the Shiodome tower (download the map from the hotel's web site first!). The walkway to the 3rd floor of the Shiodome are easy to follow - the basement tunnels are more complicated and we rarely used them. There is a Family Mart in the basement, useful for food and other items. As other reviewers have noted, the surrounding buildings are full of restaurants of all types. The location is also good - lots of metro lines close, easy to get to Tokyo Station (though the fastest way seemed to be the JR lines from Shimbashi, not the metro), right beside the Yurikamome monorail that goes to Teleport, and easy walking distance to Ginza.The only disappointment was that there is no WiFi network (there is cable access for laptops in the rooms however). Also, the hotel is not for those who dislike heights, as it extends from floor 25 to floor 34 of the media tower. Would definitely stay again.
