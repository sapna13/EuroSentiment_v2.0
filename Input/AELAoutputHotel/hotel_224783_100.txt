{"text":"Great Stay at the Grand Hyatt After a rocky start, our visit was without incident. We arrived at the hotel much later than expected (and called from baggage claim to alert them to that fact). It was 1:30 AM local time - 4:30 AM for us - needless to say, we were exhausted. Front desk pleasantly confirmed we had booked a king, non-smoking room and proceded to send us up to a smoking room on the 23rd floor. The odor was overwhelming. Return to the front desk revealed there were only 4 unoccupied rooms in the hotel (it was a Saturday night). They offered to put us in a non-smoking double room and change us Sunday morning. No problem! That offer should have been made before the hassle of going to the smoking room...but problem solved. As promised, the front desk called at 10 AM Sunday morning with a room change available. New room, on the 17th floor, was just fine. The hotel is very conveniently located downtown - you can walk to most sites of interest. There is a Starbucks that opens to the street but is literally in the hotel. For more discerning coffee drinkers, there is a top rated local coffee shop across the street from the hotel. Other details that made our stay (June 30 - July 6, 2007) most pleasant: spacious bathroom w\/dimmer switch for those night trips - separate bathtub and large shower with great shower head and very good water pressure. Bathroom is dark - they have a magnifying mirror, but it's not lit. Difficult for make-up application. Small corner of the room window opens so there's ample fresh air in the room. Blackout shades lower on an electric switch (really handy). Bed - very comfortable - no disgusting bedspread. The workout facility is well equipped with free weights and lots of cardio machines, each with its own TV monitor. Headphones provided if you don't supply your own. As mentioned in another review, refrigerated towels on offer, with cold water w\/cups provided. The boarding pass printer in the lobby - super convenient. Valet parking is expensive - $31\/night - however, the valet staff are very pleasant and very efficient. The entire staff - superior.
