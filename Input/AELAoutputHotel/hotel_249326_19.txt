{"text":"Should have picked something closer.... This review is a bit dated, hopefully they have upgraded since then. My husband and I have never been to Amsterdam, and this was our first time going. I did an extensive search online to pick the perfect hotel. We didn't want to be too close to the city center, but didn't want to be too far out. I found the Hotel Arena online, and looked at the pictures. Loved the artsy and modern decor. So we booked it. After a long transatlantic flight, we arrived into Amsterdam at 9PM, and it was still light out. We found our way to the hotel by public bus. When we arrived at the hotel, it had a very goth look, with the trees shadows against the building. We walked in, the reception area was like a coat check-in for a club. Mind you it was a Friday night, and there is a nightclub on site, and they were setting up for the evenings festivities. The check-in was quite easy, they gave us keys to our room. As we proceeded down the curtain lined hall, I was just hoping that our room would be better than we thought. Took the elevator to the 6 floor, the doors creeped open and the flourescent like flickering. Not a very good vibe, open the door to the room, and found 2 twin beds on opposite side to the room and the smell was just horrid. I opened the covers on one of the bed and found stuff crawling. We immediately called the front desk, they told us the hotel was all booked, and wouldn't have an open room until the morning. We had no choice but to sleep. We didn't shower, nothing, just closed our eyes and drifted in and out of sleep all night long. Come to find out later that the hotel used to be an orphange in the early 19th century. Best thing of the hotel was the complimentary breakfast, great crossaints!
