{"text":"Weekend break Myself and my partner has just returned from a weekend cruise break to see MADONNA at the Amsterdam Arena we booked the ferry crossing and a one night stay in the Ibis Centre hotel. On arriving in the centre of Amsterdam we had a short walk over to the hotel. We checked in around 11am and were told our room would be ready by 2pm. Our luggage was kept in a secure room and we went out to explore. This is our fourth visit to Amsterdam and once again it did not dissapoint. I recommend a visit to Rembrantplein, this is a tram ride away but very nice. Full of bars, resturants and shops and also not far from the Flower Market. When returning to the Ibis our room was ready. The hotel and room was very clean and welcoming. The only disadvantage is the hotel is now 100% non-smoking you have to stand outside. Our room was a twin room facing the railway station. There was a bit of noise but not disturbing at bed time. There is also some construction going on as the hotel is being extended but that also did not cause a problem. The staff I found were excellent and very helpful. We did not return from the concert until very late (2am) so we were hungry. The staff told us we could have a pizza from the take-away they provide even though was only available till 1am. This was a godsend. They telephoned our room when it was ready. The breakfast was included in the price and we found it very good. Buffet style containing eggs, sausage, beans, fresh toast and much more... Overall I rate this hotel very highly and would stay here again (even though I am a smoker) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":96,"mention":"MADONNA","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Madonna_Inn"],"startOffset":89},{"endOffset":1211,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1206},{"endOffset":1473,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1468}]}
