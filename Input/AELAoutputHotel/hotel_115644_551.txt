{"text":"Comfortable with historical charm My girlfriend and I stayed at the Chancellor on our roadtrip. Our first issue was stopping the car and it was difficult given the tight streets with the cable car tracks right in the middle. We had to do a big loop in order to drive up facing the right direction, but that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ just San Francisco. Stopping in front of the hotel for the valet parking was difficult when we arrived in the evening since the whole block was full of parked cars despite it being a no parking zone. Eventually, we got the valet to take my car to their undisclosed parking location. Be aware that you need to give 20 minutes notice to get your car back. There was a mix-up one time when I asked for my car and they somehow brought the wrong one. But the error was corrected quickly and the staff was friendly. The valet parking cost seems like a lot but considering the price of the rooms and the nature of driving in San Francisco, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ quite reasonable.The room was a touch on the small side, but given the location and history of the building, it was a minor concern. We were provided with a spacious closet that included a safe which was a nice touch. The bathroom was fine and the little touches made it feel cozier (like the rubber duckie and the not-often-provided cotton swabs). Watch the lip walking into the bathroom though because you might trip or at least hurt your toes. Another nice touch to the room was the pillow menu. We couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be bothered to ask for different pillows, but knowing that they had a varied selection of interesting pillows was comforting.The Chancellor had one computer in the lobby for public internet use. The set-up seemed like the computer was off-limits, but all you have to do is ask to use it. The room is set up for wireless internet access, but you need your own laptop of course.One really helpful thing was the map they provided. It had all of the major tourist attractions and really made it easier for us to plan our trip.All in all, we were quite comfortable at the Chancellor and the staff was very friendly (including answering our questions about the 4.0 earthquake that happened while we were in San Fran). Considering the charm of the building coupled with the excellent location next to Union Square, the Chancellor proved to be a good choice for our vacation.
