{"text":"Not bad, but not the best This is definitely a quaint place to stay for couples. I recently booked my first trip to Puerto Rico with my boyfriend and we chose At Wind Chimes Inn due to all of the reviews we read online. We stayed from 9\/24 - 9\/28\/2008. Its cute in the fact that it feels like home. When we arrived we were greeted by Felix, a very nice man at the front desk. He gave us a map and even took the time to explain to us what the best places to eat (where they served authentic Island food) and which buses to take to travel around. The hotel room we stayed in was up on the 2nd floor, back by the bar, Room 127. The room had a very comfortable Queen Sized bed, but overall it was a bit small and had a strange smell to it, somewhat like a musky odor. Its not that bad though. The AC worked fine, and you definitely need it for the heat! The bathroom could have been a bit cleaner, and the cable connection on the small tv in our room was really bad. There was a bit of a mosquito issue in the room, we kept the windows closed but for some reason, they just kept on coming in. The overall atmosphere of the hotel is great, makes you feel right at home. It is definitely nothing flashy and extreme. Outside of our room was a small sitting area where we enjoyed beers (Medalla Light is the best - try it!) and great music from the bartender just downstairs. The location is pretty good, literally one block from the beach. The walk to rest of the area is not too far either, just steps away from restaurants. The hotel is in a very quiet location, so if you're looking for relaxation, this is the perfect spot you want to be in. Otherwise, try and get a hotel a little bit closer to the Action in the heart of the Condado area, like the Marriot. The pool was clean and very nice as well. There is a really cute cat that we named Ferdinand that lingers around the patio and bar area outside. The Condado beach is really nice because its never too packed, but the waves are a bit on the strong side. If you keep heading towards the Old San Juan area, just before the Dos Hermanos bridge, there is a really beautiful beach with calm clear waters too.
