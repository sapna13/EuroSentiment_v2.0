{"text":"Great hotel Stayed Jan 2-7, 2008. At first a little apprehensive - website looks great, but a little out of the way in Mongkok. But when you arrive, the room was great. Thoroughly modern, great views (we were on the 31st floor). The bed and pillows were the best I have slept in. I asked the hotel where to buy the pillows. Only drawback was the extra charge for in-room internet. However, the 5th floor had a number of internet terminals and most of the time we did not have to wait to use. Service staff were very polite and helpful.Was confused how to get from airport to hotel so emailed the hotel - response was fantastic with detailed maps depending on your choice of transportation. We chose the express bus. On leaving the hotel, we took a cab to the Kowloon station to grab the airport train (fast and cheap). Told them our choice and they registered our names with the bus desk. Easy.The hotel connected to a mall which was convenient as we ate breakfast there and had Starbucks there. The mall had many restaurants, including a pretty good dim sum (recommended). The dessert place was very good as well (also recommended).The location of the hotel, while initially I had misgivings, is not too bad. Close to the Mongkok MTR so convenient. Also close to the Mongkok East station which we took the MTR to Shenzhen for a day of shopping. Around the hotel are many shopping places. The street for shoes is close by as is the night market stalls. Also, many snack places if you like street food. ","annotations":[]}
