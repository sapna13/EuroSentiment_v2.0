{"text":"Majestic Elegance is a Winner If you're looking for a fabulous place to spend time with your lover, this is for you. Took my new husband to ME for his birthday. He has treated me to the Paradisus - also in PC - on several occasions but it is higher priced and not within my budget for this vacation. I made arrangements for this vacation through Bookit.com and there was not even a snag with the reservation. As a matter of fact, we were upgraded without request and the process of discovery on a new property was delightful, thanks to the very qualified, smiling staff at the Elegance Club check-in lobby. Rooms: To die for. The room is spacious, appointed well with nice touches such as wall decor, lighting, LCD TV, etc. While there are some refinements needed, they are minimal and not one of the identified needs stopped us from thoroughly enjoying our stay. We had an indoor jacuzzi and an outdoor spa on a private roof-top deck. Wow - wow again.Food: Delicious. The best beef I have even eaten in DR was at the steakhouse here and the evening meals at the Italian restaurant left me wanting more. Seafood was pretty darn good - no one can beat the Paradisus in the seafood category, however. We enjoyed the Japanese restaurant but never tried the Gourmet French. We assessed the feedback here before leaving to be accurate. The menu is limited and didn't feel the need to venture there with so many other terrific options. All of the buffet options were terrrific and I did not select one thing that wasn't tasty.Hotel grounds and beach: Fabulous. The beach was lovely, enough chairs for all and a Bali bed available by making a reservation with Elegance Club staff. Drinks were delivered to your chair - if you'd like - and the walk-up bars were close by and staffed well. Evening entertainment has not been thought through yet. Shows were fun but not of the same professional quality of other more well-established properties. Feel that they will get there. Lobby bar was wonderful and many seating areas inviting guests to mingle and meet new friends. We found ourselves there every night and always had interesting people to talk and party with. Take Off bug spray. Mosquitoes were a nuisance and definitely noticeable. Feel the property may want to fog for these pests in early evening to keep them at bay.All in all, I feel this was a risky propostion that turned out extremely well - given the newness of the establishment. Everything about it causes me to want to plan my return. While it is hard to touch the quality of an all-inclusive Paradisus experience anywhere, I feel that this experience rivaled it for about 50 percent of the investment. In two words - LOVED IT.
