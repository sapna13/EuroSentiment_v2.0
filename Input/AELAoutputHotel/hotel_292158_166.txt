{"text":"Wonderful Trip! Stoney Creek, OntarioWe just returned from our trip to Punta Cana. We stayed at the Grand Palladium Resort and Spa in the Palace Hotel. It was just fabulous. The rooms were exceptionally clean and had all the amenities in the brochure. There was even a hottub in the room! The cleaning staff were extremely friendly and did a terrific job! The food was great and there are many restaurants; buffet and ala carte to choose from. You are able to use the restaurants at the other hotels in the complex. The complex is very widespread and the best way to get around is the trolley which runs about every 15 minutes. The pools are large, spacious and very nice. The staff at these hotels are exceptional. They always helped us whenever we had a question and the waitstaff were phenomenal! They always have a smile and are always willing to get you whatever it is you want. Remember you are in their country so there will be a little language barrier. They do their best to understand you and we tried our best at Spanish. The entertainment was great. The shows were very professional and the poolside staff always had some type of game to play. The grounds were clean and the hotel itself was fabulous! We would return. My only complaint was some of the German guests were extremely rude. Politeness isn't worldwide! Ignore them and enjoy your vacation. We read a few comments that had a few bad things to say and they were from AMerican, ignore them! This is a great hotel and we will return!
