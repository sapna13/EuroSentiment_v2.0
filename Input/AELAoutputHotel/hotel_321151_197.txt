{"text":"Jurys Boston - First Class Stay for mid range price We had to stay one night in Boston to conduct some personal business, but wanted to make the trip somewhat social and fun. The Jurys Boston Hotel certainly made the accomodation part of our stay hassle free. The hotel is the former Boston Police Headquarters, and has been tastefully remodeled (except for the funky mirrors in the elevators!). Our room with two double beds was first class, not too small as some reviews have said. Three adults stayed comforably, though we admittedly packed light. Free internet service was both wired and wireless, and easy to connect to. The beds were comfortable, and the bedding was changed as requested prior to our arrival (due to a down feather allergy). The hotel allowed us to check in early (which they do not guarantee but will try to accomodate). The bathroom was large, with nice modern decor. It featured a large, walk-in shower with dual shower heads. One of my few minor nit-picks was that water leaked out at the base of the door and soaked the bath mat (not a deal breaker). The room included a lockable safe, mini-bar, iron, hair dryer, robe and umbrella for your use. The hotel has a nice restaurant (The Stanhope) and bar (Cuffs). We had a drink at the bar and watched sports on the big screen TVs. We had breakfast at the Stanhope the next morning. It was of the usual big hotel price ($7-18), but I have to say I did not regret the price-convenience trade off because it was EXCELLENT.The location was VERY easy to find by car, right off the Mass. Pike Prudential Center exit. It is close to Copley Square, Newberry Street and Boston Common.My wife recently stayed at the Four Seasons in Boston, and although she liked it, said it had nothing over the Jurys (which was ~$200 less per night). We love going to Boston, and do not get there enough. Next time we DO go, it is almost certain we will stay at the Jurys Boston hotel.
