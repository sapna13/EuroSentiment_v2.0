{"text":"Make your own opinion! Do not believe some dissapointed yankees! We stayed at Melia Caribe Tropical Resort on Thanksgiven holidays. Before moving there we read a lot of advises on the website and did not know what we should expect. Everything was really good!!! It was our first journey to Dominicana and we liked it very much.The resort is huge, has four districts: Melia, Caribe, Royal Service and Golf villas. It was not convenient to walk from one district to another one, and we sometimes took special vehicles (which runs between districts). There are a lot of swimming pools, restaurants with various cuisines, a casino (who likes gambling) and different activities (for children and adults). I noticed that some travelers were not satisfied by quality of meal in restaurants, but I would like to say that everything was good. We liked to eat at Seafood, French and Royal service restaurants. I saw a lot of Americans spent their time at an American restaurant (I supposed they could not live without hamburgers and steaks) and could say nothing about quality of meal in this restaurant.Swimming pools are incredible! The beach was clean and well organized! Only one problem we had was the communication with hotel staff because they can not speak English. It shocked us at the beginning of our stay but later we learnt some useful phrases in Spanish. We stayed at a Royal Service villa. The Royal service has a lot of advantages: an individual restaurant with a swimming pool and a bar, privileges in booking other restaurants, an individual beach with a bar. If you like to travel with luxury it is better to choose Royal service. Every evening we went to watch shows for children (we traveled with our 2,5 years daughter) and for adults. Some adult shows were not good, but it was fun to watch it.Overall I would say this is probably one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in on holiday.
