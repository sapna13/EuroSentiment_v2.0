{"text":"Foget about it! SERIOUSLY! Absolutelly unfriendly staff starting with the reception desk, ending to bars and restaurants. The receptionist Juan answers in absolute indifference , with both hands deeply througn in the pockets and showing a clever smile that wherever we have booked a room with a seaview the only room available is one with a restaurant view, as they sell that room as sea view' one! You will never get a coke earlier than 15 minutes, neither you will get rid of used plates on the table faster than this. Thus all afternoons , starting at 15.00 till 17.00 starts a noisy karaoke at pool site , you'll never get alsleap during afternoon hours whatsoever. you mostly have to carry yourself own luggage in last day, even asking for service 3 times at the reception. Late check up time is max at 13.00 (it may be also 19.00 hours with two options: paying a fine of 40USD, or , as the receptionist sais, paying him a tip of just 10USD instead...), but you will most proably wait for check up clerk for 30' as she\/he leaves as exactelly 13.00 for lunch time.The single nice person in service at the location was the room cleaning lady she hardly tries herself doing her best. Room was clean but AC leaking, thus noisy too. Food is fare but avoid sea food, I really mean it! Soift drinks are all fake , soda tastes of salt. Beach towels are in a poor condition, and take care of occasional garbage left by tourist on the beach, as no one get's read of it until midnight. Rats appear by the pool side sorage room for beach towels every night.Definitelly DO NOT GO THERE!
