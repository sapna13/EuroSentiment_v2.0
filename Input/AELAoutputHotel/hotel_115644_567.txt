{"text":"Choose the Chancellor, you won't go far wrong!!! Holidays are very important to us, so we always invest a lot of time and research when booking our hotels. We are so glad we took this time out, as the many great reviews of the Chancellor pursuaded us to choose it over many other locations around the city such as fishermans wharf, nob hill and chinatown.For those of you who are still undecided, please choose the Chancellor Hotel. It's location on Union Square is perfect if you want to tour the city, spend time shopping, eat\/dine or even take in a show. The cable car stops just outside, and you are also close to other means of transport.We had a fantastic view of Union Square from our room as we emailed Wes Tyler ahead to request this. Wes replied within a day, superb customer service which beats many Five Star hotels I have stayed in.The hotel itself admittedly is basic, but I liked this, you must remember that this is a base camp and you rarely spend that much time in your room. Don't be put off by this, the hotel is clean, staff are friendly, food is great and beds are very comfortable, they even provide you with a pillow menu!!!The iron and ironing board were a godsend as my travel iron has seen better days and a digital safe is also included.If you are on your way to San Francisco, we hope you enjoy it as much as we did. It's truly a unique and wonderful city. ","annotations":[]}
