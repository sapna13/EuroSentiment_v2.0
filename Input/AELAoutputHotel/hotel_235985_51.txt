{"text":"We enjoyed the stay Stayed for 8 days (too long for Florence - overload of sights). Our room was large with a standard sized bathroom complete with bath and shower. Large twin beds with very firm mattresses and pillows. Linen sheets changed every day! Towels beautiful fluffy white and lots of them. Flat screen tv with BBC world and CNN together with italian and french channels. Breakfast good for Italy depends on needs - cereals, bread, yoghurts, fresh fruit (whole), cheeses ham crossants, fruit juices, fresh coffee and tea. Ver friendly and accommodating staff. Location very good for the station and fairly easy to reach all sights. Guide books run down the area as dubious but we did not find a problem. (the top graded hotel in tripadvisor is in a very depressing area).We had problems finding hotel so these directions may be helpful. Exit station at the east end of the concourse i.e platforms to the north, cross over the extreme north side of the bus station immediately adjacent train station and then cross main road via Val Fonda and carry on the in same direction (passed some blue busses in a mini bus station) along a back street via Bernardo Cennini (100 yds) unitil you reach a T junction with Via Faenza, turn right and the hotel is about 100 yds on the right. See previous reviews for suggested restaurants in area although an additional one would be Il Contadino on Via Paluzzulo 71r. Fixed price menu for lunch and dinner mainly locals - no written menu, the owner reads it out - 3 courses √à√\u2020√ü?0.50 total for two including wine and coffee √à√\u2020√ü?5 simply prepared but as good as other restaurants. For a break from Florence's constant traffic noise try Lucca for the day, walled city with plenty to look at with peace thrown in. Try Paris restaurant fixed price menu near the Palazzo Pfanner.
