{"text":"First Class Hotel, First Class Service We stayed at Island Shangri-la from 11\/17\/06 to 11\/21\/06 (Delux Habor View room) and the experience was phenomenon.Having a private car reserved (a service that is provided by the hotel for 730 HKD one way), we were greeted by an IS staff at the airport and directed to the waiting Mercedez and driver. We were then taken to the hotel (I should mention that water, towel and mints are provided in the car). Upon arrival, there were a guest relation staff and the luggage staff waiting for us. We were then taken directly to our room where a quick check in process (checking passport, getting credit card number...) and orientation were done.The room was very large with nice firm bed, all in one fax-printer-copier, hot tea, a bowl of fruit (the tea and fruit could be a special arrangement that I got from booking with whatahotel (a company that only book 5 star hotel around the world) and everything you can think of (bathrobe, slipper, needle and thread, flat screen TV, remote controlled curtain, plate, silverware, glass, tea, coffee...). The bathroom is incredibly beautiful and large with marble all around, a flat screen TV, nice size tub.The staff was extremely helpful and attentive. They went out of their way to show us places that we need to go and made reservation for us.The location was excellent, right on top of the Pacific Mall (with all brand names that you can think of) where the MTR station is.The breakfast at Too cafe is the best. By all mean, get the package that includes breakfast. Here you can find the freshest fruits, juices, traditional Chinese foods and Western breakfast.I do recommend to go to Lady's Market, not because of the Lady's Market itself but because of the endless stores (fashion, electronic...)and local restaurants around it. I do not care for the Temple Market.The Peak is definitely a must go and so is Stanley Market. About the Jumbo Floating restaurant, unless you are doing it with the cruise package for 640HKD, I don't think it is worth to eat there. Personally, I think the food was outrageously overpriced and service is very poor. It was quite an experience to ride the boat in Aberdeen to see the Fish village...Back to the hotel, I would definitely stay at IS again.
