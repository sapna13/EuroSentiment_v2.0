{"text":"Good standard in most ways This is a good standard, city centre hotel. The location is very convenient, in easy walking distance of all the main sights. The road outside is very busy and the neighbourhood is not lovely; this means that you may be unimpressed on your approach to the hotel. Once inside, however, there is a considerable improvement. The internal courtyard is most attractive, having a marble stairway, a water feature, glass lifts and subtle lighting. As other reviewers have commented, the sound-proofing is very effective and keeps out the bustle both from public areas and bedrooms.The bedrooms are very good, rather larger than in many city hotels and in a good state of repair. Ours was spotlessly clean and well furnished with very good beds. There was ample evidence of attention to detail.The restaurant is attractive but meals were only just satisfactory. Other visitors may have been more successful than we were but we did not find the quality of food anywhere in Madrid to be its strongest selling point. Judged against this standard, the Senator Grand Via was OK at breakfast and at dinner but it did not rise above this. The service was not well organised, for example, with guests waiting to be seated whilst many tables were left uncleared. There appeared to be a general lack of management in the restaurant.The pool referred to in the hotel literature seems permanently to be closed.Despite these reservations, however, our stay at the SGV was a pleasant experience and we would be happy to stay there again.
