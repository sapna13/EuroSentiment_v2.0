{"text":"Great rooms, normal amount of nickel  I stayed at this Westin every week for about six months, so I've time to develop (in my opinion) a fair and balanced opinion.Good: Rooms: Nice, updated rooms on Starwoods floors. If you can, ask for a room on the starwood guest floors. I've stayed on other floors and noticed many differences right away (size, furniture, etc.). Luckily, I snagged rooms (with a city view) on SW floors for the majority of my stays.Location (Business): Great for most business travelers- located right downtown on Pearl St, next to the Chase tower. Oh, and the attached ice skating rink (in the city center) is always a good time.OK: Staff: Staff is generally very polite, but over the months I stayed there, I had witnessed encounters between colleges and rude and\/or disinterested front desk staff. Concierge is usually very nice and fairly knowledgeable about the city.Gym: The gym has a number of treadmills as well as an eliptical, bike, stair climber, and weight machine. This a reebok branded gym, and is fairly solid compared to other SW hotels I've stayed at. As usual, be aware at it gets packed between 6 and 8am, so you may not get a machine anywhere near that time.Bad:Parking: $20\/night valet fee with no real alternatives. The queue can get quite backed up in the morning (15+ min with call ahead)This fee seems abnormally high for the city.Internet: $10\/day. For the nightly rate they charge, I feel that this should be included.Location (social): Not many restaurants in the near vicinity (walking distance). The city center itself closes around 4pm, so there are no food options there. Need to hop in a cab for a quick ride to the west village or deep ellum for large choice of restaurants and bars. If you're hungry, room service is the same as most hotels- average at best. A few places will deliver (ask the concierge for menus)Overall, this hotel does a fine job with comfort and hospitality. I've stayed in other hotels in the area and ended up picking this one for long term stays. Definitely recommended if you're a business traveler working in the downtown Dallas area.
