{"text":"Great for families with small kids -( NOT Royal Service review) We stayed at the Melia Caribe Tropical from Feb4 to Feb9 2007. I stayed there with my mother, my husband, and my toddlers (2 and 4). This was a fantastic vacationKIDS CLUB- They have three catergories 4 months to 4 years, 5 to 12, and a teenager club. I had both my children in the same room, 4 months to 4 years. The staff is nice, the room is very clean. I noticed many cribs in a separated room (monitored with Camera), a highchair, and an Avent sterilizer. There really isn't any program or activities for the kids, they basically play with the toys (car, kitchen, etc.), watch cartoons, or colors. Only on the first day they went to the playground for 5 minutes and that was it. I felt good about this because of all the water around the club I felt more confident having them confined in the club. I noticed that the next two groups were much more entertained. I am not sure if the staff of the baby club spoke good English because both my kids speak Spanish. In short, your kids are in good hands in that Baby Club.ROOM- I hadn't requested it but there were 3 beds and 1 crib in our room. We did request connecting room so that my mother (staying in a separate room) and ourselves could babysitt the kids while relaxing next door. We were told the rooms did connect but they didn't. As far as I know there are no connecting rooms at all in the regular hotel, but there are plenty in the Royal Service. We could have moved for an additional $1400 for the 2 rooms for the 5 days, which we didn't feel was worth it.The rooms are very clean, I noticed some paint coming of the wall, but I guess given the climatic conditions this is normal. The shower was a problem in both room, no matter how you positioned the curtain the water would be all over the floor. The pillows weren't great either. Besides that the rooms are great and spacious.RESTAURANTS - The food was very good to great, depending on the restaurant. There is just so much choice, it is overwelming. The food doesn't taste like we are used to it, but this is what happens when you travel abroad. We ate twice in the Restaurant a la Carte, the Mexican was average with great service whereas the Chinese was excellent with slow but friendly service. We usually preferred to eat at the buffet at night to be able to pace ourselves with the kids. Highchairs are available everywhere. It is true that a $2 tip will get you a long way.POOL \/ BEACH- the pools are great and clean. This seems like a huge hotel, however, we sometimes had a portion of the pool for ourselves. The beach is great and very clean. We have walked a lot on the beach and the Melia is definitely the place to be. Neighboring hotels have really nasty, overcrowded beaches. The best thing was that even at 11 AM you can find lounge chairs in the shade under a palapa, at the beach and the pool.GROUNDS- you do have to walk a lot and it feels great! You are on a vacation, relax and take it slowly. It is fantastic to walk in this hotel, the vegetation is beautiful, and so are the animals walking on it. It is very dangerous and slippery when wet though! We would leave the room around 9am, go have breakfast next to the beach and pool, have lunch there, and then go back to the room to get changed for diner. We were at the fresh aire from 9-6 everyday. Just fantastic.IN GENERAL- It is the perfect place for families with small kids. The check in is a rather slow process, but this is the carribbean way of life. At check-out, if you plan to have the bell boy come and pick up your luggage, call 15 minutes ahead.
