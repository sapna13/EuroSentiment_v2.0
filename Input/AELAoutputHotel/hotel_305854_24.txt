{"text":"Good Value Hotel My wife, 2 √à√¥√ú old son and I recently spend 2 weeks at the Harbour Plaza Metropolis during March 08 and found the hotel to be great.Check in was smooth and quick and we were in our room relaxing after our flight within 5 mins. We booked a partial harbour side room. The room is small as mentioned in previous posts but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ well designed\/modern and it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel small. It was big enough room for our son to play with his toys.We had breakfast included in our package. During our time there we had breakfast at the restaurant on ground floor (actually level 7) and up on level 20 in the Harbour Club Lounge. We were upgraded halfway through the trip. Breakfast was great at both locations. We found that on the ground floor there was more variety of food but Level 20 had the fabulous views of the harbour. Overall breakfast was excellent with quality food and the egg station chef was excellent. The hotel is attached to a shopping mall. The shopping mall is more catered for locals √à√\u2020\u2022?no big name brands here. He used the laundry service there; it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the first shop on your left as you enter the shopping mall. $32HK for up to 7ibs. There are several restaurants within the shopping mall that always looked busy but we never ate there. We did grab a quick bit at the food court on level 3 which was good and cheap. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ also attached via a small walk way to Hung Hom MTR which makes getting to China very easy. We caught the train from there to Shenzhen. The station has a McDonalds, star bucks and other small retail shops much better than the shopping mall.Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ let the hotels location be an issue for you as they offer a highly efficient and on time every 20 minute shuttle service to the Kowloon Hotel (on Nathan road). The shuttle takes 5 mins to get downtown which compensates for its location. Over all we found the Harbour Plaza Metropolis a good value hotel and recommend it to anyone. There service was excellent and friendly. We plan to be back next year and will book this hotel again.
