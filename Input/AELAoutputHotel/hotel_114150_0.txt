{"text":"Perfect Hotel We chose this hotel because of it's location. Being a stroll away from so much of Boston's highlights and a 1 minute walk from Faneuil Hall, we hoped it would suit all our needs, being a family of 5, for our 3 days in the city..It turned out to do that and more. The biggest unplanned part of the trip was the weather. The day after our arrival we had 8 inches of snow in half a day. We may not have been ready but the hotel was. From help-yourself hot apple cider in the reception area to several people outside helping open the doors and get you through the entrance, we felt so looked after. The reception was warm, welcoming and relaxed with a lovely 'library' feel. Breakfast was excellent as was the service.With all the snow the location really paid off. We were able to go out, shop, eat and be entertained within 3 blocks of the hotel. When we had adjusted we even went to the park with cheap toboggans bought locally. and took in a movie, being able to walk back to the hotel easily. We all agreed how relaxed we felt in the Millenium. As we left to go to the airport, without us asking, the receptionist even looked up our flight for us to see if it was delayed. The small negatives are few. The room wasn't enormous, (though it took us comfortably), the views aren't great, we looked out over the market, but for a city hotel it wasn't bad. And the restaurant downstairs was still undergoing refurbishment. However the temporary one on the 2nd floor was fine. None of these small points affected our stay one bit. Would definitely stay there again. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":382,"mention":"snow","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Snow_cream"],"startOffset":378}]}
