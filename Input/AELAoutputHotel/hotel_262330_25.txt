{"text":"Fantastic View!! The view was absolutely amazing from the 49th floor corner King Suite. The computers were down when we checked in which seems to be a problem quite a bit...could be all the construction next door at the World Trade Center though. The rooms were meticulously clean and the housekeepers know their jobs and are very efficient. You never see them, but your room is always clean and ready. The location is great - lots of nice, casual restaurants around. Got a great manicure\/pedicure around the corner and sushi. Walked up to Canal Street for shopping. The lobby is horrible with all the tourists coming in and using the bathroom. It could not possibly be any smaller and it is quite astonishing how poorly laid out it is. The front desk is helpful though and just ignore the bellman and take your own bags. It isn't worth it to hail one down when the elevators are so close and quick. The beds are really soft, but the pillows are too soft so had to ask for some foam ones. They came up pronto! The only problem was our family coming to visit - they were staying at another hotel and they would ring our room often and the phone never rang. Important as they were going to leave on a flight back to the UK that night so they were in the lobby for an hour waiting for us. We didn't even know they were early. Overall, worth every penny. Use the AAA rate!
