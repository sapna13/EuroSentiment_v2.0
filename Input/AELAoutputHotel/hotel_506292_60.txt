{"text":"How hotels should be! This hotel is absolutely fantastic - and I'm fairly hard to please!Obviously lots of attention has gone into the design of this hotel and the results are beautiful. From the rooms, to the pool, the restaurant, spa and general surroundings. It is very peaceful and felt empty (although we were told it was nearly full). They have created an extremely relaxing, spacious environment. We stayed in a terrace room (no. 32) for 4 nights in early Oct. It was simple with nice features such as the four posted bed, an outside terrace  small garden (where we sat in the evenings with a drink), and a huge bathroom with bath and outside shower. The decoration is simple and elegant from the marble floor to the very high thatched ceiling, in classic whites and neutral colours.The staff deserve a special mention. Lots of small touches which add up to a feeling that you are a valued guest. They remembered our names and greeted us each time we walked through reception. We were bought iced water regularly lying by the pool. We used the shuttle down to the town and back again every day - the drivers were friendly and we picked up some useful info on restaurants, shows etc (I agree with the previous reviewer who said it was too far to walk! With the free shuttle or taxi's at √ä√£¬¢1 a go - why walk?? If you want exercise head out to the rice paddies).If you are lucky enough to get a few nights in Ubud, stay at the Uma!
