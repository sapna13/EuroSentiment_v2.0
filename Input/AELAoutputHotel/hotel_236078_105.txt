{"text":"A very beautiful gem I decided to go to Amsterdam literally at the last minute, but still wanted to stay somewhere special. After looking online I saw this hotel and from the minute I saw the photos I knew I had to stay here and nowhere else would do.The owners truly went out of their way to help me secure the last room they had available, but oh, I could not believe how lovely the garden room was and I cannot begin to describe my joy when I was told it was reserved for me. A really big thank you to the most sweetest of hoteliers I have ever come across. Staying at this accomodation in particular was important to me, as I wanted to see specific museums and this hotel was in the middle of each one I wanted (and got) to see during my 24 hours in Amsterdam.The location was very peaceful, pretty, clean, very safe, away from all the hustle and bustle, but close enough to get to some eateries when you have no energy left to wander far.Even on the canal circular, the guides said the location of the hotel - 7 Bridges - was one of the best in Amsterdam.I would definitely stay here again and am now going to recommend this hotel to everybody I know, it is a real beautiful gem, spotlessly clean, and everywhere I looked within the en suite room, one by one everything caught my eye, from the furnishings to the look and glorious smell of fresh lilies.Compared to other hotels prices during high season and at extremely short notice for a single room, this hotel beats the lot, in every way. If you are feeling low or stressed believe me this hotel will change all that in an instant. ","annotations":[]}
