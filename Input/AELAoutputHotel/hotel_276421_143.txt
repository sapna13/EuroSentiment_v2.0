{"text":"July 10th - 24th Nice place - but be careful with the food! Reception: On arrival, after a 14 hour journey (door to door) all you want to do is, book in, dump your stuff and jump in the pool. Well throughout the two weeks we were there we tried to avoid reception as they were a joke. 45 mins waiting to book in! 45 mins to get a hotel safe key!. They just seemed to ignore you! ask what you want and then go and serve someone else√à√\u2020\u2022?enough said!!The room:We were in the Villas, room 1109. The rooms were OK. The bath had seen better days (rusty) but we only showered so it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother us too much. It was clean, no bugs and the air con worked. The walk to the beech was nice and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ take to long, the grounds are well maintained and very pleasant. The villas were located near the best pool, the Margareta Bar, El Capitan√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Bar and the themed restaurants.The buffet restaurants:Well, what can I say! My wife and I were both sick after the first week and are still ill now!! (nearly two weeks later). My son fortunately stuck to chips, pancakes and pineapple for the two weeks although he did get an ear infection! The food was constantly covered in flies and the birds may as well have there own table √à¬£¬∂? Nearly everyone we spoke to had suffered one way or another. My wife and I were very selective about what we ait and were aware of the hygiene risks but we still got ill √à√\u2020\u2022?so be very careful!! The menu was quite repetitive. The most enjoyable meals were at the beech bar where the burgers are cooked in front of you. My son had these every day and did not get ill. The themed restaurants:We had to book these 4 days in advance!! (A lot of people must have booked and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ turn up as they always seemed to be empty when we were there) Not really fair if your only there for a long weekend like many of the Americans. Mexican and Japanese were OK but didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like the Caribbean as I think this is where I might have got my bug!!Excursions:Booked Saona Island with Airtours rep Felix, was a great day out and what a beautiful Island! Highly recommended!! Booked Speed boats and snorkelling with Seaworld on the beech (in front of stalls) with Dominguez. We went twice it was that good! thanks to Nelson and Miguel. Paid $40 per person. When I told Felix √à√\u2020\u2022?he went ballistic, I then had a standing argument with him as he wanted me to book with him @ $68 per person. What a nerve, what a knob!! Shop around there are some good deals. Also paid $95 to swim with Dolphins. It was OK you get about 20 mins in a group of about 20 (I think it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a lot dearer in Florida). Went Marlin fishing √à√\u2020\u2022?Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go if you get sea sick!!The Beech:Beautiful, probably a bit too much going on but still very nice.Nationalities:I know you get good and bad everywhere but some French nationals really let the side down. No consideration or respect of others in and around the pool and why is it only the French have to smoke in the pool and smoke at the buffet bar when getting there food!! Would I go again?I had a great time, like everyone else, its what you make it. But I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stay at this hotel. Pay the extra and stay at a hotel where you can eat safely and not get ill! The Dominican is nice and so are the people.
