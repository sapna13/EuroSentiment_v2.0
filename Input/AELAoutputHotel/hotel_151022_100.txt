{"text":"Natura Park ok for the price First of all before I start, remember this is mine and my families opinion and I am sure there can be many objectives depending on your time of stay!Check in was fast and easy, we had to wait about an hour for our room, so we just went to the buffet to eat!Our room was fine, we had a beautiful garden view, we were in building 4 on the 2nd floor, Right outside our room there were ducks and geese and flamingos.. The previous comment about the hairdryer was on target, it is soooooo old and almost useless, so if you have thick hair you better bring your own... The maid did a lovely job everyday, we left her $3 everyday and left little notes that we needed more water or lotion and she did everything asked of her! The grounds were very pretty, the pool was nice, the beach was a little small widthwise, and yes when we were there if you didn't get up early everyday you were not getting a beach chair ,poolside or beach! Food----the buffet blah~ ya know its like eatin at Ryans everyday, but your not gonna starve! The Specialty restaurants were very good, at the steakhouse we all had Ribeyes, we ordered them medium, but they were well done, At the Seafood I had Shrimp Linguine and it also was very good, at the other one, I had Stuffed chicken which was very average,! In the specialty restaurants, we were there total about 2 hours in each one, very slow service. The Buffet the service was almost non-existent, good luck getting a drink. Even at the bar, if you sat at a table, you were gonna wait a while before someone came and got your order!Xtras-----Shopping~ 99.9% of our shopping was done in the gift shop and it was very reasonably prices,There is a small market up the road, which you will go by on your way to the hotel, we didn't make it there, but I wish we would have. We stayed in Punta Cana a couple years ago and visited this really cool Beach Flea Market called El Cortesito and I thought maybe we wouldn't be too far from it, but I was wrong, if you leave the resort by beach take a left and it is about a 4.5 mile walk... If you take a left on the beach and walk about 1.5-2 miles up to the point, that is where you can find some cool shells and coral.Apple offers a shopping trip into town for $25, if you want lunch also it was like $45 or $50, don't do it, the hotel offers a shuttle to the same shopping place like every 2 hours, it was called Palma Real and it was very,very expensive... They did have a Hard Rock Cafe and a Tony Romas Ribs..There is a mini bar in the room, which was nice, but you got 2 beers 4 soft drinks,(ours never had more than 2 pops in in at one time) there was a lot of other stuff in there but you had to pay for it, my mom accidently drank a can of juice and she paid $4.00 for it! She didn't follow instructions! haOverall, I doubt we would visit Punta Cana again, I would love to go to La Romana, I have heard wonderful reviews, I would love to ck out Jamaica or go back to the Riveria Maya! Hope this helps!also we went for $869.99 +tax+insurance!
