{"text":"Solid hotel for quick visit This is a solid but not spectacular hotel. The best thing about this hotel is the location. When people say it is across from the train station next to the green dome, they mean directly across the grand canal from the train station. I forgot my watch and looked out the window at the train station clock for the time. When leaving by train, just walk across the bridge, no hassle worrying about being late for the train. If getting in by bus it is a block or two walk so if your luggage has wheels, no problem. I went to the right instead of straight and to the left where the bus dropped us off and went to the side canal which is pretty big and thought it was the grand canal. Just asked where the train station was and got pointed in the right direction. If staying for a long time, there are better hotels in quieter areas on side canals. There are no real balconies where you can hang out and watch the grand canal and the windows are just a little too high to get a good view. Breakfast is plain, don't think of it as a big meal.. just enough to get you to lunch. The staff is very nice. They will only recommend two restaurants and the one in back which is accessed on the alley is cheaper and I thought it was better than the more expensive one by the first bridge which is a step up in class but harder to find. They were just puttin up their website and it wasn't in English yet but should be ready by now. If you book directly with them they will give you a better deal if you upgrade your room. The room they booked for us was too small and we upgraded to a bigger room with a canal view. If anyone makes a suggestion they try and implement it. Someone wanted internet access so they put a laptop by the front desk you can use free of charge to access your email. There are better hotels, but if you only have a few days, the location and clealiness make this a solid choice. It takes you a day to figure out the vaporeto schedule, but they start the line a block away by the bus stop so walk down there and you always get a good seat, often in the front or back rather than inside. Avoid the #1, take the #86 whenever possible and don't worry, almost every one stops at the train station to get back if you don't want to walk. As you are at the far end of town, it makes you get out and travel. We walked from here to St. Marks but only one way and takes awile. Get off at the Rialto bridge which is the most crowded stop and walk to St. Marks. Safe at night so we went there every day and night and usually got back midnight to 1am and the desk clerk didn't mind. Posting an arrow above streets telling you how to get to major areas is a big plus, I wish they did that in Rome. You never feel you are lost and always felt safe even walking around after midnight.
