{"text":"Good deal for the price We booked our stay through Expedia and got a great deal on our stay. We read the reviews at TripAdvisor and felt confident we would be satisfied with the quality of the hotel.We stayed on the 8th floor. The view from our room was of the backside of the bldg (no ocean view) but we didn't mind because we didn't spend a lot of time at the hotel. The room had recently been updated and was nicely decorated. The fridge and microwave were nice. It even came with plates  utensils (although one of the utensil sets was missing). We only wish it had a sink other than the one in the bathroom. The pool was very small, but who goes to Hawaii to spend time at the pool when the ocean is just blocks away. The Exercise room was decent, we used it twice. We never visited the spa.Our one major complaint -- The hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ website claimed to have services that we never received or witnessed others receiving:√à√\u2020\u2022?Welcome Oshibori (cool towel) upon arrival at check-in -- We did not receive this at check-in, they did give us beach towels though.√à√\u2020\u2022?Complimentary Continental Breakfast delivered daily to your room or to-go bag for added convenience -- We had to go to the lobby for the breakfast and it was difficult to find seating. The continental breakfast was lacking, just juice, muffins  fruit (banana, orange or apple √à√\u2020\u2022?no tropical fruit like you would expect). √à√\u2020\u2022?Complimentary Coffee  Tea Service in the Lobby 7:30am-Noon -- We never saw it. We don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ drink tea or coffee, so it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ affect us, but did hear some complaints. In fact we saw people paying $2 for a cup of coffee out of a machine at breakfast. (there is a coffee-maker  cofee packets in the room).√à√\u2020\u2022?Daily turndown service with orchid on departure night -- We received the daily turn-down service, but never got the orchid.We also thought the parking fee of $15 was pricey considering the parking garage was hard to access even in our small sports car (we still can't figure out how the SUV's managed the tight corners) and condition of the garage itself.The maids were very helpful and left out room in excellent condition.The price, the quality of the room and the good maid service made up for what was lacking in other areas. Overall it was a good deal for the money.
