{"text":"A Fantastic Resort and Island Let me start of by saying if you travel to the El Con you will have a wonderful vacation. Pleas do not believe all the negative hype on the site. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ just not true. We recently returned from an 8 night stay at the resort and found that it met or exceeded our expectations. We had a party of 7 (4 adults, 3 children ages 10, 13 and 14). We are from NJ and CT and have traveled to many locals with and with our children over the years. We can be picky but I must say everyone had an enjoyable time. Here's the deal-We arrived at the resort Tuesday July 25th. We rented a minivan which I would suggest doing. It gave us the freedom to explore and go off the resort to local restaurants for dinner. The hotel shuttle is about $66 R\/T per person. Our two families split the rental which came to about $250 per family and we had use of a car all week long. They do charge daily for parking but I suggest when you depart you ask for some of that to be removed from the bill. We waited for our car from valet one night for about 45min. We mentioned that before we checked out and were only charged 3 nights for parking. The staff is very accommodating but you'll have to put in a little time and effort to get exactly what you want\/except. Check-in was somewhat slow. The rooms we had been promised were booked (In the Las Brisas bldg). Apparently there was a large wedding taking place over the weekend and the entire building had been reserved. They put us in the Vista wing of the hotel overlooking the pool with a spectacular ocean view. These rooms were a bit smaller than what we had reserved. The told us they could move us on Thursday to a newer building adjacent to the vistas. This building had larger rooms (King bed with pull-out couch) and had 6 floors instead of 4 and a balcony. They put us on the 6th floor. I suggest this part of the resort or Las Brisas when traveling with kids. The resort is large and you will be in a central locale to all the resort has to offer. The rooms we were in were not falling apart. They were very clean; beds were comfortable and not really outdated. The bathroom was quite large and in great shape. AC worked well too. The resort has many restaurants. The prices tend to be somewhat expensive but no more than you would pay at any other resort. I must say that we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have one bad meal at the resort. The food was very good. You can do a casual meal outside on the patio overlooking the pool or a more formal one at Stingrays or Blossoms. Do yourself a favor. Get some food for the room like bagels, cereal etc if you want to save a bit of money. The room has a coffee machine. We also bought some rum and beer on hand to make drinks. The only issue I has was paying $5.50 for a bottle of beer. Go to the local supermarket and get a Styrofoam cooler for $2.00 and fill it up. Rooms also have small refrigerators too. The pools were clean and refreshing. There are 3 pools and a waterslide on the main level. I would also suggest going over to Las Casitas to swim in the infinity pool. Although it states that only guests of the Casitas can utilize the pool, we went several times and were handed towels from the staff. No one will bother you. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a beautiful pool with a magnificent view. Palomino Island was also a favorite among our group. Taking the boat ride to the island is fun and enjoyable. Once you arrive on the beautiful island, everything you need is there. Food, drinks, lounge chairs, towels, snorkeling gear, jet skis etc etc. The beach is a bit rocky when entering the water but once you get into the beautiful Caribbean, you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l forget all about it. The resort is going through a $95 million renovation. I will admit it does need some TLC here and there but you will not get the spectacular views, beautiful beaches and above average accommodations at another resort in Puerto Rico. We all enjoyed our vacation and all agreed it was well worth the money spent. PS- Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ miss out on the Bio Bay tour, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ so close to the hotel. Ask the concierge to give you the info for Island tours. Ask for Havier. It was a FANTASTIC experience ","annotations":[{"endOffset":162,"mention":"hype","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hype_Energy"],"startOffset":158},{"endOffset":2594,"mention":"bagels","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bagel"],"startOffset":2588},{"endOffset":2664,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2658},{"endOffset":2845,"mention":"cooler","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cactus_Cooler"],"startOffset":2839}]}
