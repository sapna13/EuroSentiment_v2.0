{"text":"Nice Hotel - good location in Hollywood We stayed at this hotel for two nights having arrived into LAX before driving off to Scottsdale. As we'd never visited LA I read a lot of reviews of what district to stay in as well as which hotel. In the end, following reviews of this property here we booked club level rooms at the Rennaissance Hollywood.Firstly I would say Hollywood is a pretty good place to base yourself for a first time visit to LA. It pretty is what LA is all about - we did the bus tour, a limo tour of star's homes and the Madame Taussads and Guiness World of Records attractions, which are right on the doorstep of this hotel. So it is very well placed.Self parking was $10 a day in the big parking next door - where there were also loads of shops and a cinema. The check-in staff were very polite and helpful.Room itself was pretty good - quite small for a 'suite' - once a single fold out bed was up there wasn't a lot of room. Also the door to the bathroom opened outward which was unusual, and automatically closed which the kids didn't like. The blind which covered the window was a bit tatty but still worked well to shut out the morning sunlight. Beds were very comfortable thoughThe club lounge was good - with good snacks in the evening and a very good breakfast. Not too busy either. There was one member of staff in there but he didn't 'interact' with anyone, just sat watching his PC screen.I was talked into booking a stretch limo by the concierge to see the 'homes of the stars'. This was a rip off however (Topline I think it was). The driver wasn't that interested - we didn't see half the houses mentioned on the blurb and we finished 30 minutes early! When you're paying that sort of money you expect better. I fed this back to the concierge who took my details and said he'd be in touch although he never has.Overall I mentioned some of the negative points but our overwhelming impression was of a lovely hotel with pleasant staff in a superb Hollywood location. Would I go back? Absolutely!
