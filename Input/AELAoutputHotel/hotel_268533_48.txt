{"text":"Loved the jacuzzi We have just come back from our journey in California. The Argonaut was the last hotel we stayed in, the last but certainly not the least. We were 3 in our party: my husband, me and my 22 yrs old daughter, so we had reserved the King suite. When we saw it we were almost open mouthed because it was very, very spacious and full of amenities such as a very large living room with separate closet for the safe, a table with a vase of orchids and a chocolate box on it, a large sofa bed etc. There were 2 minifridges and 2 tv sets, one in each room. The windows had a view on the SF bay and Alcatraz. The bathroom was almost a wonderful dream come true: it had a huge jacuzzi with annexed window and view on the bay! We were on the 3rd floor and, as concerns the noise many people mentioned in other reviews, I must say that we were either very lucky or we enjoyed a very sound sleep, because we heard none. The service was good and efficient too.At the front desk I must say they were a bit impersonal, I mean they didn't have the overfriendly attitude we had experienced in other hotels, but...who cares? At the restaurant The Blue Mermaid we had dinner only once : it was a saturday night and it was overcrowded. The service was so slow that eventually we were angry and hungry, so we complained. They were very apologetic, said it had entirely been their fault and refused us to pay the check; we obviously insisted to pay what was due, but...no way. Such an attitude requires peace and forgiveness, so let them be forgiven! I will give them another chance when I'll come back to the Argonaut during my next stay in SF.
