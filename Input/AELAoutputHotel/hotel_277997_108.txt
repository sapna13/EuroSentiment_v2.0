{"text":"Tapatio Cliffs Wonderful! Everyone of the staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly. Easy check in and check out. I was looking for a true suite, not just a room divided by a half wall, which gives no privacy. This Hilton knew how to do it right. There were 3 rooms, divided by doors for privacy, which is great when traveling with children or snorers (we had both). We entered the living room, which had a couch bed. The next room had a vanity on one side and behind closed doors on the other side were the toilet and bathtub. We continued on to a large bedroom with a balcony. The beds were super comfortable. We asked Room Service for additional towels, lotions, etc., and it was no problem at all.The casual Mexican Restaurant on property was very good and the cheaper of the more upscale restaurants (I forget the name) had a beautiful fireplace and a good meal. The drinks, however, were not the best, on the night we went.The only downside to staying at the Tapatio Cliffs is that it is all by itself. Not close to shopping, museums, etc. So it is perfect for a quiet getaway but if you want to do more, it's best to rent a car. We used their towncar service one night (rates slightly higher than a cab) and although it was cozy -- Super expensive. The hotel does provide a shuttle for $9.00 to the closest (upscale) mall but it is on a schedule i.e.; leave hotel at 11:30 a.m., return at 3:15 p.m. They also provide shuttle service onsite to your rooms and their restaurants (which came in handy in 30 degree temperatures at night). Just be prepared to tip.All in all, it lived up to the Hilton name. We were extremely happy with our room. It was my first time in Phoenix in the winter and even though outside it was freezing, the central heat worked great and we were not cold inside. ","annotations":[]}
