{"text":"Great New Years Eve At Bahia Prinicipe!! Travelled to Gran Bahia Principe Dec 27- Jan 3, 2008. Had been there previously February 2007. This time we brought our three daughters 20,17,9. It was a great time to travel with the family, and I could see that there were many people who felt the same way. The hotel was decorated nicely for the Christmas holidays. New Years Eve had a special menu- and it was awesome. Party included a dance show and fireworks. The hotel had hats and noise makers for all. The disco was quite busy that night. I had requested ajoining rooms, as I was incontact with Albania Batista by email prior to arrival, and this was granted. As we were returning guests, there were T-shirts, rum and fruit baskets awaiting our arrival. As previously, the grounds were beautiful, the staff friendly, hotel clean and well kept. The only beef I have is that booking the ala carte restaurants the seating times were either nonexistent or very late. We booked as soon as we arrived!! Two seatings were for 9:45 pm. Who eats that late??I spoke with the guest services manager and he assured us he would change things, but never heard back. Both times we arrived at the restaurants at about 7:oo pm and asked if there was a possibility of being seated earlier, and both times they took as right away!! The restaurants were not booked to capacity, so I don't know why it couldn't have been booked that way to begin with. I started to wonder if the people staying in the Ambar section had priority bookings for the restaurants. Regardless, of that, the ala cartes were enjoyed by all, the buffet restaurant- not so much. Quantity not quality at buffet. I would still return again, however, not for a while, time to try something new.. Punta Cana is a fabulous destination, wonderful people and lovely beach.
