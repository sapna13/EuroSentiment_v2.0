{"text":"Can't wait to go back! A great location, great rooms, great restaurant - What more could you ask for? The staff was very friendly and helpful although we did have one problem. They were supposed to provide a rollaway bed but did not. House keeping and the first front desk contact were of no help - they said they didn't have any left.Their attitude was basically the extra person could sleep on the floor. After we insistied this wasn't an option, the front desk got some one with authority. There were no rollaways available so we got upgraded to a suite.Normally this type of experience would really sour me on a place but everything else was so good and all other staff contacts were so positive I just have to write the one incident off as a fluke. We had a 6 day stay so I feel we got a good picture of the overall operation. My wife and I always try to go to the top restaurants in cities that we visit. We saved the hotel restaurant -Cafe 15 - to our next to last night. We had unwittingly saved the best for last!.The young woman who served as the greeter was terrific as were all the servers. Very friendly, knowledgable, and accomodating wait staff. Wonderful decor and GREAT food!!.It was so good we cancelled reservations at a top restaurant for our last night and went back. We weren't very hungry so we just ordered dessert and wine\/coffee. We were still treated like royalty!I stongly recommend this hotel and the Cafe 15! ","annotations":[]}
