{"text":"Lovely hotel at a fabulous location We booked this hotel for our 2-day 3-nights weekend vacation in San Francisco after reading many positive reviews of it. And, we are extremely happy that we did it. First, the location of the hotel is as good as it gets. There is a shuttle bus running around the clock door-to-door from the airport to the hotel. The cable cars run right outside of the hotel, so we could hop on one randomly as we walk. Although we were strangers to the city, we found it absolutely painless to do our visits using public transportations because everything is nearby. We took BART to Berkeley and used MUNI around the city. We also found ourselves right in the center of a shopping and restaurant haven. We were able to find vegetarian or vegetarian-friendly places with fabulous food (such as Asia SF, Golden Era, both of which are highly ranked on TripAdvisor) all within walking distance. And, we were thrilled to find that even China Town was only 3 blocks away. We made a pretty aggressive to-do list for the trip, and we were surprisingly happy to see that we got to do them all, because we didn't lose any time on transportation. Second, like a lot of others said, although the room is small, it is clean, lovely, and extremely quiet. At the end of the day, nothing beats a peaceful good sleep. Overall, we feel it's really worth every penny we paid, and we definitely will book it again when we visit San Francisco again ","annotations":[{"endOffset":612,"mention":"Berkeley","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Berkeley"],"startOffset":604},{"endOffset":612,"mention":"Berkeley","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Berkeley"],"startOffset":604},{"endOffset":612,"mention":"Berkeley","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Berkeley"],"startOffset":604},{"endOffset":612,"mention":"Berkeley","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Berkeley"],"startOffset":604}]}
