{"text":"Great Location Great Hotel My wife and I have just completed a trip around the world staying at a variety of hotels, some bad, some good. We both rated this hotel very highly. The reception staff are kept very busy with the high volume of tours which come through but they still treated us with warmth and a smile. The concierge, Rhoda, was particularly helpful, as was their comically dressed bellboy, who was great at whistling down cabs and providing directions. If you are staying at this hotel try and get onto the 5th floor. This is the floor with the business centre. We stayed in room 506 which was large, clean and very well equipped with everything expected from a quality hotel. The king sized bed was also fantastic. We did not have any meals at the hotel as it is located very close to Walgreens supermarket. We saved lots of money buying fresh fruit and groceries from this store. The room also had a microwave oven which came in handy heating up a few TV meals. The coffee making machine was also a nice touch, especially for my wife! Fishermans Wharf is a great place to stay. Even though it is very touristy, its where the action is and there is lots of cheap clothing and characterful shop assistants. San Francisco is a superb city. For a fun filled day, if you have the energy catch a cab to Haight Ashbury, walk from Masonic down Haight St and check out all the great shops and survivors of the hippy and punk eras. Keep walking through Golden Gate Park ( about a 2 hour walk) visit the attractions and get right down to the Pacific Ocean. Just keep heading west towards the sun. There is a great hotel just to the left here. Have a few wines or beers and catch a cab home. What a day!
