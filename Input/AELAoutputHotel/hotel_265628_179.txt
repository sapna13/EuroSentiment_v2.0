{"text":"PARADISE!!! Simply put, INCREDIBLE! We booked this trip not really knowing what to expect...we saw an arial shot of the whole resort, heard about its ammenities and activities, and figured we'd go ahead with it. My jaw dropped as soon as our bus began to pull into the long stretch of drive way, passing cute little shops and beautiful landscaping, pink flamingos and finally, the resort. This place was beyond every expectation I could have ever had!! This resort has got to be one of the most beutiful places I have ever stayed at. The extremely friendly staff and lively entertainment crew, the FABULOUS food (tip, stick to the buffet and maybe give the steak house restaurant a shot, but otherwise, BUFFET ALL THE WAY), the wonderful activities, the spotless cleanliness, the beautiful landscaping and surroundings....the list goes on and on....This is however mostly a family resort and a getaway for couples, so if you're looking for rowdy fun, this is definitly not the place...but if you're looking to be surrounded in a paradise of a resort, being serviced by the most lively and friendliest people, to eat some fabulous dishes, to endulge in fun silly daily activities or simply enjoy the comany of some newly-met friends at the EXCELLENT swim-up bar, then this is it! I would DEFINILTY go here again and i HIGHLY recommend it to all!The one and only negative thing I can say is that the beds aren't too comfy to sleep in and the casino really isn't much to brag about (at all)....basically not a huge nightlife...the disco is fun, but not crazy or anything...and other than that, there's not really too much to do otherwise....ALL in ALL, FABULOUS!!!
