{"text":"Pretty good, not a 5 star though Our family of 4- kids aged 10 and 6 were at the Bavaro Princess from Feb. 14-21. The resort was 100% full and you could tell at the buffets and pool area. We did not get the platinum upgrade because it was $30 per day per person, which I did not see worth it.The bavaro princess was a nice resort, beautiful grounds, birds, ponds, and the most beautiful big beach we have been to. The ocean here was great for the kids to play in, not too rough but still some waves for fun. The food was pretty good, buffets were good, but not a huge variety. Kids ate fries alot. There were 2 buffets one at the lobby and one by the beach. The beach buffet was open for breakfast and lunch and is quite small. It gets very busy at lunch so we went to the lobby a couple times as there were no tables. They have a pasta station for lunch and dinner everyday, and also will cook pork chops, hamburgers, hot dogs. We ate at all the a la carte restaurants except the asain. I would recommend booking these, cause the buffet is pretty boring 3 times a day. We enjoyed each of the restaurants. You have to book the a la cartes. You can only book 2 days ahead, which meant you have to go to the lobby every morning to reserve. I was dissapointed that there was not more at the beach McPrincess beach snack place-only burgers, hot dogs and fries. There was nothing in between meals besides this and after supper, there were no snacks at all. We really like the beer here, except the one in the mini fridge. El Presidente is a very good beer. Premium club people got MGD in bottles. The rest of the drinks for the common folk were poor. Bottom shelf liquor, no canadian rye unless you were premium. Pina Colodas and other slushy drinks came out of a slushy machine and I did not care for them. Rooms were good. They supplied us with 2 cots for the kids which was nice. The room has a king bed up top and a living area on the bottom. Very large rooms and a nice sitting area to play cards. Also a patio outside was nice. There is a lot of walking here as it is a large resort. We did not mind as it was so beautiful with large trees and flowers. There is also a train that comes around if you get lazy. Kids club is pretty good, not too many kids go. Mine went a couple times. They played tennis, water polo, some archery, and then played at the kids center. There was also a show one evening that the kids participated in, which was fun. About 10 kids on average at the club. It runs from 10 am to 12:30 and then from 3pm to 5pm. One note, we tried to get money out of a atm machine and it did not work! We have a td card, so make sure you have a backup. Some of the tours do not take credit cards. Lots of Europeans here, which means there is a lot of topless women. If you will be uncomfortable with that, I would advise to pick a differnt spot. It seems that this is common in Punta Cana as they would even walk down the beach topless. My husband didn't mind, but it did make it a little awkward with small kids. We travelled with Air Canada Vacations and as I always say, I will not go anywhere with them again. We had a 7 hour flight from Edmonton and the plane had the old style tv screens. My kids could not see the movies. Some of the headsets didn't work and all they gave for food was a dried up sub and one chocolate bar. Very poor service and unfriendly stewards. All in all we had a great time and didn't let any small things bother us. Just be aware that you cannot compare 5 stars to other 5 stars. If I were to rate out of 10, I would give this a 6. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
