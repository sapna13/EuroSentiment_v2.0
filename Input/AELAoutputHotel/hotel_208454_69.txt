{"text":"Central Location As Sofitel priviledge members we always stay at Sofitel Hotels where possible and the reviews on TripAdvisor for the New York Hotel were very good so we booked in for four nights.Central location and friendly staff on arrival, we were not upgraded as there were no rooms available and our room was on the 15th floor but with views over the back of buildings and fire stairs on New York, not what we had requested. The room was a standard size but we had requested a Queen size bed and it was a double. The bathroom was a good size and had all the necessities. The next morning we went down to the front desk to see if we could get our upgrade or at least a room with a better view of New York and a Queen Size bed. Apparently in New York Queen size beds are what we in Australia call double, so remember this and book your bed accordingly. We were moved to a room on the 19th floor with a better view, same size bed and so we settled for the rest of our stay. Like all Sofitels complimentary water provided each afternoon\/early evening and also free internet (with a printer) again appreciated.The staff were very friendly, in particular the wonderful concergie and also William the doorman who organised a great town car to take us to the airport and who was always interested in how our days had been . The bar was nice and overall a good stay.Great little bar across the road fron the hotel - cant recall the name but good pasta and buffalo wings, you turn left as if going to fifth Street and its across the road. Also their is a post office across the road in an office building which is very close, ask William for instructions.. Also took the advice of other TripAdvisers and had breakfast each day at the little red dinner down the road, great breakfasts, good service and reasonable prices.
