{"text":"Wonderful Staff I stayed here for 2 nights on the club level. The staff here were awesome! After the first meeting they knew your name. Very warm and inviting.The public areas of the hotel are very sleek and borderline stark. Elevators were quick. Payphones are on the level with the meeting rooms. Pool looked nice but it was very smokey due to the fires so I did not linger outside anymore then I had too.Club: nice selection of breakfast and lunch items. Very helpful. request for a later check out was accomodated. Very comfortable. 2 computers available for you to use. Nice selection of evening drinks.Room: Great sized. Great Bathroom. No name amenities are being replaced with Bvlgari. Nice robes. Great views. bed was comfortable. Plenty of hangers. Good desk with small office supplies in the drawer. Asked for a transformer that was delivered straight away. Paper delivered each morning. Slippers and shoe shine sponge in the closet along with a small safe, shopping bag, and umbrella. Maid left a key in the slot for me so I did not have to put mine in everytime I came back to get the power working. Not so good: Internet. Could not get the wireless to work. The broadband did work at S$30.00 a day. Only 1 packet of instant regular coffee per day for the kettle plus 1 pack of decaf and some tea. You need to walk through 3 malls to get to the MRT. There is some constuction noise from the MRT station being built across the street. There is a complementary shuttle from the mall next door to Tangs that leaves around :45 after the hour. Taxi's are reasonable. The hotel is a little removed but it is a quick trip to just about anything. Buffet Breakfast had a good selection. I would stay here again.
