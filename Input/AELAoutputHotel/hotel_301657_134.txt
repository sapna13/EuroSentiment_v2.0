{"text":"Quality hotel with great service As per some other reviewers, we were on honeymoon and the Park Hotel was our first stop. Interesting location known as Shiodome- an area reclaimed from marshland and now a modern scyscraper business area but very close to the main train lines and within walking distance of some of the big shopping areas such as Ginza.The hotel occupies the 25th to 34th floor of the building it shares with Kyoto News. Service could not be better. Anything we needed help with (i.e directions on arrival) they were only too pleased to do. We arranged to meet a friend for dinner one evening and when we asked at reception about getting there via taxi, they printed out a Japanese map with the exact location of our restaurant. Rooms were excellent and super clean. It is worth upgrading to the Premium Rooms as the views are spectacular especially at night.We arrived very early off a flight from Singapore and they checked us in straight away.Also, it is wirth getting the breakfast in the hotel as it is a buffet and can really get you up and running for the day! There is a choice of western or traditionalFinally, from here you can walk to Shinbashi station which is on the JR line and pretty much services the entire of Tokyo. If you have a JR (Japanse Rail) Pass, you really get your money's worth. Get your head around the transport system early in your trip and Tokyo just opens up to the visitor!I will atach a shot with the view from the room when I get round to doing downloads!
