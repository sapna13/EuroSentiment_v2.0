{"text":"Good if you need to be close to the airport We stayed one night in November so that we could be close to the airport for an early morning flight.The staff at reception are wonderful. Very helpful, professional and accomodating. The room itself was OK, no major complaints, but a standard hotel room with reasonably good quality fittings. For our purposes for one night it was completely fine.The food in the hotel is a bit substandard. The menu didn't offer a great variety of choices and it seems the preferred option is the buffet, but if you are pregnant (like myself) then buffets aren't great. The food was overly expensive for what it was and the service at the restaurant was a little below expectation - when travelling with a child and giving a childrens menu it usually helps to advise if any of the listed options are not available PRIOR to leaving the menu. Of course our 3 year old was set on having pizza only to be told that they couldn't do it. This is not a big issue in itself but anyone who knows what it's like to manage the expectations of a tired 3 year old will know what I'm talking about!!Anyway my only other complaint was that the sheets were so OVERLY starched that they made a huge noise every time we moved in bed. This probably sounds bizarre but I've never come across this before and I spent the whole night trying not to move so that I didn't wake up my husband or daughter!!We got an excellent deal for the room on Wotif.com so for what we paid it was perfect. The location next to the airport was great and within easy reach for the shuttle bus which took literally a few mintues to get to the airport. The noise from the train and the airport was actually very minimal and our 3 yr old was very entertained by watching the planes landing and taking off.All in all if you need to stay next the airport this is an excellent option, just don't eat at the hotel and make sure you shop around for the price!
