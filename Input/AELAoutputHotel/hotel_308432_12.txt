{"text":"Pleasantly surprised My family and I have just returned from 6 nights at the Gold Coast Hotel Hong Kong. It was planned as an extended stop over to break up the long journey from Heathrow to Sydney.We had pre-booked (500HK$) a Mercedes Limo from Hong Kong Airport to the hotel, on arriving at the arrivals hall a smartly dressed man was waiting for us clearly displaying a board with our name. He promptly showed us to the Limo and we were taken directly to the hotel. The hotel is a 25 minute journey from Hong Kong Airport.The lobby of the hotel is very impressive, polished marble everywhere and very clean. We checked in, and our luggage was taken to our room. The room was clean and bright and had a lovely balcony over looking the sea and marina. There were 2 double beds, however were not the standard size and were a bit small. The most comfortable way of sleeping was if my wife and I slept with one of our children rather than together.The hotel has a beautiful lagoon style pool area and very well established fauna. There are cabana√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ available if you need to get out of the heat of the sun, however there is plenty of palm trees for natural shade. Lying by the pool you could be in any tropical country it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ absolutely gorgeous. There are two water slides, that can keep children occupied.The hotel has direct access to the beach; however the beach is used more by the locals than hotel residents. The beach was clean, had a shark net and life guard, however the sea did not look too appetising.Logistically the hotel does seem to be a little way out of Hong Kong; however there is a hotel bus that leaves either end [Hotel to HK √à√\u2020\u2022?HK to Hotel] on the hour, the last bus back from HK is at 11pm; the journey time is about 30 √à√\u2020\u2022?40 minutes depending on time of travel. The hotel offers an extensive buffet breakfast and dinner. Or you can opt for the short walk the Gold Coast Mall, sounds rather grand however is made up of a number of restaurants, 7even11, and a MacDonald√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ all reasonably priced.
