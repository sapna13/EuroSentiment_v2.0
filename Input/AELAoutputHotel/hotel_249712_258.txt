{"text":"very good hotel in central location Stayed for three nights during a weekend paying a very good rate through priceline. Got a room on the lower floors which was of good size compared to NYC standards.Very clean  modern, everything was in perfect order. I was especially amazed that the room was very quiet, heard hardly any noise neither from outside or from other rooms or the hallway.Coffee maker with starbucks provided, mini-bar is pricey.Location is perfect, almost on Times Square. Subways, eating options etc within walking distance. Check-inn staff  concierge very efficient. There is a small business center. Internet fee is 9,95$. Housekeeping did also a good job. The hotel is connected to a cinema with a mexican restaurant and a starbucks. Small grocery next door. Overall, I really enjoyed the stay at the Westin Times Square, nothing to complain about. Would definetely return if I got a good rate.Small hint: If you need a cab to travel outside manhattan, do not let the hotelboys know. They call a cab already waiting and the cab driver needs to pay some sort of commission for the ride which will be eventually paid by yourself. I did that mistake and it ended in a 10 minutes argument regarding the price for a 5 miles ride to Jersey city. So just tell the guys you want to a destination somewhere in Manhattan and negiotate the fare with the cab driver afterwards (but this is a problem certainly not limited to the Westin).
