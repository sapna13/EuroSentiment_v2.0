{"text":"Excellente!!!! My husband and I took our honeymoon to Excellence, July 14 - 20th. After reading some of the previous reviews, we were a little skeptical of what we would think of the resort and the amenities.... but after experiencing it for ourselves we have to say it was above and beyond fabulous!!! We are very easy going, easy to please people, but definitely enjoy the finer things in life. The resort was gorgeous, the room was perfect, the staff went out of their way to make us happy, the food was good (not fabulous, but definitely good), there was plenty to do if you wanted activities (we spent all of our time in or by the pool or on the beach)... all in all it truly was a wonderful, relaxing, fun honeymoon and vacation! To address some of the negative reviews we read, the ride from the airport is a little bumpy, but it is not that bad. There are just roads with potholes, but the drivers do a great job of avoiding them. In the hour it takes to drive from the airport to the resort, there was maybe a total of 2 minutes where the road was really bad. The bugs - yes, mosquitoes come out, but only at night from our experience, and they are not terrible...with a coat of bug spray (mainly on your ankles and feet) before going outside for the evening, you are fine. The food.... we will agree you are not eating at 5 star restaurants there, but there are 8 places to eat and definitely something for everyone's taste between them. Our favorites (in order) were the Chez Isabelle (French), Agave (Mexican), Tuscana - for breakfast and lunch, The Grill (lunch and dinner).... we did not try The Lobster House or Barcelona because we heard so-so reviews for them both... we were not able to try Spice (Asian) but heard it was very good. Also, there is a pizza place, which is fabulous! There is a guy that walks around the pool and beach during the day with a blue bag full of individual pizzas... we took full advantage of that several days. And, the pizza place is open late (until 2:00 am) so it is great for the late nights after the disco! Service - we had nothing but top of the line service! The staff was so friendly and quick to accommodate any request we had. We did stay at the Excellence Club (which I would definitely recommend spending a little more money to upgrade to) and loved the amenities that came with it. Robert, one of our private concierge persons at the Club, was amazing! He knew each club resident by name and just went out of his way to please his guests. Carlos was also a great staff employee that helped us with our bags. He was always wearing a smile and quick to help us with anything we needed. The event coordinators were so much fun! We loved all of them, but the 2 that stood out to us were Alexandra and Franklin. They were so much fun and did a great job with all the activities! If you go to Excellence and see the, be sure to tell them that Sammy Sosa said to tell them hi! (My husband was introducing himself as Sammy Sosa to everyone that worked there.... they thought he was too funny, but never forgot his name!) The shows at night were a little cheesy (especially the magician) but all are entertaining to watch. The Circus show (which was more like a Cirque show) was fun and the Michael Jackson show was really great! The young Michael was amazing! The Disco (dance club) was a lot of fun and never so crowded you couldn't dance. Definitely do the Dominican cookout on the beach! They serve Dominican food, set up tables on the beach, have live music with an area to dance.... it was great fun and neat to try the food. I would say that 80% of the guests there were on there honeymoon, but there were several anniversary couples there as well.... definitely a perfect place for couples! Bottom line, I would definitely recommend Excellence to anyone - especially honeymooners. We cannot wait to go back for our 5 year anniversary!
