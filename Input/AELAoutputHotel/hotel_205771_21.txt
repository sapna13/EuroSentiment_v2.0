{"text":"Good hotel with pool Our family (two children 16  13) stayed at the Ville Sull'Arno for an 8 day period with two rooms (one standard, one superior). Both rooms were large and comfortable with the 'superior' room having a better bathroom with separate shower and bath. Plug-in mosquito killers are provided, but with the windows closed and aircon working well, we did not use these and only suffered a few bites! The hotel is a good 25 minutes walk from the centre, but benefits greatly from this by having a small'ish but very welcoming pool, with towels provided and having a lifeguard. The pool surround could be improved and more sunbeds could be added, but it was rarely too busy, after all you visit Florence for the sightseeing not to focus on the tan, but it was great to visit sights in the morning and relax by the pool in the afternoon. The walk to town is safe, and for much of the way is tree lined and shaded. Taxi's are around √à√\u2020√ü? and, unlike Rome, we found them to always use their meters and not rip you off!Only ate at the hotel once, not because of any complaint, but as there are too many other places to try and whilst the food was good the atmosphere can be a little formal. (Note: The best pizza's for eat in or take-away a few streets opposite and to the left with a small outside terrace). Breakfast was fine, with the usual continental choices plus scrambled eggs and bacon available.The bar area could be improved to generate more business and make it more comfortable for an early evening or late night drink. There are only a few bar stools plus two comfy chairs and the couple of times we had a drink on returning from a meal in town we felt that we were keeping the staff from their beds! The pool table takes up much room which could be used for more comfy seating and to create a better bar atmosphere. (I never saw the pool table in use at all).Don't take my comments\/suggestions as negatives, we were very happy with our hotel choice and I would recommend it to others.
