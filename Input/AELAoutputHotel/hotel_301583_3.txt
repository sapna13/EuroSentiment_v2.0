{"text":"Disappointing The breakfast served when I was there was definitely not what one would expect of a 5 star hotel, and certainly not an established name such as the Raffles. Waitress serving me was from mainland China and did not speak English (unacceptable when there are so many local Singaporeans and Filipino residents available in Singapore who have been brought up speaking English). Only reason I can see for hiring mainlanders is to take advantage of lower salaries.English breakfast at a colonial-era hotel, but no brown sauce! I now live in Singapore, and all the ingredients needed to create a proper breakfast are available at any local supermarket. Again the hotel was cutting costs.Long Bar- atmosphere spoilt by pop\/hip hop music.Bar  Billiard Room- waited 15 minutes without being served, had to go to the bar myself to order a drink. Obviously management are not on top of things.Overall- this is a very elegant hotel. I have been back several times since for drinks in the evening. Unfortunately it is run by the Singapore Government (Raffles Group is owned by a Ministry of Finance-controlled holding company) and while it would be a stretch of the imagination to compare it to the state-run hotels in communist countries, it would certainly do far better in the hands of an experienced hotel management group. Raffles Group could certainly learn from The Dharmawangsa in Jakarta and other stylish hotels in the region.There are plenty of other better run hotels in Singapore, unfortunately they do not have the luxury of occupying a historic site such as the Raffles. One does not stay at somewhere like the Raffles if price is an issue, however I cannot help stating that the standards of service fall far short of what is expected of a SE Asian 5 star hotel.If you really want to stay at the Raffles then do so, but don't get your expectations up with regard to service. This place is run to generate cash flow and they do not really care if you return as they have plenty of business anyway from the large flows of visitors to Singapore.
