{"text":"OK but some annoying details First of all, we have to consider the new design of Novotel hotels much much better than in the past. It's simple, clear, modern and very good with flat screen TVs, very comfy bathrooms with elegant design and a good scheme of colors.About the size, it's small but reasonnable because we booked a standard room and in comparaison with HK standards, it was OK, about 20 sq meters. However, even if the room was nice, the staff of the hotel is absolutely not helpful and not smily at all. Even if you arrive with a lot of baggages, nobody will help you to bring it to your room. They don't say welcome and they don't care if they disturb you. In the morning, even if you place the sign do not disturb in front of your room, they will call you if you need they make the room. It was totally disturbing because we wanted to sleep and we have been wake up. Nobody says sorry and it's not acceptable.We can complain about the soundproofing as well which is not good at all and you'll have the impression to live with your room neighbours. Depending of the kind of customers will saty close to your room, it could be OK but it could be much more noisy as well...However, it's a good adress because the location is PERFECT, in the middle of Wanchai and the design is very interesting.But the management should train better the staff because this is a four stars hotel...
