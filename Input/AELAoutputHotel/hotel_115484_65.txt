{"text":"A desert classic! We (me, wife, 6-year old daughter) stayed at the Biltmore the nights of July 6-7. I grew up in Phoenix and have always known the Biltmore by reputation; however, my only experience with the facility had been several nice meals at the restaurant at the Biltmore's golf courses.I booked the room through Hilton's web site and got a $116 per night rate (plus resort fee and tax). We got to Phoenix quite early and called ahead to get an early check-in (11:30 when check-in time isn't until 4:00). The front desk emplooyee who answered the phone was extremely courteous and accomodating. When we got to the hotel the valet staff was courteous and helpful (although we self-parked).At the front desk I was told that I had requested a king bed (this is in my HiltonHHonors profile). When I pointed out that I was traveling with my daughter the front desk person immediately looked for a different room. She quickly found one for me. I further pointed out that I planned to self-park, then she said the room she had was far from self-parking so she would try again. She then said, I have a very nice room for you but it only has one king bed. She made it very clear that it was an exceptional room and that I would like it. I took her advice.I stayed in the Saguaro Villas - what an nice room. This is a full-blown suite: 20-foot ceiling, enormous patio, floor to ceiling windows looking north to the mountains, fireplace in the living room, full kitchen, large bedroom, walk-in closet, etc. The VIllas are owned by other people and Hilton manages them when they are in the rental pool. The Saguaro villas have a small, but beautiful, pool if you don't want to be in the large pool area.My only complaint with the room (and this is minor) is that it is dated and needs to be refurbished. The maid service was very efficient.Spending time at a Phoenix-area resort in the summer is quite popular with the locals and the Biltmore is no exception. By 9:00 a.m. all of the shady spots (with umbrellas) had already been claimed at the big pool. Of course, there were no people at these spots - just their stuff. During the day the large pool was a giant party. A wide variety of people having their own fun - singles, couples, families, young and old. The swim-up bar is nice and the prices are in-line with what you should expect at a resort (and actually cheaper than what you'll pay at many of them).The resort fee entitles you to use the spa, which is a nice use of the $25. At most resorts the fee lets you use the gym but the spa is an extra charge (or completely off-limits unless you purchase a treatment). I worked out both mornings and it was nice to finish the session in the spa lounge with some fresh fruit and fresh-squeezed orange juice.My gripes with the Biltmore are minor. First, I think the hotel needs to do a better job of embracing the desert. There is way too much grass on the property - this is irresponsible from a water usage perspective and in the summer the brown areas look horrible. Second, the decorative brick with the distinctive art-deco design is in need of repair. Throughout the exterior of the hotel the brick is cracking or has fallen off the wall and been poorly replaced. We had breakfast the first morning in the restaurant and found it to be incredibly mediocre. The pancakes were as dry as the desert.Will I be going back? Probably not. Why not? Because the Phoenix area has so many wonderful places to stay and I want to try them all! But I highly recommend the Biltmore!
