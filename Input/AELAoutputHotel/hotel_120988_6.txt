{"text":"Pricy but good airport hotel I had to attend a large tradeshow in Boston in September 2008. The only option I had for the dates I was attending was the Hilton. I don't normally stay in airport hotels because I find them overexpensive and usually underdeliver service. I was glad that this hotel, although really expensive (likely due to the tradeshow), was a decent hotel.You cannot beat the convenience of the hotel. You don't ever have to step outside Logan Airport if you arrive in Terminal A. I walked from the plane directly over to the hotel via a skybridge in less than 10 minutes. The skybridge dumps you off by the conference area of the hotel. A little extra signage would have been helpful, but I managed to find the lobby to check in without too much hassle.Check in was quick and the staff helped me with understanding the bus routes for the tradeshow. My room was on a lower floor with the most dreadful view of roofs, pipes, and a slice of road. Fortunately, the noise from the airport was minimal, although you could hear the occasional jet taking off.The room is done in a minimalist style, very cool and gray. It was pretty masculine looking, but the bed was comfortable. The desk was useful for getting work done but the chair was a bit difficult to sit in for long periods of time. The hotel pub restaurant is a good option for those staying here. I was hesitant to eat there, because you really are a captive audience. But the portions were huge, prices were reasonable and the service was really good. I ended up eating there twice during my stay and the waiter remembered me on my second visit. I really liked the convenience of the hotel. If I absolutely had to choose between one of the Logan hotels for a future visit, I would want to return to the Hilton, as long as the price was not too outrageous.
