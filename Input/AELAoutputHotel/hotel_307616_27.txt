{"text":"Best Hotel in Kuta The Discovery was the first hotel in Bali we stayed in. We arrived on Jet Star at around 10:30pm and it was only a very short trip to the hotel. On arrival the staff were very welcoming and we were soon off to our room. Once there we found they had made a mistake with the room and the only √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëeluxe ocean view room√à√\u2020\u2022?had two single beds, we brought this to there attention and asked to be upgraded which was not a problem and we ended up in a room 10 meters from the ocean with the best view of the sunset I had seen in a longtime (ocean front room). We were at the Discovery for 7 nights and in this time my girlfriend and I got engaged. The staff were very helpful in making arrangements for the night and all went very well. We ate in the hotel restaurants a number of times; the meals were very nice and reasonably priced. However if you want some of the best international cuisine you will ever have head next door to the back of the shopping mall (Atmosphere) or to Kuta beach (Rosso Vivo). Conclusion is the room rate is a little more expensive than some of the more remote locations (Nusa Dua) but they do not charge a fortune for drinks and food, also the service charges are all included. The staff are very friendly, pool with swim-up bar is very nice, gardens are large and very well kept and spa services excellent and cheap for a hotel. Excellent Hotel will go back.
