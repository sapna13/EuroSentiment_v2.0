{"text":"Excelente! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our time at Punta Cana! You can do as much or as little as you want; for us, doing as little as possible was the ideal choice! Upon arrival, we were greeted with cool champagne and washcloths as well as smiling faces and a gorgeously landscaped resort. We were then taken to a nicely air-conditioned oceanfront room with a beautiful outdoor terrace with a jacuzzi, all of which were maintained on a twice-daily basis. We were pleased by the beautiful pools which included floating mats and a swim-up bar with the best pina coladas, mudslides, and coco locos you've ever tasted! The martini bar was also another favorite. The beach was covered with soft sand and plenty of chairs, beds, benches, and hammocks to relax in and watch beachside weddings take place. Every so often, someone would come along with a freshly baked pizza. The waves were rather large, so we didn't do as much swimming in the ocean (it's the Atlantic, just fyi). There are 5-6 different restaurants, all right there on the resort. Our favorites included Toscana, which includes personalized omelettes, skillets, and every other breakfast food you could possibly imagine, and Agave, a cheery Mexican restaurant with an incredibly talented mariachi band, tasty fajitas, and guacamole made right! We were there during Hurricanes Hannah and Gustav, but we managed to get away with only 2 days of rain! When our room started flooding from the rain, we were whisked away to another room, which was nice and dry. The rest of the time included beautiful sunny weather, although I have to say, the mosquitoes were relentless! Every night was heralded by some type of show: Michael Jackson (our favorite), the 70s and 80s, a circus, and a magic show. We enjoyed these from a distance but had no problems resigning to our private room, where we could enjoy our own little mini-bar (oreos, peanuts, crackers, soft drinks, and beers) and Cuban cigars! We loved the variety served on the room service menu and would have utilized it more for snacks. We also would recommend bringing as many toiletries\/medicinal items (OFF!) as possible to avoid highway robbery for something as small as toothpaste. As far as the honeymoon package goes, there's not too much to add. To get a massage through the package, you only get 15% off (but it's still a great experience). The romantic dinner in a restaurant isn't anything special except for some rose petals on your table. The dinner on the beach is an extra $150. Another warning is that if you book your transportation to the resort with travelocity, PRINT out your travel voucher. Also as mentioned, the rides to the resort are definitely nauseating, so bring some dramamine. As I mentioned, there's certainly ways to entertain yourself: ziplining to horseback riding to team sports to dancing to karaoke. But there's quiet relaxing privacy too if you want it. Overall, we would rate this experience as excellent!!!
