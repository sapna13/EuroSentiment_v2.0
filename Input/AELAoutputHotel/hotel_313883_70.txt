{"text":"Stayed at the Tropical Princess in April Like most of the DR hotel reviews, the ones on the Tropical Princess were mixed. We booked with some confidence about the place, but with lowered expectations regarding food and accommodations.Overall, the stay was above average and we got a good package deal.Food:The food at the buffet (La Higuero) was pretty sufficient most of the time. Formulaic food stations that would vary their dishes a bit based on time of day (breakfast vs. lunch vs. dinner) or each day by cultural theme. One day it was Mexican, another day Asian, another day Seafood. Go expecting generic quality and you'll be ok. None of the cultural specialties were any better than a restaurant here in Toronto that specializes in that cuisine (e.g. Italian, Chinese, Seafood, Steak). However, it was all pretty much passable. The pasta bar was pretty decent and sometimes busy. The omelettes, teppanyaki, seafood mix, were also pretty decent. I would recommend going with most of the cook-to-order food stations, as the food seemed to be fresher and you had some choice with ingredients. The pizza station was popular but pretty weak tasting. The funny thing was everything tasted just a little bit different than here. Even mainstream things like hamburgers and hotdogs, but not offensive at all. The service at the buffet is very quick, attentive and friendly.One of the only things I didn't like was the fact that it is outside (covered, but you still get the odd fly).The Brasilian ala carte is included in the standard package as is the Dominican. We found the Brasilian pretty weak and the Dominican abit better - the steak and grouper were good.Although it says the dress for dinner at the ala cartes is pants only, long shorts and a decent shirt will be ok.Got a bit of upset stomach, but nothing some Pepto couldn't solve.Accomodations:The superior room was decent - clean with ceramics but a bit rustic.We had an issue with small red ants the 2nd day on the wicker table.Called housekeeping and they came and sprayed some form of Spanish Raid all along the edges and inside the wicker. We had to leave for a few hours and didn't put anything edible on the table afterwards, but never saw another ant the rest of the trip. However, these small mosquitos seemed to get into the room because the hallway is open to the outside and they would come in when the door was open. We couldn't hear them but I woke up the first day with 6-8 bites on areas of my arms not covered by clothes. I wore a long sleeve shirt,trackpants and socks after that and had less bites. The TV has cable and gets a fair number of English stations. The bathroom was fine and the walls were soundproof but the doors are paper thin wood. Add in the open concept hallways that echo and you could hear people talking in hallways or moving suitcases and furniture on the upper level.The Resort:There can be a lot of walking because the resort is big and spread out between the units, beach, main pool, main lobby and concierge. I could see how it might be hard if you were immobile or elderly. We were at the Trinitaria unit which was a bit farther away from the main pool and buffet so a little more walking, but also a little more quiet.The beaches are nice - hot sand and a bit of a breeze. Temperature is a bit humid but we had 7 straight days of sun with no rain. The A\/C in the room had trouble keeping up on the plus 30c days. There are 3 pools and lots of free activities all day. You have to get up pretty early to grab a beach hut or poolchairs.The Kids club is quite good and for 7 dollars its like a full day of babysitting and activities if you want. Stuff like outdoor pool games, pingpong, banana boat rides, soccer, tennis and they'll even take the kids to lunch.Everyone at the resort was generally friendly. We didn't run into anyone rude at all. Tipping early and often helps. I would also bring lots of 1 and 5 dollar bills. Not too many people have USD for change and you don't want to have to exchange while you are there, as you'll lose based on the rate. Also, if you take a trip to the Tower Princess Casino you can only play certain games in USD. The ATM's only dispense DR peso's.The Spa is a bit expensive and there is a free gym which is small butadequate.Overall, it was an above average resort.
