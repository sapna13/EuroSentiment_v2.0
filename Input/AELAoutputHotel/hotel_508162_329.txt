{"text":"Dreams...more like a nightmare! Just returned from a 10 night stay at Dreams from 5-15 May. Dreams does not live up to its 5 star rating...Had a few problems with our room initally, however, we were moved with little or no hassle. The hotel grounds and pool were lovely and nicely maintained. Weather was lovely. Beach was not too good once you left the main area..it was strewn with debris, which should be cleaned on a regular basis. I know the hotel doesn't own the beach, but their guests do use it.The most disappointing issue was the food... it was dreadful...bring plenty of immodium..we went through 2 packets!! The world cafe (buffet restaurant) was very poor not only in decor but also in food quality and temperature...didnt have one hot meal. I came across dead fly in chicken caesar salad..no orange juice one morning..its on order we were told. The shrimp caesar salad in seafood restaurant contained salad and one prawn!! We tried all the restaurants, same story.I could go on..the food was horrendous!!!! One exception lobster was good..it was grilled so they couldn't get that wrong.The drinks selection was very hit and miss, there seemed to be a constant issue and moan among guests about the shortage and long waiting times, this didn't really affect us as we dont drink much but do like a glass of wine with dinner...house selection was appalling so we purchased wine as required usually around $40 per bottle. it went nice with the $15 per lb lobster (which was only decent meal we had)Staff were hardworking and friendly, however the standard of service fell well below 5 star rating. Entertainment team had vast array of activities during the day however the nightly shows were a bit on the tacky side..We also had a few issues with telephone calls to our room..6am alarm call that we didnt request....10.30pm call to come to reception on the second night of our vacation to settle our bill (there was no bill)..we did get a bottle of the house wine as compensation for inconvenience!!!The good weather was the best feature of this holiday..no complaints here!As far as I can see main issue is bad management. Solution = management shake up, new chefs, staff training programme and a refurbishment programme.Unfortunately, wont return to find out if this will happen!!!
