{"text":"A Horrible Stay At St. Regis San Francisco When we arrived the room was ice cold. The air conditioning unit had malfunctioned. After about an hour we called for the unit to be repaired. Thinking it was fixed we left the room only to return to an airconditioning unit that was still broken, this time the room was warm and stuffy. At 4AM not being able to bear it nor sleep we called to be switched to another room, a very difficult proposition as there was a general reluctance to do so on the part of the hotel. We insisted, they came up with a security detail. This I believe fed into the general misconception that a black man could be a person of violent disposition. Could it be racial profiling as I have an accent and happen to be black? Needless to say the hotel refused by delay tactics to send someone over to move our luggage to the new room. After waiting for half an hour it dawned on us they were not going to help us move. We did it ourselves. The hotel went further to delay making our room until at 4:30PM when we returned to the room and insisted that it be made. Overall, a very shabby treatment for the money we paid to stay in the hotel. A shirt sent out to be ironed came back late, causing us to almost miss our appointment. I could not be paid enough to stay here another day! ","annotations":[]}
