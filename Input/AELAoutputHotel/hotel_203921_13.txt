{"text":"Wonderful Gem Across the Arno My new wife and I recently stayed there on our honeymoon. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by Sabrina, who was charming, helpful and ebullient. There was a nightly complimentary happy hour which was already in progress (red and white wines , along with some fine finger foods).We were quite pleased with our room. It was extremely spacious, spotless, with some tasteful art. We were also thrilled to see that the hotel ha left us a bottle of wine to enjoy as a congratulations upon getting married. The complimentary wi-fi came in very handy for getting ideas about what to do in Florence. There was also a complimentary 10 minutes of phone use anywhere in the world per night using Skype. Originally we were scheduled to stay only two nights in Florence, but we loved the city and the hotel so much we stayed an extra two nights as well.The location of the hotel, while not ideal, is quite good overall. It is about a 20-25ish minute walk\/stroll down the Arno river (a picturesque walk that I would recommend taking at least once when in Florence anyway) to get to Ponte Vecchio, the main pedestrian entryway to Florence. Alternatively, one can take a bus to Ponte Vecchio, for which the stop is just a block away from the hotel.My only bad experience was the final night. Our room was on the ground floor facing the main street near the hotel. At about 11:00ish, street cleaning began with a huge vehicle with flashing yellow lights that made a great deal of noise. For some reason it kept going up and down the street for almost FOUR hours. The curtains of our room were somewhat sheer, meaning that the flashing yellow lights could quite easily be seen reflecting off the walls and mirrors of our room. My wife was able to sleep through it all, but I was awake the entire time. Thicker curtains would be a nice upgrade.But that was the only issue I had while staying there. Sabrina and the entire staff is tremendously helpful (and all of them speak excellent English). Overall a wonderful stay. We will be back if\/when we return to Florence!
