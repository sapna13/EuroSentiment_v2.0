{"text":"Amazing Hotel, awsome amenities! I've never written an online review but this hotel was so great I just had to.For a very reasonable price (I had booked on Priceline, but for some reason the reservation didn't go through -I blame priceline, so called and asked for the internet rate of $149) you get a high end experience.My love of this hotel started Saturday morning when I headed out for a walk around the area. I saw their shuttle sitting out front and asked when it'd be heading downtown. The driver was sitting there and asked when do you want to go? He took me right then and scheduled a time to pick me up.The next day when I asked them to book me a cab to take me to the bar down the street they had recommended, they offered to check with the shuttle...and sure enough, it was going to be around in a few minutes, so they took us down the street on their way out to town.They have the basic hotel general store items downstairs but also offer some Trader Joes items for purchase since it's just down the street.They've got coffee and tea available 24\/7 and fresh baked cookies each afternoon. Delicious!They said they're going to be opening their Wine bar during the weekends, which was the down side.You can rent bikes for free, use the University pool, order one of their entertaniment carts and they even have loaner umbrellas for those rainy days in Seattle.The rooms were totally clean and quite stylish, the beds were comfortable and the room even had a huge full length mirror. The only word of caution: the windows aren't tinted, so if you look out onto the street, don't do it naked!I loved this hotel!
