{"text":"Amazing Location - Funky Hotel - Great Experience A great stay at the Bryant Park Hotel.We were in New York for only 4 days, so wanted a place that was as central as possible - we really couldn't have done much better! As you can probably gather from their website - Bryant Park Hotel is very trendy, red-lit lifts, funky music in the Lobby, doorman that look more like bouncers (though were very pleasant) and lots of subdued lighting. If that's not your thing - I'd think carefully about booking here. There's even a late-night party menu of sushi and White-Castle (amongst others) which is guaranteed to appeal to the more hardcore party animals. I'm pleased to say however that this didn't mean the hotel was noisy through the night.The staff were great, though only 1 out of the 2 Concierges we met were particularly helpful \/ knowledgeable. However the front desk staff made up for it, helping us out with online airline check-in, printing boarding passes, looking after our luggage once we'd checked out, letting us use the fitness centre bathrooms to freshen up before our flight (9pm so we'd spent the day out after checking out in the morning) and just generally being helpful. Also there's two room services a day, as with many big-city hotels these days. We even had a third service on request one day which was nice. Rooms are great - very modern with LCD TV's and gorgeous, well equipped bathrooms. A minor niggle was that there was no free Internet access, with the hotel charging about US$10 \/ day for the service. That's outdated guys! Also - breakfast was pretty pricey, I'd recommend an amazing patisserie which was about 3 doors away (out the front of the hotel and go left) which did excellent pastries  coffee. Location wise - brilliant, on the corner of 5th Ave  40-42nd St, you can walk to Times Square in 5 minutes, Rockefeller Centre in 10, Grand Central in 10, both Macy's  Saks in 10. Plus you're within 10 minutes walk of nearly every major Subway line. Can't do much better!We both loved this hotel, my girlfriend has already said she'll be back to stay there for her Hen weekend in a few years time!
