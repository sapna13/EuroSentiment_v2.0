{"text":"Great base for New York trip As first time visitors to New York we wanted a decent hotel, close to the main attractions that we could base ourselves in for the week we were visiting New York City. We have used Trip Advisor on several occasions for recommendations and again we were not disappointed!Our hotel room was a junior suite on the 27th floor with great views of the Manhattan skyline, especially looking out at the Chrysler building lit up at night. The room itself was great with more than enough space for the two of us. The king side bed was extremely comfortable, by the end of the week it was pretty hard to get out of!! While the kitchen was on the small side there was more than enough room to prepare breakfast in the morning, make a cuppa upon returning in the evening and having a fridge to store some beers in meant you weren't dipping into the mini-bar!The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We messed up our booking dates (totally our faults) and the front desk staff sorted it out within minutes. The cleaning staff also deserve a mention as the room was spotless on our arrival and throughout the stay.Manhattan is easy to get around once you get your bearings. The Empire State building and Macys are a 10min walk down the street, with Penn Station just a little further down. We tended to walk a lot but there is a subway station (Line 6) one block away on 33rd street (one going uptown and one downtown on opposite sides of the road) and a good bus service around the corner that goes cross-town the length of 34th street. A $10 metro card will get you 6 trips on either the bus or subway. Failing that the doormen are always on call to hail you a cab (expensive during peak time, but not so much at night). Like other reviewers we hired a limo to get us back to the airport in Newark √à√\u2020\u2022?a bit overpriced at $80 but it included a tip and tolls.We ate in both the Barking Dog (the special pork chops were really good) and Thai restaurant (recommend the green curry) either side and both meals were good. We also got some food from the Murray Hill store\/deli to take back with us to the apartment which was also quite reasonable. On one of our lazier nights we rounded the corner onto 3rd avenue to a number of pubs\/clubs with some good nightlife. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in New York and I have no doubt that the comfort, cleanliness and location of the hotel contributed to this. We would definetly recommend it!
