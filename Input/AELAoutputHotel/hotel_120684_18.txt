{"text":"A great hotel - right on the beach We are a couple in our twenties who stayed at the Outrigger for a week in May\/June 2008. We were deciding for ages between this hotel and the Moana Surfrider, and in the end chose this one for the balcony, as a balcony room was a lot more expensive at the Surfrider. The other hotel on the beach, the Royal Hawaiian, was closing for refurbishment at the time, so that one was never in the equation.The hotel's location is excellent - right on the famous Waikiki Beach, with all the shops, bars and restaurants right on its doorstep. We had a side ocean view room with a balcony. The room was a really good size - it had two double beds in - although the balcony was too small; the ones directly on the front looked much bigger. It was fantastic to wake up to a view of the ocean every morning. The decor was a bit dated in the room and throughout the hotel, but completely acceptable.The pool area isn't that big considering the size of the hotel, although we never had any trouble getting a sun-lounger. There are no parasols though which makes sunbathing in the midday sun almost impossible, unless you are a hard-core bather. There are parasols and beds for hire on the beach, but it was about $40 for two beds and a parasol for the day, which is expensive to do more than once. The beach area does get busy, but its not unbearable.We had breakfast at the hotel pretty much every morning - there's plenty of choice in the buffet. We ate at the hotel in the evening a couple of times too which was very nice and a lovely beach-front setting. We would also recommend the restaurant 'Top of Waikiki' - which is the revolving restaurant that can be seen from the main street, it gives excellent views of Honolulu especially at sunset.I think if we went back to Waikiki again we would choose one of the other hotels along the front, but I would certainly recommend the Outrigger for a pleasant stay, ","annotations":[{"endOffset":350,"mention":"Royal Hawaiian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Royal_Hawaiian_Hotel"],"startOffset":336},{"endOffset":350,"mention":"Royal Hawaiian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Royal_Hawaiian_Hotel"],"startOffset":336},{"endOffset":350,"mention":"Royal Hawaiian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Royal_Hawaiian_Hotel"],"startOffset":336},{"endOffset":350,"mention":"Royal Hawaiian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Royal_Hawaiian_Hotel"],"startOffset":336}]}
