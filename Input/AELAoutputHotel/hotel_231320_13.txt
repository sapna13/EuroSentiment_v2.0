{"text":"Not too shabby... For my first taste of a European hotel, the Hotel Damrak was actually not bad. I was pleased to get it at a pretty good rate and it was backed up by a satisfaction guarantee by another website. As I said though, it was my first Euro hotel, so discern on your own what things are standard and what things are outside of the norm. 1. The rate was good. $50.00 Euro less than surrounding hotels.2. The entrance was a restaurant\/Inn.3. The lobby was actually a reception desk at the posterior of the restaurant\/Inn.4. The elevator was a great sight to see! :) No need for steps with luggage.5. The room ( a single) was adequate, although small (but it WAS a single).6. The room, bathroom, closets were clean and well prepared. Good water pressure.7. The continental breakfast (coldcuts, veggies, cereal, eggs, cheese, juice, milk, etc.) was different and pretty good. Kept me healthy and full at the start of my day(very important as that meant that I had more Euros in my pocket!)8. The maid always came early (good). She always brought her two kids who played tag and games in the hallway (bad).9. When you left the hotel, you had to leave your room key. ( good? bad?)10. You could not have any overnight guests (bad). One of the staff members told me about this, the morning after I left with my overnight guest (GREAT!)11. Very friendly and helpful staff.12. PERFECT location!Would stay there again, but just in a bigger room. ","annotations":[]}
