{"text":"Great stay in NYC Loved the Palace. Stayed for three nights with the wife and 9yo kid on the 39th floor - incredible city views - executive lounge was great for breakfast, light lunch and snacks during the day, drinks and desserts at night - made the huge hotel seem small and private club-like. Food was good, also. Staff in the executive lounge were great, friendly and helpful, and the free computer usage was really convenient and useful. Room was a nice size - beds very comfortable. Cute little kid's sized plush terry robe was provided for my daughter. Bathroom, although small - was still nice. Great shower pressure and water temp. Small stain spotted on the bedspead on check in was changed immediately. Otherwise, the room was very clean.After a day of shopping, the nightly turn-down staff (inadvertently we think) threw out some boxes and bags that held unopened purchases - specifically most of the stuff that we bought for our daughter to go with her new American Girl doll. As soon as we noticed, we called the front desk. Security was at our door in minutes, and they quickly found all of the items in a sealed trash bag. We really appreciated their quick response, their repeated and sincere apologies, and I was just glad that we got everything back as it saved me a return trip to the store!Staff throughout the hotel were extremely polite and helpful - from the front desk which quickly checked us in at 11 a.m., to the bell men and door men who got us cabs and town cars in seconds. Only minor disappointment was the gym, which, although nice, was smaller (and more crowded) than I had expected. It still was convenient though to be able to get in some sort of workout without having to leave the hotel.The hotel is in a most amazing and incredibly convenient mid-town location. Sure its expensive, but we'd stay again for sure!
