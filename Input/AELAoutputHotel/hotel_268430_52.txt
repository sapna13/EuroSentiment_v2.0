{"text":"Not that impressed. Could have been better. It wasn't the worst experience, nor the best. I would have to agree with another reviewer about the Kids Club issue. The hotel staff did not appear to know anything about it. Finally, I was directed to the Casino where they told us that the lady who ran the Kids Club had quit. Obviously, they could not have necessarily known this ahead of time but it would have been nice if they had a backup plan. Having brought a child, it was my number 1 requirement for picking this hotel and the fact that I am a loyal Marriott rewards member. We realized that my 9-year-old would not be interested in a lot of the sightseeing and activities we were so we had our heart set on him having a club for activities so we could do our thing too. Imagine our surprise..no kids club..Their alternative consisted of hiring a babysitter at $15 an hour for a minimum of 4 hours. No thanks. Just another way to charge outrageous fees. So, in turn, we did not get to experience a majority of things that we felt PR would have to offer. We were reduced to hanging out at the hotel with a not so great beach. The water in front of the hotel was disgusting and garbage had washed ashore..and I mean garbage, cans, bottles, old sunglasses. I shutter to think if anyone would walk on the beach barefooted and get a cut. I hate to sound like a whiner but another complaint was the service. It was so slow. I feel everyone did the bear minimum, yet I am sure expected a tip. One night we went down to eat at the cafe and they had one person working and the place was full. Most people did not even get served so they left. We are frequent visitors to Mexico and we'll take our dollars there. I do have to say also that the taxi drivers were not friendly at all. They never said one word to us..NONE of them and we used several. I would also have to agree that all charged different rates to the same places so that was wierd. Just very not friendly. My impression as a whole is that Puerto Rico just does not embrace tourism like Mexico does. We won't be returning to Puerto Rico. Mexico here we come.
