{"text":"Release the birds - environmentally supportive? We are Australians and have recently stayed at the Chedi Club, Ubud (March 2007). After just having stayed at the Padma Hotel, Legion, wewere looking forward to the little extras, great cocktails and great food at the Chedi Club. We were disappointed, although we are normally easily pleased. No comparison whatsoever to the complimentary cocktails and wonderful canapes lavished on us at the Padma Hotel. After settling into our beautiful villa at the Chedi Club we walked from one end of the grounds to the other (our room was up the furtherest end) to the restaurant for the so-called complimentary cocktails and canapes offered in our expensive package.We were brought a recommended cocktail which was pretty awful (the Chedi Purple!). We politely drank it, but we weren't offered another drink, although we sat there for another 30 minutes with empty glasses. Another waiter brought us canapes which consisted of two tiny little squares each - one was a curried samosa and the other was a tiny piece of bread with egg, about an inch square. Nothing more was offered, so we asked a waiter where the canapes were as we weren't sure of the process. The waiter asked us what would we like and we said we'd love some more samoses (one each so far! and they were TINY). He then asked us how many?. We just gave up at that stage. The canapes were obviously scarce as were the cocktails! I do not in any way blame the waiters for this, however, we question the management of the Chedi Club in regards to the wording of the packages (and the offering of such) that are included in our package. Complimentary afternoon tea was also very meagre. We never went back in the evening for the complimentary cocktails\/canapes, it just wasn't worth the trouble. The pool villa was very beautiful and our personal butler was very lovely. However, to us, this was equivalent to 24 hr room service which you receive in all good hotels in Bali. There was one computer available until 7 pm. and quite often you had to wait to use it (we also gave up on this as well). The complimentary breakfast was fine, although we preferred the Padma Legion breakfast as there was a greater choice. Chedi Club is very exclusive and at breakfast there were only about 5 other couples\/triples around, so obviously they do not offer the abundance of the larger hotels. Ubud's scenic areas are pretty around the mountains and rice paddies, but the village was a disappointment and the market is shocking unless you like being pushed and pulled around by the many people struggling to make a living selling goods. Worse than Kuta\/Legion. With Bali Belly I was traumatised by having to use the public toilet right in the centre of the markets which is shockingly Third World. Some advice regarding lack of facilities could have been offered from the Chedi Club. There was a general lack of information provided in booklets in our room. Our DVD player didn't work and had to be replaced, although this was done very efficiently after finally discovering the problem. Great restaurant in Ubud town - Lamak. Fantastic service, wonderful staff, and great food there with complimentary car provided to and from this restaurant. This was our a highlight as was the beautiful villa and the great job Arka did in tidying and cleaning every day. He alsowent out of his way to get a recipe for us. The Chedi Club prides itself on its support of the environment however to see the beautifulbirds locked in tiny cages all around the grounds was a true negative, very disappointing and saddening. We'll be going back to Bali definitely...to the Padma Hotel, Legion to get the little extrasone would expect of 5 star hotels.
