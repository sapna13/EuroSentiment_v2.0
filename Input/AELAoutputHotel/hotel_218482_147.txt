{"text":"Ignore the negative reviews!! Our stay at the Catalonia Bavaro resort was amazing! From the moment we checked in we were treated like royalty! We found out later in the week that this resort is one of the older ones in Punta Cana, however, being one of the older ones has it's advantages! The grounds were beautiful and lush and the staff was very attentive. Our room was spacious and comfortable, and clean enough to just about eat off the floor! We had the best sleep all week! The buffets had a great selection of food and the ice cream and deserts were amazing! The service was 5 star all the way, we really enjoyed Nestor, he always made our meals entertaining at the main buffet! The a la cartes were good, however, we found the Mexican one the most entertaining! You have to try the crepes at the crepery too! The beach had lots of chairs and pallapas for shade. Make sure to walk past the Royal side beach because you'll find a great market to buy souveniors and paintings. The staff at this resort work really hard and we found tips went a long ways! Just to see the smile on thier face was well worth it! We left the resort on a couple of excursions and would recommend the Bavaro Runners, it was a great way to learn more about the Dominican way of life because you're in such a bubble on the resort that you really don't realize how the people really live in the country. Overall, I would certainly recommend this resort to anyone, it was a great experience all around for us! We honestly can't think of a single thing to complain about.
