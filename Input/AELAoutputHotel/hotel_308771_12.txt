{"text":"Great Hotel Stayed at Bounty 3 times (dec 04, dec 06, july 07, jan-feb 08) and at the Mecure once (next to hard rock). Compared to the Mecure I would say i prefer staying at the bounty. Bounty is central to everything - beach, clubs, great restaurants, shops etc.Yes you do get mostly younger people (17-30 y.o) staying at the hotel who are mainly there to have fun. The hotel does not play loud music at the pool 24\/7, they play music til 10pm i tihnk on the 'drink til you drop' nights on friday.All the staff are so friendly and yes sometimes they are trying to get you to buy a ticket for the parties but a no thanks is all you need. I went back a year later after i visited the first time and some of the staff still remembered my name and the friends i went with last time.Rooms are nice, never had any problems with cleanliness and room cleaned very well everyday. Never had any issues with the hotel billing us for things we didn't use.Hotel food was pretty good, more expensive then the street restaurants but stil cheaper than Aus food. If your after a good meal at a good price then the best places are Rainbow (out the front of bounty), Bamboo classic and the best i reckon is Jegeg Bulan (the staff here are the best guys ever especially koming and ketut, its next to cirkle K and mini mart).Overall nice hotel with nice rooms, grounds and staff with a target customer base of 17-30 yr olds. This is the only place i bother staying at in bali unless i was going on a honeymoon, then would stay in nusa dua or tuban (east of kuta).
