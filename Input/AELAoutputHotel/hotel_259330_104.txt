{"text":"Great Vacation Spot A friend and I just visited Grand Paradise Main Secton on May 1st to May 8th. All I have to say is that I am not sure what people are complaining about. I had a wonderful time. You have to go there without high expectations. A four star resort there compared to a four star resort here have huge differences. I can honestly say that we had no problems at all. Our bathroon had a small leak from the shower but we didn't even notice it until 5 days into the trip. Another thing I should mention is that we had heard that they didn't provide face clothes. They actually did when we got there, but they only provided 4 for the week and didn't replenish them. But we also didn't ask for them to be replenished either.To start - Sunwing was great - no problems with the plane, travelling, anything like that. Reception desk, friendly nice - no problems.Our room - we stayed in Building 3 on the second floor room 3210 in the Main section. We thought we were going to have a garden view and we had a pool view, so we were pleased with that. It was just gorgeous. We had an alarm clock, coffee maker, iron, 2 double beds, sitting area, safe ($), mirrors, - no problems at all with the rooms. We had a mini fridge in our room which had water coke and sprite in it and that was all included - no problems at all and she kept filling it back up every day for us.We went to the entertainement every night - it was great, funny. Good times. The disco was good, great music and dancing. Every day by the pool there was aerobics, activities, spanish lessons etc.... Always something to do if you wanted to do something. Music played by the pools in the afternoons.The staff at both parts of the resort were extremely friendly and helpful. The maids were great, the bartenders were great and so were the entertainment staff. Abraham at the swim up bar in the club section was hilarious...go and see him - he is totally worth it.We did notice that the club section catered to the French. The main section spoke in all 3 languages (english, french and spanish) but we went to the club section for the day at the swim up bar and we noticed that their daily activities by the pool were only spoken in french.The food - we went to 3 a la cartes - in my opinion the Domincan was my favorite compared to the Steak House and Seafood. Mind you I am not big on Seafood and steak is steak. The buffets were great. I am one of the most picky people I know and I never had a problem finding anything to eat.Pools were always clean, the beach of course - BEAUTIFUL. We were up by 6 every day, but we didn't put towels down on chairs until 7 or 8 and went for breakfast and then came back to our chairs. Even then there were chairs left at the pool and on the beach. There was one day where we didn't have towels down and we tried to get a chair by the pool around 2 in the afternoon and it was pretty hard as it was such a hot day.We did one excursion - Saona Island - beautiful - whiter sands, calmer waters, warmer waters....just beautiful. I probably wouldn't to the same one again as I already have, but it was nice.All in all it was a great trip we met so many great people. Everyone was friendly. All around I really can't complain about one thing and I would recommend this place to anyone!
