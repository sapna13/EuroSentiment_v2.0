{"text":"Great Stay, many conveniences We stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites from July 6 to July 12. The hotel is nice and clean. The suites are roomy with a fridge and a microwave (our fridge even had a little freezer although the room next door did not have the freezer in their fridge). The pullout couch was actually very comfortable. It's not the kind where you can feel the springs of the bed but it looked like the mattress was three sections of firm foam which folded over into the couch. There was even a little round table with chairs which was nice as we had breakfast in our suite a few of the mornings. There is the cutest little 2 cup Wolfgang Puck coffee maker which made really nice coffee or if you prefer, there is coffee down in the lobby each morning. There's a nice flat screen TV in the living room area and a regular TV in the bedroom. The restaurant, the Green Room, had really good food. We asked for towels twice and the towels arrived at our door within minutes. We had a gorgeous view of the river on the 7th floor. The pool was adequate with large pool towels. Parking is in a covered indoor lot so your car is not scorching hot when you get in. In terms of location, it is really not near to any attractions but really not far from any either. We took the shuttle to the Aquarium one day and it picked us up in the afternoon no problems. We drove to the Children's Museum and into Cambridge and the Museum of Science and it was not too far at all. The thing is that the hotel is close to the highway so if you stay away from peak hours, these attractions are only 20 minutes away. There is a Whole Foods across the bridge so you can easily buy fresh fruits and breakfast stuff for quick and easy breakfasts in the morning. Whole Foods is expensive but alot cheaper than doing the breakfast buffet downstairs every morning (you can even buy breakfast foods by the pound in the prepared meals section). I would definitely stay here again.
