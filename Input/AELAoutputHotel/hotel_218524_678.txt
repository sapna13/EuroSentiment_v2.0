{"text":"Amazing and Tranquil My boyfriend and I are very well travelled and have experienced everything from camping in remote jungles to the Ritz in New York. We stayed at the Excellence Punta Cana and loved it! To address some of the previous and recent reviews, the week prior to us staying there, there were some fatalities in the waters in the area. As such, there were at least two lifeguards on duty at all times - sometimes three. Any time someone was venturing out a little too far from the shore for their liking, they would blow their whistles and have them come back in. An excellent and prudent action on the part of the hotel. The meals were amazing. Not once did we have to wait to be seated in any of the restaurants that were all dinner menu based. The lobster house is very romantic - with the ocean breezes blowing tthough as you at by candlelight. The Grill had excellent choices and cuts of meat to choose from. The Barcelona had tasty seafood and mediterranean styled dishes to choose from. The Asian restaurtant (can't recall the name) had wonderful Chinese, Japanese and Thai foods. The Mexican restaurant (Agave) was in a cozy cantina setting. The French restaurant was closed most of the time we were there, so we didn't get to try it. The only buffet style meals were in the morning and lunch in one of the restaurants. Even then, the buffet was excellent. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Contrary to what others have posted, if there was ever a problem (which we had with our fridge and a dripping tap in our room) it was quickly fixed. The fridge was making a bit of a shrieking sound. We called the front desk and someone was at our door within 5 minutes. They checked it out, and came back while we went for dinner and when we returned, the problem was fixed. The tap was also fixed when we were at the beach. Very few hotels we have stayed at have been so responsive to issues such as that. The beach is outstanding! I can understand that if someone paid extra for the Club Excellence, they were be saddened by the fact that anyone could use the Club Excellence Reserved beach area - which we did. But, there is plenty of room to share and not be annoyed by other guests in your space. The beach is magnificant. Another thing noticeable was the absence of vendors pestering you on the beach. They would stay outside the designated beach area assigned to the resort. On each end of the resort beach, there were small stores open to buy souveniers, if you so desired. It was ultimately relaxing. The rooms were clean and the maid\/turn down service was always timely and well done. 24 hour room service was taken advantage of several times and it never failed to deliver in very short order. We even ordered (quite by accident) from the Club Excellence menu and it was delivered to our room without question. It was only after the fact that we noticed there was a separate menu for that particular upgrade. We would stay at the Excellence again and would recommend it to anyone. The only thing we would recommend against is paying more for the Club Excellence - the standard accomodation is more than adequate and enough to keep you pampered. We loved it and can't wait to go back!
