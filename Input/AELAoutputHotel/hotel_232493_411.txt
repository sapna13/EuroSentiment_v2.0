{"text":"Hotel Nadia, Review from a students point of view. Stayed in the nadia hotel for 3 nights and just got back yesterday..... We were`nt looking for a total budget hotel so this seemed a good choice as it wasnt too expensive yet wasnt to shabby!Arrived at the hotel and first thing we saw was the stairs, this was funny for us as we are two young students who found them fun to run up but at the same time if your disabled\/older then you might want to be prepared for it so its worth mentioning.when we got into the check in counter we were given some maps\/drinks by the young pretty lady at the counter and she gave us our room key and wasreally nice all round and I would imagine they would help you out in any scenario you might get yourself into!got into our room and it was a bit small but very nice, tv, balcony, power shower, sink toilet, safe etc... and a general nice room all round, with no problems I can report on and we were both really pleased with it and we have a fairly high expectation on hotels as we are regular travalers.id say out of the whole of amsterdam this is probably the best location to be as there is a large supermarket 2 mins walk away plus your 2 mins walk away from the sqaure and personally id rather be staying 2 mins walk away from the sqaure as it quite loud and there are some dodgy looking peeps about so for the location of this hotel. It says on there website and brochure its about a 10 minute tram ride away from the central station... this is not true, for us it was about a 5 minute walk from the station on foot in the rain! so all in all, location this place is the best!to sum up my whole review, for all of you who are now looking through the endless hotel websites then reading bad reviews on them and getting annoyed with yourself, just stop there... im your avaredge travaler who normally spends around 60-80 pounds a night on a hotel and Id give this place a 3\/4 star rating and have no reall negative onit, so do book it! its really nice place to relax and enjoy amsterdam and id also say to ask for the balcony rooms and then you can enjoy some drinks on a night there if you want to get away from the amsterdam constant rush, all in all 10\/10 GREAT HOTEL!!! If nadia read this, let me say a big thanks to you and I will without a doubt be rebooking later this year, thanks.
