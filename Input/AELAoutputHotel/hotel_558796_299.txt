{"text":"Great Small and Friendly Hotel in Venice I am just back from a long weekend in Venice, having finally managed to get sufficiently organised to take my Mum after years of thinking about it.I was looking for a small, quiet, friendly hotel and I found it in the Al Ponte Mocenigo. The hotel is nothing too flashy, but at the same time a very pleasant. We took what I think was one of the smaller twin rooms on the ground floor. The room was very nicely decorated and the bathroom immaculate - my impression was that the place has been recently renovated by the quality and condition of the fixtures and fittings.The staff are extremely freindly and helpful - they went out of their way to book restaurants, provide directions, and generally answer any query we had - most impressive!The hotel does not serve evening meals (at least it did not whilst we were there). Breakfast is a continental affair (cereal, breads, fruit, yoghurt, etc) and weather permitting, this can be taken in a the outdoor courtyard, otherwise there is a small indoor area by reception. I think there is also the option of having it in your room.In terms of location, it is literally a minutes walk from the San Stae water bus stop and about 10 minutes walk to Rialto. Nearby there are a number of good restaurants, cheaper than those close to the main attractions. We went with the hotels recommendations are were not dissapoionted.The only negative comment I have is that staying in the ground floor room, you do tend to here people arriving back at the hotel at night. There is a door buzzer which is audible from the room, and then the inevitable chatter before folk retire. This did not overly concern me, but if you are sensitive to noise then perhaps you should avoid this room.
