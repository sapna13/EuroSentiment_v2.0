{"text":"Great Hotel, great rates Stayed 1 night on stop over home from Oz. Hotel was excellent, rooms very clean and well appointed, stayed on 43rd floor over looking city, and got fantastic views. We are a family of 4 including 2 teenages so managed to get connecting rooms. Beds very comfortable. Loads of rates available, would suggest getting rate including breakfast. This was buffet style and selection of food was enormous. Would also suggest you book via airline if you can, we travelled with Sinagpore Airlines who get very good rates unfortunatly all these rooms gone when we booked. Managed to get rooms at SG$360 each including breakfast. Did not recognise many of the negative comments noted on previous reviews. Could not use bars as kids were under age, 18 for girls, 21 for boys, but you can get a drink in the foyer cafe area with teenagers. Hotel was busy each time we went through reception, but with so many floors this is to be expected. Our check in was quick and efficient, check out is at a separate check out desk, and was again quick and efficient. Hotel will hold luggage if you have late flights, we used this facility and were happy with the security of storage. They alos have a hospitality room for you to use to freshen up before departure. Note that this is an oversize room and you share it with other travellers. Hotel does not have airport transfer facility, so we used cabs. Normal taxi cost via meter cost us SG$16, but you can use maxicab, for a fixed SG$35. ","annotations":[]}
