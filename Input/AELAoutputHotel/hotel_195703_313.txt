{"text":"Simply the Best! A tripadvisor member from Ontario, Canada There is simply no need to consider any other hotel in Florence than the Hotel Casci. It has it all! Approachable management\/staff are willing to do anything for you. The lovely breakfast in a room filled with merriment and chatter among the guests (a credit to management) include the best hot chocolate and cappuccino anywhere, and delicious traditional fruit tarts among many other food items. The guest rooms are very clean and include a safe, minifridge, color television and air conditioner; all were in excellent working condition. Our room (#11) was very quiet, had comfortable beds and a large bathroom (the towels which appear to be tablecloths and tea-towels do the job, and add to the uniqueness); it was lovely waking up to the sound of the bells from the Duomo (a few minute walk down the street). The lobby bar sells an assortment of hot and cold beverages, and has free internet services. Finally, the location simply can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be beat; it is within walking distance of everything. My husband and I spent a week here in June 2006.Our favourite restaurants included Il Latini (they are generous with food and drink samples), Ristorante Alfredo Sull√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©√πrno with its close proximity to the Ponte Vecchio, and the charming Trattoria Enzo e Piero. As well, there is a tiny eatery across the street from the Hotel Casci, on the way to the San Marco Square, that serves inexpensive traditional food (no tables). Interesting sights include Piazzale Michaelangelo for the city view (a hike uphill) and the interesting jasmine-covered Chiesa di San Miniato al Monte (church) where you can listen to a service\/Gregarian chanting from the monks at 5:30 p.m., and stroll through the unique cemetery. The local bus (from San Marco Square near the Hotel Casci) will take you to the hill-top suburb of Fiesole: here, you have a sweeping view of Florence below, especially from the Reggia Restaurant. There is an inexpensive leather shop (purses) nearby. The local bus (again, from San Marco Square) will also take you to the hill-top suburb of Settignano; here, you can enjoy icecream in the small charming piazza and take a lovely stroll to Villa Gamberaia. There are some shops you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ miss for unique souvenirs. One is Alice√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Masks Art Studio: the owner, Prof. Agostino Dessi is known throughout the world for his paper-mache masks. While in his shop, you feel like you are visiting Gippeto√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ workshop (yes√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√ºou will see Pinocchio masks). Another shop is Johnsons and Relatives (a few doors down from the Hotel Casci), for stunning marbelized hand-painted paper. Also, as you enter the Officina Profumo Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella, you will be immersed in the scent of soaps, perfumes and lotions that are apparently made from centuries- old recipes. One final recommendation, if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to spend a lot of time in Venice, we suggest a day trip by train (tickets available at a nearby travel shop from Hotel Casci). The three hour one-way trip travels through picturesque countryside, and is relatively inexpensive. Once you arrive at the train station in Venice, the half-hour water taxi ride along the Grand Canal to St. Mark√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Square is simply breath-taking! We thoroughly enjoyed our one week trip to Florence and highly recommend the Hotel Casci!
