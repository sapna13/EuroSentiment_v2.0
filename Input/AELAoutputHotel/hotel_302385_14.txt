{"text":"Loved it We stayed in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for our anniversary. The lawn and garden is excellent. Staff very nice, service are personal. They leave us with a message in the room before the check-out date to let us know we can still stay in the hotel lounge after check-out and extended discount for massage in the hotel, etc. Nusa Dua is a very nice resort area. This hotel unlike the Laguna and Westin nearby that has bale that you can do a lazy lying at night to enjoy the sea breeze. On a couple of nights, we just take a 3 minutes walk along the beach to the nearby hotels for bale and sip a drink there. Transportation is sth that you have to prepare for. There is no shuttle bus in the hotel and nusa dua area, except a shuttle to Bali Collection, which runs every 1 hour till 10pm. You have to take a taxi to wherever you go. Taxi service in the hotel are pricy, like USD15 for a ride to Kuta. But many restaurant has pick up service. For many nights, we asked the restuarant for a pick up for dinner, then just do some shopping and foul around in Seminyak, Kuta, Jimbaran, then take a taxi back to save one trip.We tried snorkelling in Nusa Dua beach with hawkers in the beach. It is a 10 mins ride by boat to the snorkelling area, costs USD30 for 2 pax for 1 hour. 1 hour is actually enough.Food in the hotel are delicious. It costs like USD40++ (excluding drink) for a Korean bbq dinner for 2. Like other 5 star hotels nearby, the drinks are pricy, like USD8++ for a cocktail, USD2++ for a small bottle of water. There is no kiosk or convenient store within walkable distance.We tried the Embrace spa package for 2 pax for 2.5 hours in one of the spa villa at USD190++. It is absolutely excellent and worth the money. There is a private plunge pool, jacuzzi and steam room in the villa for the couple, so enjoy the complete privacy. You can enjoy other spa facilities for the whole day, like the spa lap pool. The staff there said the spa lap pool has underwater music facilities, though i really cannot hear, it is very relaxing and enjoyable. I tried Well Being Spa in Seminyak (a local spa outside) as well at USD64 for 3 hours, it is absolutely not comparable, worth to pay more in the hotel.
