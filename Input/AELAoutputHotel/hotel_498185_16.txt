{"text":"Good location and comfortable I enjoyed my stay at Hotel de las Letras. When I arrived, I was upgraded to bigger room which was room 605. It was on the top floor and had an entrance hall, bedroom and bathroom. The bedroom had 6 large windows and was full of light. It was a great size, with a comfy bed, flat-screen tv, stereo and mini-bar. It also had a small sofa and brochures about Madrid, which helped me plan my stay. The hall had a wardrobe, which was lit inside, a safe and a box full of chocolate and snacks (not free). The location of the Gran Via was excellent as it was a short walk to the 3 Art Galleries, Puerta de Sol, Palacio Real, Salamanca shopping district, Chueca etc.The only negative was the airconditioning, which struggled to cope with the heat on my first night and went down as far as 27C. After leaving it on all day, my room cooled down to 22C, but I had to switch it off at night because it was so loud. I think it may have been because my room had so many windows and so more sensitive to the heat. The bathroom didn√à?√¨t have airconditioning or a fan, so was warm at all times.The breakfast was included in the price of my room and had plenty of choice. The quality of the room-service was also good. The staff in the hotel were helpful and friendly. There was free internet access in the Biblioteca and the Spa looked nice, although I didn use it. The gym is a treadmill and exercise-bike, so it is small. Despite the airconditioning problem on the first night, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I shopped around for a good price at this hotel, so would say it was value for money.
