{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! I always go by the reviews on Trip Advisor; 9\/10 cases they are spot on!! Again, Hispanos 7 Suiza is no exception. Booked 3 nights at this apartment hotel after reading the rave reviews here.And I was overjoyed when I arrived with my parents, tired and worn out after a long delay with flights and taxi journey, to find that the front of the hotel is really nice with big lights and full glass walls, which made us feel very safe (plus it's a lot easier to find home in the dark after too much sangria!). Friendly and helpful staff, esp. the 2 staff on our departure date. Offered to book us a taxi and kept our luggages (as we weren't leaving until the evening and check-out time is noon) without any prob.Apartment itself is massive. Lovely balcony, good-sized kitchen with everything - washing machine, dishwasher, fridge etc, living\/dining room, 2 bedrooms (1 en-suite) plus a large bathroom. Massage shower in en-suite bathroom and a large bathtub in the other. So nice to sit outside in the balcony after a long day.Our rates inc breakfasts. Again, fantastic. Lots to choose (hot and cold meat, eggs, bacon, bread....). We dined at the cafeteria area which is downstairs of their top restaurant, with vintage cars everywhere. Felt very posh!Location is unbeatable. Literally 100 yards from Sagrada Familia, L5 and L2 metro lines and the Bus Turistic stop. Lots of restaurants around. Area is residential and felt very safe, although there were 3 of us!Will definitely stay here again whenever I visit Barcelona.
