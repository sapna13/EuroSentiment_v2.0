{"text":"Fine but not worth a special trip We flew into Phoenix to go to Sedona and the Grand Canyon. We weren't sure where to stay in Phoenix, so looked on Tripadvisor for help. I wanted a great pool for my two kids, and decided to split our time in Phoenix between Tapatio Cliffs and the Pointe South Mountain Resort.Tapatio Cliffs is an attractive hotel built on a cliff. There are many pools, the most popular for kids being the Falls complex, with one good water slide, an irregular shaped pool with plenty of play space and a jacuzzi. It was nice, but not spectacular. The rooms were clean and well decorated. I don't like though, having the toilet and tub in a separate area from the sink. It seems crazy to have a hall between them, but oh well. The suite also has a sitting area with a TV, then you pass through the hall with the bathroom facilities into a bedroom, nicely furnished. There is a small fridge in the suite with freezer, and two TV's - one in the sitiing area and one in the bedroom. This was nice for me as I could put the kids to sleep and still read or watch TV in the sitting room.The onsite restaurants were good, but pricey.To be honest, if I returned to Phoenix I would stay at the Pointe South Mountain resort instead, as their pool complex is much much bigger, better and more fun. The Falls pool complex at Tapatio Cliffs is OK, but might bore kids after a day or two. ","annotations":[]}
