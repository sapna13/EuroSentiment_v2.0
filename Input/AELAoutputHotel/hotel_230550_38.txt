{"text":"A mature view We visited the hotel in early May as part of a group travelling through Germany on the railways. Vast difference of expectations within our group - we were happy with our room (which did have a bath), but it was not acceptable for some of our group who were mature  well travelled. The configuration of the rooms (bath\/shower curtained off from the bedroom) was quite unacceptable for mature couples and friends sharing.On the plus side - the position was great - public transport excellent - even the Berlin Tour Bus picked up at the hotel.The hotel was next door to the SBan train station.Breakfast was OK (we have travelled extensively and judge a hotel by it's breakfast )- so even though this was pretty good, it was not excellent.The great recommendation was the service - our TV reception broke down at 17.00 on Sat evening - and reception could not fix it. We had almost accepted that we were going to give up - but the maintenance guy called in - diagnosed the problem and disppeared at 5pm on a bank holiday Saturday. We assumed that was it for the weekend - but 50 mins later, he knocked on the door with the required replacement part. In the UK - you would undoubtable have been left until after the weekend.Full marks to the hotel for service.One black mark - In the bar I paid 16.50 Euros for a large glass of red wine described as 'Californian'by the waitress which at the current exchange rate was approx. √ä√£¬¢12. The price was not offered when I ordered, and the following day I checked the price list which proved it was correct. However - I still feel cheated. Do not discount this hotel - we travelled as part of a pre-booked group, and found the whole service excellent.Give it a try.Judith\/Mike ","annotations":[]}
