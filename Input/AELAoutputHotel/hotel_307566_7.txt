{"text":"Not what it used to be We stayed at the Patra about 3 years ago and really loved it. So when we decided to go back to Bali (for the 4th time) we just booked the Patra without a thought. That was a bi mistake !!!When booking we specified a non smoking room ... but that's not what we got. After arriving in the room we called reception and let them know we weren't happy. After a lot of mucking around we were promised a move the following day. When time came to move (we had 2 interconnecting rooms as the were 4 of us) we had one room ok the other still stank of smoke. The problem was we were travelling with our teenage daughters and we didn't want to be in different parts of the resort. We objected again ... and after another few hours and a room 'treatment' to get rid of the smell we moved again.The final result was 2 rooms free of smoke smells but not interconnecting.All in all, whilst they were 'very sorry' it didn't help us. In short the first two days of the holidays were ruined.Last time we were there we thought the breakfast was great ... this time very, very ordinary. And the place is looking very tired. I heard that the place is about to undergo a major renovation. It's well overdue.I've previously said on this site that the Patra was great, and at the time it was true. But things change.We have booked to go back to Bali in March next year ... but the Patra is definitely off the list. A real shame !! ","annotations":[]}
