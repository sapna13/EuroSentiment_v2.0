{"text":"never again- hugely overpriced i suggested the axel hotel for some friends visiting me from abroad. When they checked into the suite, they had various comments regarding the lack of thought in this hotel. i checked out their room, as i felt bad for suggesting it. i have worked for an airline for 18 years, so i have a bit of insight on all ranges of hotels. After seeing the place, i would NOT suggest that anyone pays these over-inflated prices - there are many better options in barcelona at half the price.the Suite had an open plan bathroom, which was nice. but the toilet had no door, so you had to hear everyone on the loo - unacceptable. The showers DO NOT have thermostatic controls, why - they cost marginally more?the wardrobe is cheap chrome, open air and ugly. so you are faced with seeing your clothes and suitcases during your entire stay. one of the friends was on medication needing refrigeration, they DO NOT have fridges or minibars or tea coffee making facilities - unacceptable. they have the cheapest, nastiest flat tv that sticks out of the wall. on top of that, and yet even worse, you get a cheap samsung stereo with huge ugly speakers that hang either side of the bed. surely an afterthought in that orange wood colour. all in all, it feels like a cheap conversion with fake wood floors and substandard fittings. some of the lighting was interesting, though was very home-made and will date quickly.my friends returned to the Axel after a stay in Ibiza, this time they stayed in a deluxe room, which was as above, but with a bathroom with a door.They also commented that the staff were unfriendly, did not know anything about the local gay area, and were generally uninterested in their guests. (they could rarely get a taxi, and were not helped to find one)i also noticed they must use half of the power grid on lighting the guest hallways, it is truly painful lighting and shopping mall like design. though i loved the bottles of chilled water on every floorwhat more can i say, i will never suggest that anyone stays here. rl, bcn ","annotations":[{"endOffset":958,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":955},{"endOffset":965,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":959}]}
