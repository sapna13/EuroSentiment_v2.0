{"text":"Excellent value and location Arrived and was pleased by the friendly reception staff. Smallish lobby is smart and topped off by a steel waterfall originating in the Club Room on the floor above.The Affinia website isn't particulary clear, I thought this was an all suite hotel, but it isn't. I had a standard queen room. I was expecting a small kitchen but there wasn't one. No problem though.The room was a good size, especially for New York, and the fittings were of a 3* or 4* standard. Good sized bathroom with marble surfaces. Aveda products are excellent.Good sized closet (although, as a man, I ignored it and lived out of my bag).Bed was exceptionally comfortable with a pillow top mattress (basically a layer of pillow padding across the mattress). There is a slightly gimmicky pillow menu where one can choose from three of four pillow options. Again, I am male, and was staying alone, so ignored, it.I didn't use the Club Room so can't comment. Don't go for the $14 breakfast (not included in room rates). There are a million places in Manhattan to go for a better (and better value) breakfast. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but there IS room service from a restaurant (MINT) across the street.I was in room 405. This was obviously on the 4th floor. You can hear some noise from 3rd avenue, but it didn't bother me. The view from rooms on this side of the hotel isn't that great - just a brick wall. I could see 3rd avenue at an angle, but again, no real problem.Location is excellent. Turn right out of the hotel and 10 mins later you are at the Rockerfeller Center, 15 mins and you are just north of Times Square. Great deli around the corner to the right outside the hotel, or a larger supermarket (Associated) on Second Avenue (south a bit).I booked this as part of a deal with flight from the UK, so I couldn't see the hotel price, but I expect it was about $150 - $200. At that price it's great value. Don't hesitate to book this hotel if you can get it at less than $250 a night.
