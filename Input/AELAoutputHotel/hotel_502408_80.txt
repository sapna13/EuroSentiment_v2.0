{"text":"Just what we were looking for Based on the reviews from the site, I felt pretty comfortable booking at the Affinia 50 and we weren't disappointed. There were 4 of us (8  10 year old) and we had so much room. The location was great. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Rome, the doorman greeted us with a Welcome home when we arrived. The gave my wife a flower on Mother's Day when we checked out. Only negative was a smaller bathroom with 4 of us, but we used the mini-kitchen sink as an alternate place to brush teeth, get a drink of water, etc. I love finding out good things to do from these reviews so I will add in a couple. There is a bagel place just around the corner called Ess a Bagel. It was listed in our tour book as one of the best in NYC. We ate there 3 out of 4 days. For a family of 4, out breakfast bill came to about $14 each day. We walked to the Comfort Diner one day and that was a good sit down traditional breakfast place too. Two other family friendly places the kids loved, Ellen's Stardust Diner near Times Square. The waiters  waitresses sing between waiting on tables. The kids loved it. Food was pretty good diner fare too. The second place was The Peanut Butter Company in Greenwich Village. My daughter lives on peanut butter so this was one of her highlights. It was a small little hole in the wall and definitely off the beaten track. It was fun to get away from the touristy stuff and see real people(not tourists) going about their daily lives. You see apartment buildings  parks  pickup basketball games, etc. Kids loved the food and the general neighborhood feel.Since this was for the Affinia, I will wrap up and say I would definitely stay here again. Especially compared to the other options directly in the area and for the price.
