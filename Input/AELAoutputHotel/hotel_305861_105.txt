{"text":"What great value! When we came through Hong Kong in June after an absence of several years we decided to stay on the Hong Kong side, as a change from Kowloon where we had always stayed previously.We booked the Metropark through Asia Reservations, who undercut everyone else, and took both the upgrade to a Harbour View room and the full breakfast package which was offered when we booked - but is not showing on the website now - give them a call and ask for it. Both additions were worthwhile. The view from our 16th floor room looking out to the harbour over the tennis courts and soccer fields of Victoria Park was like a breath of fresh air, in such contrast to the crowded high rise buildings that cover so much of Hong Kong. The hotel it is a little away from the centre of Causway Bay shopping, but still an easy 15 minutes walk, and in any event the MRT station is just across the nearest intersection giving access to one of the most user friendly public transport systems anywhere.The room was smallish, like all Hong Kong hotel rooms, but came with all necessary conveniences, including free cable connection to broadband internet. Add a very comprehensive buffet breakfast, helpful friendly staff, and you have a value recipe which is hard to top. Tip to travellers - don't miss the quality shopping at nearby Times Square - and the top grade restaurants on the top four floors offering a variety of cuisines at very reasonable prices.
