{"text":"Great experience at Silver Cloud Lake Union My husband, 13 year old son and I stayed at Silver Cloud Lake Union for 5 nights in late March - early April. The room we had was perfect for us...a king size bed  TV, with a separate sitting area divided with pocket doors featuring a sleeper-sofa, micro, fridge and sink, and a plasma screen TV! The reasonable room rate featured a fantastic breakfast, including make your own waffles, several bread and muffin selections, cheese, boiled eggs, yogurt, cereal, fresh fruit and juice...and really good coffee! There was also free internet in the room and a business center downstairs where we printed our boarding passes for the return flight home. The free shuttle was great, took us to all the tourist spots we wanted to see: Seattle Center (Space Needle, Experience Music Project, Science Fiction Museum, Key Arena, etc...), Pike Place Market, Seattle Aquarium, Pioneer Square, Downtown...it runs from the hotel every 30 minutes and can get full, so you do have to plan a bit in advance, but we had no troubles reserving space. The staff were all unfailingly polite and helpful. The indoor pool and jacuzzi were a blessing for us after a long hard day sightseeing. Lake Union is a bit out of the way from downtown, but we liked that. The marina area across the street has a good selection of restaurants and is interesting in itself. We had a great time in this beautiful city, and though cloudy and chilly, it barely rained at all during our visit.
