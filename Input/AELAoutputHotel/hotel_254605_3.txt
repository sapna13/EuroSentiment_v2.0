{"text":"Hotel 41 - what a gem! Well, what a fantastic hotel. Before i arrived i had emailed them to see if i could get an upgrade(to a superior room for free) for my wife and i as it was our anniversary. When we turned up not only had they upgraded us for free, but also the other couple we were travelling with got upgraded. This hotel is so close to times square, about 40 yards from where the ball drops in times square every new year's eve, but being on a side street, it was very quiet. Check in was quick and easy, they give you a free bottle of water each. We stayed in room 201 and 202. these rooms face out onto the main street. the rooms are clean and ok in size, you get a double bed, writing desk, full size fridge and 2 bedside units that are wall hung. The air conditioning unit blows out hot and cold air as you wish via the digital thermostate on the wall. There is also a built in double wardrobe with drawers beneath. In the bathroom it is very clean, wash hand basin, toilet, double shower and hairdryer - very good. The aveda toiletries get replenished every day (inc sun) and these are shampoo, conditioner and moisturising lotion (excellent on the feet after a long day walking!). Downstairs in bar 41, the breakfast is served daily with free hot drinks until 4pm from a self service machine. We booked with expedia and booking was on a no breakfast booking, but when we turned up at the hotel they said breakfast was included - result! - nobody checked anyway. Breakfast consisted of danish pastries, bagels, croissants, water, orange juice and coffee. latte, cappa, hot chocolate etc... in the evenings on a week night beware of the bar as it gets verey very crowded, the queue is like 3 deep to get a drink as all the workers pile in there as it is happy hour for several hours.Would I return - without a doubt. Location, cleanliness and the staff make this a wonderful hotel. If you are worried about room sizes, dont be - im used to staying in suites in dubai where they are huge and the room sizes here are fine! if you want to stay in your room all the time... stay at home.
