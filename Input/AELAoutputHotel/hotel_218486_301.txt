{"text":"The Week Of Discuss and Disappointment Afriend and I stayed from 7\/28-8\/4\/06,it was a low class 3 star dump when you are used to other. Pools were dirty, the guests at the swim up I assume thought they were to just drink and urinate in the pool all day as they did not get out to use the restroom so we did not get back in after the first episode. The beach was dirty, the beach shop people attack you trying to get you to buy their JUNK, the people at the resort want to take you to another of their five star Ocean Barvaro Motels...Much better then this to see...what? well, you get nagged to go with Felix, and the other is nicer.Pick and chose your food,all pretty much the same 3rd rate taste. A quant coffee house IF you have never been in a nice one in the states or other countries such as Italy or Spain. Our A\/C had to be maintenanced 2-3 times daily, I called the manager on the 4th day, after showing the man what needed to be done, it was then fixed. Not much english, only spanish. English is only understood when it is to their advantage we quickly learned.No water pressure in the shower, may have to flush toilet twice due to low water level with urination to have paper go down. People were waiting 4-6 hours upon our arrival for check-in, we waited 2, I called our agent, within 5 minutes we had our room, I had made the desk clerks aware I was placing the call from my cell. PLEASE do so or you will wait as most did on a daily basis as we seen them come in right to our last day of departure. If you are a 5 star person and want quality and peace without chaos,go elsewhere, other class of folks may enjoy the chaos and the lack of wonderful nighly entertainment. For those of us who enjoy finer please reconsider this, and I came home with 32 mosquito bites due to green moldy water in the ponds.
