{"text":"Good for business travel; worthless as a resort For a business traveler, this hotel has some things to offer, namely: nice beds and bathrooms, proximity to the airport, decent in-house restaurants, an air of quasi-luxury, and a passable bar\/lounge. With that in mind, memo to hotel execs: two things any business hotel absolutely must have are (1) easy access to Starbucks --FAIL-- and (2) wireless internet in every room --FAIL. These are not hard to accomplish, and something pretty much every Hampton Inn has managed by now. So even as a business hotel, it misses the mark.As a resort, I would love to have been in on the meeting which informed the planning and decisions behind this property. It's as though they decided to have a resort and left all the planning to someone who had never been on vacation. First --why on earth would you situate a resort on the most inhospitably windy point on the entire island. The wind is insufferable, strong, constant, and nagging. It blows the dirt-like sand everywhere, and every chaise is coated to the point where they don't appear blue, but brown. You can't hear the person next to you, it's so loud. I'm surprised more reviews don't mention this. It is very, very inhospitable, the windiness (the staff told me the wind was typical). Another point about location -- remote from everything. $50 bucks round trip to Old San Juan.If you are going to have a windy beach and pool area, for god's sake, heat the pool. I'm here on a weekend that is jam-packed, and have seen 9-10 people use the frigid pool the entire time. It is FREEZING, and when you get out, the wind is chilling. It doesn't help that the pool is beneath a forest of palm trees that effectively blocks the sun almost entirely. The hot tub has the usual resort problems. It's not hot. It's filled with infants and screaming children. Why bother, really?The gym has a lot of decent equipment packed into a regular-sized hotel room. It's unacceptable and pathetic. If they moved the same exact equipment into a space three times the size, it would be decent and even good. They should do away with the yoga studio (and I do yoga every day, so I'm not putting yoga down), and expand the gym facility or just do away with it altogether. It's almost dangerous how packed it is. Again, it appears to have been planned by someone who does not use gyms. Nice idea, bad execution.On the upside -- great staff, good concierge, great in-house restaurants, picturesque. Rooms are nice, though the standard room has a fairly small window and it gets a little dark. The showerhead sucks but decent water pressure. Tips -- the El San Juan Hotel down the road has 2 Starbucks and a very good restaurant called Coco that was pretty empty. The hamachi appetizer is good, crab balls were good, drinks were amazing. The little gelato store 2 buildings down has cheap, decent lunch and great gelato. Walgreens next to that for snacks, cokes, and lotion. Dont bother with Ritz poolside food and drinks. Lame on all accounts. BLT Steak and Il Mulino both fine. in sum, the very, very low end of the Ritz brand. Not a good location for laid back sun, and poorly planned\/designed. Go somewhere else for fun.
