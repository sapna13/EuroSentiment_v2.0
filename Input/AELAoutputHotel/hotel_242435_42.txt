{"text":"The Hyatt was outstanding First of all, thank you to everyone who has submitted reviews on Tripadvisor. These really helped me plan what was an amazing holiday in Hawaii (I returned only a few days ago).I stayed at four hotels during my stay, so I will review the other ones separately on the website (being Westin Moana Surfrider Waikiki, Four Seasons Resort Maui and Westin Resort Maui).I was extremely impressed by the Hyatt Regency. It was in a great location across the road from the beach, in the centre of activity, and offered superior hotel facilities. From my perspective, it was probably the best place to stay in Waikiki if you wanted that 5 star hotel feel as it was the largest hotel there, featured an impressive lobby and interior, nice guest rooms (all of which had balconies\/lanais) and had a range of restaurants, high-end retail shopping and many other facilities (even a doctor's surgery which I found surprising).I booked a Deluxe Ocean view room to ensure I had a good view of the beach (I had read several reviews to indicate that Partial Ocean view rooms in hotels generally provided views of buildings or mountains, with just a speck of water!). My other room specifications were for a room in the Diamond Tower, as suggested by other reviewers (I think due to views down the beach towards the main area of Waikiki) and a room higher in the hotel to avoid any street noise. The hotel offered me the exact type of room I wanted which demonstrated their high level of customer service from the beginning.In fact, in other reviews I had read some people mentioned about good or bad customer service at hotels generally, which I hadn't previously perceived as important, but I was given such good treatment at the Hyatt I realised how much I appreciated this. I was quite surprised at how friendly and helpful the staff were.In terms of the restaurants, I only went to the Terrace Grille for the breakfast buffet, which was excellent. Again, the staff were very attentive. The restaurant was open-air and overlooked the beach, so it was a nice way to start the day. There were also other restaurants in the hotel which looked nice (including an award-winning restaurant).All in all, my stay at the Hyatt was excellent and I will be keen to book there again when I return to Hawaii (hopefully soon).
