{"text":"Too many loud people This was my second time staying at this hotel. My first was two years ago as a newlywed. This time, I came with my husband, one year old son and another couple. Last time I was very impressed. We stayed on the club level and the hotel did not seem crowded. I chose the Ritz again because we wanted a beach accessible resort style hotel where everyone would always have something to do. I do not like the feel of Nusa Dua (too manicured and flat.) I have never stayed at another Balinese beach, but liked the waves of Jimbaran. We stayed for 3 days exclusively within the hotel and then went to Ubud (Komaneka) for 5 days. This time I have mixed feeling about our stay.The setting (on the cliff), the beach , saltwater pool, Kisik, Dava martini lounge for drinks, and parts of the landscape are incredible. Unfortunately, I often felt that there were several bus loads of tourists with a package deal who were dropped off daily. Also, the food and the level of service were inconsistence.  We chose an ocean view room. We would have booked the club level, but were unable to, because children are not allowed. Eating at the Padi restaurant breakfast buffet was a horrible experience. It was too crowded, and I encountered a very rude guest. Actually, I would avoid this restaurant all together. We also went there for dinner and the Thai food and service was not very good. Otherwise we had a sunset dinner at Kisik, pool-side meals, and breakfast at Dava which were all good. During the day, we went to the Kuba beach which was practically empty. Kuba beach is one of my favorite features of the RItz. We also enjoyed the main pool and the saltwater pool. My son had fun in the play room. They should have more outside toys\/structures with shade. The children's pool should be updated. Ths spa is nice. I did not have the best massage or body scrub, but it was good. There is a variety of treatments. Last time our treatments were during the day. This time they were at night. I preferred this. When I left my massage room, the enviornment outside was so quiet and peaceful. All the staff was very nice. They did not seem fake. I think the Balinese in general are very warm and friendly. The people and their strong traditions and beliefs are why my husband keep coming back to Bali. I asked a waiter about the 10 % service charge on everything. All the staff split this. This resort is not that child friendly. I am referring to all the stairs. We brought our stroller everywhere because it serves as a high chair too. (Though, there were sturdy\/belted high chairs at the restaurants.) This was sometimes very difficult. I saw one wheelchair, but am not sure how they managed to get everywhere except for the golf carts. I did feel comfortable with my son being loud and active, because there was so much going on. And, there was plenty of grass for him to run on. When we stayed in Ubud (Komaneka) I often felt that he was making too much noise. Overall, my friends and I enjoyed our stay. It was there first time, and they though the place was beautiful. This is a good place if you are with big group with varied interests. If you stay here, stay at the club level and avoid the high season. I have a feeling that the rooms are being sold with a package deal in some countries, so this may never happen. The grounds and pool are very beautiful. I am glad that we did stay here at least once. If you don't stay here, come to Dava for a martini. Next time, I will try a different hotel .
