{"text":"Professional, polished customer service I visit Singapore regularly on business and, whenever possible, ask my clients to book me into The Conrad. Unfortunately they don't all do this as it isn't the cheapest hotel in towwn, but it always makes the return a little bit sweeter!The service is just first rate. It's warm, genuine and welcoming without being cloying. The rooms are a good size, and if you're lucky enough to get an Executive Floor room, you'll get a good plasma or LCD TV as well. My only complaint is that the TV's are on a wall that means you can't lie flat out and watch through your feet! (Something everyone wants to do after a hard day of meetings!)Room service food is average plus, but again the service is terrific and friendly. This is a hotel where people will actually talk to you! Not a great choice of hotel restaurants, but Golden Peony is quite good, and the hot and sour soup with lobster excellent. Heaps of restaurants nearby as well.Location is great and will be even better in a couple of years when the new MRT station opens up nearby, but even now, City Hall is only an easy 10 minute underground, airconditioned walk away. Suntec Exhibition Centre is just across the road, and the Paulaner Brewhouse is next door and offers great German beer.But, back to the hotel. Comfortable, well equipped rooms that are clean, light and airy, good facilities, good pool and spa, clean modern gym, convenient location....but I always come back to the service. It is willing, warm and welcoming. A hotel that is worth trying!
