{"text":"A Perfect Hotel! We spent 6 glorious days at Hotel Santa Maria Novella over Easter. The hotel was full of travelers but the service was personal and impeccable. Our daughter, who had been living in Florence for several months, warned us that European hotels were less than impressive. She got to the hotel before we did and called us to say the place was amazing. She was right! The furnishings were lovely, the amenities were wonderful. We had a Junior Suite (room 621) for the 3 of us. It wasn't enormous but it suited us perfectly. Best of all we had two balconies - a small balcony overlooking the rooftops and a larger balcony overlooking the Piazza Santa Maria Novella. Glorious! (The construction should soon be finished in the square and then it will be perfect, although my husband loved watching the workmen while he relaxed!) A few steps away was a rooftop terrace that looked out to the Duomo. We could see the fireworks from the exploding cart on Easter morning. I had read some reviews that said the area was dicey because of the proximity to the train station. Not true - it was just fine. The proximity to the train station and bus station (a few minutes walk) was great as it made traveling around the area so easy. Even better was the central location as we walked to almost every site in town. We felt we were so close to everything yet away from the main fray of the Duomo. The outstanding Trattoria Croce al Trebbio restaurant was literally around the corner. The very helpful people working the desk made reservations there for us and also recommended some other wonderful restaurants for us. They were so helpful. The breakfast was very good, if repetitive, and the cappuccino was perfect. We would love to return to Florence some day and would be sure to stay in this warm, friendly and charming hotel.
