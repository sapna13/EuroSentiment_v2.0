{"text":"Absolutely Loved It!!! We arrived in Punta Cana from a long flight from Denver and we absolutely amazed at what a beautiful place this was. To be expected:The vendors, taxi drivers and others are real pushy at the airport. You need to be careful and follow your paperwork and locate your travel desk if you booked through an agency. Having done this before, I knew what to expect and pushed my way through.I see most people complained about the roads to their hotel, come on, these roads are expected here and it's the same in Mexico. Get over it, as in an hour (more or less) you will arrive at your hotel to paradise. I do have to admit, it was tiring after a long day of traveling, but when we arrived at the hotel, awwww, paradise!Good:Everything about the hotel was great.......Our room was clean, cool and nice. The staff were great although we encountered a few ladies that looked like they had a bad day working the restaurant. But otherwise, the staff treated everyone well and were very attentive to our needs.The room was great, a four poster bed, well stocked mini fridge, air conditioning, great view, turn down service.Great music performed by a live band kept us going by the Cafe Kafe bar outside. Kudos to Braulio, the bartender there, he was lively, fun and danced his way around the bar entertaining all of us while making drinks with a smile.Beautiful garden that brought peace of mind when you walked through it. The ponds were filled with tons of fish, turtles, and there were a pair of parrots hanging out, birds and even a rooster, hen and family wandering around. They have avocado and lime trees, small bridges and peacocks. Cocolocos and mamajuana are good, but you need to watch out, those mamajuanas will get ya! It serves as a great shot and they say it's an aphrodisiac as well...see for yourself! LOL They do serve no name brand alcohol with most drinks, but will happily serve you name brand as well, but you have to ask for it.Food was good for the most part. We ate at the Lobster House, Toscana and The Grill for dinner. The lobster was great, I had it grilled with a garlic butter sauce..yummy! Cyprian was a great server at The Grill. The breakfast buffet was good with lots of fruit and breakfast items to choose from including pancakes and omelettes.The beach was clean, tidy and had plenty of chairs to choose from with beachside service including drinks and mini pizzas served right at your chair.We did the Saona Island and Bavaro water excursions. They were just as great as the review read here. We snorkled and had a blast. Raul from Bavaro water excursion was a great snorkle guide!Not so good:It rained heavily one night were were there, but it didn't affect our trip or plans, but the rain is heavy and brings out those pesky mosquitos. Mosquitos---ugh, I wore Deep Woods Off spray - which is the heavy duty stuff and they still got me good. Yet, my boyfriend did get one single bite....darn pesky mosquitos.Something (or someone) was floating in the ocean on one day at the beach. The lifeguards on duty steadily watched it, yet, didn't bother to take a seadoo out to check it out. I don't know what it was and everyone was trying to draw conclusions, driftwood maybe? But right before that, my boyfriend saved someone who had swam out past the bouy (people - they are there for a reason, don't swim past them...) and brought her to shore. By the time he brought her to shore, the lifeguard was still trying to put on his boogie board tie.....hmmmm. Be careful, the water can be rough.Vendors in Santo Domingo plaza are pushy and do give you free things, yet want to charge you for them. Be aware, just ignore them and keep walking or they will sweep you up. But I do have to admit that one sold t-shirts and we got them for a bargain.Overall, this was a great experience and I would recommend it to everyone. Keep one thing in mind, as you do not have to tip, I would still recommend you carry at least $100 worth of $1 and $5 bills for the great service they provide. You will still receive it whether or not you tip.
