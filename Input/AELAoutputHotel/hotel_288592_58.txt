{"text":"Helpful Staff, Comfortable  First time at a Conrad Hilton hotel. The downtown location is ok, as always in Miami there's construction going on. You have to take the elevator up 20 flights to get to the lobby, then go to a seperate set of elevators to go down to your room. Our King, Bay View room had a view of the tennis courts and pool, plus the condo building directly in front of the hotel. So it was a partial view. The bed was yummy and sheets were luxurious (best part of the room). There was a desk and a comfortable lounge chaise in the room as well. The bathroom was covered in marble, seperate tub, long vanity counter top, good lighting. The stand up shower wasn't all that great. Good water pressure, but there's no place to put your shampoo, soaps, or to comfortably shave your legs (ladies). Plus, all the water leaked through the bottom of the glass shower door - put down lots of towels or you'll slip on those marble floors. Turn down service brought two free bottles of water ($8 in the mini-bar). Great continental breakfast, expect to sit down and order off the menu. If you're on the go, have them box it up, bkfst is great and free (if you have a pass, ask the front desk for one). There's also a coffee maker in the room if you don't want to walk down in the mornings. Morton's Steakhouse is across the street, but there's a restaurant in the hotel, too. You'll definitely need a car, or a cab, to get to the beaches. Overall, ok for business, but not for pleasure.
