{"text":"Best Time Ever My friend and I stayed at this resort from dec10\/06 to dec 17\/06 and we had a blast. We mostly stayed at the pool but we spent one morning at the beach which was fun with the waves.(just hold on to your bathing suit) Our room was clean, no problems with air condioner, buffet was good although by the end of the week I was tired of it. It is a lot of the same stuff everyday but not a big deal. We ate at the mexican twice it was great and brazilian once and left half way through it was taking a long time to bing everything out and we weren't that hungry anyway. We did 2 day trips. We did the saona island which I would not recommend. It started at 0630 in the lobby then 2.5hr bus to the boat then 2 hr on the boat to the island. While at the island you are constantly harrassed by people trying to sell you things. Then it took 1hr back to bus by speedboat then back on the bus for another 2.5hr. When we got back we were so tired we went to bed. The other one was the shopping tour which was excellant for only $22. They take you to the rum factory and show you where to buy things so you won't get ripped off. My tips if you go to this place: bring bug spray, your own facecloth(they don't supply them) and remember if you go looking for faults you are going to find them but this place is great I will definatly go here again.
