{"text":"We will never come back and you should not waste your time and money there - First of everything: this hotel should be 2 to 21\/2. Never 4, 41\/2 or even 5 as they claim. Old hotel with old rooms.- Food average: Buffet were better than the ala-cart. Actually, the food in the ala-cart was terrible. (Note: Cuba is not like this)- Service: very bad. They just don't care for us. Why? We had already payed and stocked there for 7 days with no other place to go, so why care? (Note: Cuba is not like this)- I couldn't leave my wife for 5 minutes. Too much harassment and too little respect and privacy. (Note: Cuba is not like this)- They try to sell their club advantage every time you cross with someone from the hotel club advantage (they are every where). We went to rest and have fun, not to buy anything. Offer one time and if you don't want they should respect. They don't do this. (Note: Cuba is not like this)We visit another resort Paradisus Punta Cana Resort (Sol Melia), that is away better and money worth.Advise: When traveling to caribe:1st) Never stay in a resort that belongs to the local government or local business. Choose one that is international like Sol Melia, Sandals, Club Med, etc.2nd) Don't be cheep. You get what you pay for.3rd) Read many and many reviews although people react different and they go in different periods in the year. Summer sometimes is good in some locations and bad in others.4th) Length: 4 to 5 days is the best. You never get boring and it is not too long if the place is not good or you are not enjoying the place.5th) When buying from Expedia (or other agencies), ask how many people are going to the same resort as you. You don't want to be the only one and everybody else in another resort. It looks like you could be making a bad decision.
