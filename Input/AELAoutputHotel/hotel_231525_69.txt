{"text":"Excellent. Want to go back soon please! My wife and I stayed between 14 - 17 March, and would certainly stay here again. It has all been said before - excellent staff; very clean room; all the staff speak to you (that doesn't happen everywhere!), and the position could not be better. The complimentary drinks and pastries were very welcome. If you want guaranteed absolute silence day and night though, don't stay here. The hotel is in the middle of a very busy city and, yes, you might be disturbed. We occasionally heard the bells (I am sure they didn't ring all night), and there was a wonderful argument (known as a domestic in the UK) in the alley one evening. I wish my Spanish or Catalan had been better as I am sure I would have learn't some very useful words! It was over as quick as it started, and we both slept very well every night. Stay here, and I dont think you will be disappointed.It was my Wife's birthday whilst we were there, and we had not told the hotel. When we returned on birthday evening there was some chocolates and a very nice hand-written note of congratulation waiting for her in our room from the hotel - a very nice touch that was appreciated. They could only have got the date from her passport copied on arrival - well spotted!We got breakfast out every day, usually for about 7 - 8 Euros each. The bar in the shopping precinct (out of hotel door, turn right, turn right into covered shopping area and walk through) was good. We had excellent lunches (3 courses + drink) for 10 Euros each at Mamacafe (c\/del Dr Joaquim Dou) and Anima (c\/dels Angels), both in the El Raval area. The El Raval area is on the opposite side to Las Ramblas to the hotel and is well worth a visit in its own right - especially if you want to get away from the tourists.The Bus Turistic (two routes from Placa de Catalunia) at 23 Euros each for two days was good value. Be aware though that not every form of tourist transport runs every day all year round. We were disappointed to find that Tramvia Blau and the associated Funicular Tibidabo only ran at weekends when we were there.And finally. The impression from guide books, etc., is that Barcelona is rife with petty crime. I didn't see anything untoward. I live in a cosmopolitan seaside city and I didn't feel any less safe walking around Barcelona than I do in my own home central area.
