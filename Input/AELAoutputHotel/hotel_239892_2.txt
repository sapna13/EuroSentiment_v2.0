{"text":"Good central location, reliable amenities We stayed at the Homewood Suites in Tukwila over MLK holiday. The price seemed right and the location was convenient. I was also thinking that we could use the refrigerator\/stove, etc, but decided instead to eat out. The room was very nice and large with a nice leatherette sofa, great lighting, ample seating at a desk or the sofas. The kitchen\/lounging area was separate from the sleeping area. I was impressed by the amount of room provided.The kitchen is small but adequate. It has no oven. Also, ours did not have a colander in case we wanted to strain food.There are apparently nonsmoking rooms with fireplaces, but these were not available when I checked in. I also received one of those Homewood Suites blankets at check-in (an option at the $139 price when I made online reservations) and it is great. We stayed on a weekend and did not get to experience the light dinner hors d'oeuvres.I did notice a rather strange odor in the hallway of my building, something similar to sour milk or curry (but not in a good way). However, this did not carry into the room.The breakfast was fairly standard. As a budget Hilton member, I enjoy the Hilton Garden Inn breakfasts the most. The Homewood Suites breakfasts tend to have oddly shaped scrambled eggs, greasy meat and the usual continental affair. They did have a decent oatmeal. The business center was large with two computers and an awesome color laser printer. My husband, however, felt that using Microsoft office applications was very cumbersome due to their security software.It was too cold to use the pool, but it looked like it would be nice in the summer. Overall, the stay was pleasant. In retrospect, if I knew I wasn't going to use the kitchen, I would have a chosen a less expensive Hilton option.
