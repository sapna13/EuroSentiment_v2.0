{"text":"Deserves every one of its 5 stars. We stayed two weeks at the Conrad Bali this summer and although our expectations were high (as other reviewers have stated, it is not cheap by Bali standards), we came away 100 per cent satisfied. The hotel is beautifully designed in contemporary Asian style with lots of interior gardens. Our room, a deluxe oceanview, was spacious (not huge) and very tastefully decorated. The balcony was large. The pool area is large and absolutely beautiful.You can spend days there just reading and relaxing. The beach in front of the hotel is not worth mentioning, however. If a beautiful beach and swimming in the sea is important to you, this is not your hotel. There is a decent fitness room with modern equipment and great service (cold wet scented towels brought to you during your exercise, etc.). The hotel also has a very nice spa, with its own pool, steam room, jacuzzi, etc. Treatments there obviously cost extra and - again - prices are rather steep by local standards. Food is excellent. There are a three restaurants (one, Spice, with ambitious and refined fusion cuisine), all which are excellent. The breakfast is absolutely five star. What really impressed us the most though was the consistent high standard of service. The staff were always attentive, helpful, and respectful. In the entire two weeks we stayed there there was not a single time when we were unhappy with the quality of service or any other aspect of the quality of the hotel. That is rare and denotes real Five Star standard. A couple of words on Nusa Dua itself. There isn't much going on there and you will want to go elsewhere frequently for dinner, entertainment, etc. This was never a problem for us. Taxi rides are cheap and pleasant. In all, if you are willing to pay for quality, I'd recommend this hotel without hesitation.
