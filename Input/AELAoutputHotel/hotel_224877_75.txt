{"text":"How this place is 5 Stars I'll never know????? I am typing this review as I lay in bed at the Mandarin (literally, I'm in the room!). We checked in yesterday at 2:30pm and only had to wait 3 hours for our room to be cleaned. That's right; we couldn't get into our room until after 5:00PM!! Then, they called to ask if we had received our luggage (shouldn't they know?). I actually had to go downstairs, find a bellman, and demand that he take me to the location where the luggage was stored to identify my luggage (it wasn't tagged properly). Had I not gone downstairs who knows how long it would have taken them to figure it out? By the way, the front desk was completely useless. All they could say is sorry, your room isn't ready. So, the hotel is ok but not great. Last night we had some sushi, a couple of beers, Tai pai noodles and a club sandwich for about $70 and the server was gracious enough to actually refill our water glasses once (over an hour).Today, our housekeeper took all our snacks out of our room (maybe now we have to raid the mini-bar?). Literally, we had some Pringles, MM's, and other snacks in our room and after returning from the beach they were GONE! I called the front desk to complain, they advised they would call housekeeping and call me back. That was 45 minutes ago and I never received a call back. The service at this hotel is a COMPLETE JOKE. I've been on multiple cruises, stayed at three different hotels in Hawaii, and dozens of other hotels across the U.S. I'm fairly well traveled and I can say with confidence that the service at this hotel is [--] (pardon my French). STAY AWAY; go to the Ritz Carlton on Key Biscayne or anywhere else but here. The beach is nice but there is no water access and did I mention the service is terrible?? Five stars my [--]!!
