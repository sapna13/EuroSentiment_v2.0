{"text":"Pretty, but a bit of a walk to beach and expensive extra bed I got a great rate of 93Euro per night for a Queen room, but needed to have an extra bed for my 9 yr old daughter. I figured a nominal cost but was shocked to learn they charged me 67 Euro per night for the extra bed. I sent their mgmt an email saying the hotel was great looking and we enjoyed our stay, but I was very disappointed with the extra bed costs. No reply received after 2 weeks. Good features: The air conditioning works great; Free mini-bar fridge with waters, soda and beer; nice modern decor; nice workout area  pool overlooking the Meditteranean. Great spot for photos of the mountains and city. 3 medium-sized jacuzzis. Across the street from the Diagonal Mar Mall - huge 3 story mall with a\/c. The hotel service desk (associated with Holland Cruises?!) was very helpful in arranging tickets to see a flamenco dancing performance. The street-tram is just across the street, and the metro is about 5 minutes further away.Features to be aware of: You have to have a room above the 6th floor to have an unobstructed view of the sea. Bit of a walk (10 min) to the beach. Sandy beach that sported middle-aged topless women. Water was warm, and there was a lifeguard. From the Bus Terminal, it is probably too hard to carry large suitcases with a family to the Arc d'Triomphe metro stop and then do a metro transfer to the train stop near the hotel. The numerous steps up and down the metro stops also makes carrying\/rolling bags challenging. Clothing for men\/women is casual throughout the city. Everyone is wearing flip-flops and shorts.FYI - the taxis do have meters. We arrived via the Girona shuttle bus at the main bus station and went to get a taxi. The one we picked negotiated charged 25 Euro and got additional for the 3 bags. The return trip with a meter only cost 15 Euro after tip. We found the easiest way to get about was the single zone T-10 book of 10 metro\/bus tickets for about 6.65 Euros.
