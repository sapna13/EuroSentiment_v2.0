{"text":"Great hotel for toddlers and children Our 4 night stay at the Embassy Suites Hotel Phoenix-Biltmore was overall a nice stay. The best part was their *fabulous* atrium with the Koi fish. Each morning, my toddler woke saying fish, fish! and went to bed at night exclaiming the same thing. It was a nice area of Phoenix to stay in and 25 minutes from Mesa and other areas of Phoenix we were visiting. The Biltmore shopping area next door offered some nice meals and it's expanding soon to include a Paradise Bakery. The hotel's Omaha steakhouse is nice, but pricey. However, their late night menu includes some of the lunch options (sandwiches, etc), which are generous servings and reasonable if you would prefer not to go back out. One night I had to wait especially long for a meal I had ordered from the restaurant to pickup downstairs ( it took them 45 minutes - only should have been 15). The bar tender treated me to a drink (alcoholic) of my choice! That, accompanied with the nice waiting area kept my frustrations away. We stayed in a room that was extremely comfortable and spacious (toddler, husband, and myself) - 2 rooms of course. The main bedroom is enormous and great for keeping everything including setting up a play and changing area for our toddler. It did become a bit noisy with traffic the next morning, so I would recommend a room facing the pool if possible - in March, the pool was not crowded or noisy later in the evening so I would not think this would be a problem. Pool area is also nice, and clean. The breakfast was nothing exceptional, but it met our needs. It is a nice area, although I was not keen on the milk being in a metal container. Personal preference. Omlets were watery, fixed too quickly. The staff was extremely nice, although the housekeeping service was slow in getting rooms done throughout the day. This posed a problem when you have a toddler that needs an afternoon nap. There is no business center, and only one working computer available for internet use. However, it was so slow and had issues, so I gave up checking my email that weekend. Yes, I would recommend the hotel to others, especially those with children. A few bumps along the way, but most certainly a much better experience and nicer stay than others I have experienced in Phoenix over the years. I wanted to rate this Neutral\/average, but the Koi ponds and atmosphere of the hotel bumps it up to Above Average.
