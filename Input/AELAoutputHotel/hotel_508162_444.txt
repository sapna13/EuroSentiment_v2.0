{"text":"It was a Dream Come True I can't not say enough about this trip. We had a group of 11. All of us said we can not figure out what all the Donna Downers that write in and say they that they didn't like the Dreams. We were there from March 23-29. Our biggest disapointment was when we had to board the bus to leave.I just read some of the postings and can not figure out what resort these people were at!!We had a very early day of travel on Easter Sunday. The ride from the airport is interesting and is bumpy. So what! When we arrived about 3:00 pm we were handed cool clothes to refresh. The staff at the counter were very nice. We were told our room were not ready yet and we shoud have some lunch. We did. We walked down to the Seaside for lunch. After lunch we walked back and registered. Our bags were already in our rooms.Monday we had a meeting with our VIP travel person Sharon. She explained the the resort. She told us about the beach and you should swim to the left in the area marked. If you didn't you could find rocks. Well, I did! I was knocked down by a wave and hit a rock and broke my toe! Not the resorts fault! They didn't put the rocks there! It did not spoil my stay!I have read that the help wasn't friendly. Again what resort where you at? We could not be happier than with all the staff. All very freindly and helpful and all had smiles. We did tip, but not one of the staff acted like we needed to.Wilson at the pool bar is great. As is 50 Cent and all the rest.We had great meals at all the restaurants. There was something for everone. We did enjoy Himitsu restaurant dinner the best. It was our daughters 16th birthday and they made it very special with a cake and song. She loved it. We did have a wait for dinner. Here is a tip. Put in your name. Go down to the World Cafe and order a few small pizzas for a snack and order some drinks and sit on the balcony out side the restaurant and enjoy the evening with friends. What's the hurray? Your on vacation!The drinks were the best. Always trying something new. Could always find a name beer at the main bar in the lobby. But why drink name beer when you are on vacation? Stay home for that!Finding chairs was not a problem. We spent our time at the beach. You can sit by a pool anytime. The pool is great! If we needed more chairs we asked the staff and they brought us more. Everyday the staff raked the beach. It was very clean. A wonderful breeze everday.We met and talked to alot of people form all over the world and all said they could not say a bad thing about the Dreams.We did take a day trip to Saona Island. Well worth the money. It is an all day trip. You should check it out. We met alot of people from other resorts and it sounded like the Dreams was the best resort to stay at.We are already planning next years trip to Dreams.The Ocean's 11 Group.
