{"text":"Not the best choice while staying in San Francisco While the room rate is moderate, not cheap, the Metropolis hotel is not a viable choice when staying in San Francsico. The hotel is worn, desperate need of updating, much like the neighborhood it reside within. The hotel staff is pleasant, but I found the rooms to be in need of a deep cleaning, meaning shampoo the carpeting, dry cleaning the comforter, and addin screens into the windows (who ever heard of a hotel with windows that completely open so that children or anyone could jump out of? Weird!). The hotel has one elevator that can accomomdate three persons comfortably, you can imagine if someone has several bags with you when you get on the elevator, very cramped. Sometime you wait for 4 -5 minutes to get out the hotel, depending on which floor you reside.Then there's the neighborhood...I grew up in Detroit, Michigan, so I know what inner city life can be like. Frankly, I was shocked that I was harassed by small gangs that hung out near the hotel. More over, it's the climate of San Francisco that attracts homeless and wandering youths, not the hotel fault, but why not have someone at the door on the street to watch out for their guests? Simple solution to help the guests feel safe. But apparently, common sense is not a forte of this property.Also, I was really shocked that when I booked my room, the hotel charged me for the entire stay on my card, normally, I would expect one day charge to hold the room and charge the balance of the stay upon CHECKOUT. But this was not the case.Bottom line, there are many alternatives to this property, you owe it to yourself to investigate all of the alternatives in the area before booking at the Metropolis.
