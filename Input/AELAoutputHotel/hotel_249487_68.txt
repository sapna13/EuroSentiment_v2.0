{"text":"Home away from Home Once again our stay at the Water Club was wonderful and a trip we look forward to all year, and when it was time to leave it was hard to do so. As usual, we stayed for two weeks (not long enough!!) and have been staying at the Water Club for the past ten years. Truly, it is our winter vacation retreat. Bob, Virna, Gerardo, Mateo and all of the staff (our hotel family) are exceptional and all are graciously accommodating √à√\u2020\u2022?it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ like arriving at our second home. The young ladies at the front desk, and they know who they are, were always smiling and happy to see us, and always asked how our day or night was. And, William and staff were always at the door welcoming us back from any activity we were out doing. This is something that they all do, not only to returning guests, but also to new ones √à√\u2020\u2022?whether staying for business or pleasure. We cannot say enough about them all. They all make a great first impression - very important when travelling.Our room (as usual) provided fantastic views (from all angles) of the skyline, beach, and the planes taking off and landing. We love staying in Puerto Rico and particularly the Water Club, this spot is one of the best!!! Over the years, those we have recommended to stay here have enjoyed it and return when they can.The beach is one of the loveliest on the island and a main reason we return. Towels, chairs and umbrellas are provided for guests; Kevin had our usual spot set up and ready and waiting for us daily. There was always an opportunity to get food and beverages delivered to our chairs (with a smile) for those of us soaking up the sun and enjoying the surf√à√\u2020\u2022? Of course, those who prefer the roof top bar (Wet) will not be disappointed in the food, pina coladas, mojitos, etc., and, of course, the view. Our food at Tangerine and Wet was always very good and flavorful - and, the music √à√\u2020\u2022?well, let√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ just say there was music Friday and Saturday nights. Great for the younger crowd.While we return year after year and our relationships with everyone has grown over time, we feel we are treated very special and like close family √à√\u2020\u2022?but, the staff at the Water Club is genuinely caring and truly enjoy what they do, and when they say √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Øy pleasure√à√\u2020\u2022?they sincerely mean it √à√\u2020\u2022?from the GM to our dear friend Wilfredo (the Painter!!); we miss you.
