{"text":"Lovely Hotel with a few downs! I was really impressed with this hotel when I arrived. Check-in was quick and friendly  all the hotel staff are extremely helpful. The rooms were nice - quite spacious and very clean, but they were ridiculously hot. We had two rooms and both of them were unbearably hot. There was air conditioning but it didn't seem to do much.The bathrooms were very nice - but beware of the shower heads - they're not very secure and the force of the water pushed mine out of the wall and almost hit me - they're big metal baton-like things!!! On the first day, breakfast was delicious. All sorts of fruit and yoghurt, meats and fish, buns, bread, croissants, pastries, cereal and a cooked breakfast option. 2 of our party are vegetarians so ordering a cooked breakfast with no meat was fine, However on the 2nd day, too much of a fuss was made about having breakfast with no meat and the guy offered us pancakes instead because it seemed too much of an effort for him to order us 2 vegi breakfasts.When our pancakes arrived, they were stacked high with bacon, so naturally, I said we don;t eat bacon that's why we have pancakes - so, they took the pancakes, scraped the bacon off and returned them to us, covered in bacon fat. The hotel is situated very near to Tower Hill station which is fine. We went to London to see the Lion King and Hairspray and found it OK getting to the theatres, but it was a bit tricky getting back!Fantastic London hotel, with just a few mishaps!
