{"text":"Flying solo at Excellence in May I headed off to Excellence in May for a long weekend, and did so without my husband who had conflicts. I figured no big deal - however it certainly seemed to be for the hotel itself. i was continually contested on my soloness - at breakfast, lunch, dinner, by the maids, etc... it seemed an impossible concept to understand. This was not hugely offensive, it is a couples resort after all. That's my point, I guess - it is a couples resort. I upgraded to the Excellence Club, which essentially meant there was food out all day long - which was true for the rest of the resort as well. The rooms were fine. Not great. I had a swim out room which was convenient. The pool and beach were really wonderful, which is how this review caps its average rating. Annoying: Maids entered my room 4-5 times a day for different reasons. I was never approached by the pool and offered a drink at any time in my 5 day stay (though I watched it happen all day long for other folks). The internet connection was spotty and inconsistent. I waited 2 hours for my luggage once I checked it. I eventually went and retrieved it myself, which did not go over so well - but the pool closes at 5p and I wanted to get a dip in on my first day. Realities: This hotel is a solid hour+ (more like 90 minutes once it is all said and done) from the airport. The restaurants are so-so. The staff is very nice and very sweet. Take bug dope - lots of mosquitos. Cabs cost about $60 and are a tiny bit more convenient than a transfer with a company and a van.Spa: I do not recommend at all. I had two treatments - both very amateurish and weak. Actually, one was downright laughable! A woman who confessed she was a manucurist just played with my hair for 30 minutes, vs. giving me a head massage. ThiS IS NOT A LEGIT SPA. If you are going for handwork, do not waste your time. Weather in May: it was perfectly perfect as far as temperature. There were rain showers late morning and thunderstorms at night. I found that to be kind of nice and varied.
