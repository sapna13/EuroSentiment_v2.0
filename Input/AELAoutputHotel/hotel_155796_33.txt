{"text":"Just what we were looking for! I was a little hesitant after reading such varied reviews and also that the hotel wasn't on the beach, but we tried it anyway. We were very pleasantly rewarded!We found the hotel very easy to find - followed the directions on the hotel website and got there on the first try! It was a great drive from the San Juan airport - very scenic. Our check in went smoothly and we were in our room in no time. The room was beautiful - tile floors, a wooden sleigh bed, beautiful tv console... The balcony was a little small, but easy for two to stand outside and gaze at the ocean in the distance. We had the door open alot in the daytime to let fresh air in. There were screens in the windows, so we had them open all the time, too. We wanted to get as much warm air as possible, coming from winter in PA! The in room safe was big enough for my husband's laptop (and still had more room). The bedding was comfy, and there was a coffeemaker and a refrigerator, so we bought our own water bottles and drinks... The bathroom was fantastic. There was no mold or mildew and everything was very updated and modern. The soaps even smelled awesome! The tiled shower was HUGE - no bathtub, though. Housekeeping kept the room very clean. The pool was amazing - all tile and looked like it was recently remodeled. Never anyone there during our stay. There was a section for laps, a section with a basketball hoop, a slide, and the zero entry point. A GREAT pool for all ages - lots of shallow water yet lots for adults too. Didn't do the mini golf but it looked nice - $2 extra to try it. Pool was open 8am to 9pm, and a smaller pool was open from 9am to 10pm. This smaller pool was closer to the hotel rooms and was also very beautiful. lots of changing rooms - we checked out then hung out by the pool because of our later flight. Staff was extremely nice and accomodating. Requests for extra towels were taken care of immediately. Hotel grounds were beautiful and very clean and well taken care of. Playground looked nice and aviary was cool, too. The only bad was the restaurants. We only ate at the mexican one and it was nothing special... beef was very chewy...overpriced... Don't waste your time eating there... breakfast and lunch? go the the Golden Bakery right down the street - less than half a mile before the hotel - great food!!! and cheap! and for a beach - go to seven seas beach about 10 minutes drive from the hotel. we went there three times and were always the only ones there. The water was clear and calm - nicer than the other beaches we went to like Luquillo. Go to Culebra and rent a jeep for $130 for the day and beach hop there!!! We went to Zoni - nice, but Flamenco was gorgeous! This hotel was great because of it's location - we always stay on the beach previously so it was a gamble for me, but i loved being close to the ferry - we were late one morning and drove there and parked and got on the ferry in 5 minutes! We were there for 5 nights and it was quiet the whole time - we seldom saw any other guests! Only good food we found was the Kiosk - was it 2 or 12? in Luquillo - go through the dumpy front part and there's a great section on the beach in the back.
