{"text":"Fantastic food!! Me and my boyfriend stayed at this resort from March 6- March 13. We arrived at about 8 pm. Our first thought was WOW. The entrance way was spectacular and the lounge\/reception area and bar were great to look at, very clean and alot going on. Now ill explain things in more organized matter.Food- The food was amazing, but once again everyone is different and one might like the food, while another may not. Me and my boyfriend found no problems with any of it, it was all great. The theme nights were great, American night was one of my favs. There is always something to chose from, we ate at the buffets our whole trip, never at any of the other restaurants. Neither of us experienced any stomach problems but im sure thats because we never over indulged on meat, or much of one thing.Beach- AMAZING. Honestly thats all I have to say to sum it up. You can walk for miles and miles. The sand is wonderful and the palm trees make it even more spectacular. Nothing bad to say hear.Grounds\/ Landscaping- Beautiful. The trees, shrubs, flowers are all great, very well maintained. The walkways and buildings are very nice, painted weekly if there are any fadings or anything like that. They were always painting or working on something while we were there.Rooms- I was not impressed with our room. We had requested one bed, they had given us 2 double beds. The room itself was huge but having just one, big bed would have been great, espcially since the bed we had was very small for 2 people. We were on the ground floor so there was bugs in it from time to time. Nothing in the beds though, just crawling around on the floor, which creeped me out kind of but it wasnt going to ruin my trip. Our tv didnt work the first night so we called front desk and they sent someone over to fix it, they were very quick to do so. Do not tip the maids! Well, we tipped the first night and though if we tipped they would throw in a little something extra, nope! We came back the next night and our beds were not even made and the garbage wasnt taken out, I wasnt impressed with that.Activities- there was always something going on around the pool and the beach. There was never a lack of activities going on, there was always something to do. They had al sorts of competitions to do, water polo, aquasize, games for kids, dancing, everything. Pool area- Very impressed, it was always very clean. Lots of trees and flowers around this area, makes it nice to hang out. Pool bar was great, sometimes the service was a little slow there but it was always very busy. There was chairs available for the most part. We found two right away almost everytime we were around the pool.Saona Island was amazing, I highly reccomend this excursion! The catemeran was so much fun, full of rum and coke, with a little mixture of dancing! But be careful, it's extremely easy to burn without knowing it while on the boats!All in all, I had a good time, and the resort was great.
