{"text":"It was Okay Okay here is what I thought. This is was the resort we (12 total, all aged early twenties) took our third annual all inclusive vacation. The Good-The rooms were huge, and really nice. The staff worked really hard, and for the most part were really nice. The drinks were almost too strong, and that is saying a LOT. The beach is the nicest I have ever seen, and the one in Costa Rica was really nice. When we went the weather was perfect. The Golf course was really nice, but I don't play a lot so I am not a great judge. The disco was fun. OH eat at the MEXICAN resturant. It was by far the best resturant on the properties, including the steak house. The Bad-I don't know what the deal was, but almost all of the 12 of us got sick from the food. I have never gotten food posioning before, but was sick as a dog one day. Of the nine of us that got sick, we were all better within a day. The bugs are insane. You won't see them, but you will be itiching. The biggest problem that we had was a communication issue. It seemed as though SOME (and only some) of the staff seemed to ignore the english speaking guests. And not because they didn't understand. This is not a resort that caters (sp) to Americans. You have to understand that before you go.Things I wish I knew-Bug spray, along with anti-itch cream. Bring It. Pepto Bismol. It is your friend.Small bills. There is a flea market at the Palace. It is a really good idea to come prepared with small bills so you don't have to find change at the front desk. Do not go there with big bills. MEXICAN RESTURANT. Its at the beach hotel, and is only open from 6:30-11. There will be a line at the steakhouse. Its good, but the mexican resturant is so much better.
