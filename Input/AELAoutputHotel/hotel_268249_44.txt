{"text":"Don't go! Don't Go! We booked eight weeks in advance and paid $1, 500 a piece - from Dec 30 - Jan 6 \/ 08. We booked to stay in the IFA Bravero Villages, but when we arrived, they put us up in the Villas(3 star vs. 4 star villages) The Villas are set back a far distance from the lobby and main pool area - there was a trolly taking people to and from, but seemed to be full or not operational all the time... Our flight was late and we checked in late, we realized the mistake when we reached our rooms. The six of us (all couples) had many problems with our rooms: 1 had no a\/c, another no tv, and in ours the bedding was questionably dirty - my main problem was the long walk to and from the pool (15 min. and another 15 to the beach). We complained about our problems and were moved 2 days later to a building in the Villages - a new building still being worked on. Here we had no hotwater and no tv as they were not hooked up yet. After complaining again, 2 days later, we moved to the inner Villages - our third move-in...ahhhhhhhhh Here, the rooms were descent, but our room still had no tv! Which was a drag as it rained two days straight... It seems as though we spent a lot of our valubale vacation time at the front desk bitching and complaining about the accomodations than we did enjoying ourselves. The hotel was under construction and there was heavy machinery and work crews everywhere! Banging, drilling, jackhammering going on daily!THe Food - ok. a lot of weird and unusual dishes though - we banked on the omelettes in the morning and the pizzeria - AWESOME!... AVOID the a la carte restaurants - one was a buffet (much the same as the main restaurant) the other two were not the most tasty or reliable. Beach - Ok. the water was a nice colour of blue and green, but fairly merky and cool. A lot of seaweed washing up to shore. Most days chairs were available on the beach and around the pool.Locals \/ Help \/ Management - the workers were fairly nice and would smile and dance and be happy to see you....The management and help were LESS than helpful or accomodating - truly a disapointment! The magager was however, fairly reasonable and tried to help us after waiting to see him for many hours every time. Pool  Drinks - a large pool ajoined to a pool bar - both were good. Drinks were made differently at every bar and the slushly type drinks were never really slushy consistenly...:(Entertainment - not a lot. There was a kids daycare and activites for them though...OVERALL: We are accepting nothing less than a full or partial refund or travel voucher - we are all so displeased with this resort... We were stressed out and not ourselves the whole week (other then the last day when all was finally going well...) Please don't waist the money here avoid IFA at all costs. We are reasonable people and can put up with some things, but all mentioned above was way too much!Hope this helps.Kate :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1566,"mention":"pizzeria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1558},{"endOffset":1566,"mention":"pizzeria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1558},{"endOffset":1566,"mention":"pizzeria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1558},{"endOffset":1566,"mention":"pizzeria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1558},{"endOffset":1755,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1751}]}
