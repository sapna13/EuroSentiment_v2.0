{"text":"Perfect staff, perfect location I loved the Artus the first time I stayed there, in September '05, and this was a return trip for me one year later. The location on rue Buci just can't be beat--it is a market street in the heart of the 6th arr. Bakeries, grocery stores, restaurants, bars, gelato stands, open air fruit markets and rotisseries, and boutiques are all outside the door of the Artus, and that's before you've even walked a block. You can stay out on the street until extremely late and be perfectly safe because your hotel door is seconds away from all the nightlife and people watching. Every single staff member at the front desk is great--they all speak perfect English and help with everything you could ever need--making reservations, giving walking or metro directions, helping with taxis and airport transportation, etc. The rooms are kind of small by US standards, but very clean and well lit, and the bathrooms are pretty spacious. Comfortable beds, TV and AC, minibar in-room and in the lounge, breakfast room, computer for guests in the lounge--it has everything you'd need and more, unless you have LOTS of luggage (which they'd probably store for you--I can't imagine there's anything they wouldn't help with.) I definitely value location and help navigating the city (both of which pretty much equal fun and safety) way more than I value anything else when travelling, and you just can't find anything that beats the Artus when it comes to those things--it is PERFECT.
