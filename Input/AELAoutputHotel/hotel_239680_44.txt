{"text":"C'est magnifique! We've just returned from a wonderful week in Paris at the Elysees Regencia. We picked the hotel based upon the glowing TripAdvisor reviews, and we were not disappointed.The hotel is located in a rather staid part of Paris, without the vibrant street life of St. Germain or the Marais. This means a good walk or a metro ride to get to popular sites, restaurants and shopping. Fortunately the Elysees Regencia is located a short walk from at least five metro stops; the closest, and the one we used regularly, is the George V on the Champs Elysees. It is also an easy walk to the Arc de Triomphe at the top of Avenue Marceau, as well as to the Eiffel Tower in the other direction.We booked a deluxe double on the fourth floor, with two large windows overlooking Avenue Marceau (a note: Avenue Marceau is a busy street and, while the dual-glazed windows keep out the worst of the noise, lite sleepers should request a room at the back of the hotel). The room was quite large by European standards, with a comfortable king bed, a desk, an armoire\/entertainment center and two club chairs. The rooms are very nicely furnished in a clean, contemporary style with dark woods and bright accent colors (our room was aniseed). The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean, and the bath was well-stocked with soft towels, shampoo, soaps and even shaving and nail care kits. Breakfast, served under the stone vaults of the basement, featured a good selection of pain au chocolat, croissants, breads, crepes, cereals, fresh fruit, eggs, sausage, juices and coffee. The price is a bit steep at 19 euro, but is well worth it for the excellent quality and convenience.But the best feature of the Elysees Regencia is its superb young staff. From the front desk (especially Kathrin, who made all our dinner reservations, and Pascal-Arthur, who arranged for a car to take us to the airport) to the breakfast room to the doorman, the hotel staff are wonderfully friendly, polite and professional (not to mention fluent in English). From the moment we walked in we were made to feel welcome, and every request or question was met with a smile and a prompt and efficient response. It is the staff that makes the Elysees Regencia so special. We will definitely stay here again when (not if!) we return to Paris.
