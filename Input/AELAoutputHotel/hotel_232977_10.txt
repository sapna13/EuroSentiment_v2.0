{"text":"Disappointing..Not like it looks on Website I trawled hotel websites for days after booking our Ryanair flights to Florence. We finally settled on the Hotel Londra after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. I really wanted a room with a balcony with a nice view, and in fairness this is what we got. The view from our balcony was gorgeous but there is no furniture so you need to drag the chairs from the room out onto it. They really need to think about sweeping or mopping the balcony floor tiles as they were pretty filthy. Our main gripe with the hotel Londra was the room. After all our research I really wanted to open the door to the room and be pleased, unfortunately our room, 507, hadn't been decorated since the eighties. A highly patterned carpet, floral chintzty wallpaper, net curtains and twin beds is not what is portrayed on their website. I felt pretty cheated so I decided to go back down to reception and ask for another room, I never usually do this but I thought it was probably worth asking. I was informed that the rooms that are pictured on the website are the ONLY 2 renovated rooms in the hotel and they were occupied during our stay. I felt really let down and the receptionist was pretty smug. .We paid √ä√£¬¢142 for the 2 nights by booking directly on the hotels website. I wouldn't pay anymore than this to stay there again. It is a good ten minutes walk to all the main attractions and can be a trek at the end of a hot day. I'd pay more to stay somewhere more central if I was going to Florence again. If you want to see real photos of the Hotel Londra (and not just pictures of their 2 renovated rooms) look on Expedia. They feature much more realistic views of rooms in the Hotel Londra. They still all look better than room 507 though..Also, steer clear of the bar, a Gin and Tonic is classed as a 'cocktail' and cost 9 euros! No wonder we were the only customers for the half hour we sat there! We bought our own wine after this from the supermarket round the corner so asked at the bar on our return for an ice bucket so we could use the ice machine on floor 1, the barman looked at us like we'd just spat in his face and said you have bought your own wine?! then tutted before pratically throwing the bucket as us! The building work mentioned in previous posts is still on going on and looks like it will be for some time. They've just laid the first bit of track in the metro extension so the area around the hotel is pretty dusty and noisy. This is probably another good reason to stay more in the centre where there are no building works. There are hundreds of hotels in Florence are many are very close to the Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio and Duomo so I'd opt for one of them in future.Enjoy Florence!
