{"text":"Raffles Inc. rooms very nice I stayed 5 nights in April 2008 at the Fairmont for a conference in the Raffles City Convention center. The overall experience was nice.Check InCheck in was fairly slow, but this was my first time to the hotel so they had no guest history, and they did upgrade me to a Raffles Inc. room.RoomThe room I had was spacious, well lit, and well laid out. It was nice to be on the Raffles Inc floor as the room had recently been renovated and one had access to the breakfast and evening snacks. Two small complaints with the room, however, one is paying high prices for internet connection, and the 2nd very important issue is that the air conditioning didn't work. I complained 3 days in succession about this, and I know that efforts were made to fix it, but this is an older property and while the rennovation was nice, it clearly didn't touch the a\/c system. In fact most of the common areas of the hotel, the gym, and the restaurants were quite hot. Because I was only in the room to sleep, I never made a huge issue of it. TV channels in the room were very limited.GymThe gym was well equipped and had some of the latest Life Fitness equipment including ellipticals, treadmills, and cycles. It did have some older equipment as well. There was also a complete selection of weight machines and free weights.DiningDining in the hotel is nice, but quite expensive. Other options are readily availble in the basement of the attached mall, and across the street at Chijmes.LocationExcellent. Walking distance to a number of restaurants, and the attached mall is quite nice.I will stay here again, but I'll probably make certain that I get a room that will cool below 25C next time, and I probably won't risk anything other than the Raffles Inc. floor.
