{"text":"Everything I needed except an Internet connection I stayed a week in January for business after I was unable to book at the Harbor Court. I think I like the Griffon better than either the Harbor Court or Vitale. Harbor Court has the wonderful lobby and fireplace, plus the happy hour. Hotel Vitale has large rooms and great tubs and showers. But I like the Griffon's rooms better than Harbor Court's and I like the ambiance (esp in Jan) of either Harbor Court or Griffon over Vitale. I'd recommend any of the three, though.The good:Location--Embarcadero, Ferry Building, my company's officesRoom--Small but efficient. They emptied the frig for me so I could stock it with my own healthy food and drinks. Soft bed, and I didn't have to ask for extra pillows each night after the first night. Bathroom: Standard room had a sizeable tub. I can't resist walking everywhere in SF, so I needed a good soak at nightBreakfast--You can actually go low-carb with their free buffet. I grabbed coffee and a rolled up cheese\/lunchmeat sandwich each morning.YMCA access--I didn't use it this trip, but our corporate rate included free access at the great Y next door. Other rates allow access for a small fee.The not-so-good:Internet--Neither wired nor wireless worked my entire stay. I got a feeble excuse from the front desk that it was the weather. I didn't pursue the issue because I had easy access at the office, but if I hadn't, it would have been a big problem for me. I did resent lugging my laptop on this trip for no reason, though.Lighting--The rooms are designed very efficiently, with all I needed but extra pillows. However, the lighting over the sink was atrocious. I turned on all the lights, and it was still dark. Hopefully, if you're doing makeup, you can bring your own lighted mirror.Room service--Though no different in any other hotel I've stayed at in SF, it really is ridiculous to order a sandwich and drink, and with fee\/tip have it cost nearly $30. There are just too many great options close by that are much more delicious and cheaper. I love Mijita in the Ferry Building, plus Yank Sing in the Rincon Center. If you want to spend big bucks, there are plenty of close high-priced restaurants, as well.
