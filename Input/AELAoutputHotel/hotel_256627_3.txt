{"text":"Good location I stayed in this hotel during June. We had managed to get quite a good deal on a hotel room price and had managed to find it through the Radisson group website.The room itself was very pleasant and it had a great bathroom with a huge shower. The view on the other hand was terrible but its a hotel in a city centre so we weren't too upset about that.  The reception staff were ok but not particularly friendly. The hotel only has a very small eating area which serves all meals. It is just a flight of stairs up from the reception area. The bar is also located here. The serving staff were nice. We didn't eat breakfast here as there are many cafes nearby serving a much better meal at a much better price. We did have dinner one night. We were very tired from a day of sight seeing and didn't want to go out but we found that it was quite pleasant. For every meal they reccommended a glass of wine. The room service menu is pretty much the same as the restaurant menu but slightly more expensive.The pool was a disappointment. The pictures which I looked lead me to believe that it was alot bigger then it actually is.Overall we had a good stay here but felt that it was a hotel geared mainly at business clients.Internet is also quite expensive in the hotel. From the bedrooms you get a free 24 hours but then have to pay 25 dollars per day if you wish to continue. There is a business suite in the hotel but we didn't visit that . ","annotations":[]}
