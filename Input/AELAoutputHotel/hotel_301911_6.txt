{"text":"A Unique Four Seasons Experience We have stayed at the Marunouchi on a few occasions and each time in a different type of room. The standard room was very nice, if a little small, with a windowless large bathroom. We have also stayed in one bedroom suites with a city view and a view of the station. The suites were large and exquisite with some unique features. While the station view is gorgeous, it is a little noisy. Business travellers and sensitive sleepers are probably best to ask for a city view room.The hotel is very well located. Tokyo Station, Ginza, the Imperial Palace and the Forum are within walking distance. All the sites are easily accessible by train which makes the proximity to Tokyo Station desirable (unlike the Park Hyatt which is 10 minute drive from the the closest station).The in-room electronics and amenities are excellent. LIke many other Four Seasons, the hotel provides L'Occitane bathproducts but also provides Kniepp bath salts and pillows. Yukatas and pj's can also be found in the room (in addition to the usual bathrobe) which adds a unique Japanese touch. A variety of pillows are available upon request. HIgh quality Japanese green tea and coffee are available in the room (along with china, an electric tea kettle and a french press).The hotel is very small (57 rooms). The entire staff greets you by name. The staff also notes preferences and ensures they are observed on follow-up visits. For example, we once requested an iron and on subsequent visits an iron has been placed in our room. The hotel is generally very quiet which makes it an excellent hotel for business travel.The spa is small but the onsen and gym are wonderful.The food is very expensive, even by Tokyo and Four Seasons standards. For example, a soft drink is 1000 yen. The same soft drink is available at the nearby convenience store for 140 yen. The price of the food seemed quite excessive. The cost of in-room movies was also very high (2000 yen).The concierge service was a bit mixed but generally excellent. In some respects they are very organized and go out of thier way to be helpful. On one visit, we had a Japan Rail Pass and planned to travel the country. The hotel sent a staff member to get tickets for every leg of our trip at no cost. As we were taking a small bag on our trip, they allowed us to store our luggage while touring the country and pick it up before leaving Tokyo (at no cost). This was very helpful to us and we appreciated the hotel did not charge us for these services. As well, print-outs are available for all major sites that provide a description of the site, colour pictures and a map. The concierge is also very good about making reservations, getting good tables etc... but they don't always check pertinent information before giving advice. For example, on two occassions we were told a tourist site was open and on both occasions the sites were closed (one was a regular closing and the other owing to a national holiday). I would advise people to ask the concierge to verify if the particular destination is open at the time they would like to visit. On the whole, we were very pleased with the hotel and returned after our first visit. We will stay at this property on our next trip to Tokyo.
