{"text":"Good Trip First I would like to say there were definitely bugs. By bugs I mean mosquitoes and there were ants in the sand. The mosquitoes were only horrible walking through the hallways to get to your room, and eating at the outside restaurants. My boyfriend only got bit once but they really took a liking to me. Now, the bites did not ruin the trip for me and I still had a good time. My advice is to spray yourself with off before you walk out of your room and you should be fine. The off at the pharmacy is 13 dollars so it's pricey but I would have paid 30 for it.  Ride to resort We booked a private Limo through the resort which ended up being nice. They have beer and cokes stocked in the limo for you. I do get very car sick but the ride is not that bad. There are pot holes but if you just enjoy watching the scenery as you drive by, you should be fine. If you book a limo be prepared to pay in cash as soon as they drop you off. Resort told us we could pay at checkout time but that was not accurate. The resort saw us counting our money out to pay the Limo, and asked if we needed more since they had made a mistake, which we thought was very nice. Arrival to resort,Greeted with glass of Champaign and check in was very easy. We had the Excellence Club so we checked in over there. I think it is worth getting the Excellence club because we enjoyed being able to have free internet and having some drinks before dinner.  Resort GroundsMy boyfriend loved the grounds but I was a bit disappointed. None of the pools have ocean views so that was disappointing. If you want to see the ocean you have to walk to the ocean. RoomsWe had an Excellence Swim up ocean view room. Room was nice and the air conditioner worked the whole time. There was no ocean view though. We didn't call to complain because we were happy with our room. I def would have rather gotten just an ocean view room instead of ocean view swim up. We always just ended up walking to the pool instead of walking outside our balcony. Beds were hard but we slept well. We did call and ask for the bed top and goose pillows which we received the second day. We left the maid a tip every day and we received what we asked for. FoodFood was average but we ate with no complaints. Our favorite was the Italian and Mexican. Breakfast at Tuscany was very good.  StaffStaff was nice and they were accommodating. Some were a little rude but who cares, we weren't spending our vacation with them. BeachBest beach I have been to yet!!!! Sand is super soft and the water was beautiful. Just be careful when you walk up to the stores on the beach because that is where the ants are in the sand. Overall we had a great time but I wouldn't return due to mosquitoes and no ocean view when you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e in the pools ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1265,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1261},{"endOffset":1342,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1338}]}
