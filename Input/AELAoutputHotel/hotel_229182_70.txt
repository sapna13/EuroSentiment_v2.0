{"text":"Elevator 5 Have stayed at the Krasnapolsky many times in the last few years and sometimes it's been very good and other times very average. There is a big variety in the quality of the rooms, which makes a big difference to your stay.This week it felt like the hotel is rather tired. Of course, the location is great right on Dam Square, 10 minutes walk from Centraal Station, but that's probably it's best feature right now.Arrived at 8PM to face a 15 minutes queue at check in. I had booked a standard room and apparently got the last non-smoking room, accessed from Elevator 5 ( I think that the rooms in this block are the worst in the hotel). 4th floor room size was small, but OK for the price. However, the room was very tired and smelt of smoke - what some hotels call classic or hotel speak for not refurbished for a long time !!). The bathroom was honestly the tiniest I have ever experienced in a hotel. If you are offered this part of the hotel, see if you can change at check in.WI-FI in the room works fine but expensive at √à√\u2020√ü?7 from Swisscom.I didn't bother with breakfast as it's √à√\u2020√ü?5 for a continental and there are plenty of places nearby. The breakfast room is really beautiful though, so if you have the time to enjoy it, why not. There is a coffee bar at the front of the hotel, where you can get a coffee and pastry, but it is tired and soul-less that's why I guess it was empty at 8.30AM !There are much better NH hotels in Amsterdam, such as the Barbizon Palace, worthy of the 5 stars they claim. In my opinion, the Krasnapolsky is no longer one of them.
