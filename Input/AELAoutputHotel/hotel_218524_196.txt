{"text":"Disappointed I just returned from vacationing at EPC from 9\/13 to 9\/19. After reading all the positive reviews I was sure that I would love this resort. I also want to add that I am always skeptical of negative reviews and assume that these people must be too picky. We have never had a problem with other resorts and are not generally picky by any means. The ride to the hotel was not as bad as some make it out be. It's just a long ride after a long flight. The welcome to the resort was very nice. Our room was not that great. There were so many ants near the mini bar, walls and in the closet. The jacuzzi had stains that resembled growth at the bottom. It was essentially not able to be used without risking infection! For some reason the room just did not seem clean. The food, in my opinion was horrible. Breakfast was terrible. Much of the food was uncovered so flies took over. The fruit didn't appear fresh. Every time we got pancakes they were raw and oozing with batter in the center... same with the omelette. Food seemed to be cooked with too much butter and salt. Lunch was a little better but it was by no means good food. Dinner was ok but it was very salty. Agave was good but it lacked atmosphere. The beach was fantastic. The red flag was up but we were still able to swim every day. Drink service was excellent as well. The pool was ok but people would hoard 2 floats at once which was very annoying. It's not a very relaxing atmosphere either hence I'd recommend the beach. I don't think enough people emphasize the amount of mosquitoes at night. I got about 60 bites. I have pictures but will spare people pics of bug bites! We used DEET everynight but to no avail. We went back to our room early one night because it got so bad. Nightly entertainment was fun but it would be nice to have the option to leave the resort. We are used to vacationing in Mexico where you can go down town and leave the resort. It gets kind of old after the 3rd night. The days get a bit redundant. The gym was nice and the equipment was clean and new. There are two parrots which made our trip. They are a must see! Don't get me wrong the service was excellent but this place was not for us. I just wanted to give some people another point of view since vacation time is sacred. We will stick with other Carribean islands and Mexico. Also, it is my opinion that this resort does not stand up to 4.5 stars as advertised. It completely lacks the wow factor. This is not a place for people that enjoy exploring outside a resort.
