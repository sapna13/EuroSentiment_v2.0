{"text":"comes highly reccomended I stayed here in december and as such felt i wanted to share this lovely Balinese hotel with you. It has really beautiful tended gardens and the staff are so friendly and always willing to help. They seem to smile all day long. i had a gardenview room and not one of the club rooms but was lucky enough to see inside one - the gardenview rooms are ok if not in need of a bit of a refurb in the bathrooms but are kept clean and have all that you need- but if you can afford an upgrade it will be worth it as they alo come with a superb private swimming pool area- having said that the pool area for all other guests is fabulous and has a great swim up bar. plenty of good quality sunbeds and a great waiter service. i reccomend if you fancy a change to eat out. on the beach the second restuarant you come to called Donalds has such an extensive menu from basic noodle and rice dishes to huge prawns and fab curries also steaks and chops, i can also say breakfast here is good too.and so cheep.. on the road side of the hotel ..the Cat and the Fiddle has great food and great music especially on a sunday evening - give it a try.I did a tour over 4 nights of bali and its worth going inland to pick up the real flavour of Bali. You can do daily trips but it was great staying in Ubud high up surrounded by jungle and monkeys swinging right outside your windows.For the first time i travelled as a single traveler- was very worried about doing this but i have to say this hotel made me feel very safe as was the area this hotel was in.so if you fancy authentic style hotels this is your one book it now .
