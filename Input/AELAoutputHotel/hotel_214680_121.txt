{"text":"Best location in Waikiki This was my second stay at the Park Shore, and it will be my hotel on my next trip to Oahu. The location is by far the best you can find near Waikiki. Being the last hotel on the strip provides for unobstructed views of Diamond Head, the ocean and Kapiolani Park. It's location also makes it easy to get in and out of without having to deal with the traffic, one way streets and the crowds of Waikiki.The view from the rooms are unmatched and we found ourselves spending a lot of our time on the lanai, reading, relaxing, having meals and just enjoying the scenery. We actually set up the video camera and let it record for a half an hour so we can relive it on the big screen at home.The rooms could use some redecorating but they're clean and the staff goes out of their way to make you comfortable. I personally don't go to Hawaii to be in a roomThe room rates make the Park Shore the best value you can find anywhere in Hawaii. You can find nicer rooms with fancy lobbies and 5 star restaurants,but you'll pay a lot more and will never get as nice of a view. There are two ABC stores adjacent to the hotel to keep you supplied with anything you need, a Starbucks at the entrance and a great open air bar and grill (Lulu's) on the second floor overlooking the beach with awesome sunsets. Across the street is a huge uncrowded white sand beach with nice tree shaded grass areas to set up camp for the day. It also features several vollyball courts, it's a great place to snorkle, ride some waves or just get a tan. It also has a jetty stretching about 100 yards out into the ocean with a gazebo on the end that offers a spectacular place to watch the sun set. When I've stayed at other hotels in Waikiki, I've walked to this beach to get away from the masses of people.
