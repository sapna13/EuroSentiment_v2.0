{"text":"Loved the swanky Drake. My boyfriend lives in Toronto, but we booked a night at the Drake for a nice getaway. We couldn't have been happier with our choice! All of the rooms at the Drake have corresponding names, and we booked a Crash Pad. The room was small, but more than adequate. Whoever designed this place was impressively good at optimizing space - there was room for the bed, a desk, a bench, an overhead luggage rack with a sliding ladder, and the entire bathroom area. Our bed was COMFORTABLE like I could not believe. I would definitely recommend this hotel as a place for open-minded young (or perhaps young-at-heart) couples. The shower is a glass box directly across from the bed, and the room service menu is billed as the first erotic room service in North America (there wasn't any food on it, by the way...) We had a lovely time bonding, and left feeling completely refreshed. The hotel had some nice extra little touches that I thought went very far to foster my good opinion. They use Aveda bath products, which are wonderful, and have a book-of-the-month club, where they provide you with a book at your bedside to read at night or take home (my boyfriend snapped it up before I got the chance!) Additionally, the most convenient parking for the Drake is a municipal lot across the street; if you give the desk staff your license plate # and keys, they will feed the meter for you and add it to your bill so you have no worries during your stay. The street car runs all along Queen St., making using the public transit in Toronto very convenient. Additionally, they have a very cool bar  lounge downstairs, an open-air patio on the roof, and a nightclub downstairs. We grabbed a drink in the lounge and caught some very, very cool live music before heading out for the night. Very swanky. When we got back, there was a line-up down the street for the nightly entertainment; we just flashed the doorman our room keys and jumped the line. The Drake definitely treats its guests like VIPs. I hope to be able to treat myself to another night here in the future!
