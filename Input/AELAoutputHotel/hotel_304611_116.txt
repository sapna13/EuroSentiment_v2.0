{"text":"great location for shopaholics My wife and I have stayed at the Royal Plaza 3 times this year and there's no doubt that overall it's very good value for money, having been refurbished in early 07 means that the rooms are efficient, clean and modern if a little on the small side in the bathroom - watch out those of you who like a bath as the de-luxe only had a shower but the premi√Å√\u2022¬¥re had both and separately, the shower is of good size and has a choice of small shower head or enormous. Good choice of toileteries and proper bath sized towels.The staff were very friendly and helpful, reception has good staffing levels so check in\/out is speedy and efficient. Overall the hotel is well appointed and is in a great location for the professional shopper and tourist but perhaps not the best spot for the City Slickers as the financial area is about 10 - 15 mins away by cab depending on traffic.As to the downside, I personally prefer a lounge\/bar area close to the entrance foyer not on the 1st floor, not only for all we people watchers but to spot friends on arrival. However I reserve my main beef for the restaurant, not because it is buffet only, but because it is Halal. ( It does have a wine list howebver). So all of us who like a great English or American breakfast or just a Continental get used to Turkey or Beef Bacon not streaky\/Canadian and no cold ham, prosciuttio etc either- for obvious reasons the owner, The Sultan of Brunei, is not a fan of these products. Regrettably you'll be hard pressed to find any mention of this on their website and there's me thinking that Singapore is a great example of transparency for SE Asia. In fact under Dining, the hotel maintains that it caters to every taste - some less than others maybe!! Apart from these it's got my vote. ","annotations":[]}
