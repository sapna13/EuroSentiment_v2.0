{"text":"Still Dreaming of Dreams......... We have visited the Dominican Republic 4 times previously staying at Riu and Iberostar hotels, I have previously rated the Iberostar better than the Riu's but I certainly compare Dreams PC to the nicest Iberostar which is the Hacienda Dominicus in Bayahibe.On arrival we were greated with soft drinks and champagne, check in was quick and we were on our way to our room.ROOMSWe were given a room in block 5 on the ground floor, we were a bit disappointed with the size of the room, but it was spotlessly clean and the3 of us managed with the beds pushed together.The room was a bit noisy during the early hours with inconsiderate people staggering back from the Disco, but we soon slept through it.Nine days into our holiday we decided to upgrade to a honeymoon suite on the 1st floor in block 7 which gave our 11 year old his own bed in the lounge area, we loved this room and the novelty of the jacuzzi on the balcony, I think this may have spoilt us for future holidays!!FOODWe loved the arrangement of not booking ahead for the a la carte restaurants. The food was perfecly acceptable everywhere we ate, it is'nt how it tastes at home, but the ambience and the staff make each restaurant enjoyable. Our favourite's were chinese, oceana and bordeaux. The clam chowder in bordeaux was delicious and so was the scallop starter. Sometimes the time you wait in the restaurant's can be hit and miss but remind yourself you are on holiday, let the waiter top your glass up, and relax. Margarita, Carlos, Juan, Ingrid and many more are a credit to the Hotel.DRINKSLoved Mojito's,Samisosa's, Mudslide, Isla Coco's, Punta Cana special, Tanqeray GT's, champagne and I found the house wine to be perfecly acceptable especially the red. Hubby drank Johnny Walker over ice and the Presidente beer, our son loved the creamy cocktails minus alcohol.SWIMMING POOLLoved the pool, it was very clean, and it is the first holiday where the white on the swimwear did'nt discolour, water was very warm. There was a snake in the pool one day which one of the other guest's grabbed and put it in the bushes.BEACHDid'nt spend a great deal of time on the beach as someone we went with were in a wheel chair, but did swim in the sea near the trampoline and walked down the beach almost to the Sirenis. No complaints. ENTERTAINMENTWe loved Meky Mouse, and 50 cent, they all work so hard.I do think the Hotel should roll their entertainment programme over 2 weeks rather than 1 week, so us Brits don't get bored with the same show in the second week.Core Zone- WOW!! Our son disappeared there every evening until we collected him at 11ish. It's a kids paradise, certainly a jewel in the crown for the Hotel.EXCURSIONSDid the Tropicalstorm trip from Bavaro, sailing and snorkeling from a catamaran,we would all recommend it, and my son loved diving down with the fish with his snorkel on, which scared the hell out of me!!We also did horseriding locally through Sharon the VIP rep, we had never been on horses before and we loved it, the horses looked in good shape and we would recommend this trip also.We loved Dreams PC and our experience there would certainly encourage me to book another Dream's hotel. Don't get stressed about the bad reviews, anyone looking for faults and problems will find them if that's all they are looking for. Just remember when going to the D R you are booking a chilled out relaxing holiday and escaping the hustle and bustle. If it takes a few minutes to be served at the bar, relax and remember you are on holiday, you don't need your watch, leave it in the safe!!
