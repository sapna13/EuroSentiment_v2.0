{"text":"Good family hotel but a bit isolated This property was much nicer than I had expected. We were in town the weekend of the marathon and rates in other Boston hotels were astronomical. A Sweet Dreams rate of $189 for our family of 4 seemed downright cheap in comparison. It included a great breakfast buffet for 2 adults and our 11 year old son--our 13 year old daughter was considered an adult for purposes of breakfast, although kids under 18 stay free with parents. Parking was another $20 and, if we wanted wireless, we would have had to pay another $10 per day. However there are computers in the 2nd floor lobby where we could access the internet and that met our needs. The bedroom was large and had a comfortable bed, desk, TV\/amoire and a phenomenal view of the Charles river (we were in a corner unit on the 11th floor). The sitting room had a sofa bed (not so great) and room for a rollaway (nice one--$10 night) so it was perfect for our kids. They were excited about the plasma screen TV, but it was on the wall in an odd place given the furniture layout. There was some wear and tear obvious and some older looking fixtures, but anything that could be easily updated had been done (furnishings, linens, etc...). The concierge service varied a great deal; however, William was very helpful. The concierge arranged the shuttle service which we utilized each day because even with a car, we only drove when necessary (such as to the conference I was attending). It took 10-15 minutes to Copley Square and 30+ minutes to the Aquarium--through heavy city traffic. Though technically in the city of Boston, the hotel is much closer to downtown Cambridge than to any of the interesting parts of Boston and on a nice day, it would be a lovely walk to Harvard Square (about a mile). The shuttle also goes to Harvard Square. We didn't mind the location because we had stayed down in the heart of Boston the week before and felt less compelled to stay downtown. Harvard Square is a very interesting area with lots of restaurants and pubs and the Coop--Harvard's great bookstore. All in all, a good family hotel in a beautiful, but somewhat distant location for a visit to Boston.
