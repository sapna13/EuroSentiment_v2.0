{"text":"Great if you get it at a good price Four friends and I decided to travel here for our Christmas university break. We booked online and chose this resort because it had a 4 star rating on Orbitz and was very cheap. We paid $162 (USD) a day for a 7-day vacation, including flights from Seattle, WA. After we booked it, I found all of the negative reviews here on TripAdvisor. Needless to say, I was very worried. We arrived on December 14th and stayed until the 22nd. First off, some reviewers had a problem getting to the hotel. It's really easy, just hire a taxi. It cost $30 USD for a trip to the resort and they all know where it is. Doesn't matter how many people you cram in the taxi, and its quick and direct.Upon arrival in the morning, we checked in. There was no line in front of us, though I noticed that the check-in counter is ridiculously busy in the late afternoons. The person helping us was friendly enough, though it was hard to always understand him and he kept making fun of us. I think he was trying to be friendly, but it wasn't professional. We also got a free drink at the check-in counter.We were placed in Block 3. I'd originally requested a suite in blocks 9, 10 or 11, but they were all filled. Block 3 is a renovated portion of the resort that overlooks the ocean and pool. After walking around, I much preferred Block 3 from anywhere else.We had the third floor. Very high ceilings, two queen-sized beds. The room was large and clean, though the bathroom shower water was rarely very hot (but not cold, either...just that medium hot that's irritating when you're cold from the pool). The grounds are nice. The pool is big, though we spent most of the time at the beach. The beach isn't the nicest, and its on the atlantic side of the Dominican Republic so its windier. Lots of seaweed, though there are men who clean it up as it gets washed ashore. Lots of chairs and huts for shade; that was never a problem. You can also walk down the coast and find nicer beaches. I'd STRONGLY suggest getting a tour to Saona Island...best daytrip ever and that's where you'll find pristine white beaches and that clear, green-blue water that you think of when you think of the Caribbean.The food was good. All the restaurants are free except for the Japanese restaurant, so we never ate there. We ate at the Tex-Mex restaurant three times, the seafood restaurant one, and the Italian restaurant twice. For lunch, we ate at the snack bar (fries, burgers, fried chicken, and random main dishes). Breakfast, we'd eat at Windows. We only ate at Windows once for dinner. The restaurants are clean and the food is good. We liked the Italian restaurant the most. The hotel gives you reservation tickets and tells you you can only eat at one restaurant once. We went several times. Sometimes they asked for a ticket, sometimes they didn't. But they just leave the used tickets out on a desk and we grabbed extras.There are something like six bars. The drinks are ok, most of the time they don't know how to mix stuff so you have to know exactly what you want. Don't expect anything too fancy. If you want to get drunk, it's easy. Just do a lot of tequila shots.The people can be very rude and pushy, or very nice. The sales people that come on the grounds to sell you tourist trinkets are annoying and you just have to be firm and tell them you're not interested.I'd strongly suggest going off the resort for excursions. We did a Saona Island trip (all day) and an ATV ride (4 hours). Both were totally worth it.This resort is EXCELLENT if you are getting a good price.
