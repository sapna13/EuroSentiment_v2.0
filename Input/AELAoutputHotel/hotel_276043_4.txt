{"text":"Good value for your money... Just arrived home from a one week stay at the Berlin Marriott. As other reviewers have stated, it's centrally located with the U  S bahn only a slight walk away. Upon checkin, they offered the upgrade(70 Euro) to the executive club right away, but since we arrived at 11 pm, we opted to wait until morning to think about it. There were 3 of us staying and we did not have any problems getting 2 double beds in our room. Myself, my DH and his mom were taken to our room and we promptly fell asleep. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom spacious. I booked this hotel via priceline for a very good rate of $100\/night (that's us dollars!) Postdamerplatz is a little over rated, imo. We only stayed there b\/c I wanted a 5 star hotel (although I consider the Marriott a 4 star hotel.) I also wanted to stay in an american hotel b\/c I knew my MIL would stay with us sporadically throughout our stay in Berlin and wanted to option of getting 2 double beds instead of renting an entirely different room for her. The other days, she would stay with her Berliner relatives.The only sights that the Marriott is within walking distance is the Reichstag and Brandenburg gate as well as sony center. Every other sight, we took the U bahn to get to. After a good nights rest, Dh and I went to the lobby to inquire about the executive club upgrade. Turns out WiFi in your room would be 20 euros by itself, but with the upgrade, it was free. Thereby making the cost of 70E to really 50E as we really need the WiFi and would've ordered it regardless of the upgrade to EC. After discussing it, we were offered the upgrade for 60E\/night and accepted it. Essentially, we were paying 40E for the 3 of us for unlimited breakfast, drinks and evening goodies. And for our situation, since my MIL isn't very mobile, I knew she would not go sightseeing with us and wanted the option of the clubroom for her to go to for snacks or drinks while we were out.Unfortunately, my MIL didn't stay with us for as many days as I thought she would. So in the end, I felt a little cheated b\/c I didn't feel like 40 E was worth it for just Dh and myself. Since we are both young and mobile everyday she wasn't with us, we were roaming the streets and didn't get to use the clubroom much. Every evening around 5 pm, the clubroom had 2 hot appetizers as well as a few cold ones. There was also salad, cheese, breads and unlimited drinks of beer, wine, sodas or coffees and teas. There was one day where our relatives came to pick up my MIL and we had them wait for us in the clubroom to enjoy some coffee or tea w\/o any problems. So that's an added perk which we enjoyed. Hopefully our situation will help you determine if you'd upgrade to the clubroom for your stay. The Marriott is a nice, clean, centrally located hotel with good amenities. I would stay here again if I got it on Priceline, but I doubt I would pay the rackrate for it. Actually, I know I would not. But I feel like I received good value for my money.
