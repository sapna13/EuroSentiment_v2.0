{"text":"Very Nice But Noise Issues Detract From Its Excellence Overall I thought this was a very nice hotel. It has the understated elegance that I have found at other Four Seasons Hotels like Prague and New York. It is not a grand hotel but rather a modern contemporary one so there is really no wow factor. There is however outstanding service and amenities including what has to be one of the best hotel gyms. The hotel connects to Sports Club LA, the San Francisco edition and it is really a nice gym and spa as well as pool. The hotel bar is quite nice with a piano player and I thought the lobby was elegant.The hotel is in a great location right near the best shopping without the headache of Union Square. It is also only a small distance from Chinatown and by extension North Beach with its fabulous Italian Restaurants.....both areas are nice safe walks.The service is absolutely outstanding and even better than other Fours Seasons I have stayed at. Exemplary would be the best way to describe it. The food in the restaurant is very good but not fabulous especially for San Francisco which has incredible dining choices. Room service was fast and efficient and breakfast was good each morning but nothing off the charts.My only complaint which would give me pause in staying here again is that it is not sufficiently sound proofed. I am a relatively light sleeper and sleep with ear plugs. However even with the ear plugs I was awakened by sirens each of the three nights I stayed here and I was on the 11th floor. Many 5 and even 4 star hotels that I have stayed at have sufficiently sound proofed the rooms so that you don't hear sirens from the City. I realize San Fran is a noisy city but I have been in hotels in the world's noisiest cities and not heard the city from the room with the windows closed. I would have expected The Four Seasons to do the same and note that it has in NY. I am not sure why it was skipped here but it is a significant shortcoming in my book.I have stayed in a total of 6 hotels in San Fran. I would say The Four Seasons and The Fairmont are my favorites in this City. However I will proably keep looking. On the whole if I had to choose between The Four Seasons and The Fairmont I would probably chose a room with a bay and bridge view at The Fairmont. That view is just incredible and makes up for the difference between the Fairmont being a 4 star and The Four Seasons being a five star hotel. Just be forewarned that The Fairmont is an old grand hotel that is a bit worn around the edges in the old part which houses the lobby and the restaurant. The newer tower has the remodelled rooms that offer views of the bay and bridge if you request and pay for it. That is the place to be in that hotel.I am tempted to try the Huntington on my next trip to San Fran. It has great ratings on Tripadvisor and is on Nob Hill right near the Fairmont, The Mark Hopkins and Grace Cathedral which is a cathedral that is really worth looking at.In sum The Four Seasons is quite nice. It has some very strong qualities but I can neither state that I would definetly stay or not stay there again. If you are not a light sleeper I suspect the noise might not bother you although I do note that another reviewer commented that bells from a nearby church woke him up.
