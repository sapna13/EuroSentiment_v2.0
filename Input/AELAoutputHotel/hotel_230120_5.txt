{"text":"Rundown and Disappointing! The Sofitel was chosen for the group I travelled with for the Amsterdam Marathon. I would not have personally chosen this hotel, that said we did spend three nights in a very dark (even with every light turned on) and very small guest room which looked onto the very small alley way on the side of the Hotel. The decor throughout the property is well past its prime and needs replacement. The carpet in the guest rooms is well beyond that level and can no longer be made to appear clean. The marshmallow bed referred to in another posting here...is a veiled way of making a lumpy old mattress seem to have some new life. The feather bed and comforter were nice, but the bed itself was not! The bathroom included cracked tiles along the wall near the floor and just seemed worn (not dirty...just worn). The guest room was directly across from the elevators, which caused me some concern, but did not prove to be a significant problem. The staff at the front desk were young and very helpful with the exception of Rene, who appeared to be a manager\/supervisor for the Hotel. When inquiring about internet access both by phone and at the desk he appeared to be miffed that at other locations in the world it is not uncommon for it to be easily accessed or complimentary. Rene clarified that This is not America. to us as we inquired about hotspots in the neighborhood, and that there is a charge for everything in The Netherlands. His tone and demeanor put us off from any further interactions with the staff at the Hotel, making us feel very unwelcome and unappreciated as guests in his Hotel.
