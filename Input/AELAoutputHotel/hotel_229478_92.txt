{"text":"Excellent Hotel - Enjoyed Our Stay - Highly Recommended We came to Amsterdam for our first anniversary.The Crowne Plaza was a lovely relaxing hotel with excellent room service, a nice quiet bar and restaurant and a buffet breakfast second to none. The breakfast is all you can eat and has a large variety of fruits, cerials, yoghurts, pastries and breads plus the cooked section. Wonderful, and breakfast is open from 06:30 to 11:00 hours so there is plenty of scope for those early risers and those lazy snoozers, such as ourselves. The pool in the hotel is cool and relaxing and there are saunas in the changing rooms. With internet access also, the hotel truly was a fantastic place to stay.The hotel is placed in an excellent location within easy walking distance from Dam Square, the red light district and Centraal StationWe thought that we would try a kinky location and with the legalised red light district, we decided that Amsterdam would be more kinky than most. In truth, commercialised sex is actually very dull. We went on an organised Red Light tour which is well worth the Euros. Not only did it give us a flavour and an interesting perspective on the oldest trade but it also gave us a good grounding for finding our bearings in the maze of streets, alleys and canals. Personally I think that the oldest trade must be farming but I am wrong apparently. If, however, farming is your bag, there are plenty of organised tours of cheese farms etc.Many people recommend the sex show, Cassa Rosso but I really wouldn't bother. It seemed like a stale show full of stag parties and they bring customers in and out at such a constant rate that it does detract from the show. Not worth it, in my opinion. Spend your 45 Euros each on a nice meal instead.The drugs scene is alive and well in Amsterdam and it is tourism that the locals would rather not have. As well as the legalised coffee shops there is no shortage of sellers on the street offering harder drugs than cannabis. We have never been into hard or soft drugs and the proliferation of what appeared to be zombies was quite disconcerting. So many people were spaced out it was unreal. Many of these were riding around carelessly on bicycles. With the combination of cannabis, bicycles, trams, canals and the distraction of window brothels I am suprised that there are not more serious accidents.Rembrant Square seems to be a much rougher part of the city and we were approached by beggars on 3 occasions. I personally witnessed 2 crimes take place in this area and we did not feel safe in this location, despite hoards of other tourists. The red light area was safer. I would avoid Rembrant Square.Many people recommend trams and river taxis to get about but we went more or less everywhere on foot and nothing was too far away. If you are going to visit Anne Frank's house, get there early to avoid the queues.Madamme Tussauds is also a very good attraction to visit and we would recommend this too.In short we highly enjoyed our Amsterdam visit but it was made all the more special by The Crowne Plaza.
