{"text":"Gran Bahia - ROCKS I stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana Dec 24-31st 2006, travelling with friends. We are all in our mid 20s. I have travelled to other Caribbean hotspots (Cancun, Varadero, Puerta Plata) and had a wonderful stay here.Let me begin by saying that this hotel is indeed a 5 star resort. The grounds are always clean, food was great, drinks plentiful and staff were unbelievable. Check-in was all done on the bus ride to the hotel and once we got there we had the option of having our luggage delivered to our room while we ate dinner. Room was spacious, clean but lacked good lighting (but I always find this a concern in hotels). We never had any problems with our rooms - no bugs, water was always hot, good clean smell. One thing we learned a few days into our stay was that the air conditioning works only when the balcony door is shut - otherwise it turns off. The first few nights we left the door a tiny bit open and woke up the next morning with tons of mosquito bites - learned our lesson.Trams are great for access among the resort grounds. We were in the Diamond club - we had a great room location being in Villa 34. We could access the lobby and buffets very easily. I guess its just preference where you would rather be, closer to the beach or lobby.A la carte restaurants were good - Japanese sushi was a good try but the teppanaki was quite comparable. We also ate the Italian, Mexican and Garden Grill. Try the calzone at the Italian - was very good. Also - we realized that many people were not aware of the number of restaurants open for lunch - try the Mexican, Seafood, or Italian for a change from the buffets or the beach grill. Speaking of the beach grill - I have found from experience that usually the beach grills are very good - but here it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ very good - food was repetitive and out for many hours. Oh yes - and if you ever do get a chance to get a chicken sandwich at the Hamburger joint in the Pueblo Principe you will love it - we had it on the first night and never again (they always seemed to run out).Beach was breathtaking - and pools were quite good once you get tired of the beach thing. The main pool can get very crowded and loud - try the Diamond club pools for a nice change - the seated cushions are awesome when getting over a massive hangover.It would be nice if the lobby bars were open longer than 11pm. People usually move to the Pueblo Prinicpe afterwards for the karoke\/piano bar, disco and casino. These areas were mainly enjoyed by teens √à√\u2020\u2022?its amusing watching them get drunk on tequila√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√∂¬∫entured off to Pacha and Mangu (at the Occidental and Riu) - music is much better (best reggaeton I have ever heard), and crowd is older √à√\u2020\u2022?We overall had a great vacation here √à√\u2020\u2022?staff were so friendly and approachable. We lost 1 of our room cards and they never charged us. The bar guys at the lobby always poured premium liquor (just tip them). Having read many other reviews on this site, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a shame that people will find so many faults and let the little glitches ruin a vacation. The Gran Bahia is a wonderful resort √à√\u2020\u2022?have an open mind and some compassion √à√\u2020\u2022?go with the flow and enjoy!
