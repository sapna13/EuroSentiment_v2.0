{"text":"Good Hotel with Poor Billing Practices My husband and I just returned from our 8 night stay in Boston at the Park Plaza Hotel. We booked our flight and hotel in early March and prepaid the trip. Our initial impression of the hotel was amazing. When we checked in, the hotel offered a complimentary upgrade to a towers level room, which provided a complimentary continental breakfast, evening hors d'oeuvres, complimentary local and long distance phone calls, complimentary bottles of water in the room, bathrobe and slippers, upgraded marble bathroom, and nightly turndown service. Of course we opted for the upgrade and after taking the dedicated elevator that ran only from the lobby to the 15th floor towers level, found the room to well exceed our expectations.The room was small, after all it is an old hotel, and the bathroom was fantastic. The window opened, albeit a total of about 3 inches, but enough to let a cool Boston breeze enter the room. The towers level lounge was nice and the complimentary breakfast and hors d'oeuvres were tasty (although the same breakfast was served every day). Our only problems with the hotel involve several clerical errors that resulted in large pending charges to our credit card. We checked in on a Saturday and Monday we discovered a $1500 hold on our card. My husband went to the front desk and explained the situation and was told that there had been a clerical error and our room charges (which had been prepaid in March) were charged to our card instead of to hotels.com. The staff promptly cleared the hold and instead placed a $400 hold for any incidental charges ($50 a night for the 8 nights we were staying). We had no other problems until we were returning home the following Sunday and discovered a $757 hold on our card. This was after checking out and being told that we had no charges. My husband called the hotel and they explained that there was another clerical error and that the charge would not be processed. Today is Tuesday and the charge is still pending but has not cleared. I will watch it closely.While we were pleased with the hotel accommodations, we have been very displeased with the clerical errors affecting our credit card. I definitely would expect more from a 3.5 star hotel. Perhaps they were just hoping to make an extra buck - who knows. I would stay there again, but would definitely be careful what card I give them upon check in.
