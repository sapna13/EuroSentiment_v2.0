{"text":"Affordable luxury in Tokyo I stayed in this hotel with my parents for a week when they came to visit me in Japan. It was more than 2 years ago, but our stay was so good that I still remember it well.The hotel is located in central Tokyo near the Shimbashi station on the circular train line, so it's really easy to get to any part of the city from there. The Tokyo train station is also a few stations away, so it's really convenient if you want to go on a trip to Kyoto for example. Plus it's in the most modern part of Tokyo, everything is so clean and easy to find. There are a lot of restaurants in the area, and the chic area of Ginza and the Tsukiji fish market with it's delicious sushis are not far away. The hotel is located at the top floors of a skyscraper so the views of the Tokyo bay were beautiful. We even saw mount Fuji one day when the weather was clear. The rooms weren't huge but still at a good size. The decoration of the room is pretty modern, very comfortable and cozy. A nice surprise : the fragrance coming from the bathroom.The staff is the best my father has ever seen -- and he travels alot. They were so welcoming, kind and patient. They really honoured the Japanese sense of hospitality.We didn't go to the restaurants of the hotel much because they are quite expensive, but there are plenty in the area. We did go to the Japanese restaurant in the hotel for our last night though, and it was delicious, the best sushi I have ever eaten in my life. For breakfast we went to the caf√ã√\u2022√ñ at the ground floor, it was pretty good. There is also a Starbucks and a bakery in the Shiodome tower across from the hotel.
