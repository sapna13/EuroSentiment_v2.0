{"text":"I wish I was at El Conquistador right now... We visit El Conquistador from August 18 thru 25...and we had a wonderful time. The hotel is located on a mountain overseeing the ocean. Beautiful views, well kept grounds. We were upgrated to a full ocean view at the Marina and what a view!! The room was clean, modern and with cathedral cealings. (our room was on the 4th floor ). The hotel is HUGE...so there is a lot of walking if you are not in the main building, but for us it worked out fine because we were close to the boat to the island and to the Water Park...which we visit almost every day with the kids and it was a lot of fun.A lot of people complain about the food prices. Yes the food is expensive. But if this is your concern, rent a car and visit the local restaurants. There is a very casual restaurant called La Estacion with great BBQ steak and chicken (from the main gate - make a right - about 1\/4 mile). There is a more formal restaurant called Pasion por el Fogon...the best puertorican food you will ever taste (from the main gate, make a left - about 1 mile away). Also, on route 3( main road about 10 min from hotel)there are a lot of fast food restaurants, and there is a place called El Meson for a quick puertorican style sandwish. You can go to the supermarket and buy snacks and drinks. the room has a small fridge. We bought a foam cooler (for about 3 bucks) and put ice everyday for beers and water.My only complain was the selfparking. It will cost you 16.05 daily. You can come and go as you please, but you need to validate your ticket everytime you go out. There was a Pharmacist convention from Thursday to Sunday and the parking was always packed. Very hard to find a parking space at night. I have to say, I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews. I'm glad we stayed at El Conquistador and will go again anytime!!!
