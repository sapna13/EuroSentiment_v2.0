{"text":"Fantastic Charm We spent 3 nights at the Queen Anne. If you are looking for a different kind of place, off teh beaten path, with lots of Charm, this is a great place.The downsides first: it was a bit far from the main tourist attractions but that didnt stop my husband and I from walking everywhere - in attempt to save some cash, and actually see the city, we made 3 walks from various points in San Fran (i from the golden gate park, 1 from teh ghirardeli factory, and 1 from the train stop on embarcadero) all of which were far points as seen on a map, and they took 1-2 hrs to walk. It was a bit tiring, but it was great to see the different neighborhoods and houses and views from random spots in the city. (Keep in mind, we could have easily gotten a taxi or bus, we just chose to walk)Now the ups- the people who worked there were absolutely wonderful, they were very nice and helpful. The hotel itself, and the rooms were so wonderfully filled with character and charm; it was much more preferable to staying in the typical hotel room... mind you, it may not be necessarily as spacious - our bathroom was a bit small, but i definitely preferred this hotel to most others i've ever been in. It was quiet; they had a full dining area for the breakfast in the morning.. (typical continental breakfast) they provided a towncar drop-off service in teh a.m. you just had to sign up for it... they had a great map of the city which we used to get around the entire city with... free internet access, with a comp in the lobby for all to use, in case you didnt bring your own; They actually had someone who did a ghost tour of the queen anne and surrounding areas, which unfortunately my husband and I did not get to go on.... All in all, i thought this place was so charming we would definitely be going back if we get back to san francicsco. ","annotations":[]}
