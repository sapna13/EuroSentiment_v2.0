{"text":"There are better accomodations in Isla Verde Stayed at ESJ via a timeshare exchange through Interval International. The common areas in ESJ are clean even though the furnishings need updating. The units themselves are below average. They are clean, we had a room with a balcony overlooking the beach which was fantastic but the kitchens need a complete overhaul. The furniture is outdated and in ill repair. The units really need to be renovated. And, the access to the beach is through the garage which is a little scary when you are alone. During our stay, we experienced small bites on our ankles and lower legs and were afraid they were bedbugs even though we checked the beds thoroughly. The manager assured us that they were not bedbugs but sand fleas which we later found out to be true. He was gracious and sent staff up to our rooms to vaccum, change the linen and we did not have another problem. There are absolutely no amenities at the hotel so you are forced to go to neighboring hotels for fun. We had a WONDERFUL time in Isla Verde...we rented a car and toured Dorado, Loiza, Pinones and took a tour to Bacardi, Old San Juan and other towns. The Metropol Restaurant is the best....in walking distance to ESJ the food is great! And, we had the best Mofongo in another small restaurant in a strip mall near ESJ (cannot remember the name! Sorry!) I heard the Intercontinental is a great hotel to stay in so next time, we will probably go there.
