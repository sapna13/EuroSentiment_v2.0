{"text":"Excellent Hotel The rooms are clean and quite roomy. I was worried that the rooms were going to be small since I only booked regular rooms, but it turned out to be pretty good. It can be tight if you have 4 ppl in one room. We had only two and it was totally fine. The service was pretty good at the front desk, they were pretty helpful and nice. The views of the lobby of the hotel was beautiful. In the morning or night, you can walk around the area by the water. The harbour view is really nice. The view from the gym and pool is fantastic. The size of the pool is not as big as shown on the hotel's website. But the view makes up for it. the gym is pretty ok for a hotel gym. You are close to the ferry (3 min walk). You can take it to Central, WanChai and NorthPoint. It's faster than mtr. The area has lots of shopping and good restaurants. There's also a delicious bakery down the block where i get breakfast almost every morning. THere's also a famous dessert place around the area too. In terms of location, the only bad thing is that it's not close to one. It's about 5 mins cab or bus ride away. But this is the place to be if you want to be away from the crowd in the morning. The hotel area is very residential so it's not packed when you walk downstairs. If you walk further out (1-2 blocks), you get all the stores you need like shopping, restaurants, 7-11, pharmacy, etc. Excellent stay and I will definitely go back again! ","annotations":[]}
