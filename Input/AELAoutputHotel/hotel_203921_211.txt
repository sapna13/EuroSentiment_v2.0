{"text":"nice hotel- terrible location! There seem to be a lot a reviews on Trip advisor that say things like, 'so wonderful to be out of the tourist path  bustle', and to a point I agree. It is nice in a busy city to slip out of a main thoroughfare and into a delightful little street where your charming old hotel awaits your weary head. Alas- not so here!Florence is a beautiful place, but in the summer months it gets very hot and dirty, and traffic is an ever-present evil (and I mean italian traffic; of the hooting, gesticulating and dodge-for-your-life variety). The main way you find yourself getting around it by walking and, if you are to see a fraction of what this magnificent city has to offer, you will do a LOT of walking. So the very last thing you will want to do at the end of a hot and dusty day is to force your aching feet to propel you for at least another half an hour to be able to get to your hotel! The David is a nice hotel for sure, the rooms are clean, and the little amateur frescoes painted in unexpected places are quirky and charming. The staff are helpful and unassuming, (despite giving us wrong information about the opening hours of the Brancacci chapel), even if the room towels are completely inneffectual (the towel equivalent of that old fashioned shiny toilet paper- more akin to tracing paper; whose chief purpose seemed to be dispersal, rather than absorbtion).But it really is miles away from anything- and in the opposite direction to everything else, so you won't come across it on en route to anything else. In fact most tourist maps won't even have it on there. The hotel advises that you can use the buses when they come- but we found them packed, dirty and irregular. Also, after hours of sweaty sightseeing, who wants to wait twenty five minutes for a municipal bus to get you home? My other gripe is that- by all means site your hotel 'away from the action' if there is something to be gained from from it; perhaps a romantic vista of the city, or remote tranquility etc. But the David is on a hideous main road, where the honks, brake screeches and sirens are probably more pronounced than anywhere else! And as for views? Well they would be of the same road. Not a pretty sight, and not what E.M Forster would have had in mind.A nice little hotel- and fairly reasonable, but a 20 min+ walk in the baking florentine sun to the far side of the Ponte Vecchio is just not mainstream hotel territory. Nice when you're there though.
