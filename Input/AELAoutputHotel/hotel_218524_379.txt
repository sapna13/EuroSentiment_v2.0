{"text":"Perfect Honeymoon My wife and I stayed at Excellence for 12 days starting at the end of April for our honeymoon. It was amazing. We could have stayed a lot longer!Location: It was perfect. A huge beach with lots of privacy. Grounds were beautiful and well kept. If you walk the beach about a mile you can find calmer water.Entertainment. All I want to say is Domingo. WOW can that guy play the saxophone. He is amazing. I had never seen anyone as talentented as him. His music is amazing. He is the perfect night cap. We bought 2 of his CD's which are excelent. (If you are reading this Domingo - hi from Scott and Marie from Minnesota). Food: It was very good. Enjoyed all the restraunts! Service was great and the food did not dissapoint. It exceeded our expectations. Looked forward to breakfast, lunch and dinner dining experiences. David was our favorite waiter. Favorite spot was Spice.Drinks: There is something for everyone. I like beer, but we really enjoyed the Sammy Sosa's. Excursions- We did 5 of them. We liked them all. It would be very tough to rank them so I won't.Saona Island: wow was that a beautiful island and what a blast on the catamaran. The crew on ours was a lot of fun.ATV: was a lot of fun, got very dirty. Went to a very cool cave, and got to swim in it. Very rememberable experience. Bavaro Runner: Neat to see. Got to tour a Dominican home. See coffee and cocoa being made. See cigars made by hand and smoke them. Also eat a buffet lunch in the mountains.James Bond: Cool to drive your own speedboat to a little splash pad and snorkling. A must for adventurous people.Deep sea fishing: A good experience. I caught a Barracuda which was fun. We went through Alvin on the beach.Overall a first class resort that we plan on visiting again. Domingo we miss you and hope to make it back to see you play soon.
