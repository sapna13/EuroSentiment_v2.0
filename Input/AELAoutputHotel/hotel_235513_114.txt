{"text":"Some parts ok After travelling from Melbourne for many hours I made it on March 30 and left April 4 The beds were fantastic, so were the toiletries, the concierge great (he organised and we paid people to line up for tickets that we would have to have been there at 6am !) but it stops there ! The heating was appaling and we actually slept one night with the door wedged open as it was too late to request any changes. Ended up getting a cold due to crazy heating\/cooling. The next day I spoke to the customer relations manager and we were moved and appropriate changes were made to the bill. The free internet in lobby area worked for one day out of 4 , the food in the breakfast restaurant very very expensive, and despite being a Privelege member (signed up before we left) we were not given the welcome deal until we asked. Stay at Sofitel? again not really after this experience.Great location, great cheap lunch places nearby to eat such as a Loebs, great Jewish run cafe\/diner\/New York Deli with great soup and sandwiches,Georgia Browns restaurant ok and had signed up online as a member before hand and got a main course (entree) for free with a voucher. Dined at The Willard for the once in a lifetime of amazement. Our Prime Minister Mr Howard stays here it is just so beautiful ! The food was oustanding and so was the service. It was US$201 for 2 with food and wine and just stunning with personalised menus to boot ! Found a Filenes, Borders and Ann Taylor so I was happy. Washington great and the cherry blossoms were the best. Lots of people but who cares ?
