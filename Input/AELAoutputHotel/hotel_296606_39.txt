{"text":"Very nice place I stayed in the hotel for two nights. I arrived Monday morning 11.00 am way too early to check in, which was 2pm. The charming young lady on the reception, told me she would find me a room which was available.. i got a double room for the price of the single i had booked. The staff where very nice, The room was good, TV, Safe, Nice size bed, shower \/ toilet. Telephone, Air con, lots of electricity points for your various camera and phone recharging, plenty of towels, and wardrobe space. only downside was there was no view from the window, which looked out onto an alley way - right into some ones apartment..The room was on the second floor rm 205, it was served by an elevator. the door entry is by card, and you also use this card to power the room electricity supply..by placing in a wall slot. Although i did not see a baggage room as such, you could leave your bags in the hotel, until you where ready to leave or check in..but only placed on the floor, by the elevator..The hotel has a reception desk, and bar combined. The bar is open 24 hrs.. i did not have breakfast, but fellow guests said it was fine. the hotel front door is electronically controlled from the front desk to keep out any unwanted people.All in all i enjoyed my stay and would stay again. The location is great also, its about a five minute walk from Amsterdam station, ","annotations":[{"endOffset":349,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":345},{"endOffset":349,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":345}]}
