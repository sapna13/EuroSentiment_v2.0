{"text":"Very nice traditional hotel - great location I just returned from a short week stay at the Maria Cristina Hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?my 3rd short visit in about as many years.It remains an excellent mid-level (not expensive) downtown choice. Great location √à√\u2020\u2022?easy quick walking distance to the Zona Rosa across the Reforma Ave, but quiet and in a safe location. Long walk possible either to the old center or the Museum\/park area (maybe half an hour each direction to the Anthropology Museum and to the Zocalo in the opposite direction, or easy public transit or taxi). The Zona Rosa is getting abit tacky in places but remains safe, with loads of restaurants and bars around (along with some good stores). There are several 7-11 type stores (oxxo√à√\u2020\u2022? nearby for yogurt, extra water√à√\u2020\u2022? along with several seemingly nice small eateries. The US and UK embassies are both fairly nearby (easy 5 min walk away).The hotel is clean, quiet, with a very nice bar and garden, and also a restaurant √à√\u2020\u2022?good breakfasts though the coffee was not the best (but you can buy good coffee several places nearby). I believe that there are two levels of rooms √à√\u2020\u2022?the smaller traditional ones (fine √à√\u2020\u2022?I was there last time around) and the larger two-double or queen bed ones (which I had this time). The staff are excellent and the front desk speaks good English. Rooms include good shower\/bath, nice TVs (not digital) and a good range of cable, phone, small fridge and an included electronic safe. No alarm clock or radio though (but the front desk is good for wake-up calls). Internet is available at a cost √à√\u2020\u2022?you need to pay the front desk to use one of the 3 computers on the ground floor.I will probably be back in Mexico City next year and, if possible, will be back at the same hotel again √à√\u2020\u2022?it is a very good choice for the price and location.
