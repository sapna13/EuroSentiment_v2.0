{"text":"*MAHALO* We'll be back soon!* What to say, it was so good experience.For my birthday we spent 1 week in waikiki, with my family (husband, daughter 6years old and I) we loved it!The room was ok, we had a small room with 2 small beds that we thought to have 2 big beds but everything was Ok, we are in holidays so no worries, be happy, we are in vacantion!!! We are from Tahiti- French Polynesia, we are simple!The price was good and breakfast included, every morning my daughter loved to go down to get our breakfast (1 cup of jus or coffee and 1 muffin) so excellent! we used the swimming pool, it was cold but my daughter liked it! but I did go because I'm so frizzzzin' and the weather this day was cloudy.C\/I was ok, we came earlier at the hotel about 9am but the C\/I was at 3pm, we went to the staduim and came back around 2pm, the room was clean.The only problem is the elevator, 2 were broken and to take elevator we have to wait long long time and it's always full and occupate by the housekeeping and the bell boys and the other is the parking it should be free for guest of the hotel.SO MAHALO Maile Sky Court for your service, thanks also the lady who clean our room everyday Katalina from phillipine, and she just lost her father feel sorry for her...Well, some of my friend are coming to Castle Maile Sky Court the end of this year, I gave the address...And we will be back soon!!See you and Mahalo again!
