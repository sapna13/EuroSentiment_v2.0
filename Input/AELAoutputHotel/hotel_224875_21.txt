{"text":"This is an Inter-Continental??? Could have fooled me! If you have to stay here, leave your preconceived notions of the Inter-Continental Hotel brand at home. This place is more like a Holiday Inn Express.The staff were apathetic and downright unhelpful in any regard. Many, including the lady making omelets at breakfast, didn't speak a word of English. (Forgive me, but when I stay at an international-chain hotel anywhere in the world, I expect the restaurant and front-desk staff to speak English. Miami is no exception.)Physically, the place is comfortable enough, but no more comfortable than any other airport hotel. (I will say, however, that the rooms are very well sound-proofed. I couldn't hear any planes taking off or landing during the night.) My room was small, with a parking-lot view. Bathroom amenities were only standard. The bed was way, way too soft and mushy. (Bad mattresses are bad mattresses, no matter how many layers of linens and pillows you throw on them.)Room service was slow and EXTREMELY overpriced. The breakfast was similarly overpriced and just okay. The business center has a single computer\/printer and closes early.Check-out was slow. The check-in clerk did something wrong with my credit card (I never did understand what the problem was, because the check-out clerk explained the problem to me in Spanglish) and this delayed my departure -- with no apology.Finally, the location is awful. It's technically an airport hotel, because it's just beyond the far end of one of the MIA runways. But the runways are very LONG; it's at least a 20-minute taxi ride from the terminal to the hotel. The hotel is nowhere near the beach -- or anything else for that matter. Unless you're there to visit one of the nearby strip-malls, stay elsewhere. ","annotations":[]}
