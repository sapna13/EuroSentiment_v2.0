{"text":"Awesome Hotel! I stayed for two nights at the Banks Mansion in late April 2007. I made my reservation directly with the hotel; first good sign - the staff promptly (within a few hours) responded to my e-mail reservation inquiry. From the moment I walked in the door, until the moment I checked out, it was a terrific experience. The staff, ESPECIALLY the front desk staff, were super friendly, helpful, and patient with all my tourist questions. The included breakfast buffet provided tasty, ample selections (sandwich meats, cheeses, omelets, cereals, breads, etc.) from which to energize ones' self at least through lunchtime. My canal-view room was clean, modern, and quiet. The bed was a deliciously comfortable respite from a long day of sightseeing, stocked with 4 plush pillows; goes without saying that I slept VERY WELL!!! Bonuses ranged from an in-room refrigerator stocked with various beverages (included), to individually regulated and responsive air conditioning in the room, to free internet access and daytime snacks\/drinks in the lobby. The hotel is centrally located to tourist attractions (many can be reached within 20 minutes' walking time), and a tram line runs right past the hotel which takes you to points north and south in the city. If and when I ever go back to Amsterdam, I already know where I will stay. Great place. Now I know why Banks Mansion is so highly rated by other travelers. I couldn't agree more. Thank you, Banks Mansion, for contributing to my overall delightful and successful visit to Amsterdam!
