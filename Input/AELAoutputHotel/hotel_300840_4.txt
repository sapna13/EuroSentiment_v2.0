{"text":"Pretty Good I booked directly via the hotel website. They have some good deals over there so be sure to look before you book from any place else. The location of the hotel is absolutely fantastic. It is connected to Harbor City, which is one of the largest mall of HKG. I took the airport express from the airport to Kowloon station. From there I took the complimentary shuttle bus K2 which drops you outside the hotel. The lobby is nothing fantastic. They had a lot of people behind the check desk in but for some reason they took more than 5 minutes to check me in when there was just 1 person ahead of me. The lobby was teeming with people. Then I found out that the hotel was celebrating the Octoberfest on the 6th floor and the only access for people was thru the hotel elevators. They gave me a club floor room. I had to go to the 17th floor where there was another reception. There was a strange smell on the 17th floor, maybe because it was heavily wooded and it could be the wood smell. They gave me my room key. I had requested a non smoking room and as I opened there was a terrible stale smoke smell that was emanating from the room. The room in itself was very very average. I was shocked that this was the upgraded room. I went back to the reception and told that I could not take this room as it was smelling. So they gave me another room on the 8th floor. This room was great. A piece of advise. If they want to give you a club level room, dont take it. The room I had was on a regular floor but it was huge, with a seperate walk in closet and bath and shower area. There were also 2 basins. This room was substantially better than the so called club floor rooms. The hotel does not have a gym but they have tied up with another fitness center which is about a 5 minute walk called Fitness First. You will see flyers on the floor saying that you can ask to use the place for HKD 55, but just ask the concierge and he will give you a free VIP pass. The location is amazing. If you want to go to HKG Island just use the Star ferry. The pier is located opposite to the back entrance of the hotel. It costs HKD 2.2 to go to either Wanchai or Central. Subway costs 8.5 and the station is at 5-7 minute walk from the hotel. Breakfast was good, mine was included in the rate. Overall is a good hotel for the price. I paid an average of HKD 1550 per night for 2 nights, which considering Hong Kong is pretty good. On the way back I took the airport express back and so could check in my luggage and get my boarding pass etc at the station. No worry about lugging luggage to the airport.
