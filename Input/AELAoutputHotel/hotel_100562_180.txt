{"text":"Great Stay Sheraton Seattle Hotel, Excellent StayDate: June 27, 2007Reviewer: Trip Advisor Member, Las Vegas, NVWe just spent 4 nights at the Sheraton from June 21-25 and have to say that our stay was excellent. I had read some prior reviews about the remodeling that was going on but decided to book our stay anyway. Upon arriving at the hotel we found the lobby has been completed and is just magnificent. We were very impressed as we entered the lobby and somewhat impressed with our rooms. It is a perfect location to get around the points of interest in Seattle and easy access to ride the city bus system. We attended a Mariner's game and had no problem taking a city bus right to the stadium at no charge, there was a $1.25 charge per person on the way back. It is very easy to travel within the city through this system, if you don't mind. We felt very safe at all times. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and courteous at all times. P.F. Changs and Cheesecake Factory are around the corner plus many more restaurants, a shopping mall is also within a block or two. Not to forget, Starbucks is across the street, plus your coffee in the room is also Starbucks brand. There is a shuttle that you can take at the airport that drops you off and picks you up right in front of the hotel for a $17.00 roundtrup fee, the airport is approximately 10-12 miles from the hotel, call the hotel and ask for the information. The location of this hotel makes a difference, it is centrally located and the convention center is a block away. All in all, my wife and I had a GREAT time in Seattle and part of that was because we stayed at the Seattle Sheraton. A place that we will definitely stay on our future trips to Seattle.
