{"text":"Decent hotel and worth it Location: Hotel is somewhat far from the actual downtown area. It is situated near the I-5 and REI. If you have a car, you can get to Pike Place Market, Seattle Aquarium, Argosys cruise, the Space Needle  other points of interests downtown in 5-7 mins. If you'd rather walk, then it's a good 20-25 mins. Suite: Rooms were spacious with two TVs and a separate sit-in area w\/ microwave  fridge (always a plus in my family!!!). Beds were very comfortable. My husband had a restful sleep! Food: Delicious hot breakfast buffet, which was plentiful  fabulous! Loved the waffles w\/ peach fruit topping! Only drawback was the dining area was crowded, overflow crowds had to sit in the lounge area. Check out the Crab Pot at Pike Place - long wait but the seafood was worth it!There's a Starbucks and Subway fast food place across the street. A 24-hr. Fitness gym across the street as well.Front desk staff very helpful. Only drawback was we asked for wake-up call and no one woke us up. Pool (although small) was relaxing late at night. Transportation: Around Seattle, we parked our car across the street from Ivar's at Pike Place Market for all day parking ($25). Convenient buses everywhere. Took the bus to get to Space Needle, Seattle Center, and the monorail to downtown's shopping district. Only walked 2-3 blocks to get to PPM.Purchased the Seattle GoCard for added savings on attractions for family.Overall, next time we're in Seattle will definitely stay at Springhill Suites Marriott downtown!
