{"text":"great deal for the price We were looking for a quickie get away on the beach. The resort is spotless, the staff incredibly friendly, and beach is lovely. The price was quite reasonable. The place is way to big for our taste, but the specialty restaurants helped reduced the expansive feel of the place. We had some of the best meals we have ever had in the Caribbean at the Cajun and gourmet restaurants.The staff are marginal in their English speaking ability, but were happy to help us with our Spanish. You just have to be patient. We walked on the beach a lot. The entire experience was very continental. We could easily have been on the Riviera. Very few Americans there, mostly Spanish, German, French and British. Also a large contingent from Calgary.We took one snorkel trip to the Marinarium. It was a waste of time. The boat was crowded, the coral is dead and it took up 1\/2 day of our precious 7 day stay.We scheduled this through the American Airlines website and bought airport transfers. The agent in DR is Prieto Tours. They never came to get us on the departure date and when the front desk called, the boss had left and we were told to take a cab. We did, but it left us in a rush and cost us an extra $33 plus tip for the cab. I would avoid Prieto tours in the future.Otherwise, a place well worth the money. Glad we went. The DR is getting ready to really turn into a large tourist spot. I suggest you go soon to enjoy its beauty. ","annotations":[]}
