{"text":"More like a 3 star than a five star We stayed in an executive club room for 4 nights.The room was large enough and the signiture westin heavenly bed didn't disappoint as usual.However the walls were paper thin-We could not only hear the conversations and laughing in both next door rooms,we could have spoke to them,we most certainly heard every word.This unfortunately included things you do not want to hear at 4am involving the couple in the room next door.Essentially there was no privacy,it was like staying with the waltons except late at night that couple next door weren't the waltons!The shower in the rather small bathroom was awfull with sometimes only luke warm water and the water pressure was poor.The bathroom was a disgrace I thought,it was kitted out like a public washroom in my opinion.The bathroom floor tiles looked dirty as if they hadn't seen a mop in a long time.The club lounge was nicely appointed but the hot snacks in the evening were poor,they tasted like they were reheated over several nights eg dried out mini quiches and mini sausage rolls.It was a nice enough place to relax and read a paper untill the crowds came in at snack time's and at breakfast time.The self service basic continental breakfast was grand.I wouldn't recommend this hotel to be honest,it's too pricey for what it offers and it is far from luxurious.It's more like a poor 4 star or a standard 3 star.The only 5 star quality I thought it had was the fact that it offers 24hr room service.
