{"text":"Peacock Paradise!!! My family stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro September 1-8, 2006.The trip from Pittsburgh directly to Punta Cana was without incident. Found the Punta Cana airport to be less taxing then when we went to Cancun. Just remember it's 10 buckaroo's to get in! The ride to the resort was interesting as well as the AppleRepresentative telling us about Punta Cana. I suggest an Apple tour...they are fabulous!The resort and grounds were meticulous. Bavaro is excellent. The staff is lovely. I didn't find an unhappy person at the facility. They love tips so make sure you take plenty of one dollar dinero's for just that . My 14 year old son was just busy as ever with pool activities and such. He did the scuba diving and loved it. We also took the Outback tour to the mountains which gives one a look into how the Dominicans really live. We even stopped at a school and were sung to. Make sure you get your hands on some Dominican champagne...you'll get a kick out of it!Make sure that you have plenty of aspirin and sun lotion because it will be very expensive if you need to purchase any of theseitems there...as the boy scouts say...be prepared!The only negative of the trip is the musty smell in the rooms.Take along some dryer sheets and put them in your suitcases and in your dirty clothes bags. Our luggage still has the scentbut it's funny how I minded it there but it's not so bad now because it reminds me of the trip. Bring candles or incense to burn as well. You'll be happy you did.Enjoy your stay in Punta Cana..it's fab and very kid friendly!!Peace Out ","annotations":[]}
