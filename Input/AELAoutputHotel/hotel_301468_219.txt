{"text":"Sensational Singapore!! : ) We stayed at this wonderful hotel in early March '07 for 4 nights, after booking through asia best hotels for $210 SIN per night including full buffet breakfast. At this price it presented as excellent value for money - (included +++).About S$15 for a taxi from Changi Airport direct to the hotel (cheap), where check-in was very friendly and a complete breeze. However, when we went to the deluxe city view room on the 7th floor, we discovered the configuration was 2 x twin double beds. Not much good for our 1st year wedding anniversary! After checking our paperwork from the internet booking company, I found the mistake had been mine, erroniously ticking twin instead of double!! Oooops. (Had done the same for our next hotel in Phuket also! Double ooops)Back we went to the reception desk, cap in hand, to try and get a king bed room. Well, I think the poor girl may have thought the mistake was their's as we were upgraded to the Grand City View room which is about 49 sqm and USD $320 pn on their website. Beautiful.She personally escorted us up to the 9th floor to ensure we were happy with the room (which we were!) and left us to settle in. The room was massive with a seperate sitting\/lounge area, huge balcony, seperate dressing area and massive dark marble bathroom. It had all the usual trappings of a 5 star hotel with Wireless high speed internet access, Cable television, work desk, Dual-line telephones with IDD and voicemail, Bathtub and a separate glass enclosed shower, Plush terry-towelling bathrobes and slippers,Tea and coffee making facilities, Hair dryer and mini bar  Daily selection of local and international newspapers. The only thing that could possibly be improved on would be the brightness of the lighting in the bathroom area (mirror), which I found a little dim. This hotel is really quite beautiful inside with a stunning internal atrium area and glass elevators. The decor is unmistakeably asian with dark hues and huge chandelliers. The pool area is what you would expect with a 25 metre lap pool and adequate gym area. Only missing a hot spa! The pool attendants quickly  happily set you up with a lounger, plush pool towels  free bottled water. (The hotel provided several free bottles of mineral water in your room also).Breakfast was the most comprehensive that I have ever seen - anywhere. On the first day we wondered in all of it was really included in the price we had payed. Definately try to get it included because it costs about S$45 per person if you pay on the day. They had there own little bakery cooking anything you wanted, eggs done anyway you liked, fresh squeezed juices in front of you etc etc etc... It really has too many food choices to list here, but you could never get bored with it and the service was just great and so quick. The location of the hotel is perfect. The Marina shopping centre it is attached to is one of the best we found in Singapore really. (MRT Station, great Restaurants, a bowling alley, cinemas and all the shops you could want.) The Merlion was an easy walk, river boat tours, fountain of wealth and Raffles Hotel. Watch those Singapore Slings though at S$44 for two at Raffles! But you gotta do it! We tried the MRT a couple of times but honestly the cabs are so very reasonable in price we just caught them in the end or walked. The night safari is a must-do and we enjoyed that immensely. We just caught a cab there and back from the Oriental which was under S$20. We really loved Singapore in general, the Oriental Hotel and would love to go back sometime soon.
