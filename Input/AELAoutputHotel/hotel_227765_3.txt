{"text":"Get me outta here - fast! This place is a complete dump. I wish I had've read these reviews before booking. It is cheap but now I know why. I can't believe they have a licence to provide accomodation - the health dept should shut them down!Let's see - it is dirty, run down, and NOISY. Oh my goodness - the NOISE - from the room next door, the people in the hall and from the street. We were the only non-Asian family on our floor and the others were all part of a Vietnamese tour group - so they congregated outside our room until 1am and held parties and cook-off's the floor smelled like a bad restaurant. It made me feel ill. The hotel had to steam clean the carpet the next day to get rid of the smell. Every night at 12am I called the front desk pleading for them to make the noise stop. Eventually, after 3 days they let us move rooms (although they charged us extra for the new room because it was bigger). It was no better - we could hear EVERYTHING going on next door because the adjoining door was made of tissue paper (well, it seemed like that!). Unfortunately it was our bedroom which adjoined their lounge room and their noisy kids woke at 5am every day which meant - so did we! Our shower was a trickle (seriously - I am NOT exaggerating) and it went cold randomly. The kitchen utensils were so old and revolting that I wouldn't cook with them. The stove was about 50 years old - again, this is the honest truth!!It is the hotel from HELL and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy! ","annotations":[]}
