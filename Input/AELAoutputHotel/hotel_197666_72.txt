{"text":"Small and friendly, boutique hotel in a great location We chose this hotel purely because of its tripadvisor rating and we weren't disappointed.The hotel is in a great location - just a ten minute walk to the Eiffel Tower, close to lots of shops and restaurants, two minutes from a good Metro station (3 lines) - so we were off to a good start.We arrived early in the morning but hotel staff were really helpful and made a room available for us even though it was before check-in time. All the staff were great - really helpful and friendly.Breakfast is good - nothing fancy but perfectly adequate - and unexpected as we hadn't realised breakfast was included. You can have breakfast in your room at no extra charge if you prefer.The decor is fresh and clean - more Italian than French in design - newly decorated this year. The fixtures and fittings in the room are first rate (BO TV, Villeroy and Boch cuttlery, Duravit sanitary ware etc.)The only complaints we had were that the room was too hot at night and the air conditioning insufficient to cool it down. The room was pretty small too (and this was a superior double) - but I guess you expect that in Paris.We had a fabulous time but be prepared - Paris is expensive!! Having lived there in the past, I was shocked at how much things have changed and how badly you can get ripped off when buying drinks, bottled water from street stalls etc. Given the attrocious exchange rate at the moment, you may end up more skint that you'd anticipated. We were almost forced to go begging on the Metro by the end of our stay!! ","annotations":[]}
