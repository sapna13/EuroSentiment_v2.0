{"text":"Fantastic Service I just returned from a fantastic stay at the Wyland. The location of the hotel is great, it is one block off Waikiki beach and an easy walk to all of the areas attractions. The hotel is newly renovated, and the entire hotel is decorated with art by renowned ocean artist David Wyland (who I love). The rooms are very clean, the beds are comfortable and I believe all of them feature a lanai, which is a bonus considering the reasonable rate ($149) that I paid for the room. The main thing that impressed me about the Wyland was the service. I arrived at HNL airport from Australia early in the morning,expected to have to store my luggage for the day before I checked in at the usual time of 3pm. When I arrived at 11am, I was given the key to my room and assured that there was no extra charge for the early arrival.The hotel concierge was extremely helpful in setting up my activities during my stay (including scuba diving and hiking through the rainforest), and no request seemed too difficult.On the last day of my stay my flight wasn't due to leave hawaii until 11pm. I had booked a tour that left early in the morning, and didn't arrive back at the hotel until 1pm. The hotel graciously allowed me to have a late checkout, then stored my luggage, booked my shuttle to the airport and told me that they had a hospitality suite that I could use when I returned to pick up luggage and go to the airport. As most seasoned travellers would know, the best thing you can have before getting on a plane for 15 hours of travel is a shower... so I made use of the fantastic hospitality suite until the front desk called and let me know my shuttle had arrived. Overall I was most impressed and would definately recommend the Wyland to anyone wishing a relaxing holiday in Oahu. ","annotations":[]}
