{"text":"Faulty Towers Seattle Look, you really could do better than this hotel. After the fire alarms (one at 07:30 on Christmas day), the hot water failure (almost all day), the internet failure (again, most of the day), the broken clothes driers, the kitchen that fell apart when we touched it, the front desk saying yes but meaning no we gave up and moved to another hotel. And saved $30\/night for a bigger better room! In a better part of town! Long story short, they're undergoing a renovation that is being done poorly (we stayed in a renovated room). The design of the hotel is poor: windows that can't open and windowless, dark living rooms for the one bedroom suites. Our kitchen was never equipped with pots and pans although we made repeated requests. Our hide a bed comforter never came although we asked for one several times. Unless you have a lot of time to deal with an endless list of challenges and you don't mind paying absolute top dollar for this kind of hotel, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.On the plus side, the breakfast could not have been nicer and the evening reception (with meals, basically) looked nice as well. The front desk did their best to help us most of the time and they did take money off of our bill when we asked them to do so after all of the equipment failures, etc. It's not as if the staff aren't trying, it's just too little too late.
