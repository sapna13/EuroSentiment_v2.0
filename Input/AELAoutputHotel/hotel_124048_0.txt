{"text":"Must have got lucky going by other reviews After reading some of the negative things said regarding this hotel, I'm left feeling that I must have got extremely lucky in that I enjoyed my stay. First of all I found the staff very friendly and helpful (apart from one when I was checking in) and they organised taxi's and tours for my brother and I who were staying in Seattle for a few days. I found the room clean and the bed was as comfortable as you were going to get in a 2 or 3 star hotel. The only problem was a loose tap in the bathroom sink and I'm not about to moan about that like it was the most disastrous thing that could have happened on a holiday - like some people do. There was a bit of noise from outside but lets face it, your in the centre of a large city, not some health spa in the countryside. And it was hardly enough to interrupt a nights sleep.  In fact, the fact that the hotel is in the centre is one of its bonuses. A 10 minute walk in one direction will take you to the Space Needle, where you'll get all the views you want of Seattle; another 10 minute walk in the opposite direction will take you into a shopping district which has all the major stores. And a 5 minute walk in yet another direction will take you to the sea\/waterfront. There's also plenty of taxi's and public transport available right outside the door so no one should have a problem getting around Seattle. One thing I would suggest is that if your thinking of staying a week or two in Seattle, there are much nicer parts of the city, but if like myself your only thinking of a few days before moving on, its as good a base\/hotel as your going to get. Again, I must emphasize, this is not a fancy hotel (as the cost should clearly show) so don't be expecting too much. If your easy to please, you'll like it. ","annotations":[]}
