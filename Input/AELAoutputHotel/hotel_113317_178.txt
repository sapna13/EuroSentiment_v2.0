{"text":"Perfect location and excellent staff! My partner and I stayed at Casablanca in March '08 for 2 nights.We arrived at JFK airport around 8am and jumped on a bus (approx $15 each) which dropped us off at the bus depot, 5 minutes walk from the hotel. A taxi would probably have been an easier option - they have a flat rate FROM JFK to anywhere on Manhattan $45 + tolls ($4.50) + tip. Back to the airport you're put on the meter.We arrived at Casablanca pretty early (just before 10am) and so didn't expect to be able to check in. However, they were really helpful and had a room available for us - and also upgraded us to a king room! So we went upstairs for a much appreciated shower.On our way back out the concierge was very helpful with tours, what to do and where to go, and even booked some bus tour tickets for us. $49 each gets you on a double decker city bus tour valid for 4 different routes (downtown, midtown, uptown, brooklyn heights) plus a night route for 48 hours. We jumped on the midtown route to get our bearings.When we got back to the hotel at around 6pm, Rick's cafe was buzzing with free wine and cheese and a live pianist - a great way to end a day of sightseeing. We went up and had a nap and the bed was so comfy we didn't wake up until midnight! So headed down and asked the concierge where we could go for dinner. He had a couple of great reccommendations which we took him up on (9th ave - heaps of restaraunts)Breakfast the next morning in Rick's cafe was great - coffee  tea, juices, iced tea, water, cereal, croissants, bagels, yogurt, cheese, fruit salad.....Also in Rick's is a computer for guest use with high speed internet and a printer.The rest of our stay was outstanding and to sum up Casablanca I have to say that the service is exceptional, the location is perfect and the rooms are cosy and comfortable.Check out was efficient and they even flagged a cab for us that charged us a flat rate to the airport (instead of putting us on the meter).Location: right in Times SquareInclusions: breakfast, free internet  printing, wine  cheese, free DVD hire, excellent service, real (espresso) coffee and tea  cookies 24\/7.Room: small but cosy and comfy. Good temperature, nice shower (with bath), big mirror, hair dryer, good medium sized TV, DVD player, small table and chairs.
