{"text":"Charming, quaint, but maintanance issues that shouldn't be for $'s Paid Pros. Generally a charming place with teddy bears on beds and sleeper sofa. Our room was more spacious than 4-star hotel where we stayed prior 3 nights in San Francisco. Beds were comfortable, nice little wet bar area, lots of hot water,  decent hot breakfast. Accommodating staff. Very clean. The fireplace was a very nice touch. Small grocery across street  a small sandwich shop that probably closed around 9 p.m.Downstair sitting  dining areas are very pleasant  lots of old world charm. Cons. The fifth floor room appeared to need some TLC. The faucet in the wet bar leaked  could not get it to turn off. My husband had to shut off the water, water dripped from cold water faucet in bathroom, repeatedly asked for extra towels that never arrived for we had 3 persons in room,  19 inch color tv (cable hookup with lots of channels) with sound that was very low  barely could be heard with street noises. There probably are governors on the sound so occupants cannot turn on tv too loudly. This is not a problem unless you want to really listen to tv intensely, but who would --this is San Francisco!!!The elevator left much to be desired. It had its own charm, but if a person left the gate open, then the elevator would not operate. This was tough trying to haul baggage to main floor when leaving hotel. There is no way to let front desk know about this problem unless you go back to your room or someone ventures down the stairs. We lost 10 minutes just trying to get from fifth floor to main floor when leaving for our flight.Breakfast does not start until 7 a.m., which is ok while not on business or needing to get an early flight out. Our son was in dining room at 7 a.m. when departing, but no food was even ready -- we had no breakfast before leaving for our flight.You have to go to first floor to get ice, but this is not a deal breaker.My husband did not really feel comfortable venturing out after 9 p.m. on street so got food from small grocery across street. During day, great location  felt safe-- easy 15 minute walk to Union Square  major shopping.
