{"text":"Terrible customer service Upon arrival at the Iberostar Dominicana, there was no record of our reservation for which I had a confirmation letter and number in hand from Funjet Vacations. The local Funjet representative was contacted by telephone, who maintained that we had a reservation, but the Iberostar denounced it, nor had any rooms available at any of its three complexes that night. We waited for hours while the Iberostar reception searched for another hotel to put us up in for the night. Finally, we got a room at a hotel ranked 2.0 by Funjet versus 4.0 for the Iberostar Dominicana. We checked into the downgraded hotel at 12 am, missing dinner and entertainment.Meanwhile, we incurred $40 in taxi and inconvenience fees shuttling in between hotels. We also had to put $200 on our credit card for the new hotel room. This money was refunded to us in cash the next day when the Iberostar Dominicana miraculously found our reservation and sent a van to pick us up at 12 noon. Nonetheless, we had already paid $270 for the Iberostar room, plus incurred $40 in extra charges due to the one night displacement. We lost a total of $110 due to the Iberostar Dominicana's mistake. In addition, we lost eight hours of time enjoying our vacation. The Iberostar upgraded our room for the next two nights and called it even. However, we immediately stated that we did not want the upgrade, rather, compensation for one night's stay. The reception desk indicated that the upgraded room was the only one available, so we would be staying there regardless of any credit. We were then referred to the general manager, who said that the hotel would not refund any of our money. The lack of customer service we experienced at the Iberostar Dominicana negated the high quality of the resort. There are several other five-star resorts in the area where vacationers will likely be treated better and guaranteed to have a room upon arrival. ","annotations":[]}
