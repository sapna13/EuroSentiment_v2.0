{"text":"Cant complain My boyfriend and I stayed at the resort the 1st week of June. Overall we had a great time. We only had a few issues with our stay but for the most part we couldnt complain. First, the rooms. It seems that every building was built totally different. We were in building 9 which was new. The only problem i had with it were ants. The resort itself was gorgeous. Everything was really clean and the workers were always busy making it look even better. The beach was really clean and we never had trouble finding chairs, same with the pool. The drinks were really strong which was great for us and we really enjoyed the pool bar. Food, well the food was okay. We quickly learned how to eat at the windows buffet b\/c most of the food was ICE cold! We learned to go to the made-to-order stations b\/c we knew it would be hot. The variety of food was pretty good. We absolutely loved the italian restaurant, da mario, we went there twice. The only other rest. we went to was aqua and we wern't impressed. It was very difficult getting reservations to the restaurants so make sure you go and do that as soon as you arrive. The entertainment was ok. The night life was sort of lacking. The day time activities were always fun, such as aerobics, dancing, or volleyball. By far, the worst part of the trip was the PUSHY sales!!!!!! I understand its like this at all the resorts but we were CONSTANTLY hounded about buying excursions, time shares, and stupid lobster dinners. The resort doesnt seem to care about this taking place... it was even worse on the beach. We booked through apple which was great, i'd recommend booking your excursion through your travel agency, not guys off the beach! Things that are good to have, insulated mugs for drinks, bug spray ($20 there same as sunscreen). All in all we had a great time and would recommend this resort to someone whos looking for a cheaper trip.... NOT for a honeymoon in my opinion. ","annotations":[]}
