{"text":"Our Favorite Place in the Big Expensive City! We live about two hours outside New York and every once in a while an early business meeting will inspire us to stay overnight. We've tried some other places (like the W Lexington Avenue) but have really come to consider the Westin our home hotel.Whether NY small (like London small!) or splurge-worthy corners (our last room, fabulous) the rooms are well appointed, sleek and contemporary without being...over the top...and cozy. The bedding is superb. Our last trip -- last week -- my husband booked a corner room on a high floor (it was about $475, a bit of a splurge) but we loved it! The room had a foyer, and then wrap around windows; the main part of the room was outfitted with flat screen, desk, benches, nice bathroom....One caveat: we've eaten at the hotel's restaurant -- Don Shula's -- a few times. It's a typical steakhouse (where your sides are separate) and the food is excellent but the prices are a bit breathtaking, particularly for wine. We couldn't find a bottle under $44 (and that one was out of stock) -- and few were under $70. I realize it's NY and it's an expense account restaurant but still....Service was also totally chaotic (and it wasn't even busy yet) though we did appreciate the gesture, by the maitre'd (she was a woman, not sure what you call her); she'd overheard us say we were celebrating our anniversary and arranged for us to be surprised with a lovely chocolate dessert. What a nice touch! Made up for the early roughness of service.The bar at the Westin is fun -- quite a scene -- and you can order snack food there. We might try that next time. And of course, a whole range of restaurants are nearby. The lobby has free wireless (it's kinda' pricey in the rooms).We asked for a late checkout and the hotel was quite accommodating. All in all -- excellent experience.
