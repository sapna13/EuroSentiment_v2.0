{"text":"Fabulous Hotel We stayed at the Hotel El Convento for 7 days in September. I loved everything about the hotel. We were treated wonderfully by the staff. Soledad specifically went above and beyond to help us with tour bookings and other things before we even arrived. While the pool area is small as some have said, it is a beautiful oasis in the midst of Old San Juan. We enjoyed sitting in the hot tub in the evening, very peaceful. One of the things we enjoyed the most was that most everything is within walking distance of the hotel. We even walked to the cruise ship docks and took the free ferry across to where the Bacardi factory is located. We much preferred the local Don Q rum though. The staff is really great. We never had a problem with our room being cleaned. Each day when we were out our beds were made, fresh towels and toiletries were left and the drapes were opened to let in the sun. At night, again while we were out, the beds were turned down, chocolates left on the pillows and soft music tuned in on the Bose radio. Very nice service and never intrusive . If you do stay at the hotel be sure to stop by the manager√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ reception held nightly from 6-7pm. A nice variety of wines and cheeses are provided and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a good opportunity to meet some of the other guests. There is library on the third floor where besides a small selection of books and newspapers you will also find a public internet terminal. This comes in handy for checking email (if you must!) and printing out boarding passes and checking flight status. Overall we would highly recommend this hotel. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a beautiful boutique hotel in a unique location.
