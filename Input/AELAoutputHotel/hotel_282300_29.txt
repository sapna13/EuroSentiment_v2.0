{"text":"Good hotel in No-Mans Land. Very much a business hotel, rather than a romantic getaway! Quite a few groups, as well as individual travellers.The restaurant where we had dinner on the first evening was better than most hotel restaurants and not too expensive. By Spanish standards it shuts early (10.30pm)! Both the room and the reception areas screamed 'bland standard upmarket business hotel'; but there WAS wi-fi and this was free even in the room (if slightly erratic). Large comfortable bed, armchairs and table, TV, mini-bar, safe: the usual. Bathroom (shower, loo, bidet) was fine and the washbasin area separate, which was good for couples, but the trendy glass washbasin surround let surplus water drip onto the floor. Staff service a little erratic; I had to ask for a free shower cap and even toilet paper. One towelling bathrobe and one pair slippers: maybe they thought we could share? Staff not over-keen on dispensing tourist advice, but then the Tourist Information Office is only 3 metro stops away. The view from our room on the 6th floor was the textile factory mentioned by another TA traveller and a pile of rubbish dumped next to it. The area - residential - was not attractive but seemed boring rather than dangerous. It was 3-5 mins walk to Bogatell metro station, a little further to Marina. I'd give the Marina Barcelona a gold star however for its breakfast buffet which takes up 3 sides of the room: cooked breakfasts; home-made jams and cakes; croissants, Danish pastries and churros; rolls and bread; yogurts, cheeses and cold meats; cereals; fresh and cooked fruit; juices; lots of other things I can't remember.... and staff brought us jugs of coffee (which however we always sent back to be replaced by the hot version).
