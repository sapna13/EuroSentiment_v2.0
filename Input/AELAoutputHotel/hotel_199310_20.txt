{"text":"GREAT hotel I got there expecting the worst because it was close to the train station but I was quite surprised at what I found.The hotel is very close to the train station, is rated 4 stars, has free internet in the lobby, a free breakfast along with a service that lets you get a 'take-out' breakfast if you're in a hurry, and a free drink at the bar for each of the guests. The bartender was also VERY nice. I asked for a drink that wasn't on the free drink voucher (a Radler - half beer, half Sprite) and he gladly made it up. You are even given a mini-bar and the items in there are free. There's some water, a beer, a soda, and some apple juice. The room was very clean and had a double door (yes, that means 2 doors) so you feel even more safe if you're a single female traveling.To add to this, the room was HUGE which is quite strange for Europe. Even the bathroom was about twice the size of the bathrooms we had at other European hotels. There's also plenty of storage space in case you need to spread out and there's a little table with 2 chairs in the room for you to set up your dinner and eat there. For dinner, there are quite a few places to grab some food. There is an Indian restaurant that is next to the hotel that smelled AMAZING and a Doner kabab, pizza, and pasta restaurant next to the Indian place. However, we grabbed food at the train station before going to our hotel and there are tons of choices there - from sushi and chinese, to brats and potatoes. The hotel says they have room service but I didn't see a menu but we already had food.Anyway, my husband and I will gladly stay here again if we need a hotel in Frankfurt.
