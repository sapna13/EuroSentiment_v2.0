{"text":"Great Little Hotel We stay at the IFA Ocean Village the 3rd week of March, I must admit we have a fanastic time. It is not 5star, but good value with nice amentities. The room was sparkling clean, had 20 foot vaulted ceilings, a beautiful view of the AMAZING ocean, a TV with lots of stations, Bathroom with all the neccesities, decent enough bed  pillows. After reading the reviews, we were worried about the room...I even brought scented candles and our own pillows....but we never had a thing to worry about. Room was perfect.The pools were great, warm and clean. Never had a problem getting a chair by the pools. The beach was AWESOME. We coudn't say enough good things about it. Very clean. Had to be there before 10am to get a good chair, but the couple of mornings we slept in, we were stil able to find a decent spot. The grounds were beautiful, we loved waking around and trying new pools and new bars.Food was good. I don't plan on trying every single thing every day, so by eating like a normal person, I never got sick of the food. The pasta one night, soup  salad the next...that sort of thing...eating normal amounts. The soups, although a strange green colour were fabulous. We were able to try all the restaurants and found them all good. Not amazing, knock your socks off, but I was always full and happy. Best things were the pasta grill, omelet station, fresh veggies\/fruit, the meat of the day, ice cream. The a l'cartes were good. Great service and they felt like you were in a nice resturaunt. I really liked lunch: the beach buffet was awesome (crepes, chicken, fresh salad and fruit....). and the pool bar had some of the BEST pizza i have ever had. Drinks were soooo strong. I am talking almost all rum. I sometimes asked for a extra coke. They have great bar menus with lots of new drinks to try. Every bar tender was very different, so depending on who was serving you the drink recipe could change. I liked it. Kept it interesting.The entertainment staff was funny....they mostly hit on single girls and played the same song over and over. But I did do some beach aerboics and it was fun. Played bingo...didn't do the shows or the disco. We mostly just had drinks at night and fell asleep early to a movie on TBS.Service was always good, check-in\/check-out a breeze, no problems with reservations, everything went as it should. We tipped a little bit, tried to speak spanish, and followed the golden rule. It is so frustrating to hear people complain about the staff not speaking english, you are in THEIR country. Stop being so closed-minded, Things are different in a DIFFERENT country. Food will not be the same. Service will be different. Nothing was bad ever, sometimes things were different though. If you can't accept that you might as well go to a resort where it is completely north-americanized, not this small resort with alot of character and charm. I am not new at all-inclusives, I have been to many 3,4,5 star places. This placed is great for 3.5stars, it was more than i was expecting and I would go back for a simple, but nice, holiday.
