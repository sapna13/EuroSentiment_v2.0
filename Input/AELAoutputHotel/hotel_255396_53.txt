{"text":"Bad experience Have just finished a 7 night stay from 25\/09\/07 through to 02\/10\/07 which was not a particularly pleasant experience.Admittedly the hotel is undergoing renovation but this should not be an excuse for poor service and quality. We have stayed at this hotel in the past because of its excellent location. I have also recommeded to several friends who also used the facility.This time around we encountered the following problems:-Walls painted in the hotel with no signage indicating wet paint. My husband ruined a new shirt through this. Hotel tried to have shirt cleaned but it was ruined. After 4 days agreed to credit the value of the shirt. Offer was not made willingly - I had to complain a second time before it was done..Group of 10 went to restaurant for a snack meal. As we were entering the restaurant we were told by guests that their meal had been terrible. They had eaten from the main menu. As we only wanted snack meals eg burgers  chips etc decided to carry on as surely this couldn't cause problems. 2 different bottles of wine ordered along with beers. After around 15 minutes told that neither wine was avaliable due to renovations and also beer chosen not avaliabe. Reordered 2 more wines and beers to again be told not avaliabe due to renovations. The result was after 30 minutes 3 out of 10 had drinks. When the food arrived this was another disaster. Remember we had only ordered snack meals. Some meals only just warm and others cold. Some meals sent back to kitchen to come out again cold. At this stage we decided to leave - some of the meals sent back to kitchen for 2nd time. After complaining to restaurant mangager we were given a credit for the 3 drinks we had ordered - 2 beers and one soft drink. Paid only for the food eaten.On checkout I was told I had a phone call to NZ for 1hr 11mins and 22 seconds total charge $152. I had called home that morning for around 5 mins to confirm arrival time. Agreed with hotel an amount I would pay. I had experienced problems with the phone getting a dial tone and maybe there was something faulty. I was made to feel that they were doing me a favour by not charging me for the whole 1hour plus.Have put my complaints in writing and I am waiting to see if I get a response before deciding whether to use this facility again.Will keep this updated.
