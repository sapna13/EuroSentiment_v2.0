{"text":"Beware I chose to end my South East Asian holiday in what i thought would be a 5 start hotel in Singapore(2930 Sept 07) I booked through Asia Rooms whose bookings nowdays seem to be on an unrefundable basis, which leaves little leeway if your hotel turns out to be a loser.On checking in i was placed in a room on the 10th floor........it was a dump! The entire room was old and tired with much of the furniture having stains on it.........not what one would expect from a 5 star hotel. I asked to be shifted as i did not want a room with an interconnecting door..................I was moved 5 rooms down and the decor was no better!!!!! and whilst it was a non-smoking room, i discovered a full ashtray out on the balcony that looked liked it have been there for several days!......Shows how well these rooms were being cleaned. The fact was both rooms felt old dirty and tired! I had had enough and at this point in a normal stay I would have checked out and gone accross the street to the Oriental but because I had used Asia Rooms i would lose my money.......so i upgraded for a further $50.00 a night ........The end result was basically the same room tarted up with a cheap renovation!To top things off i caught a bad ear infection from their poolMy advice if you are thinking of staying at this Hotel? don't ......It just doesnt have any class its a 2 star hotel with the outward trappings of a 5 star........It looks tempting but if you want a real 5 start hotel go for one of the major brands at least you will get value.
