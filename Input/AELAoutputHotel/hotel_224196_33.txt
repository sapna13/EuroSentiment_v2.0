{"text":"Remarkable... Will return again and again! I go to Aguadilla Puerto Rico for business and could not believe when my company suggested I stay at Villa Montana Beach Resort. Normally when I travel I have to stay in boring old chain hotels. But a resort? Lucky me and especially since Villa Montana is such a special place. There is really no other place to stay in Aguadilla that is decent and imagine my excitement when I pulled into this beautifully manicured place right on the ocean. In fact, Villa Montana has its own stretch of private beach surrounded on one side by forest and then cliffs. Even though they have a nice health club, you bet I go running on that beach every morning when I am there.They don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have Internet access in the guest rooms, they have wireless at the beachfront restaurant called Eclipse and trust me, there is no greater place to do work than this location. I honestly can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ wait for my trips to Aguadilla because I get to stay there. And of course my family is jealous and we do plan to have them meet me there soon and turn it into a family vacation. I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ imagine one better.The staff is quite nice, the food is fabulous at the two restaurants, Eclipse and Restaurant O. The grounds are beautifully manicured and the guest rooms and villas (I have stayed in both) are really comfortable and charming.Whether you are on business or pleasure, I highly recommend Villa Montana Beach Resort in Aguadilla Puerto Rico.
