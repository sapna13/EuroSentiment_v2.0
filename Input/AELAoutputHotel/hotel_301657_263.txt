{"text":"Small but good Stayed here twice on my trip. The first few days I wasn't the happiest with the room as side of the bed was against the wall and the room was tiny. I really didn't see what the fuss was about that I'd read here on Trip Advisor. I then went to Kyoto for a few days and decided that when I returned to Tokyo I'd stay at the hotel again as they offered to keep my luggage so I would only have to bring a small bag to Kyoto with me. When I returned the room they gave me stank of fish (really strong) so when the bellman came to deliver the bags I asked him to step into the room and see if he got the smell. He immedately rang downstairs and came up with another room key. This room was gorgoeus and I'm gutted I didn't ask for a room like this the first time. There was more space and the bed was in the centre of the room and the view of the Tokyo tower was amazing. I have to say that staying in that room completely changed my opininon of the hotel. My advice....if you're booking a normal room then ask for the room I was in which was 3306. If they put you in a smaller room then ask to be changed. It's worth it.Of course I'll also say what everyone else is saying....it was great location because of the subway and trains underneath. Bit of a walk though to get to any of the lines so bring your walking shoes! ","annotations":[]}
