{"text":"Nice time overall My husband and I were on a mini-vacation and did a lot of relaxing...almost too much. The hotel was very clean, beautifully decorated, friendly staff, but no after hour activities. We normally enjoy dancing and staying out late, something we don't do at home with the kids. There were no places to do this. I am not sure if this is because of the off season or if this is normal. We found the resort to be very expensive. We were well over our budget when we left. We did have the couple's massage and enjoyed that very much. They are very nice and professional in Mandara spa. We enjoyed Shimas, the asian restaurant and The Grill Room was okay over at the Country Club. The best meal I had was the spaghetti with meat sauce at Palio...amazing. I didn't know spaghetti could be so good. The breakfast buffet was $25 per person, a sandwich at the pool was $10, and the drinks were around $12 each. The fitness center was nice, and the grounds were beautiful. The pools were lovely but too quiet. They need to break out the music! Of course, some folks want it quiet so it all depends on your definition of vacation. The resort was a 40 minute ride to Old San Juan. This was our second trip to Puerto Rico so we weren't going to take the tour, but after a few days we had to just to find something to do. If you want quiet and relaxing, this is your place! If you want some entertainment, you might check out someplace else.
