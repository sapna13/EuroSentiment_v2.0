{"text":"Greg's the best!!!!!!!!!! I would thoroughly recommend this hotel!!!Sure, it's not a big hotel, it hasn't got the thrills of one of the major ones but that's not what we were after. We didn't want to hear sirens all through the night like we did when we stayed at the ramadaplaza new yorker the last time we stayed in manhattan.The 414 is a lovely little hotel with very friendly and always helpful staff particularly GREG. GREG advised us of the best places to eat (as he's a native new yorker), exciting places to go and we found ourselves talking for ages about everything. Greg has left a lasting impression on us and although we have only been back home 2 days we miss him and our conversations already.We stayed in room 102 and it was very clean and everything worked. The maid service was fantastic and the room was cleaned to a high standard everyday.The location of the hotel was fantastic only being a couple of blocksfrom time square.There was no safe in the room but we were able to store our private documents etc in the hotel safe which was signed in and out each timewe needed them.This is one of the very few hotels that offer a breakfast of any sorts. Alright, it's not a big breakfast being continental but it's enough to get you started for the day and there is always coffee and teas available in the little kitchenette area.We have been to new york now 4 times and have stayed in 4 different hotels and have found the 414 to be the best so far. Infact, we lovedit here so much that we will shortly be booking up for this time nextyear but for 10 days instead of 7.Thanks 414 for making this holiday the best we have had yet!P.S YOU ROCK GREG!!!!Mark and NaomiKent, United Kingdom ","annotations":[{"endOffset":494,"mention":"new yorker","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/New_Yorker_Hotel"],"startOffset":484},{"endOffset":1294,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1288},{"endOffset":1303,"mention":"teas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1299},{"endOffset":1294,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1288},{"endOffset":1303,"mention":"teas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1299}]}
