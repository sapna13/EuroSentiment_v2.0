{"text":"A wonderful experience We only stayed for 2 nights (during the week before Easter), but we were treated with friendliness and courtesy from the time we first contacted the hotel to the time that we checked out. The kind and caring staff are definitely one of the hotel's main attractions. It was our first visit to Italy and so we opted for the 'walking tour' of Florence. Paola gave us an amazing tour, not just of the sights, but of the political and art history and how they shaped Florence. (Her English is excellent.) It was a lot to digest, but we found ourselves understanding the city much more throughly. And wishing that we had been able to stay longer. She also arranged for us to have a reserved time at the Uffizi Gallery, which saved us a lot of time in a line-up.The hotel is a very easy walk from the train station, and close to restaurants, markets, galleries, laundromats, and all of the sights. It is a funky hotel, with interesting hallways and alcoves and it is decorated with a colourful decor. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very adequate and the room was a nice size. It was nice and clean, especially the bathroom. The bed was comfy enough and while the walls were a little thin, we only had one neighbour close by and we always fell asleep the minute our heads hit the pillow anyway. I liked how our room overlooked the homes of people who lived in Florence. It felt very natural. We have already recommended the Hotel Kursaal to a friend and will definitely stay there whenever we can get back to Italy again!
