{"text":"An amazing resort! We recently honeymooned at the Excellence Punta Cana! The resort is amazing! We payed the extra for the Excellence Club and it was well worth it! With the Club you get personal concierge service, any drinks you would like and food and snacks available all day! We stayed in an Ocean View Junior suite and we had the view of the pool and the ocean from the 3rd floor! It was beautiful! The Breakfast buffet was very good and they always had a wide selection of food. The lunch buffet was excellent! Many different foods each day and we never got bored with the food! For dinner there were 7 different restaurants! The french restaurant Chez Isabelle was the best and we ate there the most and the service was wonderful! We liked all the restaurants except for Spice, but that's a person preferrence. The pools were very clean and nice and there's a nice swim-up bar and other bars in other areas. The ocean was a bit rough, but we had fun with the waves! This resort is very secluded and far away from the next resort which is very nice! It feels open and more natural and not like another resort is on top of you! It's worth the hour long drive from the airport!The night entertainment is fairly good, some of the shows were a bit boring, but the rest were ok. Overall this resort is amazing! The service was great and we felt very pampered! We always had plenty to do and never got bored the 10 days we were there!
