{"text":"True hospitality - delightful gracious hosts There is a very good reason why this otherwise modest 2 star hotel in the heart of historic Florence rates so highly in these reviews.In these days of surly or indifferent service, the family which runs the Hotel Casci truly and genuinely care about each of their guests as if they too were members of an extended family.Nothing was ever too much trouble, and I was actually embarrassed on occasion at the extent they were prepared to go in order to accommodate me.Of course one might well expect nothing less, as service is what a hotel is supposed to provide. But I have stayed in hundreds of properties worldwide and know that really gracious and caring service is something of a lost art.Casci (pronounced KAH-shee) has the feel of a large BB as opposed to a regular hotel. The lobby is accessed from a lift (or stairs) with little at street level to alert you to the fact that the 2nd floor of the building is occupied by a hotel.They provide magazines and newspapers, a huge collection of resource books on Italy, Tuscany and Florence, free internet from a terminal in the lobby, and unlimited free (and very fast and reliable) wifi access throughout the hotel if you bring your own computer.Rooms are comfortable and quiet. Consistent with the 2 star rating and price point of the hotel, but certainly clean, well appointed and comfortable.Breakfast is served from 7:30 to 9:30, but there were times when I was up much later, and although I would not want to suggest that you expect it, the owners and staff were always happy to furnish cappuccino, pastries and juice long after the nominal breakfast hour. This was where I felt that I was being pampered - they could by all rights have politely said that breakfast was off at 9:30 and I would have completely understood.The location is very handy to all of the most notable attractions in Florence. The taxi ride from the airport is 20 Euros plus one Euro per piece of luggage. No tipping.There are dozens of excellent little restaurants within a short stroll, and the all day market with hundreds of vendors selling all manner of leather goods, accessories and souvenirs is just around the corner.I would be happy to recommend Casci to anyone who did not make 5 star luxury their one and only criterion in choosing a hotel. For those of us who instead value a friendly, welcoming environment and excellent value, I cannot think of a better recommendation.
