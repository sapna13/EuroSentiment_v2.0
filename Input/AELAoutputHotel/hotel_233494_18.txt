{"text":"A gem in the Oltrarno, Florence-with a view!!!! My husband and I and my two daughters stayed here for a night and we loved it. We found it very easily by car and used the hotel's garage for parking(although there was a charge).The location is great, just a block away from the Ponte Vecchio on the Oltrarno (opposite side of the river from the Duomo for those who haven't visited Florence before -10 mins walk). This means the hotel is quiet at night.The hotel itself is exquisite and spotlessly clean. The public areas were covered in frescos, tromp d'oeil and furnished with antiques.The breakfast was plentiful and offered both cooked and continental buffet. The hotel has only suites which makes it perfect for families and couples alike. Our suite was huge with bathroom (lovely bathrobes and slippers,Bulgari toiletries) two bedrooms, lounge with Sat TV and dining room\/kitchen. But it was the little extras like handmade soaps to choose from (free), and fine chocolates (chargeable) and fruit in the public areas which made the difference from other hotels we had stayed in.All the staff were simply charming and very attentive. They made the whole experience complete.My daughter's 4  6 years were totally transfixed with the vintage lift (pink panther \/thoroughly modern millie style) which had seats inside.The hotel's clowning glory is it's roof terrace. After 6pm you can order a drink from the rooftop bar and watch the sun setting on Florence which offers a fine view of the Duomo and all the the major sites. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it and will definitely stay there again.
