{"text":"Magnifique My fianc√ã√\u2022√ñe and I stayed 3 nights at the Royal Magda Etoile this past weekend, and it was one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had - possible *the* best.Upon arrival into the beautifully appointed lobby area, we were greeted by a charming and friendly receptionist. This theme continued throughout our stay, and the male receptionist who was on late at night was especially helpful - he helped us find a restaurant and then checked us in for our flight home on his computer. What service!Our room was small and cosy, but we were not in Paris to sit around in a hotel anyway, so it was ideal. The decor was modern, the room clean and the bed comfortable. The bathroom was a decent size, and was also very clean. The shower was worth particulate mention, as it was very powerful and the water was very hot.Breakfast was expensive at √à√\u2020√ü?2 for a simple buffet, so we didn't sample that - there are plenty of cafes and other places to get a bite nearby. The location in general is excellent, being just a short walk from the Charles de Gaulle-Etoile Metro  RER station, which is under the Arc de Triomphe. The hotel is down a quiet side street off Ave de Wagram, so there is little road noise and what little noise there is outside is kept out by the double-glazed windows.One local tip we would give is to try the bistro Le Hide (www.lehide.fr) just around the corner on Rue du General Lanrezac. We had 2 courses each and 50cl of vin blanc for √à√\u2020√ü?6, and it was one of the best meals we've had. Like the hotel, the bistro is something of a hidden gem.In summary, we would not hesitate to recommend this charming little hotel to anyone who is looking for a good base for a break in Paris. We are very happy customers! ","annotations":[]}
