{"text":"Wrap you SF trip around a good hotel We went for our 7th wedding anniversary. I booked hotel and flight and that was the end of planning this time around. Who knew the hotel would be highlight of the trip. Its posh with 5 star services including free limo ride from hotel to center of SF during normal business hours. We decided not to rent car and relied on cabs and limos only. So the limo (usually wait time 10 min) was very handy with knowledgeable driver. The concierge service was also top of the notch and give us great tips on most interesting attractions (not just traditional Fisherman Warf) and were helpful with tickets. Hotel offers a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬©resident club√à√\u2020\u2022?(I think it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the name) where for $30 per person per day you can use their club with laptops w\/internet, tv, games, fireplaces. They serve delicious self-serve breakfast (lox, delicatessen cold cuts, fresh pastry, cereal) , afternoon tea and evening cockatiels. There are also light snacks and variety of non-alcoholic drinks (bottled and not) thought the day. It also features special concierge (no waiting line and better service) and variety of newspapers. Everything is included in the price. If you like a nice breakfast in the morning and then run out the door we found club to be great feature.Rooms are very nice but what deserves special note is best mattresses we seen in hotels and soft and luxury bedding. Hotel is located on top of the hill and view is magnificent from any high-floor room. There is a famous √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√òop of the mark√à√\u2020\u2022?restaurant on the top floor. Location wise I think it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the best all neighborhood you want to see is in a walking distance (ladies no hills as SH hills are too steep).
