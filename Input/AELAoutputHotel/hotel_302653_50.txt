{"text":"Just fabulous The Melia Bali must be one of the most beautiful hotels in the world. I would give it 6 stars if I could. Every vista is a wow!. The gardens are amazing and the setting is divine. The hotel is all marble and hardwood and the quality is excellent. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We were there in early September and the climate was perfect; it was hot but not too humid which was a surprise to us as we had expected it to be like Singapore. The hotel is so wonderful that it is hard to drag yourself away for the occasional excursion, but it is worth it to see the lovely countryside up in the hills. We saw terraced paddy fields and also saw coffee beans, pineapples, vanilla pods, pepper corns, cocoa beans, ginger and ginseng growing on our trips out.The Nusa Dua complex comprises about a dozen 5 star hotels and a restaurant and retail complex called Bali Connection. There is a free shuttle bus from the hotels to Bali Connection, where there are about 20 restaurants, most with some sort of live entertainment. The quality of the food is as good as the hotels so you can eat without worrying about getting ill. There are also a number of other restaurants within easy walking distance of the Nusa Dua site, which are quite safe to eat in. Be prepared for the immigration officer at Bali airport to demand a tip before he stamps your passport. This is on top of the entry fee of $25 each and exit fee of 100k Rupea each. Don't arrive with just large notes in your wallet otherwise you will have to hand over one of those. Not everyone suffered this injustice but it initially soured my impression of the country. However, the Melia Bali will ease your troubled mind into a calm and relaxed state in no time at all.
