{"text":"Great Holiday After reading all the negative reviews and having stayed at a 5 star hotel in Mexico previously, I wanted to add a quick review of our stay.My family and friends just returned from a 7 day stay at this hotel. My nephew was married at the resort during our stay. Our party had a fantastic time. We would recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to have lots of fun around the pool and can't afford a high end hotel.We did not take the VIP upgrade on this trip as it has not been worth the extra money at other resorts we have stayed at. But you definitely should take it at this resort if you can afford it. Some of our family members did have it and I counted at least 15 improvements that we did not have.Generally the VIP rooms have newer furniture, whiter towels, better stocked refrigerators and other various things. VIP also includes rum, cigars, two 20 min. massages, free water sports, and the list continues. All VIP rooms are in one building.Our building, across the pool, was all non-VIP rooms. The furniture was a little shabbier, the towels grayer, only water and pop in the frig. And to be frank, our room was musty smelling. But the rooms of other family members in our group, were fine. It didn't matter as we were there to be by the pool and the beach and didn't spend much time in our room.The main floor hallway at the end of our building had a very bad sewage smell but was easily avoided by using one of the other hallways. The buffet food was good, although definitely not 5 star quality. More like 3 1\/2 star . But you could always count on fruits, breads, cooked veggies, eggs, pasta.The restaurant food was above average to excellent.Service at all food venues was absolutely wonderful. A tip goes a long way. Try to sit in the same area of the buffet each time you visit and you will soon be recognized and with a healthy tip on your first visit, will be given extra special treatment each time you eat. Keep in mind that these servers work all day and evening for 12 days with 4 days off. And they always have a smile.The beach was out of this world. And the main pool had a great acitivity staff with lots of action. The smaller pools were quieter for those that prefer that.A good resort for a good price.
