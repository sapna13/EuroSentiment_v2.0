{"text":"Wonderful place to stay We stayed at the Komaneka for 5 days in July 2007. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. Our deluxe room was stylishly furnished in a traditional Balinese way, with many thoughtful touches, eg fresh fruit and homemade biscuits. We enjoyed reading the books about Bali and its crafts that were in our room. The staff always had a welcoming smile and many would greet us by name; nothing was too much trouble. We particularly enjoyed the lesson in making coconut leaf offerings; good fun and well worth a try. On separate afternoons the hotel offer lessons in wood carving and balinese dress and dance - although we didn't have time to go to these ourselves. We decided on our last evening to have one of their special dinners. It was so romantic - a table was set by the pool which had candles and flowers all around the waters edge and floating in the middle. There were lanterns hanging from the trees and ceremonial umbrellas over the table. The food was served on banana leaves cut in pretty designs and the waitress was dressed in the traditional costume. The service was attentive but discreet. It made a very memorable last night at the Komaneka.The hotel is ideally located for exploring the town - the monkey forest one way (about 10 mins walk - but there were so many shops to look at on the way down!) and temples and palaces the other way (plus lots more shops!). It is worth seeing at least one of the evening dances at either the Royal Palace or the Water Palace - the surroundings add to the atmosphere.There are plenty of restaurants nearby, however we regret not making more use of the hotel restaurant.In summary we would say that this is a superb hotel in an ideal location which enhanced our stay in Ubud.One word of warning when you step out of the hotel - don't expect the delightful service to continue - be very careful which taxi driver you choose. Across the road from the hotel we made the mistake of selecting Wayan Dupa (at least that was the name on his card) to drive us for the day, but he was only interested in taking us to places that might earn him commission. His mood got less friendly when we refused to buy at the outlets he selected. We also asked him to take us to the Elephant Safari Park at Desa Taro, North of Ubud, however he actually took us to Bakas Elephant Tour near Klungkung. This park was inferior and very expensive - a 40 min ride on the elephant was US$66 per person. Don't let this put you off hiring a driver as there are many excellent ones about - just take care.
