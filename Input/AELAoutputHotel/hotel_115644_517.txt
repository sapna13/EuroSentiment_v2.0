{"text":"The absolute best for location and value Our party stayed here from November 10th to the 15th and really enjoyed our time at the Chancellor and in San Francisco.We were a party of four and emailed the hotel a few weeks prior to our stay to request adjoining rooms. They made good on their promise and we had two sizeable rooms with good facilities on a high floor (1406\/1407).The rooms are basic and not all that up to date but for SF they are sizeable as I said, clean and fully functional. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom a good size and again clean.The hotel lobby has the appearance of a much more expensive hotel and the breakfast in the restaurant is great, although the free coffee and cookies in the lobby are also a nice touch.The few requests we had of the front desk were all dealt with professionally and promptly. Basically, we couldn't fault the place and now the best part...it's location.You are right on union square near all the shops, the cable car station (which takes you straight to fisherman's wharf), chinatown, bars and nightlife, and also the BART station which we took across to Oakland for the Raiders game.I have stayed in Fisherman's wharf and you somehow feel safer on union square as well as having more to do and see within walking distance of your hotel.The Chancellor is amazing value and a much better hotel than much higher priced establishments (eg Holiday Inn, Wharf).Next time in SF, we will stay here again, no question.
