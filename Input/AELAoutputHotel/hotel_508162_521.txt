{"text":"The Good, The Bad.... But No Ugly Here I was vacilating between 3 and 4 stars and decided on 4because it is PUNTA CANA. When traveling to the Dominican (4th time for me) you must realize it is a place where people try hard, the beaches are good, weather is perfect and food not the best. They are still a work in progress on the whole but their prices reflect that. So taking all that into consideration:Food: Better than other resorts. Breakfast buffet good. Not enough outside seating. Diners at the specialty restaurants are fair. Service always with a smile and ready to please. French best for romantic, got a good bottle of wine and appreciated how they tried. Lunch at the Seaside Grill always good. Never have a problem getting in anywhere as long as you dine before 7:00pm.Japanese, Chinese, French etc...I am from NY\/NJ food is hard to beat. You won't starve and will always find something edible but forget gourmet.Rooms: Compared to the newer resorts small. Other resorts have all Jr. Suites (like Melia Caribe) at Dreams you need to upgrade. I did to building 6 which was located perfectly for me. Yes the third floor is best we stayed on the 2nd 6201 and loved the quiet, lani, and spacious room. Comfy bed, clean and newer. Turndown service and maid service was excxellent of course we always gave the girls a few dollars a day. Drinks: Excellent. Served top brands and always plentyfull. The beach service for drinks is outstanding again a few dollars goes a long way.Beach: Yes there are rocks in front of resort. Go left by the Turtle Trampoline and you will have great water and no rocks. Sand is fine and nice spacious areas, you can walk forever (yes you see garbage because this part of the island is still being developed and not cared for). Chairs are uncomfortable and need to be upgraded and many replaced. Get there before 10:00am if you want chairs as many people are rude and leave towels, never coming back so you don't know if there taken or not. This is where all resorts in Punta Cana need to work on. The resort has beach security patrol, their job should be to remove towels from unused chairs and if no one returns in an hour or so remove those towels. The plapas need to be redone (elevated too close to the ground). So yes the accomodations on the beach need updating. Grounds; Are maintained nicely, kiddie areas look fun, pool is long and winding with plenty of bars, seating and towels. There are nicer though. Again upgrades need to be done with cushions on chairs...but towels are pletyfull and they give them to you graciously.All in all a nice relaxing time. Would consider going back for the right price, however there is too much competition so I would try others...We did take the helecopter back to the airport to avoid that long bumpy ride and that is the only way to travel (if you can afford it) a mini tour is included!
