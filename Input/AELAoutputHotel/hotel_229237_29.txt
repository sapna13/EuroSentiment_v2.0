{"text":"Great Location. Honest Review I stayed here with my wife for two days this week and cannot believe I stayed in the same hotel as some of the previous reviews suggest.The location is truly fantastic with all the sights and bars within a couple of minutes walk away.Forget what Americans have to say about room size. With their body mass index they need more room!. They're not huge suites, but you're only using this as a base after all. I too requested non smoking and asked at check in whether this was the case. I too had been given a smoking room, but they had no qualms about moving me to another. Yes, some rooms' windows do face others, but this is a city centre hotel, not a country retreat.The bar attached to the hotel is fantastic. The restaurant too is superb, though breakfast at 17 Euros each was a little steep. Still, makerel, salmon, pork sausages and all the things us Brits like were there (perhaps I should complain that there was no black pudding?)For anybody on a few nights stay in Amsterdam, this hotel is perfect. The staff are polite and helpful, the hotel is clean. Yes, the lobby was smoky, but Amsterdam by definition is a little more liberal in its smoking habits.My room was clean, modern (LCD TV, swipe card entry, safe etc) and extremely comfortable. I am happy to moan when things aren't good enough, but some of the earlier reviews really are inaccurate.Book it with confidence, just make sure on check in, if necessary, that it's no smoking you require.I would definitely stay here again.
