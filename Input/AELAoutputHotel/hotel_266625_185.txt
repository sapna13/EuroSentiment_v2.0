{"text":"Ugh, do your research and stay elsewhere My boyfriend and I went Nov 30-Dec 5th, and were definitely not crazy about this place.First:We were the ONLY americans there. Basically 90% of the people there were French, and everyone else European. It would have been nice to mingle, but the language barrier was tough. Come to find out via the hotel staff, that Americans don't usually stay there, but stay at other places like Secrets. (ok why wasnt that ever mentioned when researching?)Second:The food. Horrible! Ive stayed in all inclusives before and Ive never had such a poor compromise on the quality of food. It was bland\/generic, high in fat, and just boring. Restaurant reservations? Forget it! On our FIRST day there, we tried to reserve ANY restaurant for the following 4 days we were staying, and they were ALL booked. Come to find out, you have to reserve before you even get there.Third:The customer service, even worse than the food! The staff is very uncaring, unhelping and basically have a its not my problem attitude. They all had this smug expression on their faces like they were doing us a favor just by being there.Fourth:Activities are super hard to follow. There's no order as to whats happening, where and what time. You basically have to wander around and figure it out yourself.If you choose to stay here, keep your expectations at a bare minimum. The highlights of the trip had nothing to do with the hotel, as we booked two excursions: horse back riding on the beach, and a booze cruise where we swam with sharks and sting rays. Those were awesome experiences, but again, were not related to our stay at Sirenis. If you want to stay here to save a few bucks, do yourself a favor and pay extra, so you can at least enjoy where you're spending the majority of your time.The one thing i'll say is that they have a nice pool and the beach is great. But that's probably at most resorts in Punta Cana.
