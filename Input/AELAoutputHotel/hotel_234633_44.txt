{"text":"Outstanding Hotel for the Price I stayed here June 17-19 based on reviews I read here and for the price the experience was way above my expectations. From the airport I took the RER B line then switched to the RER C (at St MIchel Notre Dame) which has a Foche Ave stop. Its a five minute walk to the hotel from the exit (the exit is also right beside the Port Daphine metro station) and the hotel is in a beatiful neighbourhood. I arrived way too early for check in but I think they see this all the time as the staff told me I can leave my bags and go exploring. The staff are extra friendly and were more than happy to answer any questions. I must have asked them everything from directions, to restaurant recommendation to how to say phrases in french. I was travelling alone and the room was a bit small but it was perfect for me. It had all the amenities including a\/c, iron with board, mini bar, tv etc..plus my room (#22) had a french balcony overlooking the street which was a nice touch. Bathroom was modern and everything was very clean and crisp. TV had about 20 channels everything from sports to movies to sit coms - but of course you're in paris so I don't know how much TV watching you should be doing. They also have a laundry service but there are dry cleaners in the neighbourhood. There is also a butcher, grocery store, bakery all within 5 minute walking distance of the hotel. There is a computer in the lobby with internet which is free to use to check your email or surf the net.The hotel is near Foche and Ave de la Grande Armee both of which lead to the Arc de Triomph. The walk is about 10 minutes to the Arc and from there you can walk (or take the metro but really you should walk..) down Champ Elysees, maybe cut across Montaigne (as far as I can tell this is where all the high fashion stores are), across the Seine to the Eifell Tower and then along the Seine to anything else you want to see....The hotel has breakfast which I had one day. In most cafes you can get breakfast for about 5-6 euros maybe a little more and this will include a hot drink, a croissant, juice, half a baguette, butter and jam. The hotel breakfast is more expensive but you have a wider choice of jams, honey, nutella, cereal, different pastries and so on. I think if you're in a rush it might be worth it otherwie stop by any one of the 1,000,000 cafes :)I only got one name, Isabella, who was working the front desk the days I stayed there. I also met the owner who was in with her newly born baby. Just to give you an idea of the type of service - I was going to the opera in the evening and needed a shirt dry cleaned. The local dry cleaner couldn't turn it around by the time I needed it but the owner said she would take care of it. When I returned to my hotel room that evening there was my shirt, nicely dry cleaned waiting for me.
