{"text":"Agon Frankfurter Allee excellent value for money We have just returned from our 3rd trip to this hotel. The rooms were exceptionally clean, particularly the bathroom which was outstandingly clean. Rooms were cleaned thoroughly everyday and towels were changed daily. The self service breakfast was very good and ample although the breakfast room can get busy at weekends. The staff were always friendly and helpful. Just a couple of small negative points. There were no coffee\/tea facilities in the room and the rooms were a little sparse decorationwise (no pictures on the wall etc) and there weren't enough pillows. (Reception gladly supply extra linen if required). These were relatively minor points however.To reach the hotel from Schonefeld airport take the Shconefeld express train or the S9 train to Alexander Platz remembering to buy a ticket from the machine at the station and validating it.From Alexander Platz take the U5 to Samariterstr. (approx 10 mins)The hotel is situated approx 100 metres from Samariterstr. station . Small tip - when travelling from Alexander Platz to Samariterstr. sit at the front of the train and exit the station via the stairs in front of you, turn right at the top which brings you out on both the right side of the road and closer to the hotel. Turn right and walk down Kingzigstr. (Video shop on the corner), then turn left at the Corner shop into Scharnweberstr. The hotel is just a few metres on the left.The taxi fare from Schonefeld is approx √ä√£¬¢25For travelling around Berlin take the U bahn from Samaiterstr. to Alexander Platz. This is a major station and all destinations can be reached easily from here.There are endless places to eat around the hotel area, whatever your taste.When we return again to Berlin, which we will, we will definitely stay at this hotel. Excellent value for money. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":16,"mention":"Frankfurter","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hot_dog"],"startOffset":5}]}
