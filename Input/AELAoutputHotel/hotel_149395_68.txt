{"text":"LOVED, LOVED, LOVED IT!!! I was extremely worried about staying here from reading the previous reviews. I have never written a review but I feel obligated based on my experience. We checked in at a private check in and served cocktails. Room: Stayed at the Reserve in a junior suite. It is further from the beach but the trams run constantly and the concierge will call them to pick you up. We had a jacuzzi which was very sizable. Nice size living room. Anything that we needed for the minibar we just asked. The first night we stayed in a room facing the side. Asked for a pool view and the next day we were moved (Thanks Jennifer). Beach: Tourqoise blue and beautiful. The waves were rough but nothing dangerous. There was a little seaweed but what can you do. Plenty of bali beds and lounges. There are lots of activities included on the beach, volleyball, catamarans, etc. Many are included. We went parasailing and used ScubaCaribe which is right on the beach. We were in the air only about 10 minutes but it was a good experience. We also took the Sunset Cruise. They take you to a reef snorkeling, pretty nice. Then you go to a natural spring where the water is waist deep. They bring out rum into the ocean and you drink right there. I highly recommend that you take the cruise with Ishmel and Orlando. Ishmel is a live wire and gets the party started. You must do the horsebacking riding. Its included and they take you to a ranch where you ride to a beach. Don't wear your good shoes.Restaurants: The food could be better. We had breakfast at Gabi everyday. It was a pretty nice buffet, good omelets. Vento and Fuego were the best. We went to El Romantico for my birthday and they brought out a big cake which is excellent. I think you do have to pay for the cake (worth it). Staff: I cannot understand why anybody would have a problem with the staff. First of all, you are in a foreign country and you should have respect for the natives. I understand you are on vacation but being nice goes a long way. These people have nothing. If you can afford to stay here, then you can afford to tip $1. Stop being cheap!!!Entertainment: The Michael Jackson show was entertaining. Skip the casino. There is a club (Mangu) down the street that everyone goes to but we didn't. The lobby has a band at nights and everyone joins in, pretty fun. Great pool at the Reserve with a nice grill and swim up bar. Never a problem getting a tiki bed but this is the low season.I have been to several all inclusives throughout the Carribean and Mexico. This tops them all. Trust me if you get to know the staff you will not want to leave. Tell Osirus, Eli, Jean, Juan, Ronny Garcia,  Marcos hello. And you must have a drink called the green Reserve and plenty of mamajuana. If you need anything else feel free to contact me.
