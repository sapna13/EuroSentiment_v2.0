{"text":"fantastic time at the Laguna but just a bit too quiet in the evenings We booked a deluxe room and as a Starwood preferred member our room was √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬∂pgraded√à√\u2020\u2022?to the Starwood floor. This upgrade just seemed to comprise of chocolates on arrival and a bath full of petals, as the room size was no different. Our room was clean and had plenty of space (and the wardrobe was the first I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe ever had that had enough hangers!) √à√\u2020\u2022?Although the balcony was tiny. The landscaping is definitely the key to the Laguna√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ charm, the pools and gardening that wander through the whole complex are really delightful and there are at least three √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºnack bars√à√\u2020\u2022?dotted amongst them. Equally the staff were extremely warm, kind and always helpful - from the bar guys to the cleaning staff. We had particularly good service from the Concierge (Gusti), the driver (Putu) and the Musicians at the Sand Bar. There was a complimentary afternoon tea and also a shuttle to the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Øall√à√\u2020\u2022?nearby. The spa though was really exceptional, it might have cost more than others on offer outside the hotel but the treatments were top notch and the facilities superb. The staff were knowledgeable and each treatment was fantastic √à√\u2020\u2022?we had one every other day! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.The Laguna has a bit of a personality crisis √à√\u2020\u2022?its set with all the other big hotels (Westin, Melia etc) in Nusa Dua but is smaller and lacks buzz in the common spaces. This is great when you want to just chill out and laze by the pool or beach but it means that the restaurants are often deserted, apart from at breakfast where it can be a bun fight √à√\u2020\u2022?we opted for room service thereafter. There seemed to be lots of people passing through on √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢ours√à√\u2020\u2022?and only staying 2-3 days maybe that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ why the breakfast room was so busy. The places to eat within walking distance of the hotel are adequate but are also in hotels, unless you go to the mall √à√\u2020\u2022?where we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think the restaurants looked great. We asked the concierge about eating and thereafter we discovered some √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¨ife√à√\u2020\u2022?and wonderful food √à√\u2020\u2022?everyone should eat at Bumbu Bali if they are staying in Nusa Dua and also go to Jimbaran Bay to eat in a Warang.We had a fantastic time at the Laguna and loved the beach it was just a bit too quiet in the evenings and if we had just stayed in the hotel we wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have know how amazing Bali really is. We also stayed in Ubud which was very worthwhile and highly recommended.Top tips √à√\u2020\u2022?don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ spend all your time in Nusa Dua. If you want to really understand and see Bali, make sure you get out of Nusa Dua and try to stay in Ubud or somewhere away from the south of the Island.
