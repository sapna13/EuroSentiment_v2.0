{"text":"Great Vacation! I have written reviews on Punta Cana before, so I feel I have to do one on this property. One word, Perfect! I can give you a fair opinion on the overall property because we stayed in both the Reserve rooms and the regular Jr. Suites on the same trip. I have a 5 yr old and 7 year old and they both had a blast! There are tons of activities for both the kids and adults. We went back to Punta Cana because of the ease of getting there from the East Coast, and the properties. I am an Airline Pilot and we go to one of these all inclusive things each year for the kids spring break. This by far tops all the other AI's we have been to. The food was excellent! Not only the buffets, but the a la carte restaurants were awesome.What we really liked was the variety and the healthy choices you could make (or not!!) We ate at the steak house, Japanese, and the new Vento in the Reserve section of the hotel. The Jr. Suite room is where we stayed the first 3 nights. It was very nice, typical Caribbean room. It was a good size, clean, and the bathroom was fine. The air worked well and the TV had a lot of US channels. Our Nanny came down for 3 nights into our trip and we could not get rooms near each other on the property, so I elected to upgrade to the Reserve rooms (Reserve is the newest section of the property. It was opened Xmas '07) The rooms were spectacular! There were 2 flat screen TV's in it, a very good size Jacuzzi and well appointed bathroom. The upgrade was $50.00 a night and was well worth it! If I would have known earlier in our trip I would have done it! The property is HUGE! The kids club is up in the new section. We do not typically leave the kids in a kids club on family vacations, however they wanted to check it out and they loved it! It was fun for us, as we got to play tennis or workout when they were up there. The pools are great! The ones in the reserve section were quiet and it was easy to find a hut or chair. My wife is a dermatologist, so finding shade is a must! We love the beach, but we are the dumb looking ones all covered up!! We loved the fact that if we wanted to head down to the beach, it was a good 10 minute walk and we were getting lots of foot time,although they have golf carts that come by a lot and will take you any where you want to go...The people could not be nicer! I think like in anything else the nicer you are, the more out of the way folks will go for you..The property has a vacation club. The workers will ask you if you want to go to a 1 hour session and they will give you some kind of certificate for it. we declined and we were not asked again on our trip. I played golf on their course which is about 15 minutes away and was pleasantly surprised in the course. They don't charge you greens fees, just for the cart which I think was around $30.00 US. They bus you over there and pick you up. You have to make a reservation 24 hours in advance I wanted to play that afternoon and when I inquired at the PR desk and they told me to go get my clubs and I could get the bus in an hour. I also went over to Cap Cana to play and it was the nicest course I have played on worldwide. It was in perfect shape and the views are spectacular! Check it out on TV the week of March 31, The Champions Tour is there for the first time and I think they will love the course. It is about a 30 minute ride over there. Overall, a great experience, great family vacation, and we will be back!!
