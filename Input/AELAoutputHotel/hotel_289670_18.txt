{"text":"Luxurious,Wondeful Staff,Fab transport links,A Proper Supermarket-heaven! I booked this last minute and was not getting left with many choices,I was really starting to panic.This isn't even the sort of hotel I would normally look at as we go for small.traditional hotels.I found this through Expedia,and as I booked only 3 days before,I had been watching the price drop. We also booked it through a well-known uk cashback site and got an additional 7 and a half percent off!! I think it worked out about √ä√£¬¢72 per night in the end,then,reading other reviews we decided to upgrade to an executive room,and paid a little more.Had a poor experience initially with Expedia who wanted to charge me √ä√£¬¢15 because I had changed my booking to an executive room!!I politely pointed out that i would upgrade when I arrived in that case,at which point they wisely dropped the charge!!I say luxurious  in my title,obviously this is a 4 star hotel,so don't take that too literally,but there is a nice air of comfort to the room,for the money,I think the lovely light wood panels and matching wooden furniture units create this.If you get an executive room,you get tea and coffee making facilities,which you don't get with a Standard room,I think.I also think that you don't get a bath robe with a standard room,but it says in the hotel brochure that you can request one.Soundproofing was one of the best bits,as this is a very busy city,but apart fom the usual police sirens,nothing to complain about. Unlike some hotels,NO sound o f slamming doors or noisy guests-loved it!!There is an ice bucket in the room and an ice machine on each floor.BREAKFAST ON ROOM SERVICE-had this the first day and all I can say is,if you HAVE to,have the continental!! Even better go and get yourself some orange juice and ensaimadas from the supermarket and eat in your room (there is also a cafe at the supermarket). I have to make allowances for the fact that we ordered it too late (they still very kindly let us have it though! )and the scrambled egg was in a pool of water and the bacon and sausages bore NO resemblance to food usually supplied in a traditional english breakfast-bacon was very thin and greasy more like ham,and sausages oozed with red oil.(think tapas) ps i love tapas but this was a Spanish version of an english meal-didn't work. I know that makes me a whingeing pom-you are right. Sorry,but I had to warn you!!Also tried the hotel RESTAURANT-they have a japanese chef (first time i have tried this type of food) and it was very nouvelle cuisine-tiny,tiny portions,not for those who like a reasonably sized plate of food,and was quite expensive, (√ä√£¬¢110 euros for two), though lovely views at night.I think this hotel has a lot of rooms,so is able to offer them at a good price if they don't all get filled up.This was a very,very well priced stay,enjoy. Central points on the metro line univesitat to canyelles are placa catalunya (well known square with dept store with great cafe views).top of ramblasPobel sec (station for poble espanya-the spanish village)Drassanes (bottom of ramblas) Liceue-stop for gothic quarter, and half way down ramblas, and market hall (very special)go to the left a bit futher down between macdonalds and kentucky for gothic quarter.
