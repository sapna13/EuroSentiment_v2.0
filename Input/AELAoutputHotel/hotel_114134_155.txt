{"text":"Not Coming Back to Lenox When I was living in Boston as a college student almost two decades ago, I never really noticed the Lenox at the corner of Boylston and Exeter, even though I lived just 5 minutes away (on foot) from it. It is a rather low key property.During this last trip, after reading a Fodor's review, I decided to stray from the safer choices of Ritz-Carlton and Fourseasons, to try out this low-key, charming, historic property.Indeed, the hotel is architecturally nostalgically charming, but it isn't in tip top physical condition. As a previous reviewer has noted, the hotel is a little faded.What was most unimpressive, however, was the service. Almost all of the hotel's staff seem to hate their jobs; they rarely smiled. While they weren't particularly rude, their service attitude was grouchy at best and weren't particularly helpful when asked for travel advice and\/or recommendations. The doormen's daily dose of smart comments were also particularly annoying. On the morning of the second day of our stay, we spilled some moisturizing lotion on the bedcover. We left the soiled part of the bedcover face up on the floor next to the bed. When we returned that evening, we found that the chambermaid hadn't cleaned the lotion off of the bedcover and had simply put the bedcover on the bed face down, with the lotion now soiling the sheets. This was particularly disturbing.Lenox also goes overboard with its environmental activism. It encourages guests, to the point of almost forcing it on them, not to change bath towels or bedsheets daily, in the interest of saving the environment. Bed sheets are changed once in 3 days, but guests are not informed beforehand. I only found out on the last day of my 3-night stay when I found a card hidden in a bedside table drawer telling guests that the Lenox is concerned about the environment and would only change sheets once in 3 days, unless requested otherwise. Guests should be notified of this when they check in, not through a card hidden in a drawer. All this environmental activism seems more like a ploy to reduce operating costs to me. It's a real shame that they have to use the mask of environmental activism to achieve this.One more tip for those who rent\/bring cars with them: while car valet at the Lenox is free during the day, the hotel charges $38 for overnight parking. There are several car garages in the vicinity that charges less than half that for overnight parking. Otherwise, if you are an early riser, just park overnight in the streets for FREE. However, travelers should note when street cleaning days are, during which days, parking between 6am and 8am are not allowed. Also, FREE street parking ends daily at 8am Mon-Sat, so you would either have to move your car and valet it for free at the Lenox, or feed the parking meters.My recommendation: stay at some other hotel while in Boston. For a truly charming historic hotel, with great service, if budget is not an issue, try the Ritz-Carlton in Newburry St would be my top choice. Another Boston hotel with great service: Fourseasons Boston. If looking for a hotel in the vicinity of the Lenox, try Marriott or Westin at Copley. For a less expensive alternative in the vicinity, try the Colonnade in Huntington Ave. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":24,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":19},{"endOffset":52,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":46},{"endOffset":130,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":125},{"endOffset":1821,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":1816},{"endOffset":1821,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":1816},{"endOffset":1821,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":1816},{"endOffset":2284,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":2279},{"endOffset":2284,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":2279},{"endOffset":2284,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":2279},{"endOffset":2794,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":2789},{"endOffset":2794,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":2789},{"endOffset":2794,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":2789},{"endOffset":2882,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":2876},{"endOffset":3042,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":3036},{"endOffset":3087,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":3081},{"endOffset":3140,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":3135},{"endOffset":3140,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":3135},{"endOffset":3174,"mention":"Copley","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Fairmont_Copley_Plaza_Hotel"],"startOffset":3168}]}
