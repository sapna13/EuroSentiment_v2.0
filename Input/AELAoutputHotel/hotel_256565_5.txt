{"text":"Exceeded expectations To all of you poor ostracised smokers out there, this is that rarest of gems, a hotel which has smoking allowed rooms - in fact, the whole of the 13th floor - but so well done there's not a whiff of smoke anywhere!.  I stayed here for 4 nights in a de -luxe studio on the 13th floor for $159 per night. The room was lovely, smart and very clean, with an excellent bathroom and well equipped kitchenette and flat screen T.V. The beds (1 queen and 1 single) were comfortable, and there was a great view over the park and across to the bay from the balcony. A very basic breakfast was included - 2 slices of bread, cereal milk, juice, fruit + jam, and a morning paper. However, I was quoted $14 for an extra breakfast if a friend came to stay for the night, which was expensive, as was the internet at $11 per hour.There are several food stores just around the corner (and a couple of internet cafes for $2 per hour), and a good selection of shops and cafes at the world centre a few minutes walk away. Museum station can be accessed just around the corner, so you don't have to cross the street, and is only 2 stops from the airport and 2 from Circular Quay . The staff were unobtrusive but very pleasant and helpful, soon sorting out a theatre booking I'd messed up, and the hotel laundry was free to use.  The only downside to my stay was the traffic noise, unavoidable even at this level, but Sydney has to bee the noisiest city I've stayed in - beloved of boy racers in souped up cars.
