{"text":"Great holiday My wife and I have travelled all over the world. We staid at the Catalonia from Dec. 1 to Dec. 15 2007. After reading earlier reviews on this site, I was somewhat wary of what we were going to find once there. What a surprise! We had 2 outstanding weeks. We had heard that mosquitoes were aboundant. We saw none. Food was supposed to be very poor. In fact, it was quite good. We had breakfast at the beachside buffet dining room, lunch at the poolside grill and pizza bar (which serves grilled chicken, burgers, dogs as well thin crusty pizza cooked in a wood-burning oven. What a snack! Dinner was always in the main dining room. The buffet was varied and you had many options even if you were not into fish or seafood. Our studio was at ground level and looked out onto the golf course. The king-size bed was excellent. Coffee and perculator were provided so we could have coffee in the room at any time. A bonus was the oversize sooker tub with plenty of hot water at any time of day as well as a convenient shower. The studio was kept immaculately cleen. 1$US per day left on the pillow works wonders. Try it...My wife loved walking the many paths in the parklike central area of the property. We are in our early sixties yet we were surprised to find so many families with young children and an astounding number of young babies. It is a very good sign when you spend 2 weeks in a semi-tropical location like Punta Cana and never hear of anyone becoming sick or indisposed. I think it is to the credit of this hotel that they consider good hygienic practices in order to assure the coninued comfort of their guests. The management goes to great lengths to provide a good beach but it is always at the mercy of prevailing winds which bring weeds after breaking over the outer coral reef.The animation team is always busy trying to keep people busy and happy. Evening entertainment is typical of al the other hotels imilar in size in the D.R. If you are looking for for an enjoyable, uncomplicated, relaxing holiday, this is a good place. I definitely recommend it for families with young children (6 mos. to 10 years old), couples who just want to relax, as well as older travellers. (The hotel isalso well suited to people who might have some difficulty walking about - the only requisit is to reserve a ground-level studio.)Happy travelling.Andr√ã√\u2022√ñ ","annotations":[{"endOffset":481,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":476},{"endOffset":524,"mention":"burgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":517},{"endOffset":556,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":551},{"endOffset":556,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":551},{"endOffset":842,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":836},{"endOffset":842,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":836},{"endOffset":842,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":836},{"endOffset":895,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":889},{"endOffset":1617,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":1610}]}
