{"text":"Excellente Holiday @ Excellence Punta Cana Having just returned from not just an Excellent but an Excellente holiday at this fantastic hotel  resort (boo hoo!!). I feel it necessary to comment on my stay and to compliment the excellent staff working at the hotel.From start to finish the staff could not do enough for you, their warm, relaxed and natural personalities shone through (even when the sun didn't!!). As the holiday progressed I became more impressed at the effort put in by all staff that I met. Special well dones and thank yous to everyone at the hotel for making my stay a very warm and relaxing one, I will be back  hopefully for 3 weeks next time!!When you visit the hotel be sure to pay a visit to the Spa, the massages are fantastic, well worth the money  the Spa itself is to die for!If you're into some seriously funny Adult humour then be sure to pay the Martini Bar a visit and watch the Dave Richards (Pianist) Show. If my memory serves me correctly the show is on a Monday night after the main show and it 's definately one not to be missed!! Relax and have a drink at the bar, I dare you to sing a song with him!! Ask him if he's finished the Morcheeba cover of the song Friction yet??!The Resident Entertainment Team, all are fantastic are worth their weight in gold too!! Funny people who genuinely give you the time of day (even if they do give you the fright of your life by waking you up during an afternoon nap!!) and night!! With the phrase of the holiday being 2000 People!! Which there never will be you will be laughing at their efforts to get the Beach Volley, Water Volley etc on the go. People to look out for on your holiday  who definately derserve a drink or two are: Luciano (Ents Manager), favourite phrase 2000 people!! Ines (Mad Macy Gray Hair!!) the disco diva!! Rosmery (tacky. tacky CD girl!!), Julio (the only Dominican Scotsman that you'll ever meet!!), very funny guy!! Carlos (ow my teeth hurt!!), fab at his job and a top guy too!! Juan-Carlos (J.C), lovely nail varnish and he's not guy!!Andres (Dancing King!!), Franklin (little devil!!) are real loveable, cheek squeezable guy!! Wilkin (2nd in command) keeps the sound  lights working, spins some tunes in the disco!!The outside acts are amazing dont miss out on the Michael Jackson Show, the Circus  the Chris Blizzard show. All are fab, be sure to get a good seat!!Food wise my fav restaurants were (all of them!!) the Spice (thanks to Ramon (Head Waiter??)),  the French restaurant (get there before 7pm to get a table!!). All in all food and service is great.Also due a massive thank you is Rafael Puello (Sub Director), again nothing is too much trouble, a real genuine guy who really cares about his customers and their enjoyment during their stay.Overall a fantastic holiday, wicked accommodation. Excellente staff, food to die for, service out of this world all served up by the warmest and nicest people I have ever met on holiday!! I will be back!!Sarah (from England but who lives in Spain, Malaga).
