{"text":"Second stay here and still great! I stayed here a few years a go when I came to Barcelona with a group of my girlfriends and thought the hotel was great then. Been to Barcelona five times now and have stayed in apartments the other times but thought I would give the Oriente another try. It didn't dissapoint! The hotel has been recently refurbished and is alot more modern than before, but it has still retained its charm. The reception staff were very cheery, polite and helpful and we all had a giggle with them when we checked in! We had booked 3 rooms as 6 of us were travelling. Two couples wanted rooms overlooking the Ramblas and one couple wanted a quiet room at the back and they immediately accommodated us - it was no problem at all. The ramblas rooms were the refurbished rooms and the back room was in the older style of room, but still very nice and much bigger than the Ramblas rooms! We were all very happy with our rooms (albeit the Ramblas rooms were very small) and found them to be very comfortable and clean. The bathrooms are a bit sparce and clinical, but hey! you only wash, shower etc in them anyway! We had a safe, hairdryer, TV and controllable heating in all the rooms. The Ramblas rooms are noisy but to us it adds to the atmosphere of being in such a great location in such a great city! The room at the back was indeed quiet, so if you are a light sleeper book one of those! Breakfast was fine - everything available, not gourmet but perfectly acceptable! All in all this is great hotel in a fabulous location and it is very good value for money. I personally am very glad I stayed there again and my family all really liked it too - we are planning another trip next year and will certainly look to stay at the Oriente again!Here are some good places to eat and fun bars to go to - BILBAO BERRIA - Great tapas restaurant in the square by the cathedral. Yum!LA GAVINA RESTAURANT - Wonderful food infact it was fabulous! Not cheap but worth every penny. In Palau del Mar, Port Vell.CAL PINXO - Next to La Gavina and just as good!IRATI - Another tapas restaurant off of Las Ramblas down a side street that I cant remember - tasty!BOSC DE LES FADES - Really fun, fairytale bar! Well worth a visit just for the experience! Turn right by the Wax Musuem.OLYMPIC PORT - Good night out if you are in a lively mood! Loads of bars, clubs and restaurants. Some of the restaurants are not too good so beware! One good one here is REY DE LA GAMBA.
