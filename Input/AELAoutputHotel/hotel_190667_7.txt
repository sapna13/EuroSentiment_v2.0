{"text":"Loved the place!! I was booked to stay in this hotel and was apprehensive given the scathing remarks in other reviews. Nothing could be farther from the truth. It is a lovely hotel and the staff are bunch of wonderful people who went out of their way to be nice and do the needful to make my stay comfortable. (I did see them quietly ignore a rude guest. I guess the moral is - if you are nice, people will be nice in return, rudeness begets rudeness!!) The room is rather small for the price, but remember that you are in Amsterdam where space is at a premium. The bathroom was a revelation and the larger hotel chains would do well to take a few cues from the Dylan on the subject of creating lovely bathrooms. Both the room and the bathroom were well equipped. The complimentary internet access is excellent. The hotel is located in a wonderful area in the centre of Amsterdam and is a short way away from the main attractions. For a 41 roomed hotel, it is very well known in Amsterdam and the locals hold it in high esteem. A taxi driver will have no problem in taking you there (If he does not recognise 'Dylan' tell him to take you to 'Blake's; which is the old name for this property. The public areas on the ground floor, the lounge, cafe etc. are chic and smart. They come across as being sophisticated and classy without being loud or flashy. In fact, nowhere is the hotel brassy, flashy or loud. Each bit of this wonderful hotel is elegant.
