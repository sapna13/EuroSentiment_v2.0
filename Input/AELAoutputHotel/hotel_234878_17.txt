{"text":"Professional if nothing else Good location.Very smart lobby, perhaps harking back to greater days. Inside the building, just a normal hotel. Four star? Slightly dubious on that one. Service was professional (English speaking staff) but at no point friendly. We were given a room different to that on our receipt but seemed similar from the floor schematic.We were on the inside of a square courtyard so noise was quite bad. Think this was more porters etc. than guests. No bath and my girlfriend was burnt by the shower changing temperature all by itself. Other than that the bathroom was clean.The beds were quite small by British standards, 2 domestic size singles in a bizarre L-shaped configuration (had twice requested a double pre-arrival and the hotel public areas certainly never seemed busy). Free space in the room was dominated by an unfortunately placed fixed desk.Room appeared slightly dated but had obviously had some (limited) modernisation in the past few years.The pink lights of previous reviews were apparent in the corridors, very strange and there only seemed to be one lift.Gripes aside, we had somewhere to put our heads down which was the main objective as we were doing sight-seeing very quickly on the Saturday.On the Sunday we checked out no problem (again, no smiles from the staff) and went to the Zoo, which is 5\/10 mins walk away, along with a major station. I imagine if we knew Berlin well, this would have been an ideal location but the hotel itself offered nothing by the way of service or charisma to entice us back to this property by design.All said and done, the price was √ä√£¬¢69 which compared to British prices is I suppose very reasonable for being near ammenities and a major shopping area. This was room only however and as I say, the least impressive four star I have stayed in anywhere.If you can get it on a deal however, go for it! ","annotations":[]}
