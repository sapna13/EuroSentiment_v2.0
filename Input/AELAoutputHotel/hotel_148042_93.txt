{"text":"Repeat guest, will return again My first visit to this resort was July 2006, and just three days after my boyfriend and I returned to New York, we booked another trip for September! We absolutely couldn't wait to get back! We returned for another trip in May 2007, and yet again in August 2007, for no reason simply other than to escape NYC and relax at the beautiful beach at the hotel (and to scratch our gambling itch at the hotel casino). As soon as we wake up in the morning, we head to the beach, where we stay for most of the day, ordering cocktails and lunch to eat by the ocean. In the evening we take a taxi to Old San Juan to try a local restaurant for dinner and look out over the fort before the sun goes down.Aside from the beautiful location of the hotel on the beach and the relaxing atmosphere, one of the reasons we keep coming back is the generous and consistent hospitality offered by the staff. They really do their best to make you feel welcome. On our fourth visit, we arrived early in the day and not only was our room ready for us to check into at noon, but we were also upgraded to an oceanfront room. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast at $18 is overpriced for what ends up being a bagel and a few slices of fruit. Lunch at the poolside bar is not cheap, but is of better value than the hotel breakfast. When my two best girlfriends and I decided to get away for a bachelorette weekend before their weddings, I could not think of a more perfect place than the Ritz in San Juan. I am looking forward to our trip (and my fifth visit) this spring! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1231,"mention":"bagel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bagel"],"startOffset":1226}]}
