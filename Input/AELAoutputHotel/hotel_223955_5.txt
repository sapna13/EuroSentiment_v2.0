{"text":"Excellent business choice I stayed at the Courtyard for four nights for a convention at the Moscone Center. I chose the Courtyard because it was less expensive than other business and branded hotels within a few blocks of the convention center. I booked through the Marriott website and had a rate of $199 per night.The hotel looks to be newer. Everything is clean and working perfectly. The lobby is inviting. My room was on the 8th floor and faced northwest. My room had a king-sized bed, a couch (pull-out sleeper), and a desk. The room was comfortable and had plenty of room. The bathroom was also larger than I expected, but it looks to be ADA compliant, hence the extra room. The bed was comfortable, and there were plenty of pillows.The hotel was quiet. I never heard any noise outside my room. The desk staff was friendly and helpful. Check-in was quick. I asked for a restaurant suggestions one night, and I was given several options from which to choose.The hotel is 2.5 blocks from the entrance to the Moscone Center. It's 3 blocks from Market Street and the Montgomery BART station. There are plenty of restaurants within a few blocks.While I think nearly $200 is a high price for a hotel room, this was cheaper than many rooms in the area, so I will consider it a good value based on the local market.I reserve giving a full 5 rating for truly exceptional stays and values, and this Courtyard comes very close. This hotel has easily earned my rating of 4 and then some. I would definitely stay here again. (CS) ","annotations":[]}
