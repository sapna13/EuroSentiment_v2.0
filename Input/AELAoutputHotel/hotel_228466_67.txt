{"text":"Extremely Disappointed Business Traveler... I'm an executive and frequent business traveler for a Fortune 50 company based in NYC and have stayed in a wide variety of hotels across the globe, ranging from business to luxury class. The Fira Palace Hotel was recommended to our team for a Barcelona meeting, as we're a rather large group, and the reviews posted thus far on TripAdvisor didn't seem so bad. (The worst I saw was a comment about the rock-hard beds - quite accurate but manageable). However, those reviews fail to capture some real problems here, particularly for the business traveler. First, the gymnasium opens at 9 am, precisely the time that your meetings will have begun, so don't bother packing the sneakers and shorts. Second, room service (other than light fare) is available on a very limited restaurant style schedule - open only for several hours in late afternooon and late evening, and is closed all other times. Besides that, the menu offerings are incredibly limited, and unacceptable for a city business hotel. Third, English is not spoken by a large percentage of the staff, which is fine for meetings of local travelers but doesn't work well for an international gathering. I could go on and on, but will spare you the details. What's more, the staff and management were entirely unapologetic for these shortcomings, and seemed to suggest that the issues cited were perfectly reasonable, at least for the Spanish business traveler. (My condolences to the Spanish!) Be that as it may, I will recommend that my organization do no further business with this establishment, and I would caution international business travelers to look elsewhere.
