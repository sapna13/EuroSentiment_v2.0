{"text":"Southern Hospitality I stayed at the Omni Park West for a lengthy business trip. The rooms were very nice....super comfy pillows and beds, nice bathroom, plasma tv. The food at Dovers was decent...it could've been better but I am a picky eater. The shuttle can take you out to several different places to eat though. They tell you the shuttle only goes in a 5 mile radius of the hotel but tip the driver well and you can get a little further out. I know there was a sports bar and a steakhouse closeby that were good.I read somewhere that the bar closed at 12am....not true at all! We had that bar open until 2am most nights. If you're there, having fun, and tipping well, the bartenders aren't going to leave.The pool was nice. They have waiters who will take drink orders and food orders for you while you are laying by the pool and bring them over to you. All and all it's a nice hotel but a bit far out from the actual city of Dallas. It's about a 20 minute drive to Dallas and about a 30 minute drive to Fort Worth. The drives out there are definitely worth the cost of a cab. The staff at the Omni was very accomodating to say the least. Talk to someone once and they knew your name after that. I would just walk by somewhere and hear my name being yelled hello. The front desk staff was there to assist in any problems, the bellhops were always there to give advice on where to go and what to see, the shuttle driver was fantastic, the bar\/restaurant staff were some of the nicest people I've met. When I left I was getting hugs from everyone. In all my hotel stays I have never experienced such good hearted people. The staff alone is reason enough to stay there.
