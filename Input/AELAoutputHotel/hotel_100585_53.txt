{"text":"Beware of Queen Rooms I spent 2 nights here on vacation with my fiancee. We had spent the previous 2 nights at the Bellevue Hyatt (very nice hotel).I booked through the Kimpton central reservation and they matched the rate I found on expedia ($129\/night) for a room with one queen bed.Because we were early, I did not expect to get a room, but was pleasantly surprised when they said one was available. Unfortunately, the room was on the 3rd floor with a view of the wall of the building next door. When I phoned to inquire about a room on a higher floor or with a street view, I was informed that all the queen rooms are inside rooms (i.e. facing the building next door). I could have moved up to the 10th floor so I could at least look over the building next door, but the room was 100 sq. ft. smaller!! I think that they should have mentioned this when I was booking, or at least somewhere on the hotel website. I probably would not have booked here if I had known I had to strain my head to look out the window to see if the sky was blue, especially since parking was $30\/night extra. (There is no self-park option at the hotel. The bellhops did not know the cost of nearby parking, so we drove across the street to check. I think it was maybe $2 less per night.) One other minor quibble is that the concierge was not on duty after the wine reception, which I would think is prime time for dinner recommendations. I did like the free internet, the L'Occitane toiletries, the bed, the magazines, and the wine reception. The restaurant, Tulio, was quite good. This is the 2nd time that we had eaten there. It is not your typical hotel restaurant.We also ate at Serious Pie, which I highly recommend. They have gourmet thin crust pizzas in a casual funky setting. It is one of the Tom Douglas restaurants.Overall, I wouldn't stay here again because I don't think the value for money was that great and because I felt a bit mislead. I think you can get a nicer newer room for the same amount of money. This hotel was rated four stars, which it might be if you pay for the king premier room. However, I don't think the queen rooms are as good. When I compare it to the Bellevue Hyatt, which is also four stars, the Hyatt is far superior.
