{"text":"Good food and good people make for a great vacation! I am a frequent traveler to the Dominican Republic and The Grand Flamenco was one of the nicer resorts I have stayed at. This was my second time at The Grand Flamenco, and although it is a modest resort, the food is good, the staff is excellent and it is just what you need if you have to travel on a budget. Not many of the resorts in Punta Cana are super fancy because this is a third world country, but they work very, very hard to make you feel at home. The rooms are typical for what you see in D.R., and they do need to update the amenities of their rooms. But the room was cleaned well every day and, more importantly, before noon every day. We had a small problem with the air conditioner but that was fixed immediately. When we entered the room for the first time, the maid had designed a towel into a heart and surrounded it with red flowers! What a romantic way to start a vacation with my husband! And each day she did a different design for us. (It helps to tip them $2 - $3 dollars each day and leave a small gift, like make-up or nail polish. Little samples that you get from Avon or at Macy's work perfectly.)The staff at the restaurants are so very friendly and they have a great pool and swim up bar. Sandy and Freddy are great bartenders! The entertainment staff at the pool were lots of fun to watch and chat with and they made sure everyone had a good time. One of the best things about this resort is that their main restaurant is enclosed and air conditioned really well, which is a great relief because the heat is quite strong during the day. The sportsbar\/restaurant near the pool has great food and is open for most of the day. We only tried one of the specialty restaurants, The Mexican restaurant, but the food was very good and the ambiance was lovely.Basically, if you are looking for a realxing time without having to spend a small fortune, this is definetly a resort to consider.
