{"text":"It Felt Like Home We just returned from 10 glorious days (Oct. 12 √à√\u2020\u2022?22\/06) at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. This would be our 6th stay at an Iberostar Hotel. The hotel is huge, is kept clean and the staff is absolutely wonderful. We had a magnificent time, despite rain almost everyday √à√\u2020\u2022?Bingo to the rescue.Animation\/Entertainment: This team is lead by 2 of the greatest Friends. Thank you Huck and Armando for making it so much fun. We were quite a challenge when it came to participating but Huck never gave up and managed to do the impossible. Thank you, Armando, for making sure we were well taken care of and making it feel like home. This team of young men and women work very hard at what they do and try their best to get everyone involved. We will make a big effort to join in on the Club Dance when we return to Bavaro. Accommodation\/Services: Reception Desk, Housekeeping, Guest Services, Bellboys, Waiters\/Waitresses, √à√\u2020\u2022?all score a 10. Being early risers and at breakfast by 8 am, our room was always made up by 9:00 am. Beware of the rooster that doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know you are on vacation! Reception called every 2 days to make sure that everything was going well - such a nice touch.Food: We basically stuck to the buffet, which was more than adequate for us. We did have dinner at the Cajun and Steakhouse restaurants and they were fine. This was our first visit to Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana, DR and will definitely not be our last.
