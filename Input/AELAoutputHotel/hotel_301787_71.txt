{"text":"A very unique place to stay The hotel is situated in the Nusa Dua area of Bali. It is a highly secured area with security checks of the cars and luggage at the entrance.Overall the hotel is really charming, with an open lobby and a truly beautifull tropical garden surrounding the hotel. In the garden you can find several typical balinese archotectue like statutes, fountains, bridges.It has 3 pools of which one is accessible by the hotel rooms on the main floor. The second pool is designed like a sandy beach including an artificial waterfall. The third pool is a traditional pool. During our stay, the hotel was not crowded.The rooms have really nice and comfortable beds, a plasma TV (opposite the bed), a balcony (with a splendid view on the tropical garden and lagoon) and a desk. The bathroom is quite big. We felt that the room cleaning was very good and discrete. Also the butler service is very nice, you can order coffee to your room, free of charge. As we had only booked breakfast, I can just tell you that the buffet offered was splendid and very good: lots of different food, even rice and sushi. A cook would also prepare omelets at your own taste. The service in the breakfast room could be kind of hectical when all the tables were full. The beach is not the best you might find in Bali but we found it truly relaxing and enjoyable unless you can ignore the beach sellers (Hello? Sungalsses, watches,..) The service on the beach and in the pool area is very friendly, although not the fastest.Overall I found it a really nice place to stay an will definitly return.
