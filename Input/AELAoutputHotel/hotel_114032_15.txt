{"text":"A bit less than expected - even for the great price I booked the Aqua Continental with my eyes wide open - I realized that I was getting a bargain rate and an okay hotel. Upon arrival we were quickly checked-in, given a room with an awesome view of the water. However, be aware that the windows are small windows placed above the half-way mark on the wall - so you will have to stand to enjoy your view. As expected, the room was very small, and so was the bathroom. The room was clean and basic - the TV was of an adequate size. The bathroom was also small. The shower head had a stream of water squirting sideways that would get the sink area wet if the curtain wasn't pulled during showers.What was very disappointing to me was the fact that over the course of a 5 night stay, the elevator alarms went off at least four times. This would be loud and annoying for about 7-8 minutes. Mind you, we were only in the room to basically sleep - so I don't know how many times they had this problem after we had checked out.The front desk was of minimal help the one time that I needed an actual answer. When I called down to see about receiving a fax and asked how much it would cost, they told me, We gave you a rate card when you checked in - I asked, can't you just tell me? To which I was told, Then I would have to go and check. Also, the three times that I specifically looked to see which front desk attendant was helping me, none had name tags. I suggest that the employees wear nametags - this might improve service.All in all an okay stay - but I would definately look to stay elsewhere next time on account of the elevator issues and the one employee issue I did have.
