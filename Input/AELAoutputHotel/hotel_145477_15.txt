{"text":"The San Juan Hotel in South Beach The first time I stayed at the San Juan Hotel was in 2005. I chose this hotel because the price was affordable and the hotels in this area are much more expensive. I found the staff to be courteous and they provided excellent customer service. All of my needs were met. I found the room cold and was unable to control my own air conditioning. Maintenance was kind enough to cover the vent in my room so that my room would not be so cold. I stayed in another hotel in the area in 2006 and realized that I prefer the San Juan. The San Juan also has a beautiful swimming pool. Last year, I returned with my daughter who loved it here as much as I do. Renovations had been done to many of the rooms and they were even nicer then I had previously remembered. The rooms are kept clean and what I also like is that there is a fridge and a microwave so that I could make my own meals in my room. There was also a table and chairs. This year once again I went back to the San Juan and had the pleasure of having a most pleasant conversation with the owner and manager. I told her that I think that she is a very good judge of character as she has always hired staff who are attentive to the needs of their customers. They provide excellent customer service and are always kind and most helpful. I can only say positive things about this hotel as all of my experiences here have been wonderful. Each and every staff member employed here has excellent customer service skills. They know how to handle any situation with kindness and humor. Miriam Corcos ","annotations":[]}
