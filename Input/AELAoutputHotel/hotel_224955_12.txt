{"text":"Like life, a good attitude matters I am a single female business traveller who was completely fine with my stay at Hotel Metropolis. The main entry to the hotel is not from the street, they have taken care to provide a secure and welcoming entry from the open parking area. I was very aware of the concerns of the immediate neighbourhood and believe that part of the responsibility is mine to be careful with the display of my possessions, and not be silly to walk alone at night in an unfamiliar area (and this could be for any city). I was checked in by Raymond, who is one of those rare few who went beyond expectations to greet me by name when I returned in the evening. I had THE most comfortable bed to sleep in after long days of meetings, and THE biggest t.v. I have ever seen in a standard room. I sent an email request which was responded to promptly. To me, these customer service standards more than make up for a block off the beaten path. At night, since I was travelling alone, I had a cab drop me right at the 'sheltered' door from the parkade, but while it was still light out, I did walk back to my hotel from Union Square without any problems. Any cabs or shuttles you require are happy to come inside the lobby to get you, rather than have you wait outside on the street. I have seen some of the other reviews, and I saw the misfortune of the some of the people on the streets nearby, but I do not think this is unheard of in any large city. This is a hotel that has a certain character and charm, and should not be ruled out based only on its location. I would stay here again. ","annotations":[]}
