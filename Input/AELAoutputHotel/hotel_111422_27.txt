{"text":"August in Boston I spent 4 nights at the hotel along with our pet dog a little Lhasa Apso. Over all the experience was quite positive. The check in and checkout were both effortless. We advised the hotel that we would be travelling with our little dog and they did not seem to mind at all. We did see 2 other families with medium sized dogs at the hotel while we were there.The room was clean and well presented, the airconditioning worked well, the daily room service clean up was quick and efficient. We did not try the hotel restaurant or the bar as we were quiet literaly spoilt for choice once you left the hotel premises. Downtown Cambridge was not too far away and you could walk to most of the places and take your pick of several ethnic restaurants.We found the shuttle service a bit - iffy on perhaps the only time we planned to use it, however we did not have any trouble driving around in Boston . All you need is a good GPS and a plan of which direction you are heading in. Mind you - you do loose the GPS signal while driving through the tunnels in the city - so be warned. Parking at the hotel lot by yourself is $25.00 per day and its no biggie - go for the top most level you will usually find a spot there.Finding parking in the city was no problem either - if you are willing to walk for say 7 to 10 minutes to a parking lot you can then find parking for $15.00 per day downtown close to the norh end - which is not bad at all. Parking in the inner city parking lots can be steep though- appx $35.00 for the day.There is a good grocery store appx a 5 minute drive from the hotel just across the bridge called 'Whole Foods' along with a pharmacy in the same zone. 2 gas stations just outside the hotel, so you should not have any problems filling up.
