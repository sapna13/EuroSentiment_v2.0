{"text":"Free Cocktails and Breakfast! The Wyndham San Juan is the perfect place to stay. Its adjacent to the airport and only 2 blocks from the beach. The hotel is clean, comfortable and features a contemporary decor. Each room has two beds plus a sofa-bed and includes a wet bar, microwave and small refrigerator. Probably the best part is the complimentary cocktail hour and complimentary breakfast.Our group of 12 people booked 3 rooms for one night prior to departing on a cruise. It was a perfect pre-departure party for us as the hotel offers a complimentary managers cocktail reception every day from 5pm to 7pm. They offer a variety of cocktails, featuring premium liquors as well as frozen drinks. They also include free chips and salsa and snack mix. The complimentary breakfast features a variety of standard breakfast foods; french toast, sausage, home fries, scrambled eggs, cereal, breads and made-to-order omelettes. The bell man was really friendly and offered numerous suggestions for good restaurants and night life. We walked one block to Mi Casita, a local restaurant in a small strip center. It featured local food at reasonable prices. The restaurant was clean, the food was well-prepared and the service was good. The hotel pool is beautiful, in a resort-style setting. On another note, I have to point out its probably best to request a room AWAY from the elevators. This floor is ceramic tile and very noisy with foot traffic. Overall this is a great hotel with a fun atmosphere in a great location.
