{"text":"Not 5 star standard I am a travel agent and stayed at this hotel at a special rate, assuming it would be one of the nicest hotels in the city. I would rate this hotel as maximum 3\/4 star as the rooms are VERY small and you would really expect more from a 5 star property. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean enough but this hotel is a bit misleading. The website clearly states free wi-fi internet access - this is not true! Apparently you get 15 minutes free but I was not advised of this until after I had paid EUR17.00 for 24 hours and an extra EUR10.00 for another hour. The website also states Jacuzzi baths - this is not true. Apparently they have a jacuzzi in the spa but not in the baths in the rooms. The location is good but there are other NH hotels with better locations in the city and obviously other hotels. It is near the Leidesplein but at the wrong end so it's about a 15 minute walk to the actual centre and way too far from the train station to walk from. You cannot smoke anywhere in the hotel apart from a small lounge area near the front door - I was also not advised of this and wouldn't really expect it in Amsterdam. I would definitely not pay the normal prices for this hotel. They also appear to have some sort of ongoing problem with the water. The cold water was turned off from 10am to 3pm while I was there - not very nice when you can't brush your teeth and there was a loud noise in the night from the water tank\/pipes. The bathroom was nice and clean though and free toiletries were a nice touch, unfortunately this doesn't really make up for the bad points and I won't be staying here again or reccommending this hotel to my clients. I was also automatically joined up to the NH world Card which is no use to me with my special rates and not being a large hotel chain. My advice - stay somewhere cheaper and more authentically Dutch.
