{"text":"Left My Heart In San Francisco San Francisco has never really been on my radar as a must visit place. How wrong I was. Without doubt this is now my favourite city on the planet.The warmth and diversity of the people. All filled with civic pride and useful √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂?hat to see√à√\u2020\u2022?tips. The charm and individuality of the neighbourhoods. The vibrancy of the bars and restaurants √à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®√î??\u201A√á¬®√î??\u201A√á¬®√î??\u201A√á¬®?I could go on but this review is really about the hotel.Hotel Vitale is top class. Located in the Mission district right on the Embarcadero it is the perfect start point for exploring the key SF attractions. I booked 2 advance seats on a shared van ride (supershuttle) to get to\/from the airport. Reasonable rate at $70 for 2 roundtrip (including tip). This is a first come first served basis but we only had to wait 5 mins. At the airport you have to look for a representative in a green jacket. It is not possible to just deal with the driver. From memory it took about 20 mins in bust traffic.On arrival at the Vitale the bell staff are super friendly and will unload your cases and wait patiently while you check in.Hot towels are offered in the super chic reception area. Front desk staff were very welcoming and offered a free upgrade right from the start. Answered all questions efficiently and provided a city map for orientation.Really nice bell guy showed us to our room and explained that he had only move to SF a year ago and was still experiencing the city like a tourist. He engaged us in a easy conversation about our interests and made various recommendations including a trip to Sausaltio from the ferry building almost directly opposite (do this it is a beautiful place). Would also recommend the evening Alcatraaz trip (book well in advance).This guy√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ helpfulness was only surpassed by the concierge who came up with the perfect options for whatever we requested.Room was immaculate and bathroom was a dream. Walk in rainfall shower and brimming with expensive toiletries. Excellent furnishings and super comfy bed\/pillows. CD player with a selection of compilations. Ambient noise maker (whales, running water etc √à√\u2020\u2022?nice touch). LCD TV and a well stocked mini bar including a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022?overs√à√\u2020\u2022?kit √à¬£¬∂? 2nd floor Room with bay view directly over the bar. Agree with all the other comments about the huge happy hour crowds and noise. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ manage to get an evening drink in the bar but the noise wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ an issue for us as we were generally out late. If you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like noise and like an early night √à√\u2020\u2022?book a higher floor if you are on the bay side. The room seemed a bit small after coming from our five room suite in The Hotel at The Mandalay Bay (but what wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ)We had mentioned it was our anniversary. 10 minutes after arrival there was a knock on the door with a bottle of complimentary champagne and a card from the front desk staff. The first glass hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ been emptied before there was another knock which was the housekeeping manager who presented us with a picture frame and another hand written anniversary card. It didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stop there √à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®√î??\u201A√á¬®?The second night saw a fresh bunch of Daff√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ with another card. The last night it was rose petals on the bed. Housekeeping was perfect. Free office \/ internet service on the second floor. Free yoga class in the gym. Amazing room service.Having stayed in top hotels all over the world I can say that I have never experienced this level of service.You must visit this hotel.
