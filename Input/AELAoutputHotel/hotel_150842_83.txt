{"text":"Excellent Resort, GREAT FOOD, Friendly Staff The RESORT:We just returned from a week long stay at the Iberostar Dominicana. We had a TERRIFIC time! We have been to several other carribean countries before and we travel ALOT and this resort is VERY clean, excellent food and selection, staff is very courteous, the grounds are beautiful and very neat and clean with not a leaf out of place, with fish ponds around open air restaurants. and NO bugs of any kind. The rooms have a mini fridge bar that the maid keeps stocked for you, there are numerous housekeepers, and gardeners and grounds keepers that are constantly walking around cleaning, which was great to see. The weather was Sunny the entire time -- rained once or twice for just 15 minutes, then sun again... internet weather shows it cloudy all the time, but it is not at all. You can choose from several restaurants, serving any type of food you like - chinese, american, seafood, etc. There are activities going on around the pool all day, which makes for some funny entertainment. Entertainment at night was very entertaining --- they have an adult show and a separate kids show. It helps to know to little spanish, but not at all necessary. The beach was clean and great swimming. Other resorts North of this resort had LOTS of seaweed along the beach and in the water.TOURS: The MONSTER TRUCK\/MEGA Truck tour (the only safari truck with 8 wheels was EXCELLENT and VERY FUN with Professional staff you see the culture, local house, school, etc and the tour guide is very informative..... you'll have to specifically ask for it, since certain travel agents only book with certain companies.... not sure why (we booked through funject\/VIP travel and they only told us about 5 different tours, but we found out through other tourists that there are many, many more tours. ***DO NOT go on the Dune Buggy horse ride Tour at Racho Pancho LLano-- we are horse owners and were extremely saddened at how thin and dehydrated the horses were -- very boney and 'sucked up'.... horses that thin should not be ridden at all. Also one horse was limping, but the guides did not seem to care at all. The guide also kept herding the horses together and making the horses go into the side barbed wire fence lines... I think he thought it was funny since it would make us tourist get nervous -- I finally had to tell him to stop it and he did. I'm not sure if all the horses on other tour companies were the same, I can only comment on this one. The dune buggies were kinda fun -- but our brakes and steering barely worked -- seatbelts wouldn't click and we were on the main highway road most of the time, rather than on the sandy beach and pastures as advertised.We would definitely go back to the Iberostar Dominicana again.
