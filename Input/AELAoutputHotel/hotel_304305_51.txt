{"text":"Keio Plaza Shinjuku - Delightful stay in great location. Couple and young teenage son chose Keio Plaza from reviews and capacity to accommodate triple booking. (We experienced difficulty trying to make a reservation for a triple room in Tokyo). From other reviews in Tokyo regarding size of rooms, we expected a very cramped room √à√\u2020\u2022?how wrong!We stayed on the 24th floor of the south tower. Room was more than adequate with 2 double beds and a made-up double sofa bed across one wall! Still enough room for our suitcases, etc. After arriving late in the evening after a long flight, my son appreciated the fact that the sofa bed was ready to fall into after a shower.The entire experience was delightful √à√\u2020\u2022?staff very pleasant, friendly and ever so helpful. Amenities were the best we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° experienced over a month away in Canada, USA  Japan. Toothbrushes  paste, hair ties, cotton buds\/balls, razors, slippers, dressing gown, etc.Great location within relatively easy walking distance to Shinjuku station, Isetan  Keio Plaza Dept stores and numerous other stores, restaurants, cafes  bars. Since we were tired on our arrival we also appreciated the great little convenience store on the 2nd level that was well stocked with snacks and drinks.Narita Shuttle picks up and drops off from the front door and Keio Plaza were more than happy to hold our luggage from checkout until late afternoon when we were due to return to the airport via the Shuttle.For convenience, on our first morning we opted for a good breakfast at the hotel prior to walking the city, and were not disappointed. The continental breakfast I chose was more than adequate (couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ finish it all) and the boys were very happy with the buffet.We would√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe loved to have stayed longer √à√\u2020\u2022?instead we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l make a point of returning.
