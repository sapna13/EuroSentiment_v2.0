{"text":"Great Hotel, Great Food, Great Parties!! We stayed at the Paradisus Hotel this past month. I have to say that the hotel was definitely a 5 star hotel. The food was amazing, the people and service were excellent,very friendly and the place was extremelly clean. I'm surprised to see all these reviews about people getting sick in general in Punta Cana. Bear in mind that these Hotels are all inclusive resorts that means all you can drink ...so yes, if you are boozing 24\/7 you will get sick!!! This is common sense guys!The pool was great, huge pool! surrounded by trees which was great because you could stay in the shadow if you liked.The beach was amazing, never seen such blue acqua color anywhere else, and I have to say that we have traveled to Mexico, Costa Rica, and Mediterranean sea, and never seen such a clean and and beautifull beach. The best was the beach bar, Gabi Lounge, the beds on the beach, amazing place, relaxing great ambiance music. The bartenders were super friendly!We stayed near the beach and yes, we had to wait for a bus or hotel troly to take us to the lobby. The hotel is huge and some things are spread out. We figured that since we were vegging out all week, it wouldn't hurt to walk 5 minutes to the lobby as suppose as taking the bus. This didn't bother us so much as we like to be active even during our vacation. The water sports were great, all incleded in the Hotel package.definetly we'll go back to Punta Cana and definetly will stay at Hotel Paradisus. ","annotations":[]}
