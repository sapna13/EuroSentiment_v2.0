{"text":"Not as much magic as there should be This was our 5th visit to Disneyland Paris with our 5 year old son but the first time at the Disneyland Hotel. We had walked past it on a number of occasions before and went in a few times to be totally bowled over with the beautiful entrance area and staircase. It was absolutely overpriced compared to the other hotels in the area but we were determined to go, saved up and booked . We stayed for 3 nights, 4 days in the parks and travelled with Ryanair to Beauvais and hired a car to get around. We stopped off at a supermarket on our way over and stocked up on water, snacks and fruit - basically everything that costs a fortune in the parks. Arrival and reception at the hotel were very nice, bags whisked away and although our room was not ready we were given our park tickets and told to come back at 3pm. We then headed off for our day in the parks and returned around 6pm when our room was ready. Our room was very nice, very spacious and clean and that's about it really. The minibar was priced so high that we locked it so that none of us accidentally purchased anything. The bathroom was quite small and not what was expected although sufficient. As many others have said the TV in the room has no Disney movies, cartoons etc in English which after a long day out would be lovely to come back to with a tired 5 year old and relax. The aim of Disney though is to make sure you're not in your room but out (spending) in the parks so it's possible that the aim is to make the rooms welcoming but just not too much. Breakfast was just OK (motorway service station standard) if a bit of a bun fight to get to anything. On one of the evenings we ordered room service which again was OK but extortionate. I know the theme in this review is that everything seemed to be very expensive but we already knew this and were quite prepared to accept and enjoy especially as we booked this hotel. The real problem that we had was that it was not any better than other hotels we have stayed in visiting Disney and we were really expecting better. It didn't feel like a kids paradise and really didn't deliver for our 5 year old. The location is great and the staff were very pleasant. We would however not fork out again to stay here although we would return to Disney but would stay elsewhere. The Disneyland Paris Hotel lacked the magic we were looking for and for us the old adage of y'ou get what you pay for' just didn't hold true.
