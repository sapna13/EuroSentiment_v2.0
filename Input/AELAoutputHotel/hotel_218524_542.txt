{"text":"Excellence Defined! My best friend and I recently returned from a 5-night stay at the Excellence Punta Cana Resort and it was truly excellent! We loved the service, the facilities and the activities. There were several dining options and fun things to do. The resort also offered serenity when we wanted to just sit back and relax. The staff really exemplified service excellence. I celebrated my birthday during my stay and the concierge staff decorated my room and surprised me with a cake- Nicki you are the best! Thank you for making my birthday special. Our requests were addressed right away and in the most pleasant manner- thanks to Edwin Ortiz. We give many thanks to Franklin for his engaging Spanish lessons every morning- Franklin your personality shines the brightest! The entertainers really created a lively atmosphere with their energy everywhere from poolside to the disco- Juan Carlos, we loved your Bachata! As for drinks, Yuli, Fabio and Domingo were √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢he best√à√\u2020\u2022?bartenders! We can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ forget about the food- simply delicious- and the refined manners and attentiveness of Kelvin and Ramon added a special touch to the dining experience. Our continued enthusiasm about the Excellence Punta Cana Resort has everything to do with the wonderful people working there. They made it more than just a beautiful place to stay. Whether we were on the beach, in the spa, shopping or enjoying a show, everyone was very nice and accommodating. I mean EVERYONE! I think the spirit of the staff brought out the best in us- we were saying √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≥ola√à√\u2020\u2022?to just about everybody from Day 1 (and we don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ do that around here). Since our return a week ago, we have recommended this resort to everyone we know. Muchas gracias por un trabajo bien hecho! NJ from NJ ","annotations":[]}
