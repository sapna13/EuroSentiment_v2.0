{"text":"The good, the bad and the ugly This was our 2nd time at this resort. Last year, we had to cut our time short due to a family tragedy.The good:The grounds are absolutely beautiful. Pictures don't justify it!The rooms are very nice, clean and are decorated tastefully.The food served in the restaurants was extremely good.Forget the a-la-cartes unless you like waiting.The staff overall were hard working people who seemed to do their utmost best.The beach is drop-dead gorgeous.The bad:They put us in a room which was geographically the furthest from the lobby or the beach. When we opened our door, we would see the main road as well as a big construction project less than 200' from our room. The construction noise started at sunrise, including jackhammers, earthmovers, bulldozers, hammers, etc.They would not give us another room. Between the traffic and the construction, there was an enormous amount of noise, which, is exactly what we wanted to get away from in the first place.Hearing buses and transport trucks rumble past the room at 6 am isn't what a resort is about.The beach, although gorgeous, has some drawbacks. There didn't seem to be enough chairs. The people seem to reserve their seats by throwing a towel on them the night before and not showing up until the following afternoon. This means all the nice, shady spots are taken and you're left with baking in the hot sun on the sand.The little bar fridge in your room? You might as well ignore it. It was empty save a Fanta bottle on our arrival. It wasn't restocked until the day before our departure, despite 4 complaints to the front desk.As I indicated previously, this was our second stay. The first time we had a family tragedy and the phone in the room didn't work. That was extremely frustrating because we had to use a phone in the lobby to arrange our flight home.This time, again, the phone didn't work. This meant no wake up service for our excursion.The ugly:I got fed up with not being able to find a beach chair. We sat in the hot sun for 4 hours looking at 2 chairs in the shade wearing nothing but a towel to reserve them.I decided enough was enough. We moved our stuff to the 2 chairs.An hour later a middle-aged German couple showed up to berate us. They certainly thought we were in the wrong and thought what we did was inexcusable. This sort of nonsense with the chairs will lead to a fistfight on the beach some day unless they stop this reserve nonsense.
