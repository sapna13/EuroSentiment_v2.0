{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover ? Fairmont Copley Plaza*******************My wife and I stayed at the Plaza during the last weeks of May.Externally impressive with its imposing fa√ã√©?ade and location within Copley square, the hotel is worthy of its status as an American Heritage property.The gilded hallway leading to reception also gave the feel of quality, however at check in it became obvious that we could have been staying in any old city hotel.As we approached the desk the young receptionist switched to autopilot and autocue and asked her obligatory list of Yes \/ No book-in questions; unfortunately by now we gained the impression that we were no longer special, despite $600 per night.Our room was large and located on an upper floor with a view over the square. The room was clean, tidy and well serviced but lacked character.( I suppose like most hotel rooms but not what you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° expect here). The decoration although fresh had a distinctly DIY finish, particularly in the marble bathroom.The walk in corner wardrobe was a joke, and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° expect even the great Houdini would have had difficulty getting in and out of it successfully.The Oak room restaurant served up a decent breakfast and dinner - at a price. The Oak room bar certainly had lots of character and came to life in the evenings - this helped to relieve the general staid and lacklustre feel to the hotel.Despite our gripes which may sound a bit petty, we enjoyed our stay in the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√\u2020rand old dame√à√\u2020\u2022? but would we stay again √à√\u2020\u2022?No - We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe stayed in better.Would we stay in Boston √à√\u2020\u2022?YES - What a tremendous city.
