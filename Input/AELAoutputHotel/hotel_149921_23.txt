{"text":"Loved the Hilton Caribe My husband and I just got back from staying at the Hilton Caribe for 6 days. After reading the reviews before we left, as we always do, once again, the people's comments were ridiculous! The Hilton Caribe is a top-notch hotel and resort. We always were greeted with a smile and a hello from all the workers, as well as had great service the entire stay. The thing that threw us is that people complained about a missing tile here, or a spot of mildew there. The fact of the matter is the hotel is 100% open to the outdoors, and seeing as though it is surrounded by water, what do you expect? The grounds are immaculate and being worked on daily. The pools are really nice, as is the beach.We do a long vacation once a year, and chose the Caribe because we had Hilton Honor points we wanted to use....we travel. Yes it is pricey, but its vacation. If you want it to be inexpensive (meals, etc) stay home and cook, or better yet, go to Vegas and stay off the strip and try to find the covetted $9.99 buffet ! This is a tourist destination, people! The food was excellent, as well as the room. The beds are some of the most comfortable we've ever had, especially out of the states. All in all, the Hilton does it right at the Caribe. I highly recommend it. If you are going in trying to pick apart the place, you should go and stay in a penthouse in downtown New York or LA. Get over it! ","annotations":[]}
