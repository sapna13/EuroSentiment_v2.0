{"text":"Beyond Excellence!! I don't have adequate words to describe this outstanding place!! My husband and I went to EPC from 10\/31\/08 - 11\/05\/08 for our 17th wedding anniversary. We could not have been more pleased!! This place is heaven on earth!!! We just sat in awe of how beautiful this entire place is. The beach is beyond beautiful. The sand is as soft as powder and the water is just so relaxing to sit and watch. It is very rough, please don't be fooled by its beauty. We frequently go to the Jersey shore so I thought nothing of the reviews of how rough the sea was, until I got in. Wow, it knocked me over without any warning. Be careful. Enjoy the shallow water and watch your back. The waves change without any warning. This did not in any way change our thoughts on this marvolous place!! We could not have chosen a better place to vacation. The people that work here are the nicest people on the planet!! They are always smiling and ready to meet your every wish. We stayed in an Excellence Club junior suite garden view. We were more than happy with our room. Robert  Carlos, from the Excellence Club went out of their way to make our stay as perfect as possible!! Thank you both for an outstanding vacation!! The upgrade to the Excellence Club is worth every penny. They are at your beck and call whenever you need them. The service from everyone was outstanding!! The food choices are more than expected. If you cannot find something you like, I would be suprised! I asked my husband about our 3rd day there if he was suprised that I hadn't complained about anything yet? (I'm known to be a bit picky) I could not find one thing to complain about!! We read all the reviews before we left and were a little worried. Don't be!!!! I can say without hesitation that this is the best vacation we've ever had!! My only regret is that our stay was not longer!! The Excellence Punt Cana is a place you must experience for yourself!! Words cannot do justice to such a magistical place!! Go and enjoy!!!!!! We cannot wait to go back!!! To say we loved it is an understatement!!!!!
