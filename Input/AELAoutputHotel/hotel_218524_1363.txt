{"text":"Valentine's Day getaway Hi to all!Secrets is a great place to go to get away from it all!! The resort was clean and well organized. The beach was unending and beautiful! There were numerous activities going on all day, everyday! We happened to be there during the Olympics, so my hubby engaged in the Olympics contests on the beach!!! It was a blast! The staff are very friendly and the entertainment staff go above and beyond to make everyone feel welcome!! The food was great! The German Chef does an excellent job running all of the restaurants!! The lines tend to get long for the dinner times, but the buzzers to let you know your table is ready was kind of cool! The nightly entertainment was hilarious and wonderful!! To the man who was blind that sang on Karoake night: You sang absolutely wonderful and made me cry!!! You should make an album!!! If you ever do, let me know: I would buy it!! :o) The resort was clean and offered lots of options for activities. Have extra money in your pockets if you go on the horseback ride. They sell a souvinier bottle of rum at the end of the ride with your pic on it. They wanted $15, but all we had was a $10. They took it. The drive on the van was a bit long to get there, but it went fast as I talked the ear off the driver!! :o) Never left the resort, so I can't tell you what else there is around. I vegged on the beach the whole week. The pizza they bring around at lunch time was really good!! Enjoy the resort!! They bring local sellers to the resort. I bought a necklace\/earrings combo for my daughter. They wanted $95 for the set. I paid only $5. Be willling to start low and don't feel guilty!! The same stuff was for sale in the gift store at the airport for hardly anything. ","annotations":[]}
