{"text":"Good Clean Affordable Accomodation We stayed here in May 2008 based on the reviews on here! We weren't dissapointed. Just to be clear upfront - this is not a luxury hotel by any means, but for the price and location you couldn't ask for much more. The rooms were clean and had fridge and microwave which was a bonus. The shower was hot and the pressure good. What really set this apart though was the customer service we received from Varsa at the front desk. She couldn't have been more helpful, whipping out a map of the city of San Fran as soon as we checked in, circling all the best places to go, and highlighting the areas to avoid. We parked the car in their free car park (which we didn't find too tight or small contrary to other reviews on here, though we could understand how some may have found it a little tight in places). The car wasn't needed for our stay though as the hotel is just a few yards from a main bus route so we got a 3 day MUNI pass and used the frequent buses and trams during our stay. Breakfast is literally some baskets of pre-packaged Danishes Pastries and Nutrigrain bars, with Coffee and Orange Juice available. Nothing glamorous but adequate if you just want to grab a bite on your way out! There are also many eateries within a stones throw of the hotel (we recommend 'Polkers').The hotel is not going to be for everyone, particularly those who want or need to maybe spend a lot of time in their hotel room, but if you are looking for affordable, clean and safe accomodation in San Francisco, then this would be a good choice to make.
