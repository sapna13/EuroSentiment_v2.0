{"text":"Well worth the money My wife and I stayed at the Ilikai from the fifth of June through the twelfth. We were both impressed by the courteous staff, the overall appearance of the hotel, and the on-site Expedia desk, which we used to plan our daily adventures. Our room was very comfortable and rather roomy for Wakiki standards. The walk to the lagoon and farther on to the beach was pleasant and never a burden. The overall location of the hotel was fabulous. We both enjoy walking so we were right at home. Ala Moana shopping center was about ten minutes away as was the International Marketplace and its surrounding shops and other venues. There are also many restaurants less than five minutes' walk (The Charthouse, Outback, Red Lobster etc...) so don't be scared off by the location at all.As has been noted here, the hotel is undergoing renovations, which really makes me want to return upon their completion. The elevators are very slow, which can be annoying and inconvenient, but allow enough time and expect the delays. The few times you won't have to wait will be pleasant surprises! Other peeves we had included the $35 per day maid service tacked on if you actually want new linens or the floors vacumed or swept, and the inner courtyard was cordened off for almost the entire week we stayed at the Ilikai.One note of caution: if you use the Expedia desk, don't fall for the no pressure and respectful time share pitch to save $100 off of your excursions' bill. The so-called real estate agents are pushy, somewhat abrasive, and definitely don't take no for an answer. Basically, they expect you to make a $40,000 decision on the spot after a two-hour presentation.Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay at the Ilikai. We Priceline(d) it ( for approximately half of the listed price on the Internet) and saved a lot of money without sacrificing anything.
