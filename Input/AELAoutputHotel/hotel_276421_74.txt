{"text":"Will go back tomorrow This is my second trip to Punta Cana and to IFA Villas, my stay Jul 21st to Jul28th 07 was as pleasant as usual very relaxing with some off the resort activities to take care of the boredom some folks have alluded to. My family had a great time although we missed the larger of the three pools that is undergoing renovation.Sure there is construction going on but you get used to it and it does not bother anyone, the hotel provided music to damper any noise that might annoy the guests, the most you will hear is a few hammers doing their thing, you got to be a winger to complain about this?Some of us should book trips to Florida because the last time I looked Punta Cana is in the Dominican Republic and their native language is Spanish and we are visiting a sorveign country. During my stay I encountered many members of staff that spoke English and even embrassed my wife who was trying to tell the waiter her order in butchered Spanish when he delightfully told her he spoke English.During my stay I noticed that tipping went a long way, the second day I tipped the cleaning lady $10.00 my room was always in tip top condition extra towels and the fridge always stocked with extra sodas and water even bottles of beer left on top of the fridge.These folks work 12 days straight 12 to 16 hour days and get 3 days off,most of them live in Santo Domingo which is 4 hours away by bus. On the topic of Santo Domingo I took the one day tour into this beautiful city organised by Pierto Tours we drove through two major towns of Higuey and La Romana saw how the locals live then to the cave of the 3 eyes ,a cave that have 3 fresh water lakes at the bottom of coral entrenched walls. Then on to the residence of Christoper Columbus, walk the halls of this great man and see his bedroom. a tour of the first Cathedral of the Americas. What a sight this was! Lunch provided at a posh resaurant by the harbor.Please be aware that when shopping in down town Santo Domingo have your bargaining hat on do not buy at the first price it gets cheaper when you are leaving to go home on the bus.Do the party boat run by Kontiki Tours they take you out off the shore of Punta Cana and you have a great time dancing to the sounds of Regge and meregue then off to snorkeling.Captain your own two man speed boat down the entire coastline of Punta Cana taking in all the resorts along the way and then off to snorkeling this is run by Aquatic Tours\/ Bavaro Splash.The food at the Resort was plentiful and delicious also the food at the Japanese and the Mexican was excellent but you must make reservations at guest services and what's the problem with wearing a pair of slacks or jeans?The nighty entertainment and disco was great and it was something to look forward to at night I spoke to one of my friends who was staying at a more fancy resort and he said he did not have nightly entertainment and his resort was too crowded.Pack your bags and visit this resort.
