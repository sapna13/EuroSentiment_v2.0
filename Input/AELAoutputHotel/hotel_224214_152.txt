{"text":"Beautiful View at Bryant Park Hotel We stayed at the Bryant Park Hotel one night in March and paid an online rate of $289 ($334, including taxes). Our deluxe queen with a park view reservation was complimentarily upgraded to a suite with a park view on the 10th floor. The view was great -- all of Bryant Park and the NYC Public Library on one side, highrises on the other. The doormen, bellstaff, and front desk were all friendly, professional, and very courteous. The clientele all appeared to be stylish -- we noticed people of varying ages, including mother\/daughter tourists and businessmen who seemed to be in creative sectors. There was a large club crowd the Saturday night we stayed (for their basement bar The Cellar)-- and the noise level, with some wee hour honking, was noticeable, even on a high floor. This hotel is not recommended for someone sensitive to street noise. The room was lovely. We had difficulty finding a hotel without the ornate, baroque, overdecorated, Gilded Age that seems to be the signature style for most luxury New York City hotels. We also didn't want the Middle American bland, standardized Hyatt\/Marriott\/Hilton style. Some of the downtown hip hotels seemed to try too hard to be stylish and that can be taxing. Bryant Park Hotel has a very relaxed, clean, contemporary style -- with hardwood floors, beautiful lighting, very comfortable beds, travertine marble bath, with a deep soaking tub and separate shower. Some of the hardwood flooring was warped in places, but it was not that noticeable. They had a selection of relaxing music, an honor bar refrigerator stocked with drinks and snacks. Not inexpensive but not outrageously priced either. Great for the convenience. 24-hour room service that we didn't try because we wanted to dine out, but the menu was nice and reasonably priced. Highly recommend this hotel for its target market share -- people who love clean, simple, contemporary styling in a midtown setting. We enjoyed every minute there, even the slightly noisy night as we like urban soundscapes.
