{"text":"The VIP Experience The Covent Garden Hotel is an object lesson in the renovation of an old building (in this case a former hospital) into a luxurious, modern boutique-hotel. Part of the success here is explained by the meticulous attention that has been paid to the detail: only genuine, high-quality materials have been used throughout; there is nothing ersatz √à√\u2020\u2022?no fake marble columns made of plastic or anything tasteless or tacky. The rooms are sumptuously decorated and kitted out with a winning combination of antique furniture and mod cons (flat screen TVs, DVD players, fast Internet connection...). Bathrooms are designed in granite and are plush deluxe. In short, what you have here is the best of the old and the modern combined into one very elegant whole.If the accommodation is good, then the service is outstandingly good. The staff are young and enthusiastic, nothing seems too much trouble for them and as other reviewers have remarked, they remember your likes and dislikes from previous visits √à√\u2020\u2022?they are so good at this it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ scary! The rooms are kept in impeccable order: bed linen and towels are changed every day, and when you return after going out at night you find that the maids have visited again to turn down the bed, turn on the bedside-lights and the radio to the channel of your choice. The service here is the best I have experienced at any hotel in the UKYou can also eat very well without leaving the building. The hotel restaurant, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022¬ßrasserie Max√à√\u2020\u2022? is a fine restaurant in its own right. It is probably best in the morning, when it serves a wide range of breakfast dishes, from traditional English to continental to vegetarian to vegan √à√\u2020\u2022?there is even a Champagne option if you are in the mood. At nighttime, though, Brasserie Max is up against very stiff competition (Covent Garden is London√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ restaurant and theatre land), and, to be honest, you could eat better elsewhere in the locality for the price. I would particularly recommend Incognico (sic), which is just round the corner in Shaftsbury Avenue and within easy walking distance. In summary, this is a luxurious boutique-hotel located right in the heart of the most entertaining part of London, offering outstanding service, superb accommodation and good food. Not surprisingly, this comes with a certain price tag. The least expensive room starts at √ä√£¬¢235 and by the time you add on tax and breakfast this bumps up to a hefty √ä√£¬¢300 ($600) per night. Clearly this is a hotel for people of means and this is indeed evidenced by the clientele (think of celebrities and their associates, media folk, international businessmen, wealthy American tourists√à√\u2020\u2022?you get the picture). If you can afford it, though, you are in for a real treat.
