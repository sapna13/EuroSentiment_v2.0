{"text":"Good not great We just got back from a trip to Excellence over the new year's week.While the place is nice, it was not quite up to billing in my opinion.Rooms (we stayed in building 10 which is part of the club): The rooms are nice, rather large with a jacuzzi tub in each one. However, the fridge did not get cold at all. The exhaust fan in the bathroom screeched a high pitched wail when we turned it on. Maid Service was very spotty I had to call the concierge at the club to get them to come one day as it was after 5:30 and no service had occurred. We also had to request new washcloths as they had taken them from the room without replacing them.Food: the food ranged from good (not great) to awful (the lobster room) unfortunately the French restaurant that everyone raves about was not open any night we were there (6 nights). The service in the restaurants was slow at best. The food in the club was hit or miss. We did enjoy the grill on the beach, in fact they may have been my favorite meals.Property overall was very clean and well kept (other than the bathrooms in general areas) the pools are nice and they keep the beach very clean as well. As reported many times here the towels are scarce get out early to have a chance to get any. People generally have their space reserved by 8:00. The staff is all very friendly and outgoing. I believe that they only teach them a few phrases in English Excellente My pleasure Salute are the ones you hear the most. The problem there is they don't always understand what you want and tell you my pleasure and then do nothing. Overall I believe that they would like to provide excellent service, they just don't know what it is.We had no issues with mosquitoes so that was a plus.The shows overall were not good. They did have an unintentional comedy factor which was the only saving grace.The casino is very small and the tables are just plain old and junky. If you would like to do excursions or book time at the spa do so early as the time slots fill up quickly.Overall, we had a good time at a nice resort. It just could be so much better without some of the quirky things.
