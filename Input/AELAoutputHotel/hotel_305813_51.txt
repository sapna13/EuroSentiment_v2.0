{"text":"Simply excellent They don't come much better than this. Efficient and friendly staff, stylish interior and excellent facilities - what's not to like? We stayed two nights and loved every minute of it. For a first visit to Hong Kong, it was a great choice that made us enjoy the town all the more. I would have no hesitation in booking this hotel again or in recommending it to friends.There were nice little touches from the minute we arrived at the hotel transfer desk at the airport to when we left again that put this hotel way ahead. How about an offer of something to drink and a refreshment pack when you've just come off a plane and can't wait to hit that shower? Or booking your restaurant, pre-empting all your questions about how best to get there and writing it all down for you in Chinese for the taxi before you can even begin to ask for it? Or checking your name from the room record rather than have you try to spell it out every time? In my book, it all comes down to thinking, caring staff that are doing their job properly. Full marks for that, and how I wish others would learn...Our room was on the smaller side but held our suitcases and two people without any problem, and still left us more than sufficient space to move around, work and relax. The one odd feature was the bathroom, fully exposed behind a large pane of glass. Fortunately, you could pull a shade on it. The hotel had warned that there might be trouble with the in-room WiFi system due to some works, but we experienced no problems with this. You may, instead, sometimes lose satellite TV input, but that was for brief moments and seemed to be due to weather (approaching typhoon).We only tried out the hotel's breakfast and the bar, both very good, but there are also several restaurants around if you don't feel like venturing out. There is abundant shopping and lots of restaurant options in the adjoining streets, however, and we found that the concierge makes good recommendations on these, too.
