{"text":"A Great Week We were fortunate enough to visit the Grand Palladium Bavaro from November 16-23, 2007. We are in our early 40's, no kids, and have travelled quite extensively through Mexico and the Caribbean. As many others have given quite a lot of information regarding the size of the resort (huge), the food (very good) and rooms (spacious and well kept), I will not repeat their reviews. Instead I will try and touch on a few topics that I had trouble finding information on prior to our visit.The gym - I am a fitness fanatic and a decent facility is fairly important to me. The gym here is pretty basic. I found it to be surprisingly small given the number of guests at the resort. There are 2 treadmills, one cross-trainer and two stationary bikes. There are also free weights and a few machines. Its a small area that is also part of the spa. Internet access - the only spot for internet access (aside from the top end suites) is located within the Palace shops. It was not open all the time and had only a few computers. I believe during high season there is also access to the internet in the sports bar which is located in the Bavaro section. Shopping - if you are used to travelling in Mexico or elsewhere in the Caribbean, you will quickly note that the DR is nowhere near as commercial. Frankly, I found this to be very refreshing as the sight of McDonalds and Kentucky Fried Chicken just seems wrong in the islands. There is a small town down the beach with vendors, they are quite insistent that you look at their stalls, but nothing a simple no gracias couldn't fix. We really didn't spend more than an hour or so there.When we were at the resort the guests were approximately 75% Spanish, 15% German\/Dutch\/French, and the remainder were North American. I found that almost everyone there, both employee and guest, could speak a little bit of English. The language issue didn't present any major problems for us while we were there. Not exactly sure why, and perhaps it had more to do with our particular week than anything else, but I did note a definite lack of the American party culture - no drunken antics by the swim-up bar etc. that we've noticed elsewhere on our travels. Everyone seemed to be more in relax mode than anything else.All in all, it was a great week overall. I would most definitely consider returning to this resort.Should you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.
