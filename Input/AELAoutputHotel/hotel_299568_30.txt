{"text":"Good for family holiday We stayed at the Novotel Family Suite, which is located at the beach side of the hotel. The Family Suite consists of a master bedroom with bath for the parents, a living room, and a children's bedroom with a bunk bed and its own shower\/toilet. Both the master bedroom and the living room have LCD TVs, and there is another TV in the children\/s bedroom for the PS2 player. This certainly minimizes incidents of kids fighting over the TV ! The master bath have both bathtub and a shower room. There is a small patio at the front of the room with an outdoor shower. The beach is adequate, with white sands and clear water, although there was an abundance of algae (cleared by the hotel staff every morning) and some plastic debris floating in the water. Water sport enthusiasts will love the proximity of operators directly on the beach, but it could be quite noisy. However, there is a roped in area on the water to keep jet skis away from swimmers. The buffet breakfast offering is of sufficient variety and quantity, although rather bland. Room service meals are better although not extraordinary. They also have a kids clubs which organizes different activities, including involving the kids in a Balinese dancing performance, and it is quite useful to keep the kids from being bored after their day on the beach. All in all, a decent value for Rp. 1.530.000, including breakfast and return airport transfers. Our one complaint involved the restaurant staff trying to charge us for an extra breakfast while we were originally told that all 5 occupants of the room would have access to the breakfast buffet. However, the charge was waived by the front office staff when we checked out.
