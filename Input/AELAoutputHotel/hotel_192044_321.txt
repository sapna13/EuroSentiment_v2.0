{"text":"Wonderful Hotel, Great Staff Decided to stay here after reading the reviews and I was very happy with my choice. The rooms were clean, a bit small but cozy nonetheless. We actually had a glitch with our room regarding our air conditioning unit which really wasn't cooling our room whatsoever. So we called the front desk and they promptly sent one of their colleagues to check. A young man examined the unit and concluded that even though the unit was blowing cold air, it doesn't seem to do anything to the room temperature. The hotel moved us to another room with better air conditioning and has been smooth sailing till we checked out. Breakfast was great with a variety of cereal, fruit juices, bangers, eggs, grilled tomatoes and pastries. But if you want an alternative, there are places in the immediate area to choose from like a peruvian restuarant down the street. Need water or snacks? There's a 24 hours store (Boden (sp?) that's very close. (Make a left from the hotel and make another left on Borough High st)Tip #1: Bring a travel clock. The only clock in the room is on the plasma tv and its rather small if you want to check the time. Tip #2: If you just want to briefly drop a short email to friends or family, bypass the hotel's internet service as its rather expensive (√ä√£¬¢10 for the day). There is an internet cafe on Borough High St .heading towards Duke Hill St. Its a √ä√£¬¢1 for 30 minutes.
