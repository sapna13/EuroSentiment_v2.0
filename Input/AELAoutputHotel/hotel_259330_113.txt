{"text":"Wasn't all that great, not a 4 FOUR STAR resort I booked my trip with an agent and of course once you get to the resort thats when you know you are not on a beach front. I stayed at the club. The first night I slept with my balcony door open as it wouldn'd closed. Had to get it fixed three other times. Didn't asked to move as others complained about the rooms in some of the sections so I didn't take the risk. On day 2, I had to get room service give the bathroom a proper cleaning as there was mildew on the shower curtain. I stayed in section 8. The staffs were great, very friendly. There was really nothing that was over the top at this resort. Everything was average or below average. One thing I would love is for this resort to be rated a 2.5 or 3. A 4 star rating is way too high for this resort. One day I waited about 20mins for the trolley to get to the beach. The walk was too much for my son. The food was ok, my son didn't eat much, he didn't like the flavour. The towel service was poor, good thing I bring my own beach towel as they ran out of towels very early in the day. If you want a quiet stay (somewhat) stay at the club, its pretty quiet. All the actionsis at Grand Paradise. I wouldn't go back to Grand Paradise, however I would love to see Santo Domingo so I will be going back to Dominica Republic. Please someone, rate this hotel at 2 .5 or 3 not 4. Its makes me wonder what the other 4 stars on this island are like.
