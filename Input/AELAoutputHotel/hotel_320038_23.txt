{"text":"Nice facility  Over the years my family has had good luck staying at Hampton Inn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂. Hampton Inn and Suits at Crosstown Center was no exception. The staff was extremely helpful, from our shuttle driver at Logan Airport, to the front desk staff who allowed us to check in early and who, upon our checkout, held our bags so we could enjoy a final day of sightseeing. The room we had was a very comfortable studio with a nice kitchenette, spacious bathroom, and living room\/bedroom. The bed was very comfortable and the entire room was clean. The only complaint regarding the room would be the curtains. They would not close and did not have any kind of light blocking. As a result, at night the lights of the city would come in and during the morning, the sun would wake us up. Besides that, the room was wonderful. As far as amenities go, the pool was kind of small and cloudy and seemed as though it needed some cleaning. However, the complimentary breakfast was very nice and well stocked. Another plus was the free internet access (wifi) and the computers and copiers available for complementary use just off of the main lobby.  Located to the side of the lobby is Ground Round, a family style dinner\/sports bar with American food. The staff at the Ground Round was friendly, however they were very slow with placing orders. The food was adequate. Located off of the hotel grounds, just across the street, is a Dunkin Doughnuts and a Quiznos Subs (both were very good options for fast food with friendly staff). As far as location goes, the hotel is located just on the outskirts of town but only about 10 to 20 minutes away from most attractions. To make up for this, the hotel offers free shuttle service to many sites and has the ability to arrange a cab within minutes. The views are not spectacular either. There is a major construction site located right next to the hotel which was noisy in the morning and throughout the day. In addition the hotel is right near Boston Medical Center and you do hear a lot of ambulances, even at night. Finally, if you walk a few blocks away from the hotel, you end up in a kind of seedy area which I would not recommend visiting.Overall, I would recommend the Hampton Inn and Suites at Crosstown Center. If you are on a budget and don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mind being somewhat away from the attractions, than this is the place for you! We really enjoyed it.
