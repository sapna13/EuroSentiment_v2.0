{"text":"Experience of a lifetime Me and my husband got married recently, and shortly after the wedding we had to host another party in Hong Kong for my relatives who couldn't make it to the ceremony in the UK. Our party was hosted in the Peninsula so we had 2 free nights in their suite, but we extended our stay at the hotel by paying extra. We stayed in the normal double room for the first night and the suite for the rest. And I'm glad to say that our stay did not disappoint.Once we arrived at the hotel, we were taken up to our room and all the check in was done there. Free fruit and chocolates were placed in the room, and shortly after arrival we were given a fresh pot of Chinese tea. The room was surprisingly spacious, all the facilities were modern and easy to use, and I loved the TV in the bathroom. Our room was not harbour view (you have to pay extra for it), but it didn't really bother me (well, it was a gift from family so can't really complain!). All rooms in the hotel also had this little cat flap (as we called it) situated in the wardrobe that newspapers are delivered and laundry collected, and we found it quite cute.We had in room breakfast the next morning, portions were sufficient but not as big as I expected. Quality was fine.We had to change rooms on the second day, and despite the difficulty to get the suite early, once that was done, the move was smooth. They picked up everything we left in the room and moved everything for us, which we were grateful for (they even hung up some clothing for us). The nice surprise was that we thought we were going to get a suite with garden view originally, but we discovered instead that we had the most spectacular harbour view - and the suite was absolutely huge! There were some handmade chocolates in the room for us as well. We also got a complimentary champagne breakfast because of the wedding package.Throughout the stay what impressed us the most was the impeccable service. We felt so pampered we really didn't want to go. The only negative point during the stay was the signal 8 typhoon that closed all doors but the trade entrance at the hotel, but obviously that's not the hotel's fault. And despite the fact that it's one of the most expensive hotels in Hong Kong, I still think it's worth it. It was a truly amazing experience.
