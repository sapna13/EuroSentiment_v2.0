{"text":"Should of been called Close Quarters I recently attended a training course with a work colleuge at this hotel, which lasted four days. It was a long four days. When we arrived, we were encouraged by the stylish lobby, and well appointed communal area. When we reached our shared room, however, any excitement we may have had quickly evaporated. The room was clean, and nicely furnished, but very tiny. There were two twin beds that were about two feet apart. We could not open the front door, bathroom door, or closet door at the same time. The bathroom had a door similar to a shower door, which did not have a knob but a magnetic catch, leaving space between the wall and the door. It did not feel very private. Our window looked out into an alley, where we were entertained daily by the homeless folks who liked to feed the pigeons, or engage in some other activities which I will spare you from. Some of the other people attending the course with us, and also staying in the hotel, were not so lucky. More than one person had to change rooms due to insects. One poor girl woke up with bug bites! The meeting room was below the lobby, so below ground. There were no windows, so spending eight hours a day in there was not enjoyable, no matter what material we were covering. The a\/c was very loud, and made hearing our instructor difficult. I did like the location of the hotel, being within walking distance of many tourist attractions. However, I will not be staying there again, nor would I recommend it to anyone. ","annotations":[]}
