{"text":"Great hotel in an ideal location I have just returned from 4 nights at the Library Hotel and absolutely loved it. The hotel is in an excellent position being well connected to subway and bus routes but also within easy walking distance of many major sights and attractions: Empire State (10 mins), Library and Bryant Park (1 min), Grand Central (3 mins), Chrysler Building (5 mins), Times Square (10 mins), Rockefeller Plaza (15 mins). You really feel right in the centre of the action while the hotel itself is welcoming and relaxing.The hotel is beautifully furnished throughout and with great attention to detail. The bedroom was on the smaller side but this was in no way a problem and in any case I was barely in there! Bathroom was lovely and bed extremely comfortable. The 2nd floor reading room is very nice and the 14th floor terrace bar and conservatory are a real bonus as it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a great opportunity to have a drink in the open air. The team of staff were charming and very helpful both before arrival and during my stay.Breakfast was good (pastries, bagels, fruit, cereal, yoghurt etc) and free coffee and pastries were available throughout the day. In the evening on weekdays there is also a complimentary wine and cheese reception in the 2nd floor reading room which is brilliant for unwinding after a long day sight-seeing. I can also recommend the Madison  Vine restaurant on the corner of the hotel; good food and great staff.Overall, the hotel benefits from being smaller than others as there are some great personal touches, quality can remain high throughout and the atmosphere is friendly. As a solo female traveller I was extremely comfortable at the hotel and also staying in that area of the city. I would certainly stay there again on any return trip to the city. Excellent.√à√\u2020\u2022?and New York is fantastic, definitely worth a visit!
