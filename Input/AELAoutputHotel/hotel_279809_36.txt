{"text":"Somewhat disappointed I stayed there recently with my family, 7 of us in 3 separate rooms. Each room had it's own problems, mine was electrical, went to unplug my hair dryer and the entire outlet box fell out of the wall. My sister in law and brother in laws toilet over flowed four times, and when they called the front desk they were grilled about what country they were from and accused of putting too much paper in it. Not knowing that some bathroom tissue is supposed to go in the waste basket, but is no where near the toilet. My nephew and his fiance's room had a ceiling fan being held up by it's wires only. In one of the rooms, the frame to the sliding door leading to the balcony fell off and almost landed on my niece. Each repair took place the next day. The food was Ok, but expected a little better. We were disappointed also in the fact that very few employees seemed to speak even some English.I will say that even though the LTI is a little dated, it is clean, very pretty grounds and has a beautiful beach. We stayed in building 5 with the ocean view but in order to classify them as actual ocean views, some of the palm trees outside the balconies obstruct whatwould be a breath taking view. I would not say that it's not worth the money, it's reasonable, but for an older resort if some much needed repairs were made it would be a wonderful improvement. ","annotations":[]}
