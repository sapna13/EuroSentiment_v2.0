{"text":"Great Getaway! My husband and I just returned from spending one wonderful week at the Riu Palace Macao. I was definitely sceptical after having read all the negative feedback by other travellers, however, don't be swayed by these negative posts. The Macao is a beautiful, clean hotel with the friendliest, most accomodating staff. The hotel and all of its staff are VERY service oriented. The beaches are glorious. One of the more beautiful I have ever seen: clearest blue water and soft white sand!! There are always chairs by the beach and it doesn't matter what time you get there. The pool was great too. Waiters constantly come around to see if you need anything. The food is the only thing that I would say was not amazing. It was OK. There is an abundance of food and many places to eat. During the day, by the beach there were a couple of places to eat as well as by the pool. I just found that everything tasted the same and after a week of eating that food, you just get sick of it. Age of travellers is a good mix. There are older travellers, younger couples and some families with children. The Macao is definitely a place to go if you are looking to relax as there is not much nightlife. We are a younger couple and we honestly didin't care that there there wasn't much to do after dinner. We were wiped from being out in the sun all day.Overall, the hotel is gorgeous, the staff wonderful, the beaches exquisite, and the food mediocre. I would definitely return to the Palace Macao.
