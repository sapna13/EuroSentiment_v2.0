{"text":"An fabulous hotel in a great location Well, after reading a number of the reviews posted here we decided it would be difficult to go wrong by booking our stay at the H10 Montcada - and how right we were !From the minute we got there the staff were helpful and courteous and having read the reviews on room sizes we asked for a large room. All that was available was one on the 2nd floor overlooking the main street, they did say it could be noisy but we elected to have it anyway on the basis that we would harldy be in, and after some Rioja who cares !What a suprise !! The room was lovely, compact, but perfectly adequate, the bathroom was beautiful ( I know that is important to you ladies out there !) and to cap it all - we had a balcony ! Room 201 if you are interested. What a bonus that was, we spent ages out there watching people, traffic, and even a Gay  Lesbian procession marched by. We had breakfasts in the hotel, which were excellent and plentiful but if you dont fancy that there is a great Patisserie across the road and even an Organic supermarket 50m away. On the downside we did book the Cava and Stawberries and would give that a miss next time. The Jacuzzi looks small but adequate and the views from the roof are excellent, a great place for a cocktail or two before dinner.As to location it simply couldnt be better. There is a metro station across the road, plenty of cafes and bars in the two squares nearby and we could walk into the centre in no more than 10 mins. We also took the tour buses as we learnt in New York that they can be an excellent way of getting your bearings, the stop is 100m away. We did the usual sights of La Famillia and the Gaudi buildings and Park - we are now well and truly Gaudied out !All in all a great break and a fabulous city, cant wait to go again soon.
