{"text":"An average hotel I stayed at the Adam's Mark for a conference. The hotel was very convenient because our conference workshops were on the 2nd floor. My opinion of the hotel goes south from there. You had to pay for using their internet service, using the computers, fax, copy machine, printers in the business center. I could not believe that a hotel that proclaims to be top notch would charge for such services, which are usually complimentary at even 3 star hotels. The rooms were spacious but the shower was terrible (at the breakfast meeting, I also found out I was not the only one that was having issues with the shower). The shower was very, very slow to drain and if you turned the handle too far to the left for hot water, the shower would make a loud vibrating noise. Evidently, I was not the only one having issues because I heard the same loud vibration from a room down the hall. The elevators were a rough ride and did not look well maintained to say the least but I was able to make it to my destination. The hotel staff and concierge were very, very friendly but I expect more than just a friendly staff at hotel that proclaims to be 4\/5 stars. Also, there was not a refrigerator or microwave in the room. Unbelievable... My company happened to pay for the week that I stayed in the hotel but I also like to stay in nice places when I go different places and knowing what I know now, I would not spend MY money on this Adam's Mark or any other for that matter. I think you pay a lot of money for much of nothing. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1337,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1333}]}
