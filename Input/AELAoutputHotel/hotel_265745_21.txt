{"text":"affordable near the airport This was my second stay at the Ibis Sydney Hotel. I really cant complain much other than it is a simple, non flashy, No Wow!, average little place very close to the airport. If you need a place to stay for a night or a layover this is perfect. I would not stay here for a vacation as there is really nothing going on in the area.The shuttle bus at the airport is complimentary but you will have to wait 30-40 minutes. The shuttle back to the airport is $ 5.00 per person and you will have to make arrangements in advance as it does get full during peak times. you dont want to wait for the 2nd or 3rd bus to come along.The reception area flows right by the restaurant. It gets very crowded in the hallway waiting to check in or out because of the restaurant and the 2 tiny elevator infront of the desk. The only problems I have with the room is the toilet that does not flush completely. I would have to flush several times before anything dissapears. It is a very basic room with limited amenities. Again just enough for rest before a long flight or to venture elsewhere.The staff is friendly, but the surroundings around the reception makes you feel hurried because of the restuarant, elevators, and small hallway. Each floor has a vending machine to purchase drinks, candy, or chips if you need a snack and not utilize the in house restuarant.Mascot Train Staion is only a 10 minute walk. It well get you into the Darling Harbor, downtown, Circular Quay area within 10 minutes. Very convenient and cost about $9.00 per person.
