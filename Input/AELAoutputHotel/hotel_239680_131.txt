{"text":"Truly spectacular!! My son and I spent two weeks in Europe druing May 2007 celebrating his 21st birthday. Our first stop was the Elysees Regencia and it could not have been better. While some people have noted that the hotel is pricey, for Paris and for the value of what is received at this hotel, I believe it is an absolute bargain, and I have stayed at fine hotels around the world. The room felt as though it was brand new, everything in perfect condition and completely spotless. The furnishings in the room were very upscale, including beautiful wood floors and lovely furniture. All service in the hotel was at the highest level and very personal. We quickly became known to all of the front desk staff and they were helpful, friendly and wonderful in every way.The hotel is in an older structure but completely restored and modernized so it is the best of both worlds. We overlooked the street through two big beautiful windows and the street is tree lined so we looked onto that which was great.The location is perfect as noted in a number of other reviews, close to many things and close to transportation to things that aren't close.I agree with at least one other review that the shower is odd with the placement of the shower head and I am 6 feet 5 inches so it is probably a bigger issue for me than most, but this is an extremely minor item and in no way would discourage me from staying there again. This is the only hotel I would look into for my next trip to Paris. ","annotations":[]}
