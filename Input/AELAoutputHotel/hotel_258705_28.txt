{"text":"Fantastic stay at the Hotel Commonwealth Our son is a freshman at BU and based on the reviews on Trip Advisor we had tried to stay at the Hotel Commonwealth for his visiting days and drop off but it had always been booked. Finally because we made our reservations very early, we got in for Parents Weekend. What a pleasure! It was certainly worth the wait.We booked one of the larger rooms looking out on Commonwealth Avenue. It was perfect - it was very spacious and there were two distinct areas. One had a very comfortable king bed with large flat screen TV with a DVD built in. Near the windows was a nice sitting area with another flat screen\/DVD combo TV. There was plenty of room for us to request a rollaway for our son to stay with us which was an extra bonus. We never felt cramped even with the rollaway. They had all the tech amenities - free wireless Internet and the phones had LCD screens for info and were cordless. The bathroom was large and a separate room for the toilet which was nice. The soaps and shower gel was very high quality and smelled delicious.The Eastern Standard restaurant is attached through a hallway. It is a separate building and the food was excellent, much better than the usual hotel food. This may be due to the fact it has its own entrance on the street and seems to have a lot of local business. It has a pub like atmosphere and specializes in fresh seafood. We returned for lunch twice and loved it, but when we tried to go late on Friday night it was too noisy for us because of the busy bar scene.Every member of the hotel staff was excellent. BU Parents weekend coincided with the Head of the Charles regatta and the Hotel was the official hotel for the race. The front desk called our room to make sure we knew that they were operating a complimentary shuttle to the regatta and that there was a hospitality tent for hotel guests. It was wonderful - they had a clean, luxury van waiting to drive us to the race. When we got there we couldn't believe the tent and food - it looked like a wedding! White linen tablecloths and fresh flowers on the tables, a buffet for breakfast that included fresh crepes, followed by a lunch buffet of stuffed crab, pumpkin risotto, shepherds pie, deserts. There was even hot chocolate with homemade marshmallows. All the food was catered from the Eastern Standard restaurant and each guest received a goodie bag to take home with a jar of the restaurant's special spice mix. This was all complimentary. The tent was right on the bank of the Charles River near the finish line so it was a wonderful location to watch the regatta.We really loved this hotel. Every detail is well thought out. As an example, we were constantly amazed that despite the fact the hotel was full, every time we pushed the button for the elevator the doors opened immediately. When we called for the rollaway bed it came almost instantly. We have stayed in several hotels in Boston within the past year - the Westin and Marriott in Copley Square and the Marriott in Cambridge and this is definitely our first choice for a hotel in Boston. It didn't cost any more than the other hotels and we left feeling it was money well spent. We can't wait to return.
