{"text":"Good hotel and location Great clean hotel with large rooms (we had 2 twin rooms and a double) The double was the smallest -- the bathroom was anyway.Clean bathroom with bath and also a bidet. Room had auto switch off lights when you took the key card out when leaving etc. Beware the mini fridge - it automatically charges your room if you take anything out (has sensors under the items). You still get charged even if you put the item back !! (though the charge was refunded at checkout). Staff were OK and the location is great - at the top end of Gran Via. It took us about 10mins to walk down to the main street. There's a lot of eating places nearby also from Tapas bars to Mcdonalds. Attached to the hotel is their sister 4star hotel (this is better known by the taxi's) and you can use some of their facilities. There is a 24hr cafe onsite but only serves coffee\/tea,sandwiches and cakes during the night. Overall, a great place to stay and central for most trips (taxi from airport approx. 25euros). NOTE: if your a Sikh (indian) Madrid is not the friendlist of places especailly if you wear a turban. Most locals think your a muslim and are stand offish. Though their was no hassle\/trouble just strange being stared at all the time. Went on a stag weekend and can recommend the Kapitol club -- 7 floors with different music on each and a great lounge on the roof.
