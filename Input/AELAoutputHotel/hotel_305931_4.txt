{"text":"The Best Kept Secret in Hong Kong We (my wife and adult son) have stayed in this property on two occassions for one week on each stay. Both stays were in the trade fair peak season and as expected, the rates weren't exactly cheap anywhere in Hong Kong.On our first stay, we took an Executive Studio which is basically two standard rooms with a sliding glass divider in between. Our son slept on the pull-out sofa bed which was comfortable enough for a 120 kg heavy weight. We were on the 22nd floor and had a refreshing view of Happy Valley thru the large picture windows. The decor and amenities of the Executive Studio is on a par with the more expensive Park Lane and Excelsior in Causeway and it's only five minutes longer in walking distance to MTR station and the centre of Causeway Bay.Internet wi-fi access (we didn't find an ethenet socket in the room) was complimentary in the Executive Studio but it's only good for one laptop. Apparently the server records your MAC address on first log-in and the same log-in could not be used for a second lap top and we had to purchase a 7-day pass for about A$50 - not that bad by Asian standards for the second laptop.It was nice to be able to enjoy a free quick light breakfast and coffee in the Executive Lounge with a sweeping view of the surrounding area in the morning and free snacks and coctails in the evening.On our second stay, we decided to take two standard room for the same price as one Executive Studio to give our adult son some privacy. We were given two ajoining rooms in the high teens and still had a pleasant outlook. However the decore (tired) and bathroom amenities (very basic) were so different to the Executive Studio that we thought we had booked into a different hotel! Each individual standard room at about 20 sq metres, is also a bit cramped. Nevertheless, the standard rooms were spotless and housekeeping standards were just as high as the Executive Studio. Internet was not free in the standard rooms but the charge was still reasonable at A$50 for 7 days. We missed the Executive Lounge privilages.This is a property under Chinese ownership and management and attracts more Asian guests than say the Excelsior or Park Lane. Nevertheless the Asian (mainly mainland Chinese) guests were polite and well mannered and did not make too much noise like the groups we have encountered in some cheaper hotels on the Kowloon side.The hotel's staff were without exception very helpful , friendly and efficient. Reception staff had a good command of English and the bell boys and housekeepers spoke and understood enough English to do their jobs. The doorman - an unusually small built Sikh gentleman was excellent.There are two small laundries on the side street (hang a right as you exit the main door) which offers same day bag wash for a very reasonable price. The same side street is also a short cut to Time Square and MTR station. While perfectly safe to take the short cut, be prepared for a very crowded experience with locals going to\/from the local wet market and assorted food stores, especially on weekends.We only ate at the Executive Lounge (basic continental breakfast) and the LuLu restaurant in the basement. The LuLu has a reputation as a better Shanghai restaurant among locals. While not cheap, they give you back about 50% of the bill in gift vouchers which can be used for another visit.There is only one bar in the hotel which is the Sky Lounge on the top floor. While offering a sweeping vista of Hong Kong, it is very much a Chingrish hangout - loud live music and smokey. It also has a minimum charge of about 3 beers worth per person - no exceptions even for hotel guests.In summary, this is the cheapest clean and friendly hotel I could find in the Causeway Bay area (well, technically it's on the boundaries of Wan Chai) that offers full service (room service, bell boys, doorman etc). If five more minutes of walking to the MTR and shops doesn't bother you, I would certainly recommend it as good value for money. Off seasons rates are under A$100 for a standard room.BTW Causeway Bay is in my opinion an amazing area. There are shopping opportunities every few steps and the choice of restaurants is endless. If you are attending a trade fair at the Convention Centre, the South Pacific offer a free shuttle. If you have business downtown, the MTR (probably the best in the World) will get you there in 15 minutes.
