{"text":"8 Happy New Brunswickers Punta Cana - Natura Park Beach - Eco Resort  SpaWe were a group of 8 ladies from New Brunswick looking for a relaxing vacation. We found it. We could not have had a better time. We were there March 26-April 2\/07. The resort was very beautiful, very well maintained. You will not find a harder working staff anywhere. The rooms were great, very spacious and very clean. The maids did a great job. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The service was great . If there was a problem of any type it was corrected very promptly. The food was good. The buffet was very nice with so many selections even the most fussy person could find something they could eat. The pasta bar was great. Lots of fresh fruit and many desserts.The breakfast was very good with a smoothie bar and fresh omelets every morning and everything you could ever imagine and more.. The best a la cart was the steak restaurant. The other 2 not so good. The drinks were great and the bartenders were friendly. This is very important as we have found from other not so great trips. We didn't find any language barrier and none of us spoke Spanish. The pool was very nice, well kept and a good size. The beach was the best. The seaweed was raked up every day. Other resort beaches to the right of ours were not raked or looked after at all. Ours was by far the nicest and very well kept. Yes, you have to save a lounge chair early if you want to have a seat and or some shade for the day but there are lots of lounges and quite a few grass huts. There are two small bars right on the beach which was great. Bring your own thermal cup and they will gladly fill it for you. The beach grill was great. We had lunch there every day but one. We read some very bad reviews before we left and were a little concerned but honestly we cannot understand all of the complaints. It is a very relaxing and beautlful place. We would highly recommend it. But...it definately is not a swinging resort for young, party animals. Our ages range was 30ish to 60ish. In fact as a group, the only 2 areas of improvement we could see were the nightly entertainment. They really need some help in this area. And the other was that very seldom was there a bartender at the swim-up bar. However the bar above it was always open but its just a little special to swim up and sit and have a drink on your vacation. Regardless, it was a great vacation.
