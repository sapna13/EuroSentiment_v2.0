{"text":"BEAUTIFUL BEACH BUT THAT'S IT! we stayed in grand occidental (the private hotel portion which gives you your own restaurant and mini pool). the beach was beautiful but that's about it. we were supposed to have great service and even better since we were in the exclusive section. this was a lie. my fiance was sick from their undercooked food and they didnt even provide room service. the pool was dirty and the people LAZY.. I wrote a more extensive review on expedia a a year ago but they did not post because it was so negative. i have never had worse service in my life. the wifi was never working the room was dirty, the tv doesnt work well. hidden fees with using a calling card on your phone. terrible mgmt (i waited on line behind others with similar complaints).. WORST OF ALL- i was supposed to get a JR Suite  was emailed photos of the room from the corporation. when i arrived they said there was no such room type and i was given a regular room. the service was jst terrible.. expedia only credited me $200 before i got tired of fighting it. DO NOT STAY HERE-- stay a few resorts away at the paradisus or stay away from here altogether.. there was no nightlife at the hotel aside from a few vendors and a mini concert.. the hotel doesnt even havea money exchange so we had to venture into town where we were followed by 3 dogs (one with a dead cat in its mouth!) and pushy people all over the place!! my suggestion is stear clear ","annotations":[]}
