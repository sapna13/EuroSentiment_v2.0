{"text":"Really nice, but not fantastic We traveled here April 27 - May 4. Our first impression was that it was a nice resort. After being at some 5* and 6*, this is near but definately not at the top. The grounds are definately the most beautiful we have seen. Everything is very well kept and they are always cutting the grass or trimming the trees. The effort shows. Beach: Fantastic fine white sand. The water wasn't the nicest, but we were told that the entire cost is undergoing some strange phenomenon that is making the water less than ideal right now. There is plenty of scenery, if you know what I mean. If you get out there before 10 am or so you should have no problem getting a palapa.Pool: Not great. Big enough, but not very festive. It always seemed a little dirty, and the pool bar isn't very hopping. We were hoping for more pool and poolside activities like other resorts, but there wasn't much of it.Food: After the reviews, we weren't sure what to expect. We were pleasantly suprised. Coming from the Midwest I have had my share of good steaks, so i am a bit picky. The steaks held up nicely. Very tender, and not overly seasoned. I think I had 6 Ribeyes and 2 Fillets on the trip. All were more than acceptable. The Japanese was the best I have ever had. I don't eat fish, but the steak and chicken was fantastic. The Gourmet was good as well, the tenderloin is really good. The Cajun was ok, nothing great. The Steakhouse was good, not great. You should make reservations soon after you get there if you have a group. You can only reserve 3, but daily you can go up to the left of reception between 3-7 and see if there are any openings. Usually they have a bunch at a few restaurants. If you want Mexican or Oriental (at the other Iberostars) you need to reserve more than a day in advance. We tried twice on the same day and they told us the same thing. The Buffet by the pool seems to be better than the one in the lobby, especially for lunch. Alcohol: We expect a few top shelf options, but we were somewhat disappointed. They have Brugal and Barcelo rum, Jim Beam whiskey, el Presidente beer. We ended up taking the bottles of Bohemia from the room fridge and filled a trashcan with ice and beer and headed for the pool. It was ice cold and great, we got a few alright man comments from a few.Rooms: Rooms were acceptable. The bed was comfortable enough and spacious. We were in 1105, it was an ideal spot, close to the pool and lobby. The bathrooms were small, but nice.Make sure you get a safe key, to turn it on, before you leave the front desk, or you will have to make another trip.Grounds: Beautiful. Full of peacocks who aren't afraid to wake you up at any time. Be careful if it is wet. The walk ways are pretty slippery.All in all, it was a great trip and it was our 2nd Iberostar. I would recommend.
