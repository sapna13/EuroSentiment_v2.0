{"text":"Want to Return My husband and I stayed at Iberostar Bavaro Feb 7-14. Our second time staying at an Iberostar-our first time in Punta Cana. From the second we stepped off the plane we noticed the friendliness of the Dominican people.Our check-in at the Bavaro was quick-we were even whisked straight to our room in a golf cart. Our room was close to the beach and restaurants. Being beach people we never made it to the pool but it was beautiful. The beach seating was plentiful and comfortable. It was nice to be able to walk up and down the beach as far as we wanted to go.The food is terrific. A wide variety of everything; I especially love their pastries. We were guaranteed 3 dinner reservations with our 7 night stay. We chose Japanese, Cajun, and the steakhouse. The service was poor at Japanese but the almond chicken was good. The Cajun was our favorite-waiters were prompt and gracious; their food was terrific. Steakhouse was good, also. We ate in the buffet restaurant every morning for breakfast and at night when we didn't have a reservation. Always excellent service there.We attended the night shows and enjoyed them. The Star Friends really put on an entertaining show and work long hours to get there.We went on two excursions-outback safari and deep sea fishing. The safari was a bumpy ride thru the area but we learned a lot about the country, people, and their daily life. Deep sea fishing was another story-windy, rough, huge waves, and a mutual decision to return to land.All in all, we had a wonderful trip and would go back tomorrow if we had the chance!!
