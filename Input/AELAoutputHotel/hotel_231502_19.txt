{"text":"Tryp Apolo: What am I paying for? In a hotel, especially one in a foreign city, one requires very few things: sleep, a shower, and occasionally some help from the front desk staff. At the Tryp Apolo, we received none of these. The hallway, admittedly, is clean and adequate, but the room was not. After a completely sleepless night due to noise and temperature issues, I rose earlier than expected to take a refreshing shower, only to discover that the shower changed temperature approximately every 15 seconds. The soap dispenser (not a bar, but a body\/shampoo soap dispenser) was annoying to operate and made me feel dirtier when I was through. Each time we asked at the front desk for tourism help--including the opening hours and days of certain landmarks--we were given conflicting answers, none of which turned out to be correct. Breakfast was promising, with a good variety of foods. Additionally, the hotel's location makes touring easy, being a few minutes walk from Las Ramblas and virtually next door to a Metro station. However, when we returned to our hotel room, we discovered that our temperature, which we'd spent the first 24 hours adjusting, had been changed although the room was not adequately cleaned. Finally, after paying the exorbitant rate of 22 euros for 24 hours of internet, when it ceased working we went downstairs to ask about how to get it to work. The front desk staff was not only unhelpful, but following a lengthy discussion, which clearly proved they were not listening, we were told that it was an external service and therefore not their problem. The last time I was in Barcelona, I booked a 6 euro per night bed in a 16 bed hostel room, and I had a better experience there. I am very disappointed in the Tryp Apolo, and the location and breakfast do not make up for this appalling experience. Even without a refund, checking out early was the preferable choice.
