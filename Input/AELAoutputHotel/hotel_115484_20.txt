{"text":"Amazing Arcitecture This is the forth and last resort that I stayed in on a long trip from Vegas to Phoenix. It was by far the best. This is a resort frequented by politicians and celebrities, so expect to pay for what you get. I stayed here in the off season so I probably would not afford it during the peak season. There is a fee for parkng (both self and valet). We opted for self (when you do this make sure you don't get lost going to your room at night!) The resort is very large and we were in the back building so we did get lost once.When we checked in, the lobby was beautiful and the staff was very helpfull. I am a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright and could see his influence throughout the resort. The prices in the shops are high (almost 20.00 for sunscreen). So make sure you do not forget anything.The walk back to our room, showed us how lovely the grouds where. The statues were beautiful. When we got to the terrace building the pool was being refurbished. This would have upset me if There were not so many pools and if I was paying for off season.The room was amazing. We asked for two beds but the were all booked (they were refurbishing rooms as well). We instead got a large king bed in a room that fit a roll away for our daughter comfortably. The bathroom was huge! Separate bath and shower with a great showerhead. the minibar was also high priced but I usually eat so much on vacation that I do not need late night snacks.We went to the main pool once. Most of the chairs are taken up by cabanas. It is so hot in Pheonix that the cabanas are popular. The second time we went to the main pool there were no chairs available. It too was undergoing refurbishing and the slide was closed. This is one thing that I wish I knew beforehand for my daughter's sake. We found chairs at the next pool over that was just as nice. There are waiters to order lunch and always cool water on hand to drink (no charge). When it was time to check out you could do it by phone or over the television system. I had a staff member print my boarding passes for me and I knew that I was going to miss this place. The only way to make it better is to take it out of Phoenix and move it to Sedona.
