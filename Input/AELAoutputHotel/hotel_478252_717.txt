{"text":"Relaxed and Feeling Fine We stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe from April 23 - April 30. My husband and I and my parents. We had a nice flight down and when we arrived the Punta Cana airport looked so beautiful. We booked Club Diamond through Sunquest. When we arrived at the airport you are given a number and directed to get on the bus. When we arrived at the Club Diamond bus there was a card with our names on it and my parents name on it, but when we got on the bus everyone was given an envelope (a Club Diamond check in envelope) - we had no envelope with our name on it. I was then asked to show the hotel voucher (which is behind your flight tickets) unfortunately it said Premier . Let this be a warning to all first time travellers - check every detail of your tickets, i had no idea there was a hotel voucher to be checked, i only checked our tickets for accuracy. Well, we were then told to get off the bus, remove our luggage and get on the Premier bus. Even though I explained to the representative from the hotel (she is there to meet you) that it was obviously a typo and that I was positive we booked Club Diamond - we were demanded to leave the bus. To cut the story short, we refused to leave the bus. The hotel representative told us on the bus that we would have to check in to the Premier section and figure it out the next day as we had no Sunquest representative at the property to help us. She sent two other people from the bus company to force us off the bus - we didn't get off the bus. All the way to the hotel we were very upset by our treatment and when we arrived at the Gran Bahia we couldn't even enjoy the welcome that they put out for you - Dominican dancers and a welcome drink. As soon as I got off the bus I saw our Sunquest rep., I immediately went over to him and explained the problem and I demanded to call Canada to speak to a Sunquest rep in Toronto and our travel agent. He calmly said we don't need to call Canada we will look after it from here - he made one call and determined that it was in fact a typo and we had definitely booked Club Diamond. We arrived at 11:00 a.m. and our rooms were not ready until 3:00. I went into the Club Diamond lounge to complain about the rep. on the bus and spoke to her boss who gave each couple a bottle of champagne and fruit platter and an extra a la carte restaurant to eat at. The Restaurants - a la carte - we booked them as soon as we got there - next day - and they were booked, unless you wanted to eat dinner at 9:00 or 9:30 at night. When we did get into a Restaurant at 6:30 the Restaurant was only half full. The best in our view was the Italian and the Mediteranean. We also enjoyed the Beach Barbeque and we ate lunch every day at the Brazilian BBQ. The hamburgers are inedible. The meat is pink and I met a fellow traveller who got sick on the hamburgers. The fruit is always nice and the salad is good as well. We found the property to be very well kept and clean. The rooms are large. The beds were very comfortable. The people are very friendly. The buffet was average. You have to be careful what you choose to eat. The beach is beautiful and we spent our days at the beach and then finished at the Club Diamond Pool Bar - the drinks are plentiful. You do have to save your chairs both at the beach and the pool - they say you are not allowed, but everyone does it and if you don't you won't have a spot. We found the night life - the shows - started too late - 10:30. They should have two shows one for the crowd who gets up early and one show for the people who like to start their evening at 9:30. The shops in the square were great for souveniers. All in all, once we got past our initial first day troubles, we all relaxed and had a great vacation. Since we don't travel that much, I would prefer next time to try somewhere else, perhaps Mexico or Aruba.
