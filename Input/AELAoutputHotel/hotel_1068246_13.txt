{"text":"Elegance or Redundant Colonial? My name is Ariel Rochman and I'm 20 years old. I just arrived after 2 weeks at the Majestic Elegance Hotel, the sister resort of the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. Last year, I spent Christmas and New Years' at the Colonial, so I can give you a comparitive analysis of the resorts. First, when you go to Elegance, you basically get all-access privileges to the Colonial side and its amenities; this is not available to Colonial guests. Hence, we went to Matsuri Chinese Restaurant and the Caribbean restaurant on the Colonial side after we had tried and tested the Elegance restaurant offerings. Further, we utilized both beaches and beach buffets, activities and pools (and obviously the bars). Secondly, their are many attractions that have been consolidated (or combined for less formal wording) such as a brand new discotech in the middle of both resorts. This is a huge improvement from last year, in which the disco was 1\/6 the size. The Spa is solely on the Colonial side and the Casino as well. This is fine as the walk isn't far. But, their are a multitude of differences. ELEGANCE PROS:The quality of food is one-star above on the Elegance side, the drinks offered are more premium, the rooms are more spacious and the bar and room service is much more prompt. The beach is more spaced out and their are beds to lie on (very comfy). The rooms have crazy shower installations and the power is based on motion sensors. Also, the gym is 100x better than the Colonial gym, with new equipment, more space, and more variety of machines.ELEGANCE CONS:For young adults my age, its too quite for my liking. Their are little activities other than Bocce ball and the volleyball courts. Its much more quiet, perhaps to the liking of the older, more mature crowds. The pool is not connected and its not used very often; the resort is still finishing construction (Jan. 2008) so their is still some quirks with the rooms.BUT, the main differentiator with both hotels has to be the personal interactions with the staff and just how far they are willing to go to ensure your satisfied. I was on a first-name basis with all the staff and they knew me very well and very quickly. In my honest opinion, they deserve more pay then they currently get. I'd like to make special recommendations and positive reviews for:Francis-Bartender at the Elegance Lobby BarRoberto- Bartender at the Elegance Lobby BarPedro- Bartender at the Elegance Lobby BarTomas-Bartender at the Elegance Lobby BarErnesto -Bartender at the Elegance Lobby BarBeach front\/Restaurant Staff:Caroline - Beach and French RestaurantBrenda - BeachRonnie - BuffetRobinson - Steakhouse and Beach BuffetBenito- Beach and BuffetFrancesco - Pool side barBeach Staff:Yan-activitiesHenry- Host of the shows, and all-around operations manager (seemed like)Alejandro and Elsa at Gymnasio Jose- Minibar service on Elegance sideGracias e' Feliz Ano Nuevo to everyone!!
