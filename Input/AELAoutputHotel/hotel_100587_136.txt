{"text":"great location, noisy, good eaterie downstairs We were upgraded to a 10th floor king room by Eric over the phone after booking thru Hotwire ( paid $ 125 per nite ), hotel gave it to HotWire for $ 89.... poor quality linens, Dell flat screen so so quality, bathroom needs a rug ( very cold marble floor), and window box style heat\/ac was noisy, and had to be kept on since single pane windows are used, but it masks bigtime traffic noise below, the hotel is on a main street, so easy to walk to many places. The restaurant downstairs on premise had a delicious breakfast, also try nearby Lola's for breakfast\/dinner. Front Desk staff is a bit green, need some customer training, often just stand there looking into space, or more interested in talking with each other than assisting guests. Bellcap was ok, but didn't explain the room's features like the included mini frigerator, or that internet is $ 10 a day with no free areas, or that most everything in the room, candy, etc is spendy, like $ 3.25 for a Snickers bar. All in all, the small room, and very comfy bed ( needs better linens, and using fitted top sheets so they don't come off in the night ), bath shower was good, but hot water wasn't there most of the time even after compaining. We had stayed here when it was the Vance hotel, it's spiffed up, but rates doubled too. It's a cheaper version ( in quality, service, etc ) of the W Hotel chain.
