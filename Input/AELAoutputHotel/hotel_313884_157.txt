{"text":"Loved the Punta Cana Princess Suites  We stayed at this resort from Oct. 19-26th 2007. We absolutely loved this resort. We were in block 5000 and had a great view of the ocean as well as the pool. We had a king size bed with a step down to a small sitting room which in turn walked out on to the balcony. Our room was always clean and the fridge was well stocked. We did the VIP package and would recommend it. Not only did it get you the premium drinks we also got the 20 min massage, small snacks at night that were delivered to our room and a free meal at the Le Cava or the Seafood restaurant as well as some other bonuses. The filet mignon in the Tex Mex was to die for as well as the lobster dinner at the Le Cava. We had heard negative things about the Fondue Restaurant but 6 of us went and it was great.Nelson at the pool bar always makes sure you are looked after as well as Kenya up in the Lobby. The Catamaran\/Speedboat excursion was a great trip. I ran into a problem with my camera but the Manager was great about and even sent a huge fruit basket to our room. We did a lot of tipping but that was because the workers that got the tips were the one who made you want to come back. We also met great people from other cities from Ontario as well as Texas and they also made it a memorable holiday. We will definately put this hotel on our return list. ","annotations":[]}
