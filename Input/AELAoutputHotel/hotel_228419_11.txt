{"text":"Good location, helpful staff My husband stayed at this hotel for a business trip, and our infant daughter and I joined him halfway through the week. We were given a very nice crib and infant bathtub to use for our daughter. We stayed on the executive floor, which had a staffed desk and a lounge with complimentary food and drinks throughout most of the day. The breakfast was excellent, there were sweets in the afternoon and savory treats in the evening. Water, soda, wine, and spirits were frequently available; and it was a relaxing environment. The staff at that desk and at the main front desk of the hotel were all incredibly helpful and friendly. Everyone spoke excellent English, which helped us a lot.I had a broken leg, so was using a wheeled thing to get around. It was very easy, with the entrance on ground level and no stairs, and elevators to access all floors. Definitely an accessible place.The location was very good. The Diagonal tram stopped in front of the hotel, and a few of buses stopped nearby and ran to Pla√ã√©?a de Catalunya, so it was easy to travel. The FC Barcelona stadium and museum and the university are only a short tram ride and walk away. The hotel charges a lot for wi-fi, but there is a copy shop\/internet place a few blocks down Diagnonal that offers computers and internet for 2.95 Euros per half hour.Would stay there again if we could afford it. Perfect for business travel!
