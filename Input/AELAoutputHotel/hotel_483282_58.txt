{"text":"Avoid it by all means (goes for a standard room) Here goes my not-so-good experience with this hotel and I try to save as many of you as I can from the same: Due to a trade fair and great numbers of weekend visitors from Mainland China, when I arrived to HK airport and checked the hotel reservation desk, they could only offer very few hotels with 1 night availability, and Cosmopolitan was the one with 2 nights available (which is a sign already, right?). Well, at least I'd heard the name before and knew roughly where it was, so why not book it. More than 200 USD per night plus all the fees and taxes was a lot but I hoped for some great value. Well, it wasn't to happen this time.BTW the location is ok, not far by foot to Times Square and the MTR, fellow travellers discussed it before. The reception was acting cool (outright rude by Asian standards) yet quick. Nobody showed any interest to help us with the luggage. The tiny room was on the 3rd floor, had frosted windows (the graveyard issue mentioned earlier - Chinese cannot stand the view of their ancestors). I guess a lower floor must be disappointing even at the better side of the hotel, as there is an elevated expressway right in front. (How did they take the pictures without it?) At one day, the bed was shifted and not put back during cleaning, next time, the desk cover ended up on top of the TV set. At least we had the impression that some cleaning took place.Amenities: Wireless internet in the room is considered standard in Asia, while it might not always be free of charge (in Taiwan it usually is). Cosmopolitan charged for a wired connection which rendered my on-site trip planning difficult. During the last night, we had to complain that there were no big towels, so after a while they brought us - two more small towels, big size was out! BTW I was travelling with an Asian friend and they would always open the door for me, but not for him - i don't call this good service but racism. Against their own race, actually. They treated us equal in the respect that we both never saw a smile on their faces. Well no worries, they will not see my face again.
