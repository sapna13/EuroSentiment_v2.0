{"text":"I just had to say something I am writing this review because I just can't believe what some people complain about. For example there's a review in trip advisor complaining about men having to wear pants at the restaurants while women were allowed to wear bathing suits. I witnessed none of this. And as for not being told about a dress code any traveller who reads up on the resort either through travel books or websites will notice that it does mention dress codes for dinner. At the Taino not one single person was in a pair of pants. Casual at best. The servers are awesome and If they know that your party is coming at a certain time, to reserve your table they put glasses on the tables filled with pop until you show up for your meal and immediately fresh drinks are there. As a matter a fact the servers are so good you don't even have the chance to finish a beer or pop before that server is bringing you another cold drink.The rooms were very clean and in perfect working order. The cleaning staff always left little characters made up of towels and flowers for us. We had asked that more pop be left in our fridge and oh my god!!! the fridge was full of pop. One of our rooms did smell a little musty but for goodness sake what do you expect with that much humidity every single day. God people get over yourselves. A trip is what you make of it. Food was a little repetitious in certain areas but there were differences each meal as well. Goodness how many breakfast foods do people think are out there?Entertainment was the best I have experienced in my last three trips. Afternoon bingo is great and we are all still singing ITS BINGO BONGO TIME. I would say definately go to Riu Taino!!As a matter a fact I enjoyed it so much last year I am heading there again next week. ","annotations":[]}
