{"text":"Bishop Lei: great location and value We stayed at the Bishop Lei this week while in Hong Kong. The hotel has a great location, the rooms are very tiny. Try to upgrade to a suite with a harbor view and it will be well worth it (and its not so much more expensive). The upgrade suite is the size of a regular room in most standard hotels. Our view of the Hong Kong skyline was breath taking! It was so wonderful we slept with our curtains wide open. Floor to ceiling windows! It was a delight to come √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢ome√à√\u2020\u2022?to that view after a long day of shopping and touring.The room kind of smelled bad\/musty until you turned on the air-conditioning. You need the room key to turn on the power, so the smell kind of gets you every time you open the door. After a few minutes though, its fine. The bathrooms are a little Spartan but the shower was hot and had good pressure, the bathrooms and towels were very clean. The elevators were extremely slow. The hotel has a free shuttle to Stanley Market and Hong Kong Central District, just as the concierge for the schedule of which days and what times. This is a nice bonus. For some reason the hotel staff tried to discourage us from taking taxis saying it would take 10-20 minutes to get a cab. However, we never had a single problem and always got a cab within minutes.I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends, because as compared to other Hong Kong prices, the Bishop Lei is a steal.
