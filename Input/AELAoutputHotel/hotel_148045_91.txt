{"text":"Tips for El Conquistador My family traveled to the El Conquistador during Easter week. It was our fourth visit to the resort. We have a nine year old and a seventeen year old. We booked a partial ocean view and got a great ocean view room in Las Brisas. First of all, I would recommend renting a car. Self park your car for around $10 a day. Stop at Walgreens in Fajardo and pick up breakfast items. The prices for meals are outrageous. We had breakfast in our room every morning. I would recommend lunch when you can at the little Sweet Corner Cafe near the funicular. We ate lunch there a few times for around $30 for 4 people. You will pay 60-80 at the other places. We traveled off the resort for dinner. There is a Sizzler about 10 minutes away by car in Fajardo off rt. 3. In addition, there are other fast food choices like Wendys and Mcdonalds. We ate one meal at Blossoms for $130. The food and service was average. The room itself was pretty nice. We had trouble with no hot water one morning. The pools and water park were nice. The grounds and views at the resort are outstanding. The resort was crowded since it was Easter break for families. I saw an advertisement(we stayed near the airport on the last night) for Puerto Rico residents for 129 a night. I paid 185 plus taxes. It is better to come here in the summer when it is cheaper and less crowded. I would recommend the hotel if you have never been there. However, I plan to look at another resort for my next vacation.
