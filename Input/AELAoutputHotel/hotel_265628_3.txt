{"text":"Fabulous resort with a twist! This is the second time to this particular hotel and to be honest it offers excellent value for money and fabulous beach location.The first week we enjoyed peace and quiet lazing around the beach and bars. The room was cleaned to an exceptional standard, and a tip to anyone would be a daily tip of a dollar which the room maids will ensure the fridge is topped up with water and beer, and a small tip at the bar now and again ensuring you will be looked after all night. The addition since the last time we visited was the addition of several restaurants including, Oriental, Italian and Steakhouse. Each one offers a good standard of interpretation from the locals. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect Chinese or Japanese chefs cooking Oriental or Italians cooking Italian...because it ain't going to happen, but a good job by the local chefs having a go. The Buffet was a good standard for the Caribbean offering a wide selection of choice.The swimming pool is massive, clean and close to the beach with two pool bars. The standard of the gardens are excellent and the entertainment is ok for couples but children will appreciate it more.Then we came to the second week on the run up the Christmas and it all changed. You may have read some reviews on here and thought hmmm. But if you look again the bad reviews mostly came from Americans...... not Canadian but Americans as they seem to expect something for nothing. Might be an idea to get their heads out of their backsides as there is a world outside the US of A.This is a fabulous resort and highly recommend if you want an adventure through local towns.
