{"text":"Wonderful Hotel with 5* plus emphasis on Customer Service Having booked 11 months in advance with Wes Tyler direct based on reviews from Trip Advisor, I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed.The Hotel exceeded my expectations and quite frankly fail to understand how any one could complain about it. After all who wants to spend any time in your room whilst visiting SF. That said the rooms were sufficiently big enough with a huge walk in closet. A Bed and pillows to just curl up and sleep the night away.The bathrooms were big enough for the purpose.As this was a birthday surprise for my husband there was a bottle of wine and a souvenir gift awaiting us.Nice touch.As I said the personal touches- coffee and cookies in the lobby this was a nice treat to have each morning, popcorn in the bar in the evening,ice machines on each floor. Just little things that go a long way.The free internet access also was great.All of the staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable.I would recommend this hotel to anyone as a must, its so convenient right across from Union Square and the Cable Car stops right outside.I must also say the second part of our trip was a stay in Las Vegas at the Bellagio. Well quite frankly in my own opinion it was terrible! no customer service no personal touches and when asking for advice, unless you were going to tip them big style they couldn't help you.Wes thanks again to you and your stafff for making this charming hotel a gem in San Francisco.
