{"text":"Awesome Place, good deal and great employees Upon arrival to Puerto Rico's International Airport we could see IC San Juan from the plane, it simply looked amaizing. Upon arrival the Bellman simply was polite, made us feel welcome. And upon enterring the Main Lobby, that is were our experience really started. Brenda, agent who assisted was just charming, thou we had to wait for the room as we arrived early. The Concierge's definetely are the best I have ever dealt with, they are simply GREAT. Jossell is quite the star performer, never, ever says no, if you want it, he will see it happens, what a positive attitude. They were able to plan in a blink of an eye all of our dinner reservations as they took their time to really get to know you, they even asked me if there was any dietiry and\/or special need they needed to know before suggesting any Restaurants, now that is professionalism! He gave us options in price ranges, upscale, moderately priced and even a few hidden gems. He offerred options for tours and even adivised of of those tour attractions that we could perhaps do on our own so with Jossell's honesty we saved money as well. Rooms are comfortable, we had a lovely pool view that we could see the ocean partly, next time I'll splurge and pay the extra for an ocean view. Had a minor mishap with the coffee maker, dialed the Concierge and within 5 minutes a new one was delivered and the Concierge, Nestor called back to verify that everything was ok!! The Hotel if a WiFi property and it works fantastic. Maids are incredible, I asked for early turn down and they were right on the ball. Food is great at the beach area but, a little expensive thou. The only draw back, no pool entertainment at all. For a Caribbean Property that I expected latin music tobe play along the beach and as a Resort I expected caribbean games such as doing the limbo but, that never happenned. Upon check out bell captain was requested and was up in the room within a reasonable waiting period. Check out was done by the Concierge, Jossell who really made it difficult for us to depart as he is so professional and corteous and he offerred to even print our boarding passes! I don't know about the other reviews printed here that speak so poorly about IC San Juan but, INTERCONTINENTAL SAN JUAN ROCKS!Thanks for an incredible vacation!Josh ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1328,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1322},{"endOffset":1328,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1322}]}
