{"text":"A privileged location with marvellous hospitality I booked this hotel having studied all of the trip advisor reviews and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ true, it is a fantastic hotel. Everything exceeded our expectations. We arrived by water taxi (95 Euros) from the airport late in the evening and were greeted by name. Our room, 103, an inside room facing the beautiful bar was lovely. I had worried that we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a view, but needlessly so. It was perfect, air conditioning was very effective and the bathroom was lovely.We were warmly greeted the following morning as we stepped out into the luxurious bar\/dining area by Matteo, the incredible owner, who speaks to everyone in their own language √à√\u2020\u2022?amazing. He guided us to a table on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal, with the Rialto Bridge as a beautiful back drop. We felt welcomed and very special. It was our 25th wedding anniversary and it was just wonderful to absorb the sights and sounds of the Grand Canal, so many varied boats. We were served excellent coffee, availed ourselves of the wonderful buffet. Then, Matteo took our order for omelettes √à√\u2020\u2022?or whatever you wished and they were perfect √à√\u2020\u2022?he personally cooked them to order. Matteo then took the time to find out our plans and to assist with suggestions, so friendly, so reassuring, so knowledgeable √à√\u2020\u2022?just great. He recommended and booked a table at L√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©?steria di Santa Marina for our special anniversary meal (excellent with wonderful friendly service).The hotel is very well located, as it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ easy to cross the Grand Canal. After sightseeing we happily returned to the peacefulness of the hotel in the afternoon. After a wonderful meal we sat on the terrace and drank a special bottle of champagne, gazing out at the Rialto Bridge and water √à√\u2020\u2022?special memories to keep forever. Matteo assisted with planning our trip to Burano √à√\u2020\u2022?nothing was too much trouble. Venice is hot and busy in July but this really is an oasis of calm which is wonderful to return to. The terrace is fantastic, watching all types of boats go by from tourists to delivery boats. Indeed, people crammed onto the waterbuses, gazed up longingly at the terrace as we sipped spritz, champagne, whatever. They knew they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° rather have been relaxing where we were! We checked out at 12 but the hotel was pleased to keep our bags and to arrange a water taxi for when we left in the evening. On our return we were warmly welcomed onto the terrace where we enjoyed a spritz before our journey home. It was no problem to them at all √à√\u2020\u2022?they made us feel very welcome, more like friends than paying guestsIn conclusion, wonderful service (such friendly helpful people), sumptuously decorated rooms, fantastic breakfasts, excellent atmosphere and location. Such a wonderful experience √à√\u2020\u2022?it would be very hard to stay anywhere else in Venice after receiving such treatment.
