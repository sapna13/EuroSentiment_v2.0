{"text":"Loved the staff We had the luck to be invited to Puerto Rico for a wedding at the Marriott. We had a problem with getting a room and at 3:45 with no sleep the night before as we had to be at the airport at 4am, I was starting to get upset. Well between Jose and Alfredo the problem was taken care of right now. Our room was a mini suite and we were so comfortable. I never got the name of our maid but we were in rm 1024 and she was great. Our room was spotless every day we came in. She left us extras of anything we needed. What can I say about Alfredo and Jose? Everytime I saw them they called us by name and wanted to make sure we were taken care of. We travel alot and that really impressed my husband and I. Pool was great, ocean was clean and men right there to take care of your needs. I gamble alot and enjoyed the casino, or should I say the casino enjoyed me as i didnt have much luck. Went to el San Juan to gamble and that was not good at all. The planes did not bother our party at all. Salsa music was a great treat. And the wedding they took care of was beautiful. what a great place to get married. We danced by the pool and just had the best of times. My hat is off to Alfredo and his staff. We are already planning our next trip.
