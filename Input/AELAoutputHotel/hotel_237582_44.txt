{"text":"Great stay at Hotel Zandbergen This is a wonderful place to stay in Amsterdam! The hotel manager, Henk, and his staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful, but it was not so much as to be overbearing or intrusive. Each morning, they asked about my plans for the day at the included breakfast, and offered suggestions (even for the days I traveled outside of Amsterdam). Additionally, when I was leaving, I had to depart for the airport before the hotel reception desk opened, and the staff allowed me to check out the night before and arrived early enough that morning to offer me coffee and breakfast before I left.The location was exactly what I was looking for. The hotel is in a quiet, residential area that is across the street from Vondelpark and a ten-minute walk from Concertgebouw and the Van Gogh Museum. The Emmastraat tram stop (line 2) is a half block from the hotel's door.My room was clean and efficient, and although it was on the small side, I didn't spend much time in there so it didn't matter.The only possible downside to this hotel is that the stairs to the rooms are extremely steep and narrow, and there is no elevator. This wasn't a problem for me, and the staff are aware that it could be an issue. When I checked in the staff asked if I had any medical problems that would limit my use of the stairs, because they could try to place me closer to the ground level. They carried my overstuffed luggage to my room for me, despite my protests.I will definitely return to this hotel, and will recommend it to everyone I know who will be visiting Amsterdam.
