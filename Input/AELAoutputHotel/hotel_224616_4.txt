{"text":"Fantastic Place- Very Expensive My sister owns one of the time shares in the Lagoon Tower so she was nice enough to let me and mom stay with her during her vacation with her and her husband. First let me just say that you never need to even leave the hotel area - everything is right there on the grounds. From great food to shopping at Dior! It's all right in the complex. There are 4 towers in the hotel. Our hotel, the Lagoon Tower was a bit back from the beach and was behind a small man made lagoon that you could swim in. There were baby baby fish in the water but they didn't bother you. There are several outside bars to have a drink at with live entertainment! The grounds are beautiful with coy ponds and flamingos. The beach was a short walk away and they were always nice and clean. In the hotel there is a mini store that is stocked with anything you could need. Every morning there were pitchers of ice cold lemon water or a fruity guava drink (boy I miss that) waiting in the lobby. Each floor also has its own washers and dryers. I loved that because I hate to go home with a suitcase of dirty clothes. The balcony was very spacious with a table and chairs. The condo had a kitchen, a livingroom, two bedrooms and 2 baths. The master had a queen size bed and the guest room had 2 twin beds. All very clean. Diamond Head is visible from the Rainbow Tower and from the beach.The grounds had lots of sitting areas, bars, an ice cream palor, a pizzeria, a small diner like restaurant with alcohol and many many many shops. The street that the hotel is on looks like Rodeo Drive if you go down 1\/4 mile. Everything from Gucci to Ferragamo. Planet Hollywood to Cheeseburgers in Paradise. They had it all. There were also cheaper stores for souveniers.We had breakfast and dinner at the Rainbow Lanai restaurant. We sat right next to the coy pond that runs along side of the place. True relaxing paradise! OK now for the things I didn't like. The place is so expensive it is really ridiculous! I paid $15 each DAY for a chair and $30 a DAY for an umbrella to sit by the lagoon! The reason why they said is because the state owns the small part by the lagoon and that it is a public piece of property. I liked the lagoona area better than the pool or the beach because it was quiet and not many people were there so I paid. I also didn't like the fact that their pools are so so small! That place is huge - you think they would have more pool space. (Slightly larger than a person's in ground backyard pool). The pool didn't seem that clean to me either..kind of slimy. However the chairs were free there but too crowded for me. At the end of the stay they charged $280 for parking and room taxes. For 6 days of parking I thought that was a bit much. Also while we were there construction was going on and it woke us up at 6:30am every morning and the view from the room in the back was all construction! Things I think you should see while staying in Oahu.Waikiki BeachHave breakfast at the Outrigger Hotel (short drive away and only $10 a head)Visit the aquarium -the zoo was a waste of timeGo to Diamond HeadEat at the Top of Waikiki Restaurant (it is a revolving restaurant) the food is awesome and well priced.Drive to the North shore where they surfWe rented a car and drove all the way up the coast  around-(beautiful)Go on the Cattamaran at the Outrigger HotelWould I reccommend this place- YES! It is a wonderful place to go if you have the money to spend. To me, Hawaii was in once in a lifetime chance so it was worth every penny spent!If you like check out my photos on Flickr under people.
