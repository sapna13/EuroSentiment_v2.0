{"text":"Wedding Anniversary  Stayed at the Caribe Hilton from April 17-21  LOVED IT! We got room 824 (original bldg)  don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ understand what another reviewer is talking about when they say there is smell  noise from the extractors belonging to the restaurant below. Maybe we were lucky (it was breeze the whole time), but never heard or smell anything  we sat on the balcony multiple times every day, at all hours. Service was great  very friendly. The room was a good size (junior exec rm-1 king bed) very clean  in good condition; the beds, pillows  linens were so fluffy, soft  comfortable. Normal size bathroom, especially compare to most European ones. We stayed on one of the executive floors, worth the extra money. Those floors are elevator key access only, good for extra privacy  security. They also give access to the lounge which has a wonderful buffet type cold breakfast, in the late afternoon-early night they have free appetizers  drink for half of what the hotel bars charge, during the day they have free sodas, water, cookies, fruit, nuts, etc. Didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ try any of the restaurant, but the menus looked VERY pricey√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®?The pools  grounds (not as expansive as when I was a child) still wonderful. The small private cove-beach is perfect, no waves to knock you off your feet, crystal clear water  the peace of mind that we could snooze off without being concern with our belongings. My only complaint is that the hotel didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have enough large beach umbrellas  the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¥ther√à√\u2020\u2022?ones they were giving us (2-3 to cover two chaise lounges) were this $9.99 pieces of garbage way below the stature of a Hilton. We are a couple with no children but the hotel is perfect for families√à√\u2020\u2022?w\/children. And last but not least, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ miss feeding the fish (even if you are not a kid)√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®√î??\u201A√á¬®√î??\u201A√á¬®?\/p> ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1045,"mention":"cookies","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cookie"],"startOffset":1038}]}
