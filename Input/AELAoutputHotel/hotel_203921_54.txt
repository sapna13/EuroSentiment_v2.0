{"text":"Incredibly friendly, lovely atmosphere Date : September 4, 2008Reviewer : Gabi SwedenCan' t say enough about how much we loved our stay at the hotel David . We stayed 7 nights and would love to be there still. It was our fifth visit to Italy and by far the best ! From the moment on arrival, we felt like home. Everything was so authentic and charming. Aesthetically very beautiful hotel. Our room , nr 18 , was very spacious, the bed very comfortable , a safe is in the room, the daily cleaning was perfect.Quiet at night and well air-conditioned. Absolute GREAT staff, attentive, warm and friendly at all time, extremely helpful .The hotel is located in a area not too close to the touristic attractions ( historical center ), but not too far that you have a long walk. It takes about 15-20 minutes to the Ponte Vecchio, but you can also take the bus ( 1,20 Euro , you can buy the tickets at the hotel ) Sometimes we went once again later in the evening , we loved the atmosphere on the Ponte Vecchio with nice music made by street musicians . More about the location - the hotel is close to the Piazzale Michelangelo where everyone goes for the spectacular view of the town of Florence. Don' t miss the sunset !We enjoyed the breakfast and the  Happy Hour  in the evening.Really delicious. Free red and white wine, juice , water , small pizza snacks, nuts, chips, olives and a few sallads . You can sit in the nice courtyard and relax after a long days walking.Good Trattorias are in the neighbourhood, just ask the staff and they will help you .As we were there for more than 4 nights in august , one free lunch in a very typical Trattoria was included.We really enjoyed it ! Florence is a magnificent city, just enjoy and explore ! You will not regret staying at this hotel . We will definitely come back !
