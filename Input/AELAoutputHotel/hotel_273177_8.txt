{"text":"not the best well before me and my partner went to the Dam his sister managed to get us a great deal for flights and the hotel, I read a great review and saw the pictures and thought it looked great, the hotel actually looked lovely in the foyer and up the stairs. We arrived at 9am so we couldn't book in until 2pm so we had a look round dam square etc. we found that it costs 16.50 euros for a 5 day tram\/bus\/metro ticket that can be used unlimited day and night on any of the above. when we arrived at the hotel i was a bit disappointed at the room but it was mainly just somewhere to kip for the night, we did have a leaking toilet and when we used the shower it flooded the bathroom but we soon sorted that out. the no food drink or smoking in the room bit did put us off but we smuggled them all in put a shower cap over the smoke detector and smoked in the bathroom, that included cannabis, we never got caught. i was very upset to realise the cleaners had been through our luggage while we were out and also opened two of our cans of beer, but then nothing else was missing and we couldn't really complain cause we was breaking the rules!! i wouldn't use this hotel again mainly for the reason it was so far out but at a push and nowhere else available i suppose it would do. i never thought it was a dangerous area but i did see police outside the hotel every day. it didn't put us off enjoying our stay in amsterdam!!
