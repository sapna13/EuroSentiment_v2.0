{"text":"Enjoyable stay My girlfriend and I spent 3 nights, paying $279 a night.Positives:- Brilliant location - very close to Broadway (we saw two shows), right near Port Authority (useful for getting to Woodbury Commons) and right near a number of subway stations. It's super easy to get around from here- Great soundproofing - despite being right in the heart of Times Square, we never heard so much as a whisper from the crowds and traffic. Probably helps when rooms start from the 23rd floor. We had a very peaceful and restful stay - Generally good service - we paid for 2 doubles and asked for (and were upgraded to) a king room on check-in- INCREDIBLY comfortable beds. I stay a lot at 4 and 5 star hotels when travelling for work, and these were amongst the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on.- Nice touches in the room - good toiletries, a radio alarm clock which doubles as speakers for your MP3 player (it comes with required cables)- Reasonable gym: weights machines and some free weights (although dumbbells only go up to 30 lbs)Negatives:- The main negative was the maid service - my girlfriend asked for extra tea and milk and it never came. She had to ask on 3 separate occasions before they finally got it right.She also asked for extra face towels twice and again they never came.- Also, they were a bit too eager - we had put up a do not disturb sign and they called us on the phone to ask us if we were aware there was a do not disturb sign up! Of course we were - that's why it was there.. if we had been asleep at the time, we would have been very annoyed.All in all, would recommend this as a great place to stay - particularly because of the exceptional location.P.S. If you like brands and shopping, go to the Port Authority bus station right next to the Hilton, pay $38 and make the hour trek out to Woodbury Common. Some of the best outlet shopping we've ever had, with brands including Gucci, Chanel, Prada, Versace, Zegna, Ferragamo, Tumi  Samsonite to mention a few. Also, if you like pizza, we loved the pizza at Famous Famiglia's right around the corner - we ate there every day.
