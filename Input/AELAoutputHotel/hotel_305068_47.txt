{"text":"favourite hotel in the world Love this place and wouldnt stay anywhere else.If youre going to splash out on a top price hotel, you want what this hotel has got:The best views from any hotel in the world? I cant think of any to beat it, you can watch the harbour all day from the huge windows reclining on the chaise longue or from the bed, and also see the promenaders along the walkway directly below.Rooms arent huge but are lovely, with Ipod stereo system, good Tv, lovely bathroom with big separate shower and deep bath. Tea and fruit on arrival. Shame theres no teamaker except in the suites though, at this level I think there should be.Big outdoor pool plus wonderful infinity spa pools looking over the harbour, open til 2200 so try it after dark.Moments away from world class shopping ( the mall attached to the hotel isnt up to much but the whole of Kowloon is on your doorstep). The star ferry across to the island is minutes away.Step outside to view the light show at 2000.Best feature is the terrific lounge which is well worth the cost for the really excellent food, copious included drinks, internet access, and great people watching in the lobby below. Theres a business centre next door too.Special plaudits to the lounge manager Claudia who dealt with a minor quibble we had about service with charm and professionalism, and even sent champagne to our room with an apology which is indicative that this hotel takes its service aspirations seriously . It was busier here than usual due to a trade fair and presumably also the terrible weather the day before we arrived, so the lounge was busy which affected the food service somewhat on one day, and it was a mistake to allow a loud beachwear clad group in the lounge which detracted from the usual classy and calm feel. Otherwise this remains my favourite hotel and the one I always look forward to returning to.
