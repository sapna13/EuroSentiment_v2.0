{"text":"Gorgeous hotel! My husband and I, along with our three children stayed at the Wyndham from Aug. 18 to Aug 25th. I really love this hotel and its location.  Here are some tips: I recommend that you apply for the Wyndham By Request program. It provides you with various ammenities you otherwise would not get. On this trip we were welcomed with a $45.00 bottle of wine, water for the children and some snacks. Use this program if you are traveling with small children. By calling ahead and pushing my membership I was given a small refrigerator and microwave to use with no charge. (If you are going to fill up the fridge, I recommend that you shop at Amigo. I thought Walmart would be cheaper, but it really wasn't.) We were also given a room upgade-from resort view to ocean view. Although the restauraunts @ the resort are pricey, they are worth it, especially Palio. (If you plan ahead buy yourself an Entertainment Book for Puerto Rico and there are coupons in there for restaurants (buy one meal, get one free), tee times, and water sports. Also, be advised if you book through Orbitz, there is a $30 resort fee, that you don't learn about until you check out your portfolio on the TV. If you eat @ Antojitos down the hill, although the food is delicious, you will wait a long time, they don't give a bread basket and any extras you order, like extra beans you will be charged. Try Lolitas on Rt. 3, make a left down the hill. They have delicious inexpensive mexican cuisine. Please try the roadside huts by Luquillo Beach for some delicious alcapurrias and pina coladas.
