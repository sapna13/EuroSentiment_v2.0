{"text":"Expensive but enjoyable We stayed at this hotel 2 nights before a cruise and enjoyed our stay. The price is quite steep at $270 night base rate but we did like the room and setting very much.Having read mixed reviews on this web site after we booked, we did call the hotel several days in advance directly as I have allergies and was concerned about getting a damp or mildewed room after seeing some reviews which mentioned this. We mentioned that fact to the clerk. Perhaps that accounted for the fact that when we went to check in the clerk told us we had been upgraded to a room in the tower on the top floor. It was a very nice room with a great balcony view. We enjoyed the small beach they have and spend most of one day just being there and in the pleasant water....much nicer beach than that of the Marriott which has big waves and wasn't very clean or pleasant to be in. The Hilton had a nice quiet beach with no wave action. Very nice just to float on the peaceful waters. The grounds are very nice too. Pools are attractive but not connected so you really have 3 small\/medium size pools right next to each other. Lots of people all over encamped in beach chairs. Food was expensive so we ate breakfast both mornings at the small health food cafe at the spa area which is not as pricey. Spoke to 3 different concierges and all were helpful.
