{"text":"Relaxing holiday, good for families We went with First Choice and the company was marvelous as well as the Rep at the hotel (Jacki). They can't do enough to help you and try as much as they can to ensure your stay is enjoyable. We went to Kenya with first Choice and appreciated their customer service so much that we went with them again this year. Didn't even bother going with anybody else. We had dietary needs that were linked to medical conditions and they were really good.Hotel is under new management and the Barcelo group have spent money already making improvements. Unfortunately, the hotel has three blocks that are very old and run down - Barcelo have plans to refurbish these but if you get one at present - yuck! We were moved three times during our two weeks stay and this was the worst part of the holiday. Blocques 2,3 and 4 are horrible. They are damp, mouldy, old, small. Our room had cockroaches and the water was dripping down the walls.The hotel do help by sending in the fumigators and cleaning but it is made worse by the fact that some of these rooms do not have extractor fans in the bathrooms. Damp central!The air con smells and if you are asmathic you will suffer. They came and sprayed something in the air con vent and it seemed to help. If you can afford it - book a Caribbean spa suite room as these are of the size that you would expect in a regular room elsewhere in the caribbean. Unfortunately these are not assigned at the regular price (which is already not cheap). Beach is beautiful, sea is clear and warm. Beach bar and beach cafe with snacks. Pizza all day long. Really good buffets. We are strict vegetarians and were never hungry - quite the opposite. We have all put weight on in two weeks! Chefs and waiting staff are really helpful and work hard.People were tipping all the time. We didn't do this and tipped at the end of the holiday. We took a suitcase of old clothes and toys and gave them to the staff - they were very grateful. Hotel has good systems in place and you just sign a form to say that you gave them stuff.Do not expect things to be done immediately - it just won't happen. Not because they are lazy but just because that is how it is. The hotel has lots of staff and has a nice safe resort feeling. We are all relaxed and have had a good holiday. We met lots of nice people from all over the world and learnt some Spanish too! Lots of Canadians, French, Belgians come as well as Brits. Everyone enjoyed the entertainment programme. Kids club is good and in the shade. Lady who runs it is very good and the kids love her.Lots of people that we spoke to had been moved two or three times - the same as us. Unfortunately, many said they would not return - BArcelo need to bear in mind that lots of people agreed with the comment that the rooms are small for the price that you pay. Also the fact that Blocques 2,3,4 are horrible. Bearing in mind that for the same price, families would get two interconnecting rooms in other places e.g. Southern Palms, Kenya - you don't get much space for the money you pay.We would go back because the resort is lovely apart from the rooms in the above mentioned blocks. First Choice rep was amazing but she is moving on to Greece for the summer. Food was great as was the landscaping and beach.
