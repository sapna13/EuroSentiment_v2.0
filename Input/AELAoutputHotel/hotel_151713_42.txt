{"text":"Handy, Clean and Nice Big Rooms The hotel is literally right beside the airport landing strip and beside the freeway, yet you can't hear these noises from your room. The casino is located in the atrium and the noise from the live music filtered up to the rooms, but the great thing about the Embassy Suites is that you can close the door to your separate bedroom and you can't hear a thing. I thought it was neat to sit at the very spacious and well conceived pool and literally watch the planes coming down. The pool's waterfall, for the most part filters out the plane noise. There were enough chaise lounges for everyone who came to the pool (and it was full) and you can get a massage and other spa services poolside.The food at the Outback located in the hotel was terrific and the service that we received from the Embassy staff was great, especially the day manager, Bo. Overall, great location with clean rooms, good service, good food , conveniently located by the airport and other good restaurants, blocks away from the beach and for sightseeing into Old San Juan. I understand the taxi fares from this area to be a little high to go to Old San Juan and would recommend renting a car for the $40 a day which would also allow you access to the Rain Forest and the Caves. Parking rates at the Embassy are $14 and $20 for self and valet parking, respectively. ","annotations":[]}
