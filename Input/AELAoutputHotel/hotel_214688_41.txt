{"text":"Many negatives, a few positives We chose to stay at Outrigger Luana after reading the traveler reviews...I believe I'll do more careful reading between the lines next time I read the reviews. Our studio room (515) had a nice and recently renovated kitchenette with a decent supply of dishes for 4, tableware, and cooking accessories. We had a bit of a view of the ocean from the small balcony which surprised me since we were to have only a city view. The air conditioner worked very nicely. My husband liked the exercise facilities. The pool is small but nicely kept. The pool deck is on the smaller side but equipped with comfortable chairs and tents to shield from the sun. Other than that, the positives mostly end and the negatives begin. To start, (and this is a big one for me,) there is no fan in the bathroom...puhlease!! We tried to call the main lobby when we couldn't access our phone messages and couldn't dial through. When my husband went to the lobby, he was told that our phone buttons hadn't been set up yet. What on earth kind of excuse is that? There were cockroaches in the room (I hope we didn't bring them home with us in our luggage.) There was no information book in the room to explain where the pool, laundry facilities, ice machine, etc., are located or to give information on restaurants, boutique hours, check-in, etc., or any of the usual information found in a book in hotel rooms. When I asked the front desk about one, I was told there isn't one. The queen bed was more of a large double. I sincerely doubt that was a queen bed. There was a small baby ironing board...the kind that sits on 2 inch legs on a table and moves all over the place while you're trying to iron. The coffee for the coffeemaker had to be bought at the front desk. The first night is supplied in the room, but after that, the supply is not refreshed...which is fine, I guess. It was poor quality coffee. The bathroom door squeaked loudly and had to be pushed with your weight against the door to close it. The bathroom is supplied with two rough towels, two washcloths, two hand towels, nothing extra. The toilet was the cheap plastic seat type with a rough surface as if something had gotten stuck to the lid and never completely removed. The floor was only swept by housekeeping when I left a tip and a note to request it. The housekeeping staff, however, were very nice and left the room neat. The sheets were barely large enough to go 6 inches down the side of the bed and there wasn't much on top to fold over the bedspread. They do not do dishes. You need to wash your own dishes. The furniture had many worn spots in the wood stain. You pay separately for parking and internet access (which is only accessible in the lobby). I would not stay there again. This hotel was not what I had expected for $200 a night and the many positive reviews I read. Granted, staying in Waikiki is not inexpensive, but when I have it to do again, I'll pay the extra money to stay at a better hotel where the amenities are included in the price, the sheets fit the bed, and the other negatives are hopefully minimized.
