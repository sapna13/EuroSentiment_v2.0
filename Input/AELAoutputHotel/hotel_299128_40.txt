{"text":"Intercontinental just heaven! My husband  3 kids(9,6,4 yrs)just returned from 11 nights at this amazing hotel.Its huge!Impressive from the 1st moment you arrive,the staff all treat you with the utmost respect  courtesy (even groundsmen,repairmen etc).I chose it based on the kids club.Unfortunately,I was under the impression it was included in the price,however you can pay either by the hour (50,000rp)or a 5 hr package (includes lunch or dinner-very substantial too) @ 175,000rp.My kids asked to go as the staff were really good  spoilt them-made them soo welcome.Sometimes, I felt tho the kids were left to just play computer games if thats what they wanted.My kids will always choose that over other outdoors activities!Brekky was full buffet with juice bar-lots on offer. Altho some say the resort is looking tired, I agree its not a brand new hotel, however the maintenance and attention to detail is amazing!The lawns look like a golfing green,the beach was immaculate,very clean and well cared for.We stayed in the normal Singaraja suite-interconnecting rooms.They were very spacious!!Oversized king bed,massive bathroom with bath and so dark-we slept in till 9am a lot,yes,even the kids!The main pool with swim up bar was too warm and tired for me,but there is 2 other pools so who's complaining?Happy hour 5.30-7.30pm with 2 oversized wines for price of 1 and a gorgeous sunset-perfect!My only complaint is the 5 star prices-5x the normal bali prices.Eg.60000 for lemon squash,110000 for mie goreng.And no good restaurants close by.We ate at the beach warungs 2 times but the seafood was very average,so I would suggest only a few nights here-stay up in Seminyak  Ubud to be closer to everything but still upmarket.It cost us 120000rp for a round trip to Seminyak dinner each time.It can add up!My husband said it was the best hotel gym he'd been to, and the free sauna\/steam room\/spas at the Spa is great.Go for the club level if you can-they include kids club and snacks,drinks etc.And the Teppanyaki bar was gr8 fun!
