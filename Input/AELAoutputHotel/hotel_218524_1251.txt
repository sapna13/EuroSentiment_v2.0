{"text":"Great time! The Dreaded Drive √à√\u2020\u2022?after reading all the reviews about the drive to and from the hotel I was a little nervous because I often get carsick. However, I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think it was that bad. The only thing is driving there can be a little long especially because you drop other groups off within the first half hour and then it takes them another 40min to get to Excellence. There are a ton of potholes on the road but the drivers know all of them and just maneuver around them. Just prepare yourself and know it's worth the wait. You also get to see how great Excellence is in comparison!Surroundings √à√\u2020\u2022?absolutely beautiful with the rabbits, parrots, flamingos, and chickens. You can see all the time they put into keeping Excellence beautiful. The entrance and all the foliage were well kept. Everything was super clean! Spa - never tried it but we walked in and it was very relaxing. The gym is nothing great but if you must workout they go the basics.Pool - The swimming pool was very nice with a huge swim-up bar. The only thing I would recommend is picking out some good sitting around 9am or so. People can be pretty rude about saving multiple seats. If you wake up late enough you will notice towels unrolled all over the place but nobody actually laying down. If you aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ picky then it doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ matter. But if you want some shade it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a must! Beach √à√\u2020\u2022?gorgeous! I went to Puerto Plata last year and I was majorly disappointed with the beach. This beach was the complete opposite. It was clean with nice soft sand. The water can be a little rough but nothing to worry about. They have beds you can lay down on the far left side. You will notice a ton of beach activities. If you want drinks delivered to you sit near the bars. Also tip the ladies who bring you the drinks! It makes them come back.People √à√\u2020\u2022?all the employees from Excellence were so well trained and willing to help with anything! I loved every single one of them. When you get there you will notice how much they care. Danny, Victor, and Jenny were the best!!! Drinks √à√\u2020\u2022?Mudslide, Banana Mama, Strawberry Daiquiri, Coco Loco √à√\u2020\u2022?all so deliciousFood √à√\u2020\u2022?kinda disappointing. The Mexican place (Agave) do not recommend! The only thing I liked about Agave was the band. The French place (Chez Isabelle) also pretty disappointed especially since everyone raved about it! The Asian Cuisine place (Spice) probably my favorite. The food was really good and Danny was awesome! Ask him what to get and he tells you the good stuff! The Grill was actually pretty good too and there is no curve ball. You pretty much get what you ask for. Its just good burgers, salads, etc. The Lobster house was good. Just know that it only serves lobster. The Italian place we were told by other couples to avoid as much as possible. Several people actually got up in the middle of their meal and left it was so bad. The room service was seriously great! It was funny because we often felt as though the room service food was a lot better than the restaurant food. We went to the Italian place for bfast the first morning because it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ all buffet style but it was pretty gross so the following day we ordered room service and it was 100 times better. All around, everything is served in small portions so make sure you get an appetizer.When it comes to tipping we did it often. We tipped the driver, the bartenders, room service, cleaning lady, and waitors. Just leave a few bucks and they really appreciate it! It's not a must but if you do they will definitely take care of you.
