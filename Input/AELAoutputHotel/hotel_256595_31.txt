{"text":"Great hotel but bar service could improve I stayed at the hotel for 1 night recently as a member of a large group on a business trip (30-35 people). The lobby and rooms are elegant, stylish, very clean and well appointed and the reception desk staff were friendly and helpful. Group check-in and check-out was efficient. There were however a few issues which spoilt the broader experience - firstly the bar service was appalling with nearly every member in our party reporting some issue. Incorrect orders, wrong items on the bill, bills never arriving (no complaints here on that one!), long delays in orders being filled, unavailable wines that later were successfully ordered by others, topped off by a total lack of clarity regarding whether it was table or bar service and reprimands from waiters for approaching the bar. I was given the incorrect bill three times and finally paid in frustration after trying to explain I was being billed for 3 white wines when I had ordered and was drinking a red. Isolated incidents are understandable however this was almost a culture of incompetence. Our whole group found the experience less than satisfactory and a bit odd considering the food and service in the adjoining restaurant was of a very high quality standard. One recent post noted that some items on the 24 hour menu were not actually available 24 hours. This was also my experience however I ordered an alternative with no problem and it was served promptly.Despite my frustration re: the bar and room service on the whole this hotel is fantastic and I would definitely stay there again or recommend it to a friend. The location is superb and the rooms are lovely and well looked after. You will enjoy staying here.
