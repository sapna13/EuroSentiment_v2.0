{"text":"Your Classic American-type hotel. After staying in a boutique hotel in Rome before this one in Florence, this was a big hotel - as far as size goes. The shower was bigger, which was much more comfortable. I even took a bath one night. The room had a great view of Florence since we were on the 6th floor. Location: is just slightly outside the hustle and bustle of Florence, but it's walkable. You don't HAVE TO take the bus to go to places. Santa Croce is actually a nice walk from the hotel.LIKES: (1) Again, the view from the room since we were on the 6th floor. We could see some of the Arno and then the many villas and mountains across the Arno. (2.) The big shower\/tub, which we were not used to since staying in a small hotel in Rome. DISLIKES (2) The staff. After getting so much attention at the small, boutique hotel in Rome - the staff here were just not as friendly and willing to help. They had brochures and flyers of tour buses that you could take to explore the city, but I felt they knew little on how a tourist who is completely new to Europe should travel. (3). Internet use: OUT OF SERVICE was the sign posted on each of the 6 or so PCs in the lobby until the very last day when I saw that 2 were working. Come to find out though that you had to pay 5 Euro just for 30 minutes! What a ripoff. I know you don't go on vacation just to get on the computer, but it's nice just to have access to email and write to family and friends. A good tip on how to travel through Florence: pay for the one-day double-decker tour bus (16 Euro each person). It runs 24-hours so you can literally go all day. You can get on and off at sites as you please and there is audio playing as you pass by sites to give you history. One of my favorites was traveling up towards Fiesole and seeing the building\/home where Galileo died.
