{"text":"Disappointing - tiny room Have to say I was very disappointed.On a positive note the location is fantastic (right in the middle of everything), we found the staff pleasant and professional, and the concierge was very helpful.Here√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the problem √à√\u2020\u2022?for 500 Euro a night we stayed in a shoe box. I stay in European hotels frequently for work, so know they tend to be small, but at this price point this was ridiculous. It didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ end there, some strange room features detracted from our stay. First off, we found the bedding particularly uncomfortable (the sheets seemed like sandpaper). Also frustrating - the only switch for the bathroom light was located outside the bathroom door (i.e. in the bedroom), which meant that if one of us woke up in the middle of the night, we had to turn the light on and then open the bathroom door to enter √à√\u2020\u2022?drowning the bed in bright light (as the bed was of course about a foot from the bathroom given the size of the room). Also, when my wife tried to use the hair dryer she quickly learned that only the electric socket outside of the bathroom worked at all, and even that produced little heat (and after a few minutes it ceased to produce heat at all). The fitness center was also very tiny and cramped with no areas to lay out and stretch √à√\u2020\u2022?as a result you had to navigate around bodies on the floor in the middle of the few machines. Some of these may sound nitpicky √à√\u2020\u2022?but at $700 a night I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ believe they are acceptable.
