{"text":"Good location, fabulous rate Stayed at the Rosedale for 3 nights. Paid CAD$110 a night including tax \/ service. Room rate includes free in-room internet access, but no breakfast (not a big deal considering whole bunch of restaurants\/ bakeries \/ fast-food joints are within 5mins walking distance). Hotel is located right in Causeway Bay. About an 7-8min walk to the subway station and the Sogo Department store area. It's faster if you go through the pedestrian foot-bridges but you can also avoid all of them by taking a slight detour, which will take about 10-12 mins to the subway station. However, there is a tram station located right outside of the hotel so if you're familiar with the tram system, you can hop on\/off easily (it costs much less than the subway- HKD$2 flat rate). Rooms are reasonably sized (by Asian cities standard) - about 200 square feet. It's a basic hotel so don't expect any spa-like amenities - just clean, tidy and functional room (and relatively new, 5 years). It is a great place to just crash at night after spending all day shopping \/ sight-seeing. There is a free shuttle that runs between the hotel (a brief 2min walk from main entrance) and the Airport Express - Hong Kong Station. It runs every 20mins. The hotel also provide a shuttle service directly to the airport at HKD$130 per person. They also provided 2 bottles of drinking water (complimentary) in the room daily, which is great considering the tap water in HK is not suitable for drinking. ","annotations":[]}
