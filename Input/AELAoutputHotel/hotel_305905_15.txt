{"text":"An excellent choice The Royal Garden is a wonderful place to stay. We had booked a standard room through Expedia (very cheap) but were allocated a superior room. The room was gigantic, as was the bed - I've stayed in rooms elsewhere which was smaller than the bed! Every facility you would expect plus more (newspaper, tea  coffee making, etc). The pool and other leisure facilities are out-standing. Staff very helpful. Restaurants looked good and were busy but we did not use them mainly because there was so much elsewhere to choose from (my favourite was Red Pepper on HK Island). From the room service menu, I would be surprised if they were more expensive than the going rate for good restaurants.The hotel sometimes feels slightly away from the main centres but on reflection this was good because it was quieter (though surrounded by restaurants, coffee shops, bars, etc.) and the walk along the front was great.A few tips: from the airport use the train to Kowloon and then the K4 courtesy bus (included in the train ticket) to the Regal Kowloon Hotel stop (next door to the Royal Garden). Buy an Octopus card at the airport (HK$50 plus what you put on it - I suggest HK$300 to cover the Airport Express, you can get a refund less HK$7 at the end and you can 'overdraw by HK$35). The subway from the Tsim Sha Tsui station goes with travellators to close to the hotel (exit P). Temple Street and the Ladies Market are tacky - go to Stanley Market instead and benefit from wonderful views on the way.
