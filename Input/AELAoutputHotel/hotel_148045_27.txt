{"text":"DO RISK IT WITH THIS PLACE !!! I don't even know where to begin. Let's start by telling you that this hotel freezes 150$ per night stay on your credit card at check in EVEN if you have already paid, they say it's for incedintals.Lucky for me I called ahead of time and was told by a supervisor we could do $200 for incidentals.At check in we thought everything went smoothly only to find out they froze 600$. After getting this fixed we then had another issue at checkout with money, they charged the 200$ even though we paid the $71 we owed with a different card. Now onto the the other issues. The staff at this hotel are very rude and not helpful at all. The waitress at the poolside restaurant was by far the worst waitress I have ever had and I only tipped her $1 on a $70 lunch for 4. Also they will not allow you to bring a cooler to the private island so we were forced to pay $16 for soda for 4 people and the cups were only about 5oz. We then had the breakfast buffet at the Las Brisas Cafe which for 2 adults and 2 kids was $80.Also everything in this hotel was breaking down constantly. The elevators,the Funicular ( rail car that takes you up and down the cliff side from the rooms to the main lobby area), the ticket machine for self parking area,the ferry that takes you to their private island, and 2 of the mornings we were there the emergency alarms went off at 7am (they were false alarms). The hotel has 2 catamarans that are supposed to take guests to the island but only one was up and running and one of the days we stood in line for 2 hours while they did repairs. There are also 2 funiculars and only one was working so there were EXTREMELY long lines waiting out in the heat to get down to the rooms. They were making no attempts to fix either the broken catamaran or funicular. This hotel is nice to look at and the rooms are nice and clean but all the other problems do not make it worth your time or money.
