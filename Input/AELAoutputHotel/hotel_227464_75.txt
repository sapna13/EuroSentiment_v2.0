{"text":"Absolutley fabulous hotel - wonderful stay I cannot reccommend this hotel highly enough. My 10yr old son and I stayed here over Christmas for a wonderful week and this was a real treat. The location is fantastic - incredibly central for walking, public transport, airport buses and the Bus Touristic (highly reccommend doing this) with hot and cold running taxis and lots of great food nearby esp on Rambla de Catalunya and Passeig de Gracia. But the rooms are really quiet - no street noise unless you open the balcony doors.There is a lovely smell when you come into the hotel and everyone on reception was welcoming, efficient, friendly and helpful. On Christmas Day we had an unprompted phone call from reception to say that they were there to help us with anything we needed. On our last day, they were happy to bring down and store our bags until we left for the airport at 4pm which was a great relief - nothing was too much effort.I had emailed the manager Mr Sanchez (who impresses me by replying to every review on tripadvisor) to ask if we could have a twin, non smoking and street view room on a higher floor and he accommodated us completely giving us a huge room on the 5th floor at the front of the hotel. The rooms are in the Minimalist style but luxurious, very comfortable and CLEAN! The beds are fantastic we had a twin room and the singles are huge and very comfortable! Gorgeous cotton sheets that seemed to be changed daily - not 100% on this but the pillow cases certainly were. Big fluffy towels changed daily if you wanted and a good selection of toiletries and things like razors, shower caps etc. Black out curtains under the main ones are a great idea, especially for those early summer sunrises. The huge telly was a bonus with BBC\/CNN News, National Geographic and music channels as well as the rest. Took along a portable DVD player that can be run through a TV which came in very handy for playing the odd film. In our room, the sink was in the room which works well when two of you need to get ready. A little dissapointed with the tiny bathroom. In 502 there is a shower and a loo and whilst the shower is lovely and powerful the sealants are a little grubby. It looked like the chambermaids gave it a good clean but it needs something more drastic! Wouldn't have minded relaxing in a bubble filled bathtub after a day spent on the feet but then I did not specify a bath! And our room was huge. The safe was easy to use and a pefect size. A very welcome fruitbowl is a thoughtful touch.There is no noise between rooms but you can hear noise from the hallway. Perhaps the doors could be soundproofed during the next renovation...Because we were in Barcelona to sightsee, I didn't mind hearing the chambermaids in the morning as it got me up but I can see that this could be a problem if you wanted to lie in..Had breakfast in our room on Christmas day and wow - fresh, great selection of pastries and cheese and gorgeous coffee\/juice and brought up with a cheerful smile and hola! When we got back early that evening, we had been left a gourmet foodie present and card!Didn't try the breakfast room as we were never really hungry in the morning having eaten so late the night before...The bar area is great - super service and a nice place to chill out. The internet had a fast connection - made a few restaurant bookings via toptable (reccommend doing so for 7 Portes) and also checked in and printed off our boarding cards the night before we left. Can see where this would get busy when the hotel is full...(Oh by the way Mr Sanchez, the printers need ink as they are running low..)We got a little lost getting off the airport bus when we arrived (in the rain and in the dark - not my best thing) and would like to mention that the hotel is located on a street (Bergara) off the Placa Catalunya, opposite to the El Corte Ingles side (which is where the airport bus stop is) in what is known as the Triangle which houses FNAC (our point of reference from then on) and Habitat.All in all - so very impressed with this hotel - would reccommend it highly and will definitely return here (for a long weekend next time!) Mr Sanchez - compliments and congratulations to you and your staff - I can see that you all work very hard to make the hotel what it is today.
