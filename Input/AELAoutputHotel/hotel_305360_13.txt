{"text":"Super Deal for Hong Kong Island - Harbour view suites a must! I am sitting in a Harbour View Suite #2309 at the Bishop Lei with a panoramic view from both rooms that is amazing. Not only this, but we heard the apes in the zoo this morning, saw an eagle soaring over the botanical gardens below and can watch the star ferries come and go. All of this for $960 HK a night! This has got to be the best deal in HK. If you are here purely to shop, then the midlevels is not for you. But if you want to experience HK, do some touring, shopping and enjoy the restaurants of Soho, this is THE place. We thought we wanted to stay in central and were not willing to pay the price (two adults  one child) for other hotels. We have a two room suite here. Everything is clean and new. Large TV, quiet airconditioning, floor to ceiling windows, crisp white duvets, down pillows and shuttle to take us almost anywhere. We are using the mid level escalators, but I can imagine that in August, it would get tiresome. We used the hotel organized limousine service to get here. Very simple, nice and reasonable. The breakfast buffet this morning was passable for the price ($260 for 3 ) . Hotel has nice exercise facilities, but the pool is closed for maintenance. It is so nice walking along Robinson street, and easy to get to just about anywhere. Very close to the Zoo and Botanical gardens (we can see the animal enclosures below) We booked a non-smoking room, but arrived at 7 a.m. and were offered a smoking room. I checked it (super sensitive to vile cigarettes) and there was no trace of smoking. We were thrilled to have early check in. I love this hotel!
