{"text":"Nice urban oasis Stayed at this resort for 5 nights mostly for business. Overall, the hotel was excellent, especially considering that I stayed there during the busy Memorial Day weekend. Pros:Rooms: Very good. Stayed in the tower. Be sure to ask for an upgraded room in the tower. Room had flat screen TV, bathrobe, comp bottle of water each day. Ocean or City View options were available. Food: Had a nice pool side lunch. Pool service was prompt. Very nice coffee bar handy for breakfast take-out to the beach. Staff: Very courteous! Concierge was very helpful. Complaints were handled promptly. Parking: I suggest valet parking. It didn't cost much more than the garage and the staff was prompt. Location: Very convenient. Starbucks, Walgreens across the street. Old San Juan, where most of the action is, is about 3 miles (see below) Very close to the airport. Beach access is excellent. Beach: Beach service was great, with attendant ready to set up your umbrella and chair. Of course, bring a few dollars to tip the guy. Ocean is fun, but can be a little rough for the kids. Ocean water is what you might expect, refreshing, but you are swimming next to a major, urban location! Restaurants: In the neighborhood, there is an adequate, pricey, sushi place next door. Old San Juan: Definately go to Dragonfly, Agua Viva and Parrot Club. For a great local sushi option, don't miss Jinyas, it's a drive, but worth it!Health Club: Top notch. In the basement of the old wing, this place has all of the equipment you'll need. They also provide one comp bottle of water to guests who work out. Safety: I noticed plenty of staff around, both at the pool and beach areas. While there does appear to be a high crime rate, like many urban areas, the hotel and surrounding areas felt safe to me. Jogging: Suggest an early wake-up and do the three mile (each way) jog to Old San Juan. Other: At the concierge desk, there are handy maps to most of the tourist locations with easy to follow directions from the hotel. Cons:Rooms: Be sure to stay away from the ice machine\/staff entrance elevator. It tended to be noisy. A squeaky staff door was repaired promptly after I complained. Broadband: Since I was there for business, I had to use the wireless service. In the room, this service was HORRIBLE. I complained but there was absolutely nothing they could do to speed it up. There is a business center with faster service. Location: Taxis are not cheap. It was about a $12 cab ride to Old San Juan. Pool: While there are plenty of beach chairs, the pool is awkward. A huge wading pool and rather small regular pool. Probably great for kids, but not so nice for most folks. Restaurants: Avoid the gelato place down the street. It just didn't taste very fresh!! Rates: Be sure to have them explain their resort fee. This is not a problem, but it is almost automatically included on your bill. Check in: Could have been much faster. The hotel promotes express check in, but I couldn't find it. Casino: Well, maybe because I lost money. It just wasn't a pleasant place to spend the evening. Elevators: Slow, but I did stay over the busy holiday weekend.
