{"text":"Just okay First of all, I stayed at the Majestic from March 8 √à√\u2020\u2022?14 along with 33 other people who attended my sister in-laws wedding. It was my first visit to Punta Cana. It was an okay trip but I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think I will be going back to Punta Cana anytime soon. I would advise you not to go into town unless you go on an excursion. I would defiantly bring snacks and toiletries items with you. The resort is very expensive. A small can of chips and a candy bar will cost you $5.00. Also sun tan lotion will run you $17.00. Rooms: Really nice for a couple. However, the room is not comfortable for a family of four. . There isn't really any private space to change unless you go in the shower or the bathroom stall. The room is kept clean and if you want your sheets changed you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l need to tip the house keeper and leave a note in Spanish. Also, for extra bottle water tip the man who delivery it not the cleaning lady. I gave him $10.00 for the whole week and I had plenty of water in my room.Food: It was okay. I am not a picky eater and I can eat almost anything. However, I did not care for the buffets. The group I traveled with is use to Spanish and Portuguese cuisine for which tends is rich. However, some people in the group did have digestive problems. Please be careful, at the buffets because if it looks like they refried some of the food. I would stay away from the Mexican Buffet if you are not use to rich foods. The other restaurants were good (especial, the Steak House and the Seafood). Drink lots of bottle water (even to brush your teeth). Beach: Great! It was a beautiful beach but the water was kind of choppy. I have visited a lot of Caribbean islands and it was one of the nicest beaches I have seen. However, Bermuda is still the best. Pool: Awesome! It was a beautiful √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢uge√à√\u2020\u2022?pool (one of the best I have ever seen).Staff: The bar tenders at the pool were awesome. I would suggest tipping them if you want to be served before anyone else. The active staff was great (very friendly). The employee who works behind the receptionist desk √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≤eeds a personality adjustment√à√\u2020\u2022? It took us 3 days to get a wheel chair for a family member. Apparently, they did not have enough wheel chairs for people who needed them. I give them a C- for customer service. We did not have a problem with the language since some of us could speak Spanish fluently. Children√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Programs: Sucks! That√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ all I can say. I would not leave my four year old. Wedding: It was a beautiful wedding. It was definitely one of the best weddings I have ever attended. Airport\/Bus: When arriving at the Airport get ready to pay a $10.00 tax per person (including infants). We booked through Cheap Caribbean and the bus that they use for transportation needs to be updated Overall, the hotel was beautiful. But, the all inclusive was just okay... I guess I just expected and wanted more. It is definitely not a 5 start. They need to do a lot of work before they can call them selves a 5 star hotel I would give them 3 √à√¥√ú to 4 stars tops.
