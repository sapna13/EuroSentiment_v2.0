{"text":"'Excellente' and So Much More... My husband and I just returned from our honeymoon at the Excellence. It rained the first 2 days while we were there due to the hurricanes, but rain included, we still had an incredible time. The staff tries their hardest to keep everyone entertained and happy, whether it be through games, entertainment, etc. There were many things to get involved with throughout the day if you wanted to or you were able to just relax and sit on the beautiful beach. We opted for a little bit of both! Joel and Ines were always looking to get the guests involved with activities and have a good time, great job!!! The servers on the beach were very pleasant and came around to take drink orders frequently. The staff at the Excellence spoke English very well and were even eager to learn some new words they may have not been familiar with before.The food at the resort was wonderful!! Breakfast at Toscana in the mornings was always very good, we especially loved the potatoes! Our favorite restaurant was Spice, which we ate at twice, but they were all very good and we enjoyed having a vast array of options to choose from. At each restaurant, there were many choices to choose from to accomodate each persons tastebuds. Even the housekeeping at the resort took special care of their guests. We received flowers in our room in the mornings and extra chocolates in our room at night. The beds were more firm then usual, but we still slept fine. Yes, the hotel is roughly 50-60minutes from the airport, but DEFINITELY worth the ride!We loved this place and would recommend it!!!
