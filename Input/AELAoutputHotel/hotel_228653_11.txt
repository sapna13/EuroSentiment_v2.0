{"text":"Good hotel My teenage daughter and I stayed at the America in February for a long weekend. I'd read reviews before booking and, while the breakfast wasn't worth the money, we really enjoyed our stay so would side with the good reviews rather than the bad. The hotel was very clean, looked trendy enough for a teenage daughter, staff were very helpful and just friendly enough, the free internet was a boon and the rooftop area was lovely (although February wasn't the time to get the best from it). The situation of the hotel was great for sightseeing and we always felt safe in that area. Could walk to Ramblas etc, was cheap to get a taxi to and from Nou Camp (which is a great visit, even if you're not a fan). The pickpockets were out in force in the old town but they didn't approach us, i think because we made sure we had a tight grip of our bags (which were slung across our bodies) - much easier pickings elsewhere i suspect. You could see the same suspects moving from one tourist area to another - loitering and watching for unattended bags outside cafe's etc. Would recommend the bar\/cafe across the street for a cheap meal - we ate late, like the locals, and the atmosphere was far better than in the more expensive restaurants...and watched Barca win on the TV! You could hear noise from the street from our room but it was just folk going about their business, more a bustle of activity than intimidating and troublesome like it might be in the UK. Just added to the atmosphere more than anything. Did have a slight problem with hearing folk in the next bathroom via the vents - we just whistled when in the loo and it was Ok really! I'd go back there but would probably look for a bigger, more luxurious, hotel if the stay was going to be longer than a weekend. Be aware of the added tax on bills for hotels and food which may affect your budget. ","annotations":[]}
