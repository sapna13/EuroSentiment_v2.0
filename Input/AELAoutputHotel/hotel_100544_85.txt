{"text":"quirky, great value This is a great hotel if you don't mind some general quirkiness, a little bit of inconsistency style- and quality-wise, and fewer amenities than you might find at a more upscale hotel.I stayed in one of the suites...it was very clean, well furnished, interesting original fixtures. Why I intend to stay here next time I'm in Seattle:1. Awesome location, especially given the price;2. Unusual, fun, kind of faded, funky style; 3. Great, friendly, helpful staff: knowledgeable about restaurants, buses, etc.; 4. Wonderful coffee kitty corner to the hotel (Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ D' arte);5. The suite was big, clean, and comfortable. What to know before you stay here:1. My kitchenette could hardly be considered functional. There was a little stove, fridge, and sink. Entire contents of kitchen utensils: one pot, one pan, one spatula, place settings for 3 people.Yes, that's it. I needed to buy a knife for my fruit in the morning. I didn't come to Seattle to cook in my hotel, but the kitchenette may as well not have been there, for its usefulness. (It was even hard to make tea, believe it or not!! And I'm pretty good at improvising with less-than-perfect culinary situations.)2. Controlling the heating in the room is not entirely up to you, youhave to fiddle with the radiators (sometimes rather hot) and then balance what is coming out of them with the cool air coming into youropen windows. 3. Bring your own clock, there's none in the room. 4. But there is a decent hair dryer.5. The lower floor rooms might be noisy because of the theater. My impression, walking up the stairs of the hotel during a concert, was that the noise seemed a bit bad for the first two floors and much better by the fourth. I was on the fifth floor, no noise problems. Would I stay there again? Yes!! Despite the quibbles, I loved the hotel and staff, and I would stay here anytime.
