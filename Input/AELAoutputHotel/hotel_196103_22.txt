{"text":"Even Among Stoner Hotels, This Place Is A Pit The room was incredibly small, looked like a closet √à√\u2020\u2022?in fact, I still haven√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ convinced myself it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a closet. Most of the rooms at the Filosoof are named after famous philosophers and theologians (ie, the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√™onfuscius Room√à√\u2020\u2022?or the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬£ietzche Room√à√\u2020\u2022?. If I had to guess, my room was the Shamanistic Ritual Room.√à√\u2020\u2022?Staying there certainly bordered on a pagan rite √à√\u2020\u2022?the elevator (such as it was) thumped and trembled the floorways all night, and joined the ongoing slamming of doors and voices of young stoners yammering until the very. Wee. Hours.The following morning, despite my better judgement, I decided to take a shower, but lo and behold, the hotel had no running water, surprise, surprise. When I called downstairs, the staff informed me the construction crews in the street had ruptured all the water lines. They noted that they would be glad to phone me when the hotel had water again. Never did get that call.Speaking of construction outside the hotel, the tangle of bulldozers and steam shovels, along with pools of swamp muck made navigating one√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ way to the tram lines a Lewis and Clark affair √à√\u2020\u2022?no place for fine shoes, ladies. I will never spend another night at Hotel Filosoof, as long as I have the strength to crawl to the nearest bus stop. At 130 euros per night, plus extra charges to make local calls on the phone, one would expect a lot more √à√\u2020\u2022?or even a little more. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ trying to remain philosophical about my experience at the Hotel Filosoof, but staying there again would require a leap of faith that goes beyond philosophy to blind superstition or stark, raving lunacy.
