{"text":"great holiday fantastic place we spent two weeks at this resort and it was a lovely place booked through first choice,flight over we found that the cabin crew were not very helpful.we had transport from the airport which took only 20-30 mins,your rooom is already allocated for you on the coach so no waiting around at the resort to get booked in.the room was very nice very clean,tidy,with clean towels every day our maid was very nice and made our stay even more better.the buffet was very good with plenty of choice,meats,fruit,etc something for everyone. the lobby was a really nice place to sit and have a nice drink and all staff were very helpful.you dont have to wait long for your drinks.the pools were beautiful,clean and well kept,with a swim up bar so you order your drink and just sit there and take in the lovely surroundings.we did find that you had to get your towels out by your sunbeds by 7.30-8.00 as these went very quickly.you also need to book your al lecarte meals when you first arrive as these tend to get booked up quickly to.we watched a few shows at night the michael jackson is very good,plus the lion king as well.after 11 you have the karake bar,piano bar,disco and even a casino so plenty to keep you going till the early hours.we ate at the mexican which didnt think much of,grill house was very nice,gourmet was my favorite tho,italian wasnt up to much either. the rsort is big but after a few days you get use to it the map of the resort comes in very handy ,you get trains that pick you up from one end of the resort to the other and we only had to wait a few mins for it.all in all this resort gets top marks from us we had a fantastic time.
