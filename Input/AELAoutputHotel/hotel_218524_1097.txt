{"text":"Loved Excellence I found this resort to be amazing. I was there on my honeymoon from May 19 through May 26, 2007. It was one week of heaven. Despite what others might say I found the food to be really good. Altagracia a bartender makes some mean drinks and benjamin seranades you while you drink at his bar. I always tried the drink of the day and they were all great. The cocoloco is wonderful and also the sami sosa. The beach is beautiful but the water is very rough so be careful. The rooms were always up to par and the pools where emaculate. Now the entertainment staff was amazing.Isabel: boy can that girl dance, she can really teach a girl to dance the merenge.Fransisco: always has you laughingJulio: what can I say about Julio 50\/50 he was great, routing us on during beach volleyball and every activity he was coordinating. He said hello to us everyday and made us feel special. Luis: now he is the man. The boy can workout with you, dance with you, and play games. He was so fun and made us feel right at home. He always made an effort to talk to us and say hello everyday even if it was just for one minute.This resort was amazing we did go on one excursion but this is the type of trip that you are best off just staying at the resort. The Dominican Republic has a lot of poverty which was hard to see so if that bothers you stay at the resort. There is plenty to do. And make sure you check out channel 21!!!!!!!! The service was excellente. ","annotations":[]}
