{"text":"a review from normal people! Arrival - After a horrible trip that included a fog delay and loss of luggage (we were NOT impressed with Sunquest\/Skyservice), we arrived in Punta Cana after dark. Everything we had heard about the road from the airport is true and much more. It is the worst and such a long ride (longer in the dark it seems). We were so relieved to find this beautiful resort at the end of the day. We had cold towels and champagne in our hands immediately upon stepping off the bus. Check in went very smoothly, although we had a bit of trouble navigating around the resort in the dark.Rooms - We originally were in room 2623. This was a very clean, somewhat small room. It had everything one could possibly need, including a spectacular ocean view off the balcony. We later upgraded to a suite (7314). This was a beautiful room with double balcony with jacuzzi tub on the balcony. There is a living room, bedroom with plasma TV, huge bathroom area with walk-in closet. The housekeeping service was excellent, always clean and supplies always restocked. Turn down service includes soft music playing, bed turned down, chocolates, etc. There is nothing like it to make you feel pampered.Restaurants - We tried all the restaurants and they were all good. We never had any stomach troubles at all (that's a first!!). The buffet was never too crowded we found at any time of day. The a la cartes had a no reservation policy which sometimes made for a long wait if you were hungry! But if the wait was going to be too long, we were off to the buffet. Our favorites were the shrimp martini at El Patio and the chocolate mouse at Bourdeaux - to die forBars - There was always a friendly face ready to serve you behind the bar. Premium brand drinks, lots of variety....what more could you ask for? If you couldn't decide what to have, any of the bartenders always had a recommendation.Beach and Pools - It was always a bit windy at the beach, so aside from chewing a bit of sand, the beach was beautiful. There are big palm trees as well as shelters for shade, and the sand is beautiful fine powder. The pool is definitely the drawing card for this resort. There are none like it anywhere! It just goes on and on and there are plenty of floaties to hop on and float away the day. The only thing is, this place definitely plays the towel game. Since there are no towel cards, people can pick up 6 towels and leave them at various places at the beach and pool. We saw SO many prime spots that were basically unoccupied for hours and hours, but with towels on the chairs. We're just not sure how to remedy this problem since someone will always start this towel game - towel cards or not.Grounds - The grounds are immaculate and very well maintained.Activities - There are any number of activities one can choose to do here. There were a couple of days that an activity was listed on the daily newssheet, but it never happened. Not sure what this was all about, but it was not too big of a deal for us.Tours - We did not take any tours this time. We hired a cab and went to Plaza Bavarro one day (did I mention that Skyservice lost our luggage?). This is quite a large mall, but with the same old stuff as always - cheapy, cheapy and lots of work bartering..Conclusion - I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone. We would probably not go back, just because it is far away from anything and the road is just SO bad. We felt it was just too much travelling time to do anything off resort. The locals say that it will take maybe four or five years to finish the new road from the airport to the resort, we we would try again then. The resort itself is spectacular, and just the right size. As always, we were amazed by the Dominican people - such a happy, friendly, beautiful people.
