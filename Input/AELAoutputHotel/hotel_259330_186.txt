{"text":"What a awesome time just got back on tues feb 5 th and had a fantastic time. i was traveling with a group of eleven and the check in took us about ten minutes. i was the only one with a room to myself and had a great view of the ocean. the beach was amazing and was one of the best i have been too. the food was wonderful and loved the pizza and chicken and the beach restaurant. juan manuel that worked the day shift at the beach bar was awesome and always gave us frosted mugs to take to the beach. there was always guys walking the beach cleaning up and gathering the glasses and were very friendly. we went to the club part for dinner twice and was very good. i would not want to stay back in the club part but it was beautiful back there. my room was alway clean and didn't smell at all. the maid service was excellent and she turned down my bed every night. the sports bar and disco was fun. went there every night and the staff was very friendly. overall a great place and very beautiful setting. the staff was very friendly and helpful. the only complaint i had was with the staff in the gift shop. some things to help if you plan to stay here. take your own plastic glass and it with cut down with the garbage and make sure you stay at the grand paradise and not the club part as you have to take a trolley to the other part but there was always one every ten minutes. it helps if you know a bit of spanish and to get down to the beach early to reserve your beach chair. and this is a third world country so tip the staff and you will have no problems. also the sun is much more intence down there than it is in canada so make sure you have sunscreen on before you go down to the beach. hope this helps. if you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me.
