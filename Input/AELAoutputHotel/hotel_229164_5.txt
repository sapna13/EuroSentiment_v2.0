{"text":"Little room on the canal We booked a room at this hotel, despite the negative reviews and were not dissapointed. We stayed in room 317 (facing the Prinsengracht Canal) which increased the distance to the noise of the rail line. The World Cup was in full swing, and the local square was a gathering point for the fans in Orange. So the noise level might have been elevated over normal, but didn't keep us awake at night. It would have been quieter further North of the hotel's location (towards the Anne Frank Haus) but then again most people don't expect Amsterdam to be a quiet country setting.The room was clean and the bed comfortable. We were out walking the city most of the day, so we didn't see the staff much during our visit. From this perspective, I have no negative comments.Internet access worked if you were a T-Mobile customer, we aren't so we went without. No big loss, as it would have been a distraction.There is a nice bakery across the street and local grocery stores within a short walk. Walking the few blocks towards the square will give the choice of more restaraunts than one can easily choose from.I don't think that I would rate the hotel as a four star, but I'm not into pampering either so it wasn't a critical factor one way or another. Amsterdam was a stop over point for a business trip to Brussels, so I used the oppertunity to visit the Anne Frank Haus and the Van Gogh Museum.I'm afraid I'm getting a bit to old to enjoy the atmosphere of Amsterdam, but it was a nice visit none the less. The Dikker  Thijs Fenice Hotel is a reasonable place to stay, and very close to many of my areas of personal interest.
