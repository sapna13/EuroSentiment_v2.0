{"text":"Great location, good value, memorable stay! My girlfriend and I just got back from two nights at the Charlesmark. I was looking to stay somewhere centrally located, relatively inexpensive, and above all, memorable. The Charlesmark delivered in all of these areas.First, as others have noted, the location can't be beat. From the Charlesmark, if you walk at a decent pace, it's 30 seconds to a T stop, 45 seconds to the Boston Public Library, 3 minutes to the Trinity Church, Copley Plaza, or Newbury Street, and 5 minutes or so to the Boston Public Garden. BTW, the Parish Cafe (361 Boylston St.) had maybe the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life.Second, it's relatively cheap. $129 for the regular room, and $30 more for a slightly larger room. We stayed in a regular room on the top (6th) floor, but took a peek into one of the larger rooms while it was being cleaned. If you're extremely claustrophobic, maybe you'll want to get the larger room, but otherwise, you should probably save your money.Third, it was memorable. When we first opened the door to the room, my impression was My god, this room is small. But as we unpacked, and I started discovering the nice little touches around the room that make the absolute optimally-efficient use of the limited amount of space, I became more and more impressed. For example, most hotels I've stayed at have had a big dresser and a closet. Here, there were drawers that were concealed at the bottom of the foot of the platform-style bed, and sets of drawers to the sides of the headboard of the bed. There's a cabinet in the bottom of the AV-unit where you can hang clothes, and places to hang coats behind the door. The AV-unit also had a cabinet perfectly sized to hold a large carry-on bag, and a space at the top for a suitcase. Dimming lamps folded against the headboard of the platform bed. Also, there was a huge (7 ft or so tall by 4 ft wide) mirror against the wall, next to the window, creating the illusion of more space.Now, I'm a city-dweller writing from a relatively small condo in the heart of a city, so the Charlesmark hit a number of my sweet spots as far as preferences. In fact, I'm impressed with the layout and use of space to the point that I'm going to try to steal some of the elements of their design for my own place. However, I can see how someone with different tastes might feel a bit cramped in a Charlesmark room. If having a hotel room large enough to throw a football around in is your thing, then you'd probably be better off somewhere else. But if you want somewhere that's well-located, relatively cheap, and memorable, you might want to try the Charlesmark.
