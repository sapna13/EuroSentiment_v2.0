{"text":"very disappointing from louise, toronto, ontario canadafeb 14 to 21\/08i chose this hotel after reading a review in the C.A.A. (AAA) travelmagazine. the writer raved about the luxurious resort, etc.as soon as we arrived in the front lobby, i suspected that this resort was not premium,  this was confirmed when we entered our room. as soon as we opened the door the musty smell was overwhelming - i wished i brought a candle\/air freshner! also the room looked depressing as it was painted a dull taupy brown colour - at least we were in the 6 block so it was nice  quiet. the bathroom was pathetic - the toilet was so close to the tub  door that if you are a big person you would feel clausterphobic - the bathroom area really needs to be renovated  updated to be at a premium level. food was ok - was disappointed that there were only 3 a la carte  1 buffet at our resort (we could go the the ajoining properties but who wants to travel to get basically the same food?). the $60 charge at the french restaurant was a rip off don't bother going. the dominican a la carte was disgusting. buffet was ok (be careful they totally undercook hamburgers  sometimes the thicker cuts of fish)staff was not as friendly as we've encountered in other hotels around the carribean - some never even smiled once! be prepared to wait at front desk for anything even extra keys, money exchange  especially for the hospitality room key. we booked through signature vacations - our flight home was delayed  the signature people forgot to have their bus pick us up to take us to the airport- the rep. was not on duty but when we called her emergency cell# we got a recording.the hotel front desk wanted to charge us to have him call her. we had to take cabs to the airport  upon arrival found out our flight was further delayed.we took off at 2am, with a stopver in nassau to get fuel so arrived in toronto at 7am. i rate this trip a 3 out of 10  will not go back to d.r.  will never stay at a barcelo property.louise, toronto, ontariops i am also now suffering from traveller's sickness for over 1 week maybe a parasite(?)
