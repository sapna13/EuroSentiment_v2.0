{"text":"Down to Earth Paris We stayed at this recently renovated hotel for 6 nights in early April. Spotlessly clean and everything we wanted - comfortable bed, great location (on top of the Metro station for Place Monge and walking distance to Notre Dame, the Paris Mosque, the Pantheon, and so much more). Our room was on the 4th floor facing the street - double glazing meant cozy warm and also quiet. We paid 125euro (plus taxes) for a room for two people with a bath (although we had only booked a room with a shower). We arrived early from a very long flight and they were very accommodating and let us have our room straight away. I don't know if there is WIFI, but there is a laptop at reception with internet and access to a printer - no charge for printing. Some days we walked, some days we took the metro, we went all over Paris and always found when we'd had enough it was easy to get back home. The room was serviced and all the towels replaced every day. There is a short but reasonably priced room service menu. Breakfast is buffet for 11euro (no need to book, just rock up if you want to) and including cold meats, yoghurt, croissants, etc -- a good deal. Coffee was from a machine, however, and was not so great. Don't miss the market at Place Monge -- it operates Wednesday and Sunday but is better on Sudany. Not so touristy as most and full of actual Parisians doing their shopping. Awesome fruit, cheese, meats, fish, breads and a few stalls also with clothing\/crafts. We usually had breakfast at Cafe LeBarnum, which is a short work towards the river up rue Monge and looks scenically at a park, a church and a flower shop and traditional french breakfast (croissant, baguette with butter, juice, and your choice of coffee) for 8 euro. Beware of the tourist traps in nearby rue Mouffetard -- any restaurant which will seat you before 7.30pm is probably chock full of English speaking tourists and the food will be crap!
