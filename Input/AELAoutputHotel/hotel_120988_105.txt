{"text":"An experience designed to suck your wallet dry My wife and I are Hilton Diamond HHonors members; we've stayed at this property both in its former life and as a purpose-built new Hilton. As it's right on the airport, the property has one huge advantage: location.Making our reservation was a snap on Hilton's website. Check-in was even easier as we checked in and received our room assignment on-line; from the time we walked through the front door to crossing the threshold of our room, not more than five minutes passed. Rooms - even rooms at the end of hallways\/corner rooms are fairly small, more in line with what one would find in a newer European Hilton. Rooms are well furnished and our king bed had a wonderful duvet. On the negative side, the room HVAC air-flow is minimal and cooling the room took longer than expected.Our problem with this property is that aside from the fairly steep room rates, everything at this hotel is designed to extract additional fees and costs from guests. Let's start with overnight parking: US$30 (plus tips every time to arrive\/depart). Want to have internet access? That will be at least US$10. You've paid the additional cost of upgrading to the Executive Floor so you will have access to the lounge. In Europe, breakfasts, snacks, and evening treats are all complimentary together with beer, wine, and all spirits. Free. No cost. Included in the cost of paying for a room on the Executive Floor. Oh, no. But not at this Hilton. My wife was billed for more than US$10 for a single (small) glass of a routine Merlot. I could go on and on, but by now you have the idea. I suppose it's all about yield-management and enhancing the bottom line, but frankly there is a limit on what we will tolerate by way of being nickle and dimed. So, before we commit to another stay here, we are going to evaluate our other nearby Hilton family option here at Boston Logan: the close-by Embassy Suites.If you choose to stay here, fine, it's a nice property. But watch your wallet.
