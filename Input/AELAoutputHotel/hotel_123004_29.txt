{"text":"Glad I did stay at Holiday Inn Express Last Night! Stayed four nights at this hotel in late June with wife and two boys (7 and 4) while in town for a conference. The front desk staff (Jena and Jeff) were great from the moment we checked in. I had several questions about stores, buses, attractions, etc. and they eagerly answered them all. Being a Priority Club member, I was even greeted with cookies! I splurged for a King suite with jacuzzi tub - it was great to have the extra space - basically a standard bedroom that had a sofabed, with a smaller bedroom connected with a door. We did look out the back at the adjacent Holiday Inn, but the extra space made up for the lack of a view. The oversized jacuzzi tub was great - like having our own hot tub!Internet worked well, but does require an ethernet cable. I have just started carrying one with me all the time. There is also a small business center in the lobby with two computers and printers - great for printing boarding passes.The kids (and I) enjoyed the indoor pool that was actually heated. True, it's not huge, but it is ample. Hey, it's the only decent hotel in the downtown area that has a pool. You can walk to the Space Needle and adjacent museums and amusement park in 5 minutes. It's an easy walk with signals to cross streets. You can also walk to a bus stop in the downtown free bus ride zone in about 5-10 minutes. The free ride zone covers a large area. You really don't need a car here. We worked our way down to the waterfront one evening and had a great meal at Fishermans. We took a cab back and it was only $10, including a $2 tip. I parked a rental car here the first night - yes, its tight parking, but not nearly as bad as I expected from the previous reviews. I returned the car on the first Monday (original plan - we had it for a week touring around the state - see other reviews for Sheraton Airport Portland, OR; Quality Inn Ocean Shores, WA; Quality Inn Port Angeles, WA; Qualtiy Inn Downtown Victoria, BC) so didn't have to park the remaining nights. We ate a dinner at the adjacent Holiday Inn - fairly plain food, but kids eat free - nice budget break during a two-week trip!I used the washer\/dryer facilities one night - the detergent machine took my money - the front desk staff gladly gave me a box without question.Hint - if you have to have a rental car while in Seattle, reserve it from the downtown location - you can save ~$90 in taxes on a week's rental. It pays for the cab ride to the rental location and the town car ride from the HIExpress back to the airport and more. The hotel will arrange a town car to take you to the airport for a $30 flat rate - less than a metered cab fare.I would stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it for the staff service, pool, location near the Seattle Center complex (space needle, museums, etc) and proximity to the real downtown, considering the rates.
