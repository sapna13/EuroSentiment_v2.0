{"text":"Our home away from home it Italy We have stayed at the Belletini for a few days every winter for the past four years. In our travels all over Italy we have no trouble making friends and I can truly say there is NO place like the Belletini. The staff are the best trained I have ever seen in any hotel, and also the friendliest. The location is perfect on a little side street near the center and within a few minutes walk of everything interesting. Yes, you do have to look just a bit, to find the door and that's what they gave us eyes for. Really quite easy and for those who don't see well, just ask anyone in the neighborhood. Everyone around knows this hotel and how to get there.The breakfast is buffet style and excellent, also served by staff that know their jobs well and actually smile and talk to you. The rooms are quite spacious and comfortable, excellent linens and firm beds. Above all, immaculate.In addition to all of this the prize jewel of this place is its wonderful owner and host, Gina. Not only is she friendly and accommodating, she is one of the most knowledgeable people one could ever hope to meet when it comes to what to do or where to go in Florence. In a pinch she is also on the spot with good advice or help if needed.This is not a five star hotel, it is a three star home away from home and that's a thousand times better. ","annotations":[]}
