{"text":"Disappointing : great service cannot compensate for cramped rooms Soft side of this hotel is very good. Service excellent everywhere - from the front desk through the restaurants to housekeeping to the concierge and doormen. Really very good. And its position on the Marina is pleasant - bit downtowny, but really OK.The hardware - the room - is just nowhere near where you should be if you are aspiring to five stars and charging SD 410 ++.Our room was tiny with the bed taking up 80% of it. If there are two of you in the rooom, one is going to have to be on the bed. You expect this in older Japanese hotels, but not anywhere else at these rates. Other hotels in Singapore are more spacious and cheaper.As others here have commented, the mattress is hard. If you like hard, fine. Personally I could not sleep. Not helped by airconditioning that struggles to keep up with demand. So warm and humid nights spent on an uncomfortable bed. Bathroom is better - about the same size as the room? Has most of what you would expect, but materials and finish just not first class. Furniture in the room getting worn as well. Nice large cups for making tea or coffee. But the hotel information books bound in leather had swollen into the wooden slots in their drawer and could not be pulled out.Interior atrium public space is generous. Elsewhere the design of the building means the swimming pool and coffee terrace are squashed in between the hotel and the sidewalk.I was trying the Fullerton to see if it could improve on my usual Singapore hotel. Won't be going back. However good the service (and it is very good) it can't make up for the lack of comfort in the rooms.
