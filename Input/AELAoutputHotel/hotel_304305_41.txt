{"text":"Second time around This was actually our second stay at the Keio Plaza hotel. I wrote a review previously, based on our stay last year, but I thought I should write another.Rooms:This time we stayed for 2 nights at the begining of our trip to Japan and 7 nights at the end of our trip. For the first 2 nights, we stayed in a Plaza Comfort room. It was a nice room, especially for the price and definetly was a step up from last year when we stayed in the Superior room. After our 2 night stay, we were off to Kyoto and Osaka for 5 days and the hotel was kind enough to hold our luggage since we wanted to travel light. Upon our return, our luggage was waiting for us in our Plaza Comfort room however this is where I felt the first bit of dissapointment. The room (wasn't the same as our first 2 nights) was in fairly bad shape. One of the lights was burnt out in the washroom, there were marks on the walls and part of the carpet was coming up. We quickly called guest relations to ask if we could switch rooms, however they said they were fully booked for the night, but we could do so for the remainder of our stay. Now, aside from the room looking beat up, I still felt a bit let down, which was probably caused by the fact that we had just spent the last 3 nights in the Ritz Carlton in Osaka. So we decided to bite the bullet and pay for a Plaza Premier room and am I ever glad we did. For the extra $40 Canadian a night it was well worth it. Far more spacious and modern than our Comfort room and we got a kick out of the bedside light\/curtain controller. Next time we go again (3 years from now) we are going to book a Plaza Premier room again.HotelGreat as last always. Friendly staff and a great location. We did try the Korean restaurant this time for a bit of yakaniku. The meat was terrific but the price was a little steep (luckily we had a $50 meal voucher from the hotel)ConclusionWhile i'm sure there are even nicer hotels in Tokyo, I would still stay here since in my opinion, it provides the most bang for your buck. However I do recommend spending the extra bit and go for a Plaza Premier room.
