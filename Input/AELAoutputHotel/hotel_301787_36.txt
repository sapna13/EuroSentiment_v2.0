{"text":"Our Stay @ The Laguna Resort  Bali, well i never thought i would ever return. Boy, i was proven wrong. From the moment we touched down we both thought we were royalty. The smile on the Balinese people is worth gold medals all around. If i were a millionaire they would all be coming to my home and treated to the 5 star treatments that we received. Anyway enough of that talk till later on.To David and the team, although we never got to meet you personally the professionalism of the team reflected on how well a resort of this calibre should cruise. A personal greeting, escorted to room 115 lagoon access i should say, the only way to go, but if you can't get one of these rooms you will not be disappointed, as we met people who were staying in staying in garden view rooms who were just as impressed.Coffee and chocolates arrived in minutes of request from our butler Tom and the white chocolates were divine.Popping open a bottle of French bubbly started day one of our 5 night stay in paradise as the sign at the entrance of the resort says.The waters of the lagoon got the better of me so in i go. Sun beaming down, 30 degrees how could one resist.5 nights could easily i wish turn into 5 years. Would you like a drink from the bar sir, Bintang thankyou, make that two please, remembering i was not alone by the gentle nudge from my wife.Pizza followed, i thought of the waist line but who cares after all you are in paradise and if you are really care the fitness centre will more than accommodate your every need. But i needed to save room for the excellent cuisine the resort has on offer. Mee Goreng was on the cards there were no second thoughts and with views of the ocean a white wine in hand what more can one say.Waking the next day, was omelettes or cereal on the menu for breakfast, it really didn't matter as everything was there even a continental breakfast bar for those on the move, Cafe Lagoon will please every connoisseur. By the way Putra is a great host it is like you have known him for years. Save room for lunch, don't get too carried away.Afternoon tea at Mayang Sari is a must, sampling pastries and cuisine the restaurant has on offer is the best way to go.By now it was time to get back to the pool for a little gentle exercise meaning pool volleyball, one has to do something. It was southern hemisphere v northern and for someone of the 40 club i led the southern to a great victory. Well done.Not forgetting my room and pool access we head back their but not before a challenge of another game and time for tomorrows rematch.With huge beds and LCD screen and DVD player on call you can get very comfortable but you do want to enjoy what this resort has on offer so it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ back to the pool i go and to capture the sun i came in search of and the tan i got who needs a solarium.The amenities in the bathrooms are fantastic catering for your every need. I thought i had the best shower in town but i know now i only get the silver medal. With a big bath and bath salts you could lay there forever not forgetting a glass or two of bubbly.Slippers, bathrobes everything you could want is there.The Laguna Resort and Spa is there to please and you cannot go wrong. Don't forget to get a massage by the beach, you are in heaven even if you are ticklish like me, an hour is well worth the laugh.The ladies and gentlemen at reception and concierge are the best with any of our requests met there and then. It was sad to see people checking out and returning home knowing that our turn was soon to come, but hey we all know that just around the corner we will return.So David, thank you very much to your self and the team for making our stay a very memorable experience. I will be telling friends and colleagues of your resort so that they can share the same experience as we did. We can only wish we were their today. To all the guests that are with you today, Enjoy. Look forward to meeting you in the not to distant future.Regards,Dean Potakacc David CuddonGeneral Manager The Laguna Resort  Spa, Nusa Dua Bali E-mail: david.cuddon@luxurycollection.com ","annotations":[{"endOffset":826,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":816},{"endOffset":826,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":816},{"endOffset":890,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":885},{"endOffset":901,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":891},{"endOffset":890,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":885},{"endOffset":901,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":891},{"endOffset":890,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":885},{"endOffset":901,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":891},{"endOffset":1611,"mention":"Mee Goreng","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mie_goreng"],"startOffset":1601},{"endOffset":1611,"mention":"Mee Goreng","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mie_goreng"],"startOffset":1601},{"endOffset":1694,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1689},{"endOffset":2084,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":2081},{"endOffset":2128,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":2120},{"endOffset":2128,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":2120},{"endOffset":2381,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2377}]}
