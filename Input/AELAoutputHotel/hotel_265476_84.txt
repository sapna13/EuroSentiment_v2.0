{"text":"Charming little hotel My 80-year-old mother, my sister and her three daughters (age 17-30) just returned from Paris, where we stayed at the Hotel Londres Eiffel. In view of some of the negative recent feedback from reviewers, I wanted to add my opinions.First, the location is ideal. It was very convenient, with a lot of sights within walking distance (including of course the Eiffel Tower). A few blocks away is the Rue Cler area, a popular pedestrian-only street with lots of shops and restaurants; and there are many convenience stores and fine restaurants just around the corner from the hotel. Second, the hotel itself was impeccably clean. Our room was small, but not too small, and the bathroom was very nice and bigger than in most European hotels. The beds  pillows were very comfortable, and we heard no street noise whatsoever.Third, the staff was courteous, helpful and friendly. They assisted us with hotel recommendations, reservations, shuttle service reservations, etc. , -- and they speak English. We thought the breakfast was good: a selection of breads, crossants, cheese, ham, yogurt ,and cereal, along with fruit juices, tea, coffee and hot chocolate. This was perfect for all of us because we wanted something more substantial than croissants or pastries. The woman serving us every morning was very friendly and upbeat. An added bonus: I loved being able to use the hotel's internet connection in the lobby to send email to family back home. (The keyboard is French, but you can switch it to an English keyboard by clicking on the icon on the bottom right of the computer screen.)My family entourage all agreed that the Hotel Londres Eiffel was far better than other places they had stayed in Paris, and we all agreed we would stay here again. Next time I'm going with my husband, and this hotel is where we'll stay.
