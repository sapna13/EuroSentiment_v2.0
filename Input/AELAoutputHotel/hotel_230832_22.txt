{"text":"Great hotel! Spent 3 nights at the NH Duc in Barcelona before leaving on a cruise, and would recommend it to anyone!The location was right around the corner from Las Ramblas, close to the main areas and touristy spots. We were a little wary of staying so close to Las Ramblas because there were quite a few comments on tripadvisor about the noise when you book a hotel in this area, however the NH Duc is about 1-2 blocks off of the main street, and we were never bothered from the noise at all.The room was very clean, and spacious. We had a superior room with a king sized bed, and found the room and the washroom to be a nice size, and recently renovated. While it wasnt a bargain to stay here, at approx $250 US per night, it was definitely a nice place.If you are looking to see a lot of sites within a couple of days, I would definitely recommend purchasing the 'hop on hop off' double decker bus tickets, we were able to see so much of Barcelona in a short time, and it was very easy and stree free. Narrated explanations of all the sites in a variety of languages make it very tourist-friendly. The main pick-up\/drop-off area for these buses were only a couple blocks away.The only thing I would recommend against is purchasing breakfast from the hotel. It was 15 euros per person, and only provided a small buffet of cold dishes. Perhaps I am just not used to European breakfast tastes, but I did not find it was good value for the cost. About 3 minutes away there are many little cafes and restaurants along the Ramblas that offer much better value, and even a couple who served traditional hot English breakfasts with eggs, etc for half the price.Overall, great experience from the NH Duc, I would definitely stay here again!
