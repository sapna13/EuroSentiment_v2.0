{"text":"Will definitely return to the Melia Our family of 4 stayed at the Melia Caribe Tropical July 2-9. We were originally booked into the Tropical side of the resort but upgraded to Royal Service after the first night. Our original room was a family jr suite in building 2, near the beach and the Tropical pool where all the kids activities are, so the location was good but I felt the accomodations were a bit dated and not as clean as I would have liked (curtains pulling away from rods unfixed, gaps in door leading outside and a large open hole in ceiling of bathroom above the shower which made me nervous). The a\/c was extremely loud and it was on an access road where we could hear vehicles going by all night. The next morning we chose to pay the additional cost to move to Royal Service (RS) and were so happy that we did. It was like night  day! The rooms in RS were updated with gorgeous jacuzzi tub, marble bathroom  private bedroom. Once we moved to RS, we were in walking distance to all the restaurants and bars rather than having to take the tram back and forth (resort is massive). The food was very good to terrific at all the restaurants we tried but especially at the Gabi. We had no problem getting reservations to all the restaurants we wanted. Pools and beach area are stunning and clean with plenty of chairs and lots of shade. There was seaweed on the beach but it was cleaned up twice a day. Tipping and speaking a bit of spanish definitely helped us get what we wanted. We found everyone to be friendly and thoroughly enjoyed our trip once we made the move . Our kids aged 9  5 were engaged the whole week with water activities  only wanted one day at kids club, where they did the obstacle course\/rock climbing  euro bungee for a small fee. We never got sick and we only drank bottled water, which they clearly tell you to do even for brushing our teeth. We were approached a couple of times about the timeshare but we were firm about our disinterest and it wasn't a problem. Overall, we felt our trip and this resort were wonderful but would definitely recommend the Royal Service vs regular.
