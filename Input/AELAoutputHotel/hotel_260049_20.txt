{"text":"Not recommended! Amsterdam was great, but this hostel\/hotel was absolutely horrible. My sister and I had booked it online and when we arrived we found that the rooms looked nothing like the photos. We had booked a private room with bath that turned out to be ridiculously small and depressing, with a tiny closet pushed up against the only window. We were disappointed, but decided that we wouldn't be in our rooms much anyway, so what would it matter? Besides, the price was right and we weren't expecting anything large or fancy (but it would have been nice if the room looked even remotely as advertsised!). Unfortunately we arrived back to our room that night to find the ceiling leaking and dirty water all over the floor. We were moved to a new room (after much insistance on our part) that was larger, but again it looked nothing like the photos online. We really tried to be good sports about it, not wanting our accomodation to ruin our trip. The breaking point came when my sister woke up with red marks all over her body that were diagnosed as bedbug bites, and a few days later (we'd left by this point) the same thing happened to me. I wish I'd seen these reviews earlier! I wasn't bothered by the location - we walked everywhere and found it pretty central - but I was bothered about the place being so decrepit and dirty, and of course a home to bedbugs. Do not stay here. A bit more searching will turn up places in the same price range, with better reviews. Two friends of ours were also in Amsterdam at the same time and stayed in a tiny room that had charm and was clean and central, and only slightly more expensive that what we'd paid. I wish I remembered the name of it but it's nice to know it's there, and with a little luck (more research really) I'll stay there on my next visit. ","annotations":[]}
