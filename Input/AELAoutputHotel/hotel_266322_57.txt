{"text":"not a good accomodation I stayed here with my mother over Thanksgiving weekend and found the stay very unpleasant. Although Ben Bethel will write back with defensive excuses, as I saw he did to my mother, I will give the truth from my perspective:- It was very cold in the room. I called guest services to ask why the heater in our room was not working and they stated that The days are still very warm in Phoenix so the hotel has not yet setup it's heating system. I then asked if they even had a spaceheater and the did not. I am from Flagstaff and feel like I have a pretty good tolerance of the cold, but this was ridiculous.- The breakfast (if you can even call it that) was truly only bread--muffins and bagels (not even juice). I am curious to know what this upgrade could possibly be in December. Anything is better than what it is currently.- The neighborhood is not nice. I saw a gun shop just five blocks away. Lots of construction going on with the roads as well, but at least not directly where the hotel is.- Was not very impressed with the smell of the hallways--did not get an overall feeling of things being 'fresh'.- The bathroom in the executive suite (supposedly an upgrade--I wouldn't want to find out what we had before) had a shower that was impossible to change the heat settings for unless you struggled with both hands pushing hard one direction or another to change it. Hope you like the temperature you finally get it at because it's nearly impossible to change after it's on.I travel a lot so maybe my expectations are high, but I stay in both moderate--expensive hotels and feel like I have a fair judgment on what is reasonable to expect. This hotel did not meet my minimum expectations for comfort.
