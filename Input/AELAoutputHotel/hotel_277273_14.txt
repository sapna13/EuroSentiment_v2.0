{"text":"I couldn't stay there!!! It looks like I have stayed in a different place than most of other people who wrote their reviews about Senator Gran Via. Let me describe my experience:1) Room √à√\u2020\u2022?we got room 609, a spacious one, in the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ back corner. It has a large balcony facing Calle de la Montera, but balcony blinds and black-out curtains (dirty and full of holes) don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ close properly, so we had plenty of sunlight in the morning. Except for the bed, everything in the room is old and mould-smelling. The towels are so worn out that are practically transparent.2) Location √à√\u2020\u2022?the hotel is located in a very central point of Madrid and there is a metro station just in front of it. However, it was not pleasant to walk down Calle de la Montera with many prostitutes standing, and their costumers going in and out (day and night) clubs located in that street. Main attractions in Madrid are very close to each other, so I would√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe preferred to stay 4 or 5 blocks away from there, in the direction of Plaza de Santa Ana and Paseo del Prado, which are much nicer regions.3) Breakfast √à√\u2020\u2022?it was the only good thing about the hotel. 4) Wireless Internet connection √à√\u2020\u2022?my husband had work to do during our stay, so I booked the hotel since they promised free wireless internet connection. It wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ working when we arrived, because of a problem with their router, but they said it would be fixed in the following day, so my husband used their computer (paying 1 Euro each 10 minutes). Next day it was still not working, so a lady at the front desk suggested the wireline connection, accessible through the TV, which costs 20 Euros each 24 hours. I told this lady that hotel shouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ charge us for that service, considering that their promised free wireless connection wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ working. She told me only the manager could authorize it and asked me to be back the next day because the manager had already left.5) Check-out √à√\u2020\u2022?the next day, after 48 hours of no proper solution to the router problem, my husband and I decided to leave the hotel (we were supposed to stay there for 4 days). Of course we had to book another hotel (an excellent one, by the way √à√\u2020\u2022?Hotel Villa Real) using their 1 Euro for 10 minute internet, but I was relieved to leave that place. Anyway, when I announced we were leaving earlier, they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ care nor apologized to us, which I think would be the least they could have done after all the trouble.Summarizing, I really do not recommend this hotel.
