{"text":"Beautiful, Nice,  This resort was fantastic. It was the first all-inclusive for my wife and I and it was our first trip to the DR so overall it was a new experience. We would do it again in a heartbeat, especially for the relatively low cost.From Nashville it was two easy 2-hour flights (stop in Miami) and then a 1-hour busride to the resort. The busride wasn't fun, obviously, but it wasn't painful either.The resort, overall, is extremely nice. Everything is very well kept, clean, etc. The rooms were very clean and the pictures that we saw while doing our research were exactly what we got, which we were impressed with. It wasn't like the fast-food hamburger that makes your mouth water on TV but leaves something to be desired in real life. They were as-advertised.The most impressionable thing for us was the service. We were skeptical about the all-inclusive part of the trip. Were we going to have to fight for everything we wanted? Would we have to tip? If we didn't tip, would we get stiffed? We quickly learned that any of these reservations we had were unnecessary. Everyone was willing to go out of their way to make sure we were happy. Instead of trying to serve as little as possible, like I thought they would, they never acted like we were asking for too much. For example, one day we were lounging by one of the two awesome pools, it was a little after noon. We were about to go in for lunch when one of the guys brought out a dozen 12 pepperoni pizzas. We tipped him $1 and enjoyed a nice lunch by the pool. Tipping was appreciated but it wasn't required. But with the level of service we received, we tipped almost every time. Just a simple dollar goes a long way down there, so take a lot of singles with you.The food. They had seven restaurants on the resort, each of them a different genre, and we enjoyed them all. Our favorite was the French restaurant. In our experience, the beef was a safe bet almost everywhere but sometimes the chicken and pork weren't up to par. For first-timers, we were very impressed, and we heard from some all-inclusive resort veterans that although it wasn't the best they'd had, it was still very good.We would highly recommend Excellence Punta Cana. There are tons of activities during the day (look out for Julio at the beach volleyball court, he's very friendly and very knowledgeable) and a show each night, followed by live music at the piano bar or dancing at the disco. It was mostly young(er) couples, 35 and below, but there were also several older couples and they looked to be having a good time as well. I would not recommend this for a bachelor party. It would be OK for a girls' trip (my wife says) but don't expect to see many single people there.
