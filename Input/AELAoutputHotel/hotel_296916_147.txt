{"text":"Cool Style in Centre of town We stayed here for three nights and paid √ä√£¬¢71 per night room only. Breakfast is an extra √à√\u2020√ü?5 per person and is a tad overpriced for what you can get.The reception area is very austere but our room was great. We got an upgrade to a junior suite. The colour themes of the Jazz might take some getting used to but we found it to be fine. The bathroom was kitted out with black marble tiles throughout and white porcelain. It had both a separate shower and a bath with a shower. Plenty of towels. The beds were firm and comfortable. There's a minibar (not too expensive) but no hot beverages in the room.The hotel is exceedingly well situated for the centre of activity in Barcelona, just a couple of blocks from Placa de Catalunya but far enough away from the noise of the Ramblas. There's some traffic noise even through the double glazing and you can hear the rumbleof the Metro trains as far as the sixth floor but unless you're really very fussy about sound these won't disturb you.If arriving by bus from the Airport (√à√\u2020√ü?.90) dismount at Universitat as this stop is less than 2 mins walk from the hotel. The service is quick and easy.To return by bus it's necessary to go Placa de Catalunya. The are many sights to be seen in Barcelona and the 'Bus Turistico' covers most of these in 2 separate 2hr long circuits from Placa de Catalunya (√à√\u2020√ü?9 or √à√\u2020√ü?3 if spread over 2 days).The bar shuts at midnight at weekends, 11pm other days. This is a 3 star hotel and there's no night porterage.If dining out the dozens of tapas bars offer great value. The same can't be said of the two restaurants that we used: Mussol on Carrer de Casp whose food definitions left a lot to be desired and who billed us in our local currency at poor exchange rates despite our refusal to sign an agreement to this action.El Gran Restaurant on Carrer d'Avinyo which despite an interesting decor rushed us through our courses at breakneck speed.
