{"text":"Prime Location  My girlfriend found the Chancellor through TripAdvisor, and after looking at a few other places, she and I decided this was the place for us. After our stay in late March, early April, we are not disappointed. The hotel was clean, the staff was nice (willing to help with whatever we asked - be it directions, advice, etc), and the location is excellent for access to the cable cars, buses, Chinatown, the financial district, and of course, Union Square. There is a coffee shop next door, and a Walgreens just up the block. We bought our MUNI pass at the desk (the 3 day pass was the best for us). The rooms are small, but not tight. You have a large closet, a comfortable bed, and you can even pick from a number of pillow types (down, fiber, poly, buckwheat, bead, etc) at no extra cost (I've never seen this before - and it was a nice feature). We couldn't get the internet to work for us, but that wasn't really an issue since 1) we didn't need to get online much and 2) they have a computer\/printer in the lobby for your use. The staff worked to get our computer up and running on their wireless (and would have done more if we had wanted). All in all, the cost of the hotel is not the cheapest in town, but the value is very high due to location, amenities, and the overall price-point of everything in SF. If we don't stay here again, it would only be because we wanted to try another part of town - we have no complaints about the hotel.
