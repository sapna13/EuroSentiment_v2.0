{"text":"Great Hotel My wife  I stayed at the Hilton Paris Arc De Triomphe for 7 nights from Wed May 23 √à√\u2020\u2022?Wed May 30, 2007. The lobby and a joining courtyard are quite impressive. The bellmen, concierge, and front desk staff were cordial. After checking in the quest services manager greeted us as well. Most high-rise buildings in Paris are limited to the La Defense business area. The Hilton Paris Arc De Triomphe is not in that area and as such is only 7 stories tall. Executive suits are on floors 6  7, we were given a room on the 5th floor with a view of the lovely courtyard. The room was modern and impressive. The concierge and other staff spoke English. There was only a mini-bar in the room, and they did not have spare refrigerators, so I had them clear it so that we could use it as a refrigerator. They did so without complaint.The area around the hotel is upscale. There are many embassies nearby. There are several brasserie in walking distance. The Arc de Triumphe actually is not that close √à√\u2020\u2022?about a 15 √à√\u2020\u2022?20 minute walk. No convenience stores close, however. There is subway transportation at about a 15 minute walk, though we used the taxis that were readily available out front. We had drinks at the lobby bar after returning from seeing the Eiffel Tower one evening. The service and drinks were great.All-in-all the hotel definitely deserves its 4 star rating if not more. I would definitely stay there again if visiting Paris in the future. ","annotations":[]}
