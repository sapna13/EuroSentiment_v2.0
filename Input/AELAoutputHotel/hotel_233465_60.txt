{"text":"Great location  Just returned from a 3-night stay July 19-23, 2007. Great location. Excellent help from desk staff (especially Moun) on restaurant recs, how to get places, free coffee\/tea in AM . (First day I actually had to pay 4 euros for a cup a tea at the nearby bakery). Rooms were a little small but had everything you need - safe, small refrigerator (just take the honor bar stuff out), hair dryer, towel dryer. We moved the twin beds around a bit to give us more room between them (put the nightstand between the beds). We had room 24 - there are only 20 rooms in this hotel (4 per foor, with 5 floors, breakfast room is in a downstair cave). Very close to bakery and Monoprix and shopping area and Louvre. Recommended restaurants were very French (what we wanted) and one was very reasonable (12 euro fixed price dinner).Loved the clean bathroom - ours had a tub and afer a long day of walking around Paris a hot bath felt great. The open shower door was not a problem; floor got a little wet, but we just wiped up with the towel floor mat. The rooms were very well sound-insulated (as long as the windows were closed). The AC worked well, albeit the first night we did get wifts of cigarette smoke  woke up red-eyed. Last few nights we didn't notice this issue. The hotel is an area that appears to be the Japantown of Paris, which takes a little away from the atmosphere, but it did help us find the place when we were a little disoriented. It is only a short block to Opera Blvd. Would stay here again as the convenience of the location was excellent.We paid 116 euro per night (on-line special pricing for July). Others we were looking at were 140 euro per night and farther out. We also wanted the AC!!
