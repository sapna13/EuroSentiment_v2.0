{"text":"Fantastic hotel, would go back tomorrow!!!!!!!! Myself and my fiance stayed at the Grand Palladium Punta Cana resort from the 6th - 20th October and i must say neither of us wanted to leave. We stayed in block 2000 which was close to the beach, reception and the lobby and our room 2128 was perfect. Our mini bar was stocked everyday with water, beer and soft drink and the maids cleaned the room everyday.The resort is huge so the train is a must if your a little lazy like me! It takes about 15 minutes to get around and you can just hop on an off as you like. The food in the main buffet restaurant was amazing with something different everynight. The only thing that we found a little annoying was the fact that my fiance didnt pack any long trousers so we couldn't dine in any of the a la carte restaurants, we thought he might have got away with wearing 3 quarter trousers but they were having none of it! nevermind the food in the buffet was very nice and there was so much to choose from we never got bored. The drinks in all the bars were really good an were pretty stong definately not watered down. The staff on the resort are brilliant there gave first class service from the guys at the beach and pool bars to the waiters in the restaurants there work so hard for very little money. The do appreciate little tips which we gave them every couple of days.All in all we had a fantastic holiday, met some great people and did some great trips, the monster truck, saona island and a catamaran cruise and were planning to go back for 2 weeks in 2010. Wish we could go back next year but were on honeymoon in mexico!!! Any questions don't hesitate to get in touch.
