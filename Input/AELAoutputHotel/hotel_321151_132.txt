{"text":"Mainly Excellent Stayed at this Hotel from 12th to 20th November inclusive. From arrival to departure all the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful, always willing to go the extra mile to make sure everything was OK. Special mention must be made of the concierge(s) to whom nothing was too much trouble. Whilst we had one of the smaller rooms this was comfortable and clean. Given that we were only using it for sleeping, it was entirely adequate for our purposes. The Hotel is modern, the decor is excellent and the public rooms good. It is ideally situated, close to Newbury Street and the Prudential Centre and Copley Place Even Downtown Crossing, Fanueil and Quincey market are all within a 15 - 20 minute walk. Given that we were there a week the charge of $27 for a Coffee Maker was reasonable.OK - what about the negatives. Our room was at the rear of the Hotel and was quite noisy, we were awakened every morning between 0530 and 0600 by garbage collection and deliveries. The much vaunted Cuffs Bar is OK if you beloing to the younger set and can tolerate 100+ Decibels, given the layout this noise also percolates into Il Barista upstairs. It also 'drove us' to eat out of the Hotel every night.Whilst we were there the staff in Il Barista stopped serving at 2200 hrs (no way did we want to venture into Cuffs) which in a Hotel of this quality is deplorable.The Reading Room is very under utilised - an oasis of calm which could be better used - tip - buy your drinks and take them there!For a Hotel of this quality to run out of supplies for the Coffee Maker, Corn Flakes and Bran Flakes is really not on.However all the negatives above should be taken in the context of - yes we would definitely return - a little more attention to the 'extra' bits would make this a really excellent hotel - Recommended.
