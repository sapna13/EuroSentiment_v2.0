{"text":"really nice but caution for wheelchair users or toddlers We stayed here with our 1 year old son for the 3 kings parade and christmas markets. Flying from Bournemouth to Girona airport is very simple and the airport bus waits for the flight. A return to the bus station is 24 euros each and is extremely punctual and efficient (on the return as well). It takes 1hr 10 mins into the station. We then picked up a taxi from upstairs which cost 8 euros and took about 10 minutes.We were put in the new wing which is minimally and tastefully decorated. Good points are wheel chair access into the building but the lifts are very small, some of the spaces in the room again are very narrow so difficulties manoevering a wheel chair but the beds are adjustable and there was a closimat toilet if you could get into the bathroom. The breakfast which is 11 euros per person is up some stairs and there is no other access. Great coffee and very freshly squeezed orange juice and a good range of pastries and cold cuts.Why caution for toddlers - huge staircases leading off open corridors - its a long way down! You pay for a cot 10 euros a night but they do have a high chair. No evening meal service or room service or even tea and coffee making facilities and the restaurants on Las Rambas are limited for small kids unless you want fast food. The staff as previously said are all charming and the majority speak very good English. A nice place ","annotations":[{"endOffset":924,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":918},{"endOffset":924,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":918},{"endOffset":924,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":918},{"endOffset":924,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":918},{"endOffset":992,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":984},{"endOffset":1006,"mention":"cold cuts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cold_cut"],"startOffset":997},{"endOffset":1006,"mention":"cold cuts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cold_cut"],"startOffset":997},{"endOffset":1006,"mention":"cold cuts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cold_cut"],"startOffset":997},{"endOffset":1006,"mention":"cold cuts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cold_cut"],"startOffset":997},{"endOffset":1217,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1214},{"endOffset":1228,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1222}]}
