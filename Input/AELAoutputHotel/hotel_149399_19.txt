{"text":"An amazing honeymoon at the Melia Tropical I just want to start by saying 'Wow'. After reading many of the reviews on here i was slightly apprehensive if we had made the right choice of hotel for our honeymoon. I can safely say we made the right decision. We booked Royal Service, which included private beach, seperate pool, golf buggies to take you wherever you wanted as the complex was very large, in the heat it was nice to hop on the back of a golf buggy. The main part of the hotel was just as nice, had a train running around the area to take people from A to B, we did not see inside the accommdations.The transfer from the airport was 25 mins and we got to the check in desk and got in the queue - only to realise as we had booked royal service - we got whisked off to a seperate check in with drink on arrival and took straight to our accommdation. This i was not prepared for, we had the master suite - royal service but had only booked junior suite so was pleasantly surprised. The accommodation comprised of Kitchen area and large fridge, dining area, breakfast bar, lounge, 2 x flat creen tvs, cd player, jacuzzi in the dressing area, large bedroom with flatscreen tv and then bathroom, very spacious and the air conditioning was amazing - as we needed it with the heat!We had breakfast each day at the Gabi, which is the royal service restaurant, the food was delicious and the breakfast buffet changed some of the items each day which was nice.We ate at the Gabi one night, it can be buffet or a la carte. Our favourite restaurant was the Mexican, we ate their twice. We also ate at the Dominican, American, Italian - they were all lovely. The waiters cannot do not enough for you and your glass was never empty.The entertainment in the evening was varied. We chose to watch a few shows and also enjoy the slot machines in the casino.We spent most days either by the royal service pool or on the beach. The pool had a little grill area, where you could get snacks e.g hot dogs, nachos, chicken, fries, popcorn, salad and pizza if you didn't want to have a sit down meal. This pool also had a swim up bar, i loved this!The main beach had a buffet restaurant which we enjoyed at lunch time, there were 100s of dishes on offer, spoilt for choice. My husband is very 'picky' with his food and he did not starve to say the least.There are lots of excursions to choose from either from reception or by the beach for the water-sports. We enjoyed the panoramic glass bottom boat tour, although i got sea-sick :(I could go on and on about this wonderful hotel, maid service was to a very high standard and always left a chocolate or a little flower on our bed. The gardens all around the hotel were amazing and so green.The time share people got a little annoying, they start off by syaing have you seen 'this invitation' just stick to your guns and say no - that is if you don't want to go, as we didn't!The hotel truly was brilliant and i could not fault it, please do email me if you need any help!
