{"text":"Expectations exceeded I found the Hotel Pulitzer here on TA. It seemed to be in the perfect location for exploring Barcelona and the hotel itself looked like somewhere I'd like to stay.My expectations were far exceeded.First, I was extrememly impressed with the managers habit of responding to every review here on TA. Also his invitation to reviewers to contact him if they were returning. I E-mailed him to tell him of my upcoming visit. I received a response very quickly asking if I had any special requests or needed anything.It is this kind of detail that makes this hotel so special.The Pulitzers location is perfect for exploring Barclona. It is directly off of Placa de Catalunya and is a few minute walk to the top of La Rambla and into the Gothic area. I had read in many reviews here that the rooms were small. I didn't find this to be true. While certainly not huge they were big enough for a plesant stay. All of the rooms I saw seemed to be the same size. They are long and narrow, There was a big wardrobe in my room with more than enough room for all of my clothes and my luggage. There was an arm chair at one end with a chest\/desk unit with a safe. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very well appointed and very comfortable. My room was spotlessly clean and the housekeepers did a great job everyday.This is a very modern design hotel with really nice attention to details. The lobby, bar area and restaurant are very nice and beautifully decorated. The staff of the hotel were extrememly nice and friendly. All of the people at the desk spoke English. They all worked hard to insure that my stay was a good one, meeting every request with a smile and helping in any way they could.I also have to mention the beautiful roof top terrace. Very comfortable with big couches and several seating areas.The two things that I read about in other reviews that I will agree with is the poor placement of the televisions and the tissue packets. I didn't find either to be a problem. This hotel is so nice, pack your own tissues.
