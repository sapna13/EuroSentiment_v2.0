{"text":"Lovely holiday We stayed for 4 nights and then travelled to the Loire Valley for 3 nights and returned here for 6 more nights with 5 rooms booked for 11 of us. The staff were extremely helpful and kind. The location is good - walking distance to the Eiffel Tower, Napoleon's Tomb. Anywhere in Paris central should be fine as the metro is excellent with stations everywhere if you don't want to walk (unlike Rome!). This area is fairly quiet but has all the necessary markets, patisseries, etc you need within 2 min walk. The sight of the Eiffel Tower out the window every day was magic. You need to have a room number ending in 5 or 6 (preferably 5 as this is the corner) to see it. Do not have a first floor room as the building is lit up at night and the lights shine into the room, no matter how much you fiddle with the curtains! Other floors didn't seem to have this problem. Rooms ending in 4 or 5 have the toilet separate to the bathroom which was very useful. Breakfast is downstairs in the basement so no natural light or view. We ate at local cafes every morning once we got used to just having a croissant or tartine with coffee. Paul's Patisserie chain is excellent - good value, cheap, nice atmosphere. We found it easier to have a good size lunch in a restaurant and then just bread, ham, cheese and wine in our room most nights. Rooms were very clean. We would definitely book this hotel again.
