{"text":"I almost cried.... I am writing this via the expensive, though reliable and fast wireless internet connection. I arrived this morning, full of excitement at being back in Amsterdam for the first time in 22 years. Arriving outside the hotel, I was shocked. It looks terrible, dingy and unkempt. Reception was harried, arguing with some fellow guests over problems with their room. Not a good sign. I then made my way up to my room... to find a shoe box. It was so small that the chairs at the desk do not fit, the door to the bathroom needs to be closed so you can find the toilet, and the decor is very very tired. The corridors are tiny and cramped, and the hotel generally smells stale. The view at the back of the hotel is depressing. I was genuinely shocked at the standard of this hotel. I've just opened the minibar, but not had anything, so will have to see if that pops up on the bill at check out. Positives - the location is simply superb. I walked off my post arrival funk with a good long walk and window shop, and am looking forward to exploring the surrounds tonight with business colleagues. The shower worked well - maybe I was lucky?I have no basis of comparison with other hotels in the area, but I suspect to get the best out of this place, you need to beg, borrow or steal for an upgraded room... which my business booking did not allow. Would I bring my wife and children back? Not to this room....all the best! ","annotations":[]}
