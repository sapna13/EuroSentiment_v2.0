{"text":"Excellent Hotel The Harbour Plaza Metropolis in HK was recommended to me on this forum, and I am so pleased I took this advice and stayed there. I was pleasantly surprised on arrival, this is indeed a very nice hotel in HK - good 4 star standard and perfectly adequate and nice for a couple of nights or longer stay. The staff on check in were polite, helpful, friendly, courteous and efficient. The room I had was quite small but perfectly comfortable and adequate. The breakfast served (buffet style) was extensive, hot and catered for both Chinese and Western tastes very well, but the most spectacular was the evening buffet dinner. What a feast! This was very busy though, so you might need to book if you want to be sure to get in, but they had almost everything you could imagine for about 35 British Pounds - from steak, fish, chicken, pork, to lovely selection of salads, starters, chinese food, chocolate fountain, fresh crepes made to order and also souffle cooked to perfection while you wait. Overall - exceptional and would give this hotel 9\/10 for everything. The only downside \/ well perhaps not really, is that it is a little out of the centre of HK, but there is a shuttle bus every 20 mins which is never full and being just out of the centre means I think it might actually be a bit quieter. This was no problem for us, also as taxis are so so cheap, travel around HK is really no problem at all.
