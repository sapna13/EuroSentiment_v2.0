{"text":"Warm and Friendly We just returned from a 2.5 week trip throught Europe, with Paris being on of our stops. While in Paris we stayed at the Hotel Valadon for 4 nights. We could not have been more satisfied with out stay. Here are the pro's and con's of our stay:Pro's: Hospitality: Victor, Maria, Chrystal (I hope I spelled that right!), even housekeeping, were all friendly and warm. Paris was a rough and rather rude city (especially my 100% American husband!), so it was nice to know that you would at least wake up to breakfast served with a smile. The rooms are very clean, the bed and comforter are very comfortable, and the heater in the room was a HUGE plus!Breakfast: Victor's jams are one of the yummiest things I have ever tasted in my 26 years. We tried as many flavors as we could and all were great! We bought a strawberry and 2 Mirabelle to take home. Breakfast would not have been the same without Othello! He is such a sweet dog. He'll sit by you the entire time you eat (of course with hopes you'll share!), staring at you with puppy eyes. FYI: if you sneak him a little peice, he'll pat you're leg to ask you for more! Sorry Maria!!!location: right in the heart of Rue Cler. We ate from the markets everyday. They have a delicious plethora of fresh and delicious food without breaking your bank. The metro is about a 4 minute walk to Ecole Militare stop. The Eifel Tower is about 10 minutes away, as is the Rodin museum. Con's: Honestly, I have nothing bad to say about this hotel, but as an American, I can see how some fellow Americans may perceive this place. The rooms are small, as are the showers and bathroom. The beds are not the huge, Seilly Posterpedic bed we are acustomed to. Yes, the tv only has 2 channels, and yes, they are CNN. HOWEVER, we stayed at 6 other hotels in Europe and ALL OF THEM only have CNN in english!!! Whatever. try watching Dora the Explorer in french; you might learn something! There isn't much nightlife in this area of the city, but the metro is so conviently located that you can just jump on it to get to such an area.I can not wait to return to Paris and I will definetly return to the Hotel Valadon on our next trip!
