{"text":"Excellence Is Fantastic!!!!! We have just returned from excellence punta cana and had a great time. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with great service from the front desk, Pauline was fantastic. She took care of us from the moment we arrived, right to our last day there. We stayed 2 weeks and wished we could stay another 2 weeks. We have travelled all over the carribean and no other hotel gives service like this one. These guys know what they are doing and that's why this hotel is called excellence! The rooms are clean, the restaurants are great, our favorite was Chez Isabelle and the Spice, our least favorite was the Lobster House. You must eat at the Grill for lunch, everything on the menu was great. Toscana was great for dinner as well, if you like risotto, then you'll like this italian restaurant. Even room service was great and always arrived hot and with a smile. The entertainment staff was fantastic. These people work their butts off to ensure that you are having a great time. You must meet Rosemary and Innes from the entertainment, they're great. As far as excursions, we booked them through Happy Harry at the activity centre where you rent the boggy boards. He'll be sure to hook you up with any tour you want at the best prices and with a smile. As far as the beach goes, you are on the Atlantic side which has more waves then the carribean side but let me tell you how much fun that is. If you are not a good swimmer, then stay closer to the beach. Make sure you get a boggy board from Happy Harry and you'll have a blast in the water. Beach service is great, you don't have to get off your chair for a drink, they come to you. The best advice I can give you is to bring lots of dollar bills, these people deserve every penny of it. We tipped more here then any other place we have been. They will remember you when you do so and the service becomes that more spectacular. We met people from all around the world who have travelled here before and continue to come back to excellence, we will be back and miss them all so much. You will not be disappointed with this hotel. One more thing that might be useful, we stayed in the excellence club, our room was 8007, the building was a little newer, rooms were nicer, but the club is worth the extra money. We ate at the club a few times for lunch and dinner and for snacks and the food was great. It is an exclusive lounge with comfy chairs and a t.v. Very quiet and a nice change. To sum up our vacation, 10 out of 10!!!!
