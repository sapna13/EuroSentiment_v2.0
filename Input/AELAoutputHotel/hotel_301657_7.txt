{"text":"Top Notch base in Tokyo Stayed here on the way to Australia earlier this year for three days, booked it totally on the strength of reviews on this site and was not let down. Got the Narita Express to Tokyo Station and a taxi from there. Until you have had time to explore the area I would take this approach to the hotel. Underground there is a warren of subway walkways and it can be a little disorientating after a 12 hour flight. It is much simpler to just grab a cab and roll up to the front door. I loved the lobby and reception desk. It was a beautiful day and the backdrop of the Tower and cityscape of Tokyo was a fantastic welcome to the hotel and to the city. Staff are not falling over themselves to make you feel at home, but neither are they rude. Generally I found the service in Tokyo awesome, they are a class apart, very very polite and very friendly.I had emailed in advance to request a room with a view and an early check-in, they duly obliged, which I was most appreciative of as it was 9 am. The hotel is in a great location and is well appointed. We got a great rate and after shopping around I don't really see where you would get better value in the city. The subway system is really easy to get the hang of, surprisingly, as I had been led to believe it was indecipherable. I loved Tokyo, every minute of it and will be returning for longer as soon as i possibly can. The Park Hotel is a great hotel to base yourself in for a great price. Highly recommend it ","annotations":[{"endOffset":479,"mention":"roll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread_roll"],"startOffset":475},{"endOffset":479,"mention":"roll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread_roll"],"startOffset":475},{"endOffset":1408,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":1398}]}
