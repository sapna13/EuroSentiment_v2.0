{"text":"Unfair, discrimination This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed.Here is the situation in the conference meeting in this hotel:First on Friday, I reserved a non-smoking room and when I checked in around 10 pm and I was assigned to a SMOKING room. But the front desk refused to reassign me a non-smoking room after I requested TWICE right after I saw the room. The excuse they gave me was that all the rooms were over-booked and no availability. They did not check the computer nor ask my room number o double check my reservation. The funny thing is my friends who checked in about one hour later than I did were assigned to a smoking room, HOWEVER, they were switched to a non-smoking room (and upgraded to a suite) in one hour. Then, I talked to the front desk again the next day (Saturday) and talked to the reception first, he kept saying that it is the first-come √à√\u2020\u2022√ä√®¬™irst-serve policy and stating all the room was booked at the time I checked in. But he could not explain why my friends could change the rooms after my requests. Then I talked to the manager. This is the worst manager I talked to. He talked like talking to no one and the words were in his mouth. I could not hear anything and I had to almost lean on the counter. He only said, the rooms were booked (at the same time, many guests were checking out, and it was Saturday) They did not even check the availability of a non-smoking room at all. THEN in Saturday night, one of my other friends told me she was switched to a non-smoking room after she complained she got a smoking room in the midnight (Friday).So the only answer for this is this hotel treated me unfairly and discriminatinglySecond, the room is dirty, bath tub is molded, the AC\/heating is not working well. (The front desk did ask the housekeeping to spay but they did NOT show up.) Room service was slow, need to wait for at least 2 hours for a sandwich. I will never and never stay in this hotel and its chain hotels. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1899,"mention":"sandwich","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":1891}]}
