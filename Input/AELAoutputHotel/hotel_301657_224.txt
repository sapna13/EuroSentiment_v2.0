{"text":"Height of Luxury Myself and a friend stayed at the Park Hotel on our way back from Australia in July 06 (taken me a while to get round to writing this entry!). It was a great stay from start to finish. The staff are very friendly, speak almost fluent English and are willing to help with your every need. The view from the lobby is absolutely amazing and far outshines the views from Tokyo tower which we visited on one of our tours of the city. The rooms are clean and we felt more than large enough for a few nights stay. A large array of toiletries are provided as well as tea and coffee making facilities. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants, but there is ample choice of places to eat in the shopping mall which can be accessed from the ground floor of the hotel. Contrary to some other reviews on this hotel I would say that it is well placed for exploring Tokyo. We used the subway which was easy to find and navigate, although buying a ticket without the help of a friendly Japanese man who took pity on us would have proved difficult! I think the only small quibble we had was that we had problems getting to the hotel, as it was confused with the Tokyo Park hotel. However, after reading the reviews on this site before we left we were aware that this may happen and were eventually transported to the correct hotel! Something to bear in mind but not something that should deter you from visiting this brilliant hotel, which as far as we were concerned was quite reasonably priced for a city like Tokyo.
