{"text":"Nice and convenient stay in Berlin First I'd like to recommend if you are coming from Tegel (TXL) airport that you take Bus 128 to Kurt-Shumacher-Platz U-Bahn station, then south to Friedrichstrasse stop. We took the TXL bus coming in and it took a while in traffic as well as you had to hoof it from Unter den Linden. This was just a one night place for us. I love Berlin it has so much history and Friederichstrasse was on the border with the old East Germany. The hotel is fairly modern and contemporary. The check in staff were quite professional and answered all questions with care. I faile to get one young ladies name but she was quite cordial. Another girl who I spoke with seemed to be bothered but she didn't ruin my overall impression of the desk. The room was spacious enough, high ceilings, modern bathroom. Beds were comfy, duvets a bit too warm. Many amenities in this place. I did not take the breakfast because I thought 19 euros was an outrageous price. We just stepped out the front door to the right and grabbed a quick breakfast at the bagel shop next door. They have an internet service next to the checkin but 5 euros was a bit pricey for only 30 minutes! Note the couple ATM's close to the hotel (across the street in the station, it's at the Postbank) because if you go to Brandenburg Gate or Bundestag area there seemed to be virtually no banks on Unter den Linden in that direction. They will store your luggage at no cost if you have a flight that is much later than your checkout whic allowed us to see more of Berlin! I was a satisfied customer!
