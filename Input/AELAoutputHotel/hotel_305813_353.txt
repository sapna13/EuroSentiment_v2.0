{"text":"Very good hotel - if you want to stay in Chinese Hong Kong We, a group of three travellers, stayed in a Suite in the Langham Place Hotel for a week and overall, we had a fantastic experience. The hotel itself is a true 5-star hotel which offers all amenities you would expect from a hotel of such a standard. It is true, that the size of the ROOMS is a bit on the small side, but with respect to the scarcity of space in Hong Kong, this is what we expected. Rooms in upper floors over great views of the city and the harbour, even though only very few rooms seem to have an unobstructed view onto Hong Kong Island.The SERVICE was perfect - all hotel staff went out of their way to make our stay as convenient as possible. What is more, we had a few additional wishes which we voiced prior to our arrival - and everything was settled perfectly when we arrived. I know, this should be the norm, but I also know it isn't...If you can afford it, book a room that grants access to the EXECUTIVE LOUNGE, as the service there was the best I have experienced in such a facility, with free drinks throughout the day and differing (and tasty) snacks that varied according to the daytime. There is also free Internet access on three (a bit slow) computers in a designated area that offers a certain amount of privacy.BREAKFAST is plentiful and offers more than enough variety (English, Continental, Asian), even though those who need their breakfast light and sweet might complain that they have seen larger varieties in other 5-star-hotels.The LOCATION is very good, if you want the Chinese Hong Kong experience (which we did) as the hotel is situated in the center of the bustling Mongkok, which must be the most Chinese area of Hong Kong. The area is always overcrowded with people and a number of different markets are around the corner - very interesting! As the MTR (Hong Kong's adorable public transport system) is literally underneath the hotel, Hong Kong Island is easily accessible by train. Still, if you are looking for a more conservative, business like area, Mongkok might NOT be the place you want to stay in. The one thing the location does not offer, is a good bar (I mean the place to drink, not a restaurant - there are hundreds in the area!) around the corner, as these are somehow crammed into two neighborhoods that are not within walking distance (Hong Kong citizens seem to like their specialists all in the same place, there are streets full of butchers, smiths, florists, dog barbers etc...).All in all, we were very satisfied with the hotel and felt that it offered very good value for money as it is one of the less expensive 5-star-hotels in Hong Kong.
