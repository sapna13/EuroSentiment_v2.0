{"text":"A Great Stay We stayed in this hotel from 9th - 14th April $199 per night it was an excellent experience in the heart of Hollywood. As we are from London and extremely used to walking everywhere we under estimated just how far apart all of the sights are. Just outside\/attached to the hotel you have the walk of fame\/graumans chinese theatre and you can see the hollywood sign but all of those sights take 2 hours to do in total then everthing else is a long way away we walked 10 miles one day. The taxis are stupidly expensive so after spending $90 on the first day we decided to take the buses!! You get a day buspass for $3 from the driver and can go all over the city they are clean and frequent every bus that we travelled on had a map and I found the drivers and and people friendly no problem even when we travelled at night. Universal Studios is only 1 stop by metro from this hotel but other than that the metro is pretty useless for tourist sights which is a shame I was expecting more. This hotel is very nicely done free water and room service and cleaning you could not complain about I would recomend as a foreign visitor not to expect to change money in the hotel they only allow you to change $100 a day and in a place like this money is spent fast so bring plenty. Outside the shopping centre there is a starline tour booth we did the stars home tour with beverly hills as we were deciding to do the tour the price dropped by $10 each so I recommend hesitating and seeing how much they are willing to take off. One more recommendation is Mels diner across the road turn away from the roosevelt and its your 1st right great food and not over priced unlike most places. I can not compain at all about this hotel but If I was to go again I would definantly stay in Santa Monica and travel into the sights by bus or car it is a lot cleaner safer and the restaurants are nicer too. Everywhere has somewhere to park in Los angeles\/Hollywood\/beverly hills so stay by the beach.
