{"text":"Horrible I stayed the weekend of October 31 thru November 4th. The first night I arrived late (around 10pm) to check in and when I got to my room, I could not get to sleep because they had out loud music playing (reggaeton) until 12 am. The same repeated next night. There were lots of dust on the room, the air conditioning filter was very dirty, you cannot walk barefooted because your feet would get dusty. The internet (wireless) was unstable at the room, (I could just stay connected for 5 minutes and then the connection fell and I had to keep on trying to connect). The bathroom door had the lock missing and the balcony door handle broke (when I opened the door the handle was left on my hand). There are no pool towels at the pool area, so they leave one towel per person. One of the days, they came to clean the room and the pool towels needed to be changed and they told me that they did not had any towels until after 1pm (it was just 10 am). The bathrooms at the pool area were out of service. The pool was very dirty (I did pass long times at the pool area with my daughters and I never saw any personal cleaning). The pool was full of plants, sand and dead bees. The pool pumps were not working fully, I could check this myself (just few jetstreams were working). I did not let my daughter stay at the pool long, as I was afraid of the bacteria (I never saw anyone dropping clorox or netting the pool) The food is very expensive. The bar was closed during election day (no service at the pool whatsoever) I had to go out to get food and drinks. Horrible, I would never come back! ","annotations":[]}
