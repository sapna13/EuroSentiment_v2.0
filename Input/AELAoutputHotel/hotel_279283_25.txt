{"text":"Nice decor, but certainly not a home from home We had read some excellent reviews about this hotel on Trip Advisor and really wanted somewhere special for my 40th birthday. We decided to book 4 nights at JK Place and they upgraded us to a double deluxe room. Sabrina, who checked us in, was very friendly and helpful. However, throughout our stay we found a lot of the other staff rather indifferent and surly. We certainly did not feel they went out of their way to be friendly or to say hello even - which is really not what we had expected, given the many reviewers who called it a home from home. We wondered if we were missing something - but we came to the conclusion that JK Place was missing something. We have stayed in hotels all over the world, and we have found some of the larger 4-5 star hotels actually gave a more personalised service than JK Place - being more of a boutique hotel - did. The big plus points was the hotel's great central location (although the Piazza Santa Maria Novella is scruffy to say the least), but we felt it relied too much on its designer image - it felt like it was all style, but not so much substance. Another thing to mention is that we specifically asked for a quiet room and whilst the hotel made sure they put us at the back of the hotel, they did not warn us that there were renovations taking place in the building next door. We were woken by drilling at 9am on our first morning! This is something the hotel should warn guests about on their website or when they confirm the reservation. On the plus side, the free minibar (but no alcohol) and also the delicious free snacks in the lounge were a nice touch. Also, we requested a slightly later check out and they did accommodate this without a problem. One thing we could not help but notice one morning when there was much activity in the lounge and breakfast room was that it appeared some people were setting up a business presentation in the lounge area. We later questioned a member of staff who said that they do sometimes allow outside companies to hold presentations in the lounge. We were rather surprised at this, and do not think a small hotel should be using a communal guest area for commercial purposes, as guests may wish to simply lounge there during the day. Again, the staff had not mentioned to the guests that the lounge would be out of use that day.Whilst the JK Place was not the worst hotel we have ever stayed in, we did not feel it was one of our better hotel experiences, and if we do go back to Florence, we would try somewhere else next time. The d√ã√\u2022√ñcor and interior are lovely, but it was just missing that extra special something.
