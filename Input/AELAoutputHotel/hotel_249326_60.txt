{"text":"Not TOSTAY where to begin .. well , to summarise this place was overpriced and totally lacking in any sense of cusomer service. The room we got (which was the lower end of the hotels scale but still quite pricey ) was tiny and the bathroom even smaller with the shower falling apart , the beds were lumpy , soft and very uncomfortable. The room was also situated under the eaves of the building which meant you easily bumped your head when getting out of the bed or just trying to move around in general , i actually felt clostrophobic it was that small. The cleaning lady never came on our 1st full day even though we requested she call back later as we were not ready to leave the room just yet. I could go on here , but we decided to request an upgrade and were immediately given a taste of the hotels customer service levels .. we were asked why we could'nt have let them know sooner , it really appeared as though we were an inconvenience to them rtaher than paying guests - continuing with customer service , at breakfast i asked for some more milk and got the response 'what for'!even on our arrival we were greeted by a surly 'i'm to cool for school type' came across as quite arrogant and snobby.the room where breakfast was served doubled up as a bar in the evenings and you could tell from the grime and dirt on the chairs , they really were filthy (most were covered with some cloth but those that were'nt just looked dreadful). i really cant see who would want to stay here , maybe some ueber trendy partygoers with lots of disposable cash to waste .. the place did have a nightclub that seemed to be quite well known , but to be honest from what went into it it did'nt give me the impresson of being a proper hardcore clubbers club .. anyway .. to finish off , i normally dont write uup reviews on trip advisor but i really feel obliged to after this stay .. i basically felt cheated and my advise would be simple .. Hotel Arena is NOT a place tostay.p.s. to be fair the coffee there was good , but thats the only reason i rated the place as 'okay with problems' as opposed to terrible.
