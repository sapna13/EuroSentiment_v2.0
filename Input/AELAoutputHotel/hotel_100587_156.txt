{"text":"Let Go and Get in the Groove of the Max The Hotel Max is the spot where price, location, and funkiness converge in Seattle. I found the best rate I could get for a downtown single room at a decent hotel at Hotel Max. Sure, it's not the Travelodge, but I was hoping for a little upscale without breaking the bank, which can be hard to do in Seattle in August. The location is great, and I walked to the Market, the Needle, the ferry terminal and downtown restaurants and bars. Belltown is just a few blocks away, and Pacific Place is practically a stone's throw away. As for the funkiness, let's just say this is not your average, bland corporate chain. You feel like you are stepping into a music video when you walk through the front door. The art in the lobby is, well, interesting. Each room door has a different photograph and there was someething that looked like an eye chart at the end of my hallway.No doubt about it - the room was small. I had a queen, and it might have been a squeeze if I had shared the room. The bathroom is small with a miniscule shower. But I managed and decided to embrace the offbeat nature of Hotel Max rather than lamenting the fact that the shower was too small or I had to organize my belongings on the desk because there was not room to anywhere else. The bed was comfortable and I found it unnecessary to order another pillow from their pillow bar because mine was just fine. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the restaurant next door was not half bad for sushi. Try the Yummy Rolls.I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone who is not afraid to try something a little new. ","annotations":[]}
