{"text":"Hyatt Family Delight We normally don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ write reviews, but because the hotel and restaurant are so good we have been compelled to pen a review.We have just come back from a 10 night stay in the Bali Hyatt in Sanur and had a great time. For us as a family it was the perfect choice, as we like a good hotel on the beach, but with easy walking to shops and restaurants. The hotel had a lovely Balinese feel with a great welcome and a relaxed atmosphere. The reception and Wantilian restaurant were wall-less buildings with cool breezes for ventilation, making it feel less like one of those sterile Western glossy hotels. The staff, and in fact all the Balinese people, were very helpful and friendly. The best bit for us was the room and rate we had. We booked direct over the internet and got a family package. This included:a) 2 rooms adjacent rooms connected by a front porch door. This was really useful as a shoes and bucket area, as well as the security to keep an eye on the kids. We asked for an Ocean view room and both rooms had balconies and great sea views. Ours was a huge double bed, and the kids were 2 singles.b) The air conditioning in the rooms worked well and we noticed there was a dehumidifier in the room. This must have been to address comments made by others regarding mustiness, but to be honest, what do you expect in the tropics.c) Breakfast was included. It was buffet style with fruit, bread, cakes, Indonesian dishes, waffles, pancakes, and omelettes cooked to order. A great start to the day.d) A voucher for 1 day during the holiday for both kids to go to their kids club, Camp Sanur.e) And the price? 1,545,775 Rupiah per night for 2 rooms, including the tax. As the quote was in US Dollars, and the pound was strong, this worked out at about 85 GB Pounds per night for the 2 rooms. The other facilities were good too. Tennis, including cheap lessons, on 2 clay courts. There was also a badminton court and a single hole pitch and putt which was free. The 2 table tennis tables were free but busy.In the current climate we have to mention security. All the Balinese we met were Hindu and they really don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ understand what the Terrorists are trying to achieve. We were slightly concerned before we went out, but these fears were unfounded. We did take sensible precautions with our day trips by getting cars with a driver and guide organised by the hotel. It may have been slightly more but at 45,000 Rupiah for the whole day to where ever you want to go, it is only about 25 GBP. The hotel also has security guards at the gate and on both sides of the beach, which meant you did not get hassled by hawkers!There is a free shuttle to its sister hotel in Nusa Dua. This was nice for a different day as it had bigger pools and a small water slide for the kids, but not the same character. Nusa Dua was a complex of hotels, with a shops and restaurants a long way away.One of the main things we like doing on our holidays is walking and trying out different restaurants each night. Well we found such a great restaurant on day one we kept going back (we did try a couple of others but this was clearly the best). It was the Coriander Restaurant and Bar, 188 Jalan Danau Tamblingan. You turn right outside the hotel and is a 5 minutes walk. The food quality was good, service fast, wide choice and a cheap price. We got welcomed each night with free complimentary cocktail shorts, fried peanuts to nibble on, and a nice fresh piece each of garlic bread. The menu had Western, Italian, Chinese food and local Indonesian favourites. The kids said the fish and chips were the best they ever had, the spaghetti carbonara was lovely and the portions were large. The Indonesian favourites, all very good, were only 1 to 2 GBP! I pushed the boat out one night and had chilli crabs for about 4 GBP! They also do great cocktails. The Pina Colada came in a hollowed out pineapple. So do go to the CORIANDER Restaurant and Bar! We have to mention our daughter Charlotte for picking it. She liked the look of the fresh fish and prawns on display.
