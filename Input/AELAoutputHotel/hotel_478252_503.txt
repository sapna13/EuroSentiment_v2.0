{"text":"Great Hotel but VERY Large Came to this hotel after moving from Ocean Sand Beach and Golf Resort in Punta Cana (se my tripadvisor review) because there was no hot water there and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.Food excellent, hotel room nice and roomy and there were all the facilities you need to enjoy yourself with the hotel catering for both the energetic person or someone who wants to come and just lie in the sun. Only problem is that it is a little hard to find a quiet spot by the pool unless you have upgraded to Diamond status when you then enjoyed your own pool which was nice and peaceful, which we had not. If we came again we certainly would as both my wife and I enjoy that bit of peace. No problem finding a nice quiet spot on the beach though at either end of the property.I enjoyed the watersports which where included on the AI package but a tip.....take out the insurance at $20 p\/wk as besides covering damage to the boat or other boats it also enables you to book the Catermeran\/pedaloes etc. up to a week in advance which otherwise you can only do daily.Any criticisms? Only that you can only book 3 speciality restaurants a week and as we were there only for 8 days we could not try all 6 of the restaurants. Not a big deal though as the main buffet restaurant has themed evenings to cater for all tastes.All in all I would happily recomend the hotel.
