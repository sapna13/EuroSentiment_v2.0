{"text":"Very pleasant for couples who want just a beach  My wife and I vacationed there Wednesday 10\/29-11\/02. The resort is beautiful, the landscaping and beach were beautiful, and bless their hearts, the service was very, very, good. Our bed was pretty spartan, but our room (jr. suite) was very nice, with an ocean view. The meals were nice, we ate two nights at Spice with mixed results on service, but had a very nice Chateau Briand at the French restaurant. The breakfast buffet is visually beautiful, but quite frankly there were foods and fruits put out that weren't that great--for example tangerines had good color, but were inedible. I tried pancakes one morning, but it was the same griddle for omelets (not near hot enough). It is obviously quite challenging to staff a resort with a 5-star reputation with a shortage of knowledgeable people--but they really are friendly and I believe are sincerely trying to do their best. The master chef has some very interesting dishes and is quite visible going from restaurant-to-restaurant keeping things in top shape.There is not that much to do except drink and do the beach, and you don't want to leave the property, believe me. The waves\/surf are not suitable for snorkeling, or just a relaxing dip--it's damn rough. One afternoon, I thought I saw 20' waves breaking about a half mile out. We went SCUBA diving on to San Catalina island off La Romana, a nearly 2 hour bus ride--but it is a scenic drive to see agriculture in the DR (for me). The dive was very nice, we did The Wall and the Aquarios and the visibility was excellent. There aren't large fish on the reef, but there's not much current either. The dives were comparable to those off Grand Cayman--but it's quite aways from the resort. Friends told us that the Punta Cana area was their favorite in the Caribean, and I believe we were at it's best resort. That said, we may not return and check out another island for (1) beaches that permit more than just sunning, (2) closer SCUBA diving, and (3) more to do than just drink Presidente beer (which was pretty good), but when you're drinking quite a bit, it's hard to tell what digestive disorders are attributable to the alcohol or the food. Bottom line--it's a BEAUTIFUL facility, and the staff really go out of their way to do their best. If you want sun, relaxation, privacy--this is the place for you.
