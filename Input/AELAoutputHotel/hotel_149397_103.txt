{"text":"Just Got Back Hello my wife and i just got back from punta cana DR . We Stayed @ the Bavaro Princess for 5 nights.We went there with an open mind we did check some reviews out some were factual and some to all truthful. I must tell you all we do travel alot so we do have lot of experenices in the caribbean. Well i must tell you for most of us the first day is a wash our case it was 3am-3pm avery long day.When we arrived @ the airport in Punta Cana the wait just was unbelieveable we sat for 2hs in a hot bus just waiting and waiting for what we will never told . Upon getting to the hotel the front desk personnel advised us that are rooms would be in the 900 section in which we requested to be closer to the beach,which was granted. When we got to are room there was a very bad musty smell so i called the front desk and was told we would have to wait until sat @ 3pm to see if there was a room available that was 3 days away.,all i wanted to know if this was this normal or was it just our room i couldnt get a straight answer from anyone. so i ask the maintenance man if he could spray the room and clean it the next morning in which he did so we opt to stay there we justed wanted to try to enjoy our vaction.The next day we walked around the resort and i must tell you the ground were beautiful peacocks,flamingos rooster and all other types of nince looking birds runnig all around. We made it to the beach and it was everything that we were told just BEAUTIFUL BEACH its proabally the nice one i have ever seen very clean plenty white sand and alot of shade. The food i must tell was a mixed bag some good some not so good i think the food prep had alot to do with the taste just okay all in all.I will tell you a couple of helpful tips bring a watch and alot of one dollar billsand DONT TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE RESORT unless you are going home its not safe outside the front gate i will leave it at that. The rooms are dated but clean they are however HUGE and the room service is great the people work very hard to make your stay enjoyable communication is not a problem but i must tell you english is in the minority there but it is very interesting at that. I must be honest we will not return to DR its just not worth the valve of your hard earn dollar so in closing pls email me i would be happy to respone to you thanks......................
