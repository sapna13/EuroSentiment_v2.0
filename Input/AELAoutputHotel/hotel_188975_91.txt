{"text":"Worth Every Penny Once Again the Fours Season's is the best.!!!! We stayed in Paris for 6 nights, 4 at the George V. The staff was very accommodating. Having heard that Paris can be difficult for those that don't speak French, I book ed the George V specifically for the concierge service. While we were visiting at a very busy time we never felt the service suffered. Upon arrival our room wasn't ready but we were offered the option of an upgraded room without a view that would be ready sooner or a wait for the better view. Traveling with a weary child we opted for the upgrade. While waiting for our room, we had breakfast in the terrace room. When I informed the waiter of family food allergies, the Host offered to write a note in French for me that I could give to the wait staff at any Paris restaurant. How thoughtful!!! We consulted the Concierge about directions and attractions and they were always helpful and on target. When we were going to walk to the D'Orsey the concierge advised a cab since it was closing soon. We were given the option of a car to Versailles, but the Concierge suggested the short walk to the RER train at Port Alma would be less expensive and very easy. It was. I highly recommend the Museum Pass. It is available at the gift shop. The pass allows you to use a separate entrance and avoid the crowds at most attractions. While I had read on this site that we would have to wait in line for ticket for our child anyway so the pass wasn't a time saver, I only found this to be the case Les Invalides. And there wasn't a line anyway. The staff at the Four Seasons handled our dinner reservations and we were treated very well at the restaurants. I really appreciated this after inquiring at a subsequent Paris hotel about a restaurant and the staff opened the back door and pointed. Later it turned out it was closed. Stay at the Four Season!!! Fini across the street has a 5 euro breakfast including croissant, coffee and juice. They also have take out food and drinks. This will curb your mini bar expense. A Budweiser is 12 euros in the mini bar.
