{"text":"Good location; value To give some frame of reference for my review: When my wife and I travel (especially in Europe) we tend to stay in small hotels and pensions independently owned and without most amenities. That is the type of establishment to expect with the Chelsea Pines Inn. It is run by a friendly staff that happily held our bags while we explored the city and immediately addressed any small concerns that arose. The hotel is located in Chelsea less than a block from a subway station (A, C, E and L lines) and within an easy walk to Greenwich Village and Soho. The breakfast mainly consisted of breads, bagels and the like with coffee milk and juice but the all-day cookie jars as well as a welcome candy dish added a nice touch of hospitality. Before I go any further I should mention that we stayed in their least expensive room on the 5th floor. That is important for two reasons: One, the hotel has no elevator. After a day of walking the steps are not nearly as welcome as the candy dish. Second, as we walked past rooms being cleaned many looked cleaner, larger and more well kept than ours. That being said it does seem fair to judge a hotel based on the accommodations they offer and ours were slightly below average in terms of cleanliness, decor and comfort for this type of hotel when compared to other cities (this was my first time at this type of hotel within the City so I have no direct comparison). The lobby and the convention of naming rooms after old Hollywood stars implies a hip atmosphere that got nowhere near our room. Institutional green walls and an old flat-pack cabinet were the interior decorating. But again, we didn't have to spend much money, the place felt safe, the staff was friendly and we didn't vacation in New York to hang out in our hotel room. When all is said and done it did the job as well as was needed.
