{"text":"Comfortable, but uninspiring BookingWe booked our stay over the Intercontinental website. The process was easy and even though we booked an advance purchase rate, my credit card was only charged upon check-out.LocationThe hotel is pretty well located (Akasaka) with access to the subway within 5 minutes by foot. There are 4 subway lines accessible - the Ginza line is closest (300m) and the others are up to 1km away, all underground. The hotel is not too far from Roppongi - cab fare is Y600 - Y800. It's about Y1,500 from Tokyo station by cab.Check-InCheck-In was a smooth process. We arrived a little early and were accommodated (the hotel didn't seem very full) straight away. Staff were friendly and polite (common theme throughout the country).RoomsThe room was of a decent size. We were able to accommodate 2 full sized suitcases without tripping over them. We were on the 20th floor and had a decent view looking towards Roppongi. Housekeeping was a little slow though, our room would only be made up in the late afternoon which is not optimal when you head back lunch time for a rest.I really struggled with the bed, it wasn't comfortable at all. Furthermore, the standard pillows were way too soft, so I requested hard ones and these were like bricks. I didn't sleep at all well any of the 3 nights we spent at the hotel.The mini-bar was well stacked, but prices were as you'd expect in a 5-star hotel and we didn't partake.MealsMeals inside the hotel were on the expensive side and with so much on offer in a fantastic city like Tokyo, we only ate one breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast buffet itself was brilliant, but a little costly. We certainly attempted to eat enough for value! There are a couple of cheaper places in the adjoining arcade if you're looking to spend a little less, but still enjoy close-by convenience.PoolThe pool looked good (from our hotel window), but we didn't actually use it. We didn't see anyone swimming, although it was quite hot and humid.Concierge \/ ActivitiesThe friendliness and assistance provided by the concierge was extremely welcome. There was always a knowledgable English speaking person at the desk, who was eager to assist and they provided us with some valuable tips to maximise time efficiency.The business centre was well equipped, although once again, the prices were a bit on the high side. I think Internet access cost approx Y500 for 15 minutes. The lobby was large, airy and elegant.Check-outOnce again a smooth process although it took a while to convince them to give a short check-out extension as we had a time-clash with our Imperial Palace excursion. They were able to store our luggage for the remainder of the day.OverallThere is nothing wrong with the hotel, but my feeling towards it is neutral, considering the price one has to pay. Whilst we got a good deal for a 5-star hotel, I have stayed in other 5-star hotels worldwide where my experiences have been standout and the prices have been comparable or better. I would probably select a different hotel next time I'm in Tokyo.
