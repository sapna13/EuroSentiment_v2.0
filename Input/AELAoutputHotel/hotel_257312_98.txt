{"text":"Overrated! I must agree with an earlier review about the stoppy service. My wife and I stayed for four nights but had originally booked for five. When we advised we would be leaving a day earlier than planned, it was handled as a major catasrophe. Despite being a few metres away, the Manager communicated with me about this problem by email...!!! He informed me that I would be charged for all nights booked, despite my planned early departure! Now I appreciate that some country house and resort hotels have such a poilcy, but this hotel is in the city of Sydney and they are also charging the same rates as most five star Sydney hotels. I was also staying for several nights and gave them plenty of notice of the change. I found the manger (offline!!) and after a heated confrontation, I eventually got some satisfaction and was not charged for the early departure. However, it is important that people are aware that this is not a hotel to stay at if you are in Sydney on business and there is any chance that you may have to make a change to your reservation. The only other point I would make is that when we arrived on a Sunday afternoon after a 24hr flight from London, there was no one to greet us and I had to call an after hours number to get in. I was given security code instructions for the front door and told my key was in the room. We then had to carry four large suitcases up a flight of stairs with no assistance.Simpsons has an excellent hip location in Potts Point, somewhat ironic for a most un-hip hotel! However, I would not stay there again due to the attitude, inflexible policy and service problems. You can enjoy the same style and character of hotel at THE OBSERVATORY in a very pleasant and historic part of the city...same prices, but much better in every respect. ","annotations":[]}
