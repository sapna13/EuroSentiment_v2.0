{"text":"Great stay at Gran Hotel Havana Just back from 4 days at the Gran Hotel Havana with my wife (#1) and two sons (10  16). We had adjoining rooms on the 3rd Floor. Good rooms with air con, TV on wall, room safe, spotless bathroom, cleaned every day etc. We availed of the internet offer which included breakfast at a reduced rate. Breakfast is excellent and well worth the price especially when with kids - choice of breads, croissants, cereals, eggs, bacon, sausage, great fresh fruits, cold meats, cheeses and desserts! The rooftop pool was used by our sons. Everything about this hotel is great. Staff were also very helpful and patient with our broken Spanish. The Irish and the Catalans get on well anyway.. 'OO's of years under oppression from a foreign power may be one reason! The location is the great bonus. 15 minutes from Placa De Catalunya and Passeig De Graca. We could walk everywhere, even as far as Port Vell. When tired, the Metro was a couple of blocks away. One tip: avoid La Rambla. Our first afternoon, I caught a pickpocket with her hand in my pocket. She just laughed and walked on. there was no police presence. Her and her partner were posing as tourists with map, guudebook etc. I was on alert though. We spent the afternoon spotting pickpockets at work, including my own protagonist. Why do the police tolerate this? Even with this, Barcelona is a fantastic city and ranks with the best. Shopping, especially in the narrow streets east of La Rambla is probably among the best - right up there with Berlin and more affordable than Paris. Recommended restaurants:Sept Portes, Quinze Nits, Quatro Gatos, Taxidermista. We will be back and will certainly stay at this great hotel.
