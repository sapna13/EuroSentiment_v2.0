{"text":"wasted money, vacation...misleading information - awful Given the photos on the Hilton\/Embassy website one might assume that the hotel you see is the hotel you get. It is NOT. The right portion of the photo is not the hotel at all -some said it was a timeshare property. The hotel extends behind the wing you see in the photo on the right. What you get on the back side is a view of dumpsters, parking lot and beyond the homes in the distance you will see the ocean. Upon arrival and immediately upon entering the room we were shocked and disappointed. I returned to the front desk and told the staff about my numerous calls and that this was not at all what they described or what they advertised on their website photos. I lodged numerous complaints because in planning I thought I was careful and had personally phoned the 800 number and the hotel itself making sure to clarify what it was that we were seeking. Ocean, ocean view -the beach- we live in a landlocked community and wanted the beach. I was reassured that the room would have at a minimum a partial ocean view and we would be accommodated. The first evening the manager more or less told me too bad, the next morning the am manager offered to move us to the other side. There we looked over a gated community and if you sat in the right corner of the patio the beach was visible. If we could have returned to the airport and gone home w\/o $$ penalty- (5 travelers) we would have. We especially wanted to leave after the day we spent traveling on a dry run to the other side of the island to set up our snorkeling and night swim outings. A long trip from Dallas this was to be our big family island vacation. The oceanfront beach offered is a miniscule bay with moss\/scum on the bottom of much of the area you can walk. Likely due to the lack of movement within the man made cove. That drive to the other side of the island to do any of the things one might want to do, snorkel, deep sea fishing, ferry to other island or swim in the evening with glowing fish - well the traffic is worse than metro DC, Dallas and any other city we have lived or traveled to and the drive took us 3.5 hours one way. We were advised at the hotel that it was worse during the week. The breakfast buffet was the highlight. The servers wonderful. I have not eaten eggs since returning though. The all inclusive happy hour in California included frozen non-alcoholic drinks for the kids, not here they charged 3.50 or more for them. This is a desolate area of the island and if you want to eat anywhere but this hotel - forget about it. A deli\/bakery in town is delightful but that is it. Yes they have KFC, Burger King etc. not what we went to an island to eat and even there you better be bilingual. One of our best vacations was on family business but was at the Embassy Suites in Oxnard, CA. That hotel is beautiful; staff treats you like you are in a 5 star resort. Trust that all Embassy Suites are not equal and do your homework better than I did. Also, be prepared, Puerto Rico is quite dirty and the people are not particularly friendly. Quite a shame. Too many islands too many choices I recommend you make a different selection!
