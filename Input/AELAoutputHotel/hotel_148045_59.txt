{"text":"Beautiful but overpriced My boyfriend and I stayed here for four nights in May based upon a recommendation of a friend. I read the reviews about the hotel being overpriced but since I was able to find a deal on their website through AMEX (buy 3 nights, get the fourth free) we decided to go. Overall, my impression is mixed. On the positive side, we had a BEAUTIFUL room. It was an ocean view, in the new wing in the main building. The hotel itself was beautiful, we enjoyed the pools and the food was good (even though it was ridiculously overpriced). Also, if you come here to play golf, the courses looked amazing. Additionally, I think that if we had kids with us, this would also be a nice self-contained, fun and safe place to stay for a family. The bad things are the parking ($15 day for self-park inconveniently located 10 minutes away from the hotel), the 14% resort fee to allegedly pay for the catamaran that takes you to Palomino Island. Also, the area around the resort is not great so you are pretty isolated here and should just plan to enjoy your evenings in the resort and pay high prices for dinner. I think that we enjoyed our stay because we had already stayed in San Juan and Culebra during our trip so we didn't feel like we were missing out on other areas of the island. I wouldn't be happy had we just stayed here and nowhere else in Puerto Rico because there was nothing Puerto Rican about this place. The hotel is close to the Yunque Rainforest which we visited with our rental car (we heard that the resort overcharges for their tours so if you want to do this, get your own car and drive there yourself). In fact, the hotel also overcharges for their airport shuttle so you may as well get a rental car at the airport so you have the ability to go sightseeing or buy groceries! The rental car may cost you the same as their airport shuttle! We also were able to take the bio-bay tour one night at Vieques Island with East Island Excursions and that was fantastic (book this directly with East Island and not through the hotel)!
