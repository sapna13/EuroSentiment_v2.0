{"text":"Great Time had by all...... My wife and I and another couple ( in our late 30's) were at the Princess from Feb. 23rd to March 2nd. We booked through Apple Vacations. We travel every year to different locations in the Carribean and Mexico. This was our 3rd time in the DR. When deciding which resort to choose we read Trip advisor and were worried from what we read, but the resort had everything we wanted in a resort and wanted to go to a resort we hadn't been to yet. So we booked it. All I have to say is... some people you just can't please. Let me start off with the not so good. Some of the other reviews are factual , but over stated. The rooms on the 1st floor had a musty odor, You are however at a beach resort. When walking to the front of the resort you pass the treatment plant and there is an odor for a few seconds. (for a 7 day trip it maybe a total of 5 mins. of a bad odor to endure) HELLO!!!! you are on a island that is mostly JUNGLE!!!!! there are bugs and mosquitos. We were bit a few times at night but not overbearing.Now the great. The service we found to be excellent. The staff is always there to help with whatever we needed. You will be treated how you treat others. We tipped the maids a few dollars and always got what we asked for. Juan Carlos (JC) at the beach bar always hooked it up. He speaks pretty good english and was always attentive and tried to make it a party atmosphere.We ate at El Pescador, Bella Pasta(twice), the Hibachi place and the Japanese place. Our best expirience was at the Japanese place and Bella pasta, however all places were good. The main dining room had many options for food and you can always find something you like. The grounds are beautiful and well kept. The beach is awesome!!! It dosent hurt that the scenery is enhanced by the Europeans. Overall we had a great expirience at the princess. Is it the best I have been to? No Thats why I gave it 4 instead of a 5. Would I go back to the Princess? Yes. Good advice:1) Tip your maids and bartenders. (you are not required to, my expirience has proved it to be a wise decision)2) If you dont speak spanish learn some simple words and phrases before you go. i.e. hello, goodbye, bathroom, do you speak english..... etc. Its fun and the staff will appreciate it and engage you and remember you.3) Treat people how you want to be treated!!!!!!
