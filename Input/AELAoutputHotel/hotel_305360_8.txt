{"text":"Fantastic Value on Hong Kong Island I have stayed at Bishop Lei twice, Dec 07 for 3 nights and Dec 06 for 8 nights. On both occasions the hotel represented fantastic value for money, especially as I obtained a breakfast inclusive rate with Expedia. Note that however you book, an extra 10% service charge will be added to the bill.Rooms 1710 (standard double peak view) and 305 (standard single city view) were both clean and adequately furnished. Room sizes are similar to other Hong Kong hotels and are fine for me (but there again there is only me to fit in the room). Good desk with bright light for working if necessary. One minor draw back √à√\u2020\u2022?the mini-safe is too small to fit even the smallest laptop into, however the free wireless broadband works well with speeds of around 500 kbit\/sec. TV has good selection of English language tv channels including BBC World  CNN.There is a reasonable breakfast buffet 07:00 to 10:00 with eggs cooked fresh to order, but is a little pricey if not on a BB rate.As others have commented, the location near the top of the mid-levels escalator makes for a more peaceful location than say Kowloon, and the mid-levels plus adjacent soho district contain the majority of Hong Kong√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ western restaurants if Chinese food isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ to your taste. If arriving at Hong Kong MRT station from the airport, take exit D √à√\u2020\u2022?and then either take a taxi from the rank outside, or cross the road into Exchange Square bus station for the No. 12 (get off at √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬©aimondi College√à√\u2020\u2022?right outside the hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?see the Citybus website for a list of bus stops that can be followed ). For a firsthand look at the primates that provide the dawn chorus, the entrance to the botanical gardens is 2 minutes walk from the hotel (turn left out of the hotel, take the path that goes under the road and follow it downhill).There appears to be a programme underway to provide potable water to the rooms by mid 2008, in the meantime distilled water is available in a nearby shop for HKD 15 for 5 litres. I would take care with an earlier reviewer√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ statement that Hong Kong√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ tap water is drinkable; whilst that may be generally the case, the water supplied at Bishop Lei is currently NOT potable.
