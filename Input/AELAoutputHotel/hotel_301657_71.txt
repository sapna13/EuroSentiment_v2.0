{"text":"Wonderful hotel with excellent staff! My friend and I stayed at the Park Hotel for 4 nights in January, and it was fantastic! LOCATIONThe hotel is right near the Shimbashi station. Not really knowing how to get there from the NRT airport, we took a bus, but it took an hour and a half due to the number of stops along the way. You can buy a Japan Rail Pass prior (this is good if you are traveling to other cities in Japan. We used it to travel from Tokyo to Kyoto -- you purchase the exchange order outside of Japan, and then get the Rail Pass once you arrive). With the rail pass, you can take the metro to Tokyo Station, and a cab to the hotel from Tokyo Station is not that expensive (by tokyo standards). The hotel is also walking distance to Ginza and the Tsukiji fish market. Underneath the hotel area is a mall or restaurant area -- we discovered it on our last night, and it had a lot of restaurants. perfect if you are getting in around the evening and don't want to travel far for dinner. Can't remember exactly where or what it was called b\/c it's been a few months, but the hotel staff should know.STAFFextremely friendly and VERY helpful. The Japanese are normally very polite and courteous, but I thought the concierge was exceptional. They helped us get tickets to a Sumo tournament (we were lucky enough to be staying in Tokyo at the time of the tournament), and assisted us with directions everywhere else.HOTEL ROOMSWe stayed in Tokyo for 3 nights, went to Kyoto for 2 nights, and then came back to the Park Hotel for our last night. Japan hotel rooms are usually very small, and it is the same here, but that is normal. On our last night, the hotel room was a bit bigger and nicer (i posted pics).Great experience overall, would definitely recommend!
