{"text":"A piece of heaven in Berlin We have just returned from a summer vacation in Europe where our first stop was Berlin for 6 nights. I had basically taken other reviews of the Marriot Berlin and booked not just the room but also paid for the executive floor. Let me tell you this is well worth it. The hotel is good for couples, families and businessmen and they cater to everyone. You receive a great room with the wonderful beds and have all the facilities you need. The executive floor is well worth the money. You receive a breakfast that is beyond anything in North America on an executive floor - it opens early of course for the business people to eat and during the weekday breakfast ends at 10am. Drinks begin at 5:30 and have wonderful appetizers until 7 - wine, beer, sodas and waters are all available as well as mixed drinks and we spent many an evening kicking back after a full day of touring. The lounge is open all day and one can utilize the computers of which there are 3 - or kick back in another area and watch cnn on a wide screen tv.Another reason I booked this hotel was the gym. They have a pool which suited our son just fine and the 24 hour gym is connecting, has modern equipment and is bigger than most hotels - it is also secured with your room key and has a separate elevator. They do not charge to use the gym.The tour desk was most helpful and they went above and beyond the call of duty to give specific instructions on how to travel anywhere in Berlin.The location you can't beat - right at Potsdamer Platz and the Sony Centre.....walking a stones throw to the Jewish Memorial, the Brandenberg Gate, the S Bahn, the U Bahn, shopping mall and I could go on and on. Right across the street is the Ritz Carlton. If we ever went back to Berlin we would stay there without question you don't need to look anywhere else in my opinion.Well done Marriott ","annotations":[]}
