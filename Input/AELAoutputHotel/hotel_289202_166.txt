{"text":"Friendly Antiche Figure We have just returned from a 3-night stay at the Hotel Antiche Figure in Venice, and were extremely impressed wirh the Hotel. It is situated on the Grand Canal, and is within easy reach of bus and train stations, as well as being close to vaporetta stops, making it easy to get around Venice. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and we were always greeted with a smile. When we arrived at the hotel, a member of staff gave us a map, and spent about 10 minutes giving us useful information, such as how to use the local transport, things to do and see, and where to eat. As a result, we were able to make the most of our stay in Venice, and felt very comfortable about asking for information as and when we needed it.The hotel itself was stylishly decorated, clean, warm (the weather was quite cold when we visited Venice, so if you go in October like we did, take jumpers, scarves and gloves, as well as a good coat and sensible shoes!), and there was a good variety of fresh food for breakfast. We were upgraded to a newly refurbished room, with a canopied bed, and an ensuite with a power shower with side jets of water - very sumptuous, and romantic. The room had all the facilities we needed, including a safe, hairdryer and minibar. There were fresh towels , and even sweets on the pillows every day. Attention to detail, with Italian style and hospitality, is what made this hotel a real winner. We had a lovely time, and would certainly recommend it.Tips: Make sure you take mosquito repellant, and those plug-in things, as mosquitos are rife in Venice, and be aware that eating out can be quite expensive. A great restaurant to eat in is the Alla Madonna, on Calle Alla Madonna, close to the Rialto bridge, where the food is amazing - but get there early, as there are often queues to get in. (Opens at 6.45pm) Also, if you are staying for a few days, it is a good idea to buy a local transport ticket, which you can use on the vaporetta around Venice, and the bus service to and from the airport . We were hopping on and off the Vaporetta a lot, and we reckon it saved us a lot of money. (We paid 30 Euros each for a 72 hour ticket, but it paid for itself in the first day.) Also be aware that Venice can flood occasionally, making it difficult to get around. It wasn't too bad while we were there, but we could see that it could get quite tricky in places if there were exceptionally high tides. The locals put up raised wooden walkways when flooding occurs, which partially solve the problem, but could be difficult for some people to climb on to. There is so much to see, so plan your itinerary carefully. Hope you have as fabulous a time as we did.
