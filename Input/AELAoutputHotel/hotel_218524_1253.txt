{"text":"Good Vacation My husband surprised me with tickets to Excellence Punta Cana for my birthday and we stayed from Feb 23-27th. Overall, it was definitely relaxing and fun. You just have to REALLY remember that 5 Star quality in other parts of the world is very different than Amrerican 5 stars.CHECK IN: When we arrived to the property it was definitely appealing. Before we arrived to Excellence, we dropped off a couple in Majestic and surprisingly, that hotel was not very appealing when you first drive up to it. So I was happy to see that Excellence was pretty. As soon as we got out of the car, we already had the bellman at our feet taking our bags which was great. When we walked up the desk, we got a nice wet cold towel and champagne. Def Refreshing! Check in was very fast and simple.ROOMS: Ok so the rooms are def not 5 star quality but we expected that it wouldn't be. It was sort of dark. No smell or mildew but sticky. But ofcourse you are in the carribbean so you expect it. Besides,,,we are only in the room to sleep. The bed was obviously cheap and hard but we had no problem sleeping. Towels were not always stocked but whenever we found the maid, she was always pleasant and gave us towels. TV has a good selection of channels as well but no inroom movies.FOOD: The food was OK...I liked the Italian restaurant Trattoria and I def like the breakfast buffet in the morning and the plated breakfast at the Lobster house. Very good. We ate at Spice (Asian) and my food was ok,,,but my husband hated his food which was strange considering he is not picky at all. The grill was pretty good (get shrimp cockail,,it is to die for!)...Barcelona was horrible...The food was cold and not tasty at all! there were 3 other couples in the restaurant and they were complaining as well how the food was cold and not good...Not recommended! The french restaurant was most disappointing. I read reviews of how wonderful it is but IT REALLLY IS NOT!,,,Every night there was an hour\/half wait but I think that it is just to hype up the place. Because when it was finally our turn to go,,,we saw MANY tables empty. The waiters are nice and they brought out a cake and sang happy birthday,,,very sweet! But the food,,,dont waste your time for the wait! The best food overall in the resort was the fresh pizza during lunch. Manny the pizza guy would make the pizzas himself and deliver outside the pool area...Realllllly nice guy and awesome pizza!POOL: Pretty good...I wouldnt say it was spectacular,,,but the swim up bar is always great! The beds around the pool are also a nice touch,,,the only negative,,,the water was way too cold.BEACH: Ok this is the reason I come to the Caribbean! I want that beautiful blue water and white sand....Well the sand is def brown but its verrrry soft...the beach is huge and even if the sand was brown,,,it was still surprisingly pretty. The water is def verrry rough! Im not a strong swimmer but it was a lot of fun! I def went under a few times and the undertow def took my top off a couple of times! The water is a nice blue but because it is rough,,,its hard to tell. If you want that nice leisure crystal clear water,,,just walk a couple hundred feet to the right,,,and you will find it! Very beautiful!LOCATION: It is def secluded which is nice but when it was rainy it was a bit boring because you cant exactly leave the resort becauese everything is an hour\/half away...I would have liked to be able to go into a city.OVERALL: I have been to many places in the carribean. Punta Cana is very nice and the hotel was overall nice...I wouldnt say it was the best place i've been to and I dont know if I would come back but it is def worth checking out.Have Fun!!!
