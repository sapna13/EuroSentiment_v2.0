{"text":"A couple oddities, but overall great! Although the Sofitel near Times Square has a couple odd quirks that keep it from gaining a 5-star rating, my daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed it on a recent visit and would gladly stay there again.Among the MANY positives of this hotel:-Wonderfully comfortable beds-Plush bath robes and great, thick towels-Very quiet atmosphere-Complimentary computers in the lobby to check e-mail-WONDERFUL bathroom with separate tub and shower-Great amenties and complimentary Evian water-Great location about 4 blocks from Times Square and 5 blocks from Rockefeller Plaza-In-room safes that are easy to operate-Great air conditioners that truly cool the room (a rarity in NYC, where most don't cool properly)-Friendly staff and housekeepingWith all these positives, you might think this the perfect NYC hotel, but then a few little missteps make you scratch your head and wonder what they were thinking:-NO COFFEE OR COFFEEMAKERS IN ROOMS!! An astoundingly strange oversight.-Evening turndown service, but no chocolates or mints on the beds. Picky, but for $350 a night,....?-Bathroom doors DO NOT have locks! This invites the uncomfortable possibilities of a couple oops moments on your vacation.-$350 a night seems about $50-$75 a night to steep for this quality of a hotel.-They took a $900 deposit on my credit card for incidentals, even though I had a PRE-PAID room!!!! Did they think I was going to eat the entire mini-bar,....twice?!?!This is a great hotel and worthy of staying at on your next trip. However, they've certainly left some t's not crossed and i's not dotted in their lack of attention to detail. With that said, however,very clean, very quiet and very nice.
