{"text":"An average hotel. We stayed here for 3 nights en route to New England for a skiing holiday, and overall, it was okay. I'm probably a little disappointed in it and maybe had higher expectations based on the reviews here. The hotel is modern, but the room we had was a little small, a little scuffed round the edges, had a lot of traffic noise, had a Queen bed rather than a King and did not have a bath tub, only a shower. The lack of bath probably wouldn't bother some people, but as we were doing a lot of walking\/sightseeing and fancied a soak to rejuvenate the feet and legs, we asked for a room with a tub after the first night. The staff were very good and immediately changed us to a slightly higher floor room, with a tub, and strangely about twice the space although the room types were supposedly the same. This room actually proved to be much better and was quiet as it was at the back of the hotel. Unfortunately as someone else pointed out, as it was low down it was actually dark the whole day, even on the glorious sunny days that we had. The safe in this room was locked when we got in, so we asked for it to be opened for us and the staff said it would be done right away. It wasn't. We asked again the next day and were told again it would be done. After coming back to the room late that night, we found it still hadn't been done. No big deal, but as we were checking out the next day, it wasn't worth asking again.On the plus side, the staff are genuinely pleasant, the location is really good, the wine reception is a nice touch and the hotel offers free wi-fi. There was nothing that bad about the hotel and nothing that great either. It is a little too focused on style, and while the staff are pleasant, the service is a little hit or miss. Based on this visit, I wouldn't stay at Nine Zero again.
