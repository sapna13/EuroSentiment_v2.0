{"text":"Nice hotel, hit and miss service I stayed at the Hotel Cram for 5 nights in April '07 in a standard room. It wasn't my first choice of hotel but it was almost half the cost of the other hotels that I was looking at and that in the end was the deciding factor. The hotel itself is very nice. The bar \/ lobby area is actually quite beautiful and well designed. I was also impressed with the room which was nowhere near as small as I expected. It was well designed and there was a large bathroom with an amazing overhead shower. The hotel provides free wireless and broadband and free movies etc which was a good bonus. Despite all that I would hesitate to recommend this hotel. Although some of the staff members were really helpful and nice, others were the exact opposite and my overall impression of the service is negative. For example, it was my birthday while there and my partner got me a birthday cake and surprised me with it in the room. To our amazement however, room service and then reception refused to bring us some plates and forks to eat it unless we ordered some food. We were told it was against 'hotel policy' to provide plates!!! Breakfast was nothing less than chaotic and frankly a nightmare. The staff were completely disinterested and we felt like we were disturbing them. One morning there was no coffee \/ juice \/ milk until 20 minutes after we arrived. Although the area the hotel is in is good, just outside the main tourist areas but with a local feel, the hotel is located on the junction of 2 main roads. Although there was no noise in the room when the windows were shut, it was completely impossible to leave your window open at all. On saying all that the hotel was very good value for money. Over the five nights we saved quite a lot of cash, but if going for a shorter time or if money is not a consideration that I would say stay somewhere else (namely Casa Camper!!).
