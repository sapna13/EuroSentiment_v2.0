{"text":"Keeps getting better......... Stayed at The Benjamin during the Easter holiday, April 6-11. This is our 7th time at this property and each time it gets better and better. From the moment we arrived to the time we left what ever we needed was at our family√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ disposal. We had a 1 bedroom suite located on the seventh floor facing 50th and Lexington. The noise was apparent but we have even stayed on the 23rd floor and still heard the noise and sounds of NYC. That is what makes the city. When we arrived, Russell checked us in and we asked if there was a higher floor w\/ a king bed. During the holiday they of course were full, but did offer to move us the next morning right away if we wanted to. The gesture was pure professionalism. We decided to stay in our original room because when we arrived the bathroom was huge and we were two adults and two children. The sofa bed was to be already made up, but it was not. The bellman asked us what time we would like it made each night during our stay and we stated 7pm. Guess what. It was done! The rooms still looks as good as they did 7 years ago. They manage to keep the property up very well. We needed some extra pillows and blankets and in minutes were at our doorstep. We have stayed at Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, etc and never have had this service. I was completely impressed again. Beds, pillows, sofa bed and kitchen were all perfect in comfort and convenience. The high speed Internet, which you must pay for, works perfectly. Printer was easy and convenient to use. They have upgrade there TV√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ to large flat screen TV√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂. A nice touch that they are keeping up with the other boutique hotels. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ so hard to find something poor to say about this property. The pictures on their Website [--] are true to form. The bathroom and shower, well you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to get out of that. The best shower head yet. The hotel is located in the Murray Hill in midtown eastside. You can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ask for better location. The staff will go out of their way for you and it shows. You cannot go wrong and would be foolish to stay elsewhere. I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ say enough about this property from its rooms\/suites to service. We did have an opportunity to eat at the restaurant. Not bad food. A bit over average as there is better in this magnificent city. But found it very reasonable and the skirt steak was delicious. For the dessert the mud cake is a no brainier. Just to add. Plenty of towels, robes, toilet paper, toiletries, etc. Never ran short. They were replenished ever day. As to people complaining about no top sheet, you do not need it and is a European way of sleeping. The down comforter is not only light but also warm if needed. Makes for a comfortable and allows you a peaceful sleep. There so much to say about this property from staff to rooms, but take our word again, you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go wrong. Doormen and bellhops are right there for you at anytime and are more than helpful. Nice touch to hear them wish you a good evening and\/ or good morning by your name! You must try it! Superb.
