{"text":"Very enjoyable at Casa Fuster I was a little concerned upon checking in because I heard a guest complaining about something or other, but all in all we were well taken care of and given a room to our liking. We had to see a few rooms before deciding on one we liked best. My wife and I want to be as comfortable as possible when we travel, so it's not uncommon for us to look at several rooms before deciding on one. I'm sure we drive the staff bonkers, but I wanna be comfy! Sometimes it's a cleanliness issue, sometimes it's a wear and tear issue. At Casa F I'd call it a wear and tear issue. The hotel has only been open two or three years, but hotel years are like dog years. Sadly guests don't treat hotels the same way they treat their own homes...at least that's what my presumption is. Perhaps I'm wrong. In any event, the hotel is quite comfortable and in a nice area that is quiet and appeared to be quite safe. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast is incredible. I'm not one to eat breakfast, but at Casa Fuster, bring it on. They have the most delicious breakfast buffet, I dream about it. For someone who really doesn't enjoy eating, I absolutely loved the breakfast there. My wife has stayed there a couple of other times while traveling and has noticed a bit of wear and tear, but again that's the nature of the beast. During her first stay, the hotel was only open for about two weeks. As noted above, a couple or three years has shown itself. Nevertheless, I enjoy the hotel and can vouch for the staff by saying that if an issue arises and you're not happy with something, they do whatever they can to accommodate you. ","annotations":[]}
