{"text":"Nice 5-day stay at the Ritz My husband and I enjoyed a 5-day stay at the Ritz over the 4th of July weekend. We have stayed at other Ritz properties before, but this was our first time to Puerto Rico. We booked a standard room via the hotel's website and were upgraded to an ocean view room without asking. The rooms and grounds were not quite as nice as other Ritz properties, but were still very nice. Although the hotel is near the airport, we heard absolutely no noise in our room. All staff we encountered (especially the concierges) were extremely nice and accommodating. The pool is beautiful and the grounds are well-manicured. All pool chairs were already taken by the weekend afternoons, but there were plenty available in the mornings and on the weekdays. The beach is public. The sand is not the clean, powdery white sand you see in other parts of the Caribbean. The ocean, however, is much prettier and blue-er than I expected. The Ritz beach service was very nice, as staff quickly set up chairs and a little table for us.As expected, food and drink is expensive. Frozen drinks are $15, Continental breakfast of juice, coffee, and pastries is $17, and the restaurants are overpriced (we ate at Il Mulino). However, it was what you'd expect at a resort.The fitness center was clean and well-equipped. I enjoyed a pilates class. Also included in the resort fee, are free bottled water, all the towels you want for the beach and for off property excursions, internet, and beach toys (floats, kayaks, etc).We left the property to enjoy many activities. We had a great time hiking at El Yunque National Forest, took a beach\/snorkeling trip with East Wind Catamaran Company, and toured Old San Juan (it is a $25 cab ride each way). You can walk to other hotels and restaurants in the Isla Verde area from the Ritz. The El San Juan Hotel has a great evening atmosphere with live music and bar in the lobby, good restaurants, lively casino, and a hip pool area. There is very casual, but authentic Puerto Rican and Cuban dining at Metropol across the street from the Ritz. There are a few other very casual dining options, but the nice restaurants are all located in the hotels along Isla Verde (the El San Juan, the Intercontinental, and the Water Beach Club). These hotel restaurants are steak and Italian. Nice seafood restaurants are located in Condado, which is a $15 cab ride from the Ritz. There is also a bike shop Hot Dog Cycling down the street if you want to join a group ride. ***Please note that there is currently construction at this property, as they are building balconies on the rooms around the pool. They did not work on the weekends, but they resumed construction on Monday and Tuesday. Hammering, banging, and drilling into concrete was audible and visible in the pool area. The construction is disclosed on the property's website and did not affect our enjoyment.*** ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":1138,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1132},{"endOffset":1138,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1132},{"endOffset":1152,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":1144},{"endOffset":1500,"mention":"floats","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ice_cream_soda"],"startOffset":1494},{"endOffset":2025,"mention":"Cuban","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cuban_sandwich"],"startOffset":2020},{"endOffset":2140,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2136},{"endOffset":2140,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2136},{"endOffset":2140,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2136},{"endOffset":2140,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2136},{"endOffset":2264,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2260},{"endOffset":2318,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2314},{"endOffset":2318,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2314},{"endOffset":2318,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2314},{"endOffset":2435,"mention":"Hot Dog","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hot_dog"],"startOffset":2428}]}
