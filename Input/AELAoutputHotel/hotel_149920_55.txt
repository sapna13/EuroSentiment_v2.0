{"text":"OK but not worth the premium Didn't start off well. We had asked for early check in when we reserved the room several months in advance and when we arrived was told nothing was available. We were given no options, just sorry, can't check in. Maybe some suggestions on things to do and a free drink or two wouldn't have hurt.Anyway, the place was nice, the beach was fine (a little rough but not as bad as other reviews led me to believe). The prices in every place at the hotel (restaurants, gift shop, bar,etc...) were outrageous. Go somewhere else to eat, shop  drink. There's a Wendy's  Subway down the street and they even offer breakfast. We went to the Latin Star and a Seafood restaurant that I think was called Orosko's (or something like that). Don't go there!! There's an excellent Argentinian restaurant a block or so down one way and a mexican restaurant (Cielito Lindo) the other way.A lot of the reviews said to take the bus rather than a taxi into Old San Juan but we found the buses weren't regular and didn't feel like sitting at a bus stop for an hour or so. We took the taxi.Again, the room was nice, view was great but the worst part was our next to last day, the Marriott sent a note that they would turn off the A\/C from 10-3. This time they did offer a free drink. So we stayed out of our room and returned around 4 pm. We arrived to a filthy bathroom with a guy in our tub and a couple other people in the wall. We waited around for a half hour and of course everything is like we'll be done in 20 minutes. It wasn't. I complained and the Marriott did knock a little off my rate for the day but we found out later that even then they didn't fix the problem and the A\/C remained on the fritz. We ended up moving to another room (with a view blocked by trees) for our last night.We paid a premium to stay at the Marriott and to be honest, won't do it again. It just wasn't worth it. If I have to do it again, I would have stayed at the Holiday Inn Express which is about a block off the beach. You'll lower your expectations and pay a lot less.
