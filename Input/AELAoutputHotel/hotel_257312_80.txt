{"text":"What a great combo of business and tourism I spent two WEEKS at Simpsons in late March and it was wonderful. I will definitely try to come back - certainly I will stay there any time I return to Sydney.Like Cheers, this is definitely a place where everyone knows your name. I was welcomed off my early morning long flight from US with a lovely bathroom and shower, to refresh. My bags were lugged by nice people (thank you, Jackie?) up the incredible Victorian staircase to my charming garrett room (which I had picked, on-line). The room was something out of a child (and adult) dream, with TV and fridge cleverly hidden in the decorative cupboards. It was a joy to explore.Morning breakfast was a joy as well, with the home-made rhubarb compote a special treat in the sunny breakfast room. The whole place has wireless internet, which was a major decision in my choice of hotel given the length of my stay - I didn't want to be nickled and dimed for my necessary hookups with my work back home...Folks were personable and helpful- I don't know where to begin. The location is also to die for as they say in some circles. Walk out the door and you overlook downtown Sydney, the Bridge, and the roof of the Opera House; the stairs down to the Gardens and whole tourist area are but a short block away. Go the other way, and there are restaurants galore, and, for long-stayers such as me, a grocery 'round the corner (Woolworth's, downstairs, no, it is not a 5 and dime in OZ), and a majorly good bottle shop a few blocks further.So, the place has ambiance to beat the band (the downstairs area, sitting room, breakfast area, etc, is story-book like), great rooms, equal to any majorly lux hotel I have stayed in recently, although maybe not as large), and persona that you can't find in too many other places.I am a pretty road-worn traveler, and this was JUST great. Thanks to Keith, Jackie and all the others... still tired from my trip so forgive if I don't mention you all by name...
