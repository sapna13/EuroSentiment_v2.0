{"text":"Congratulations ! Outside Banks Mansion is a very classical building but well situated to visit Amsterdam. All main attractions can be reach even by foot even if i advice to rent a bike to get better fun. That was perfect .Inside the reception is friendly with a desk, a open bar all long day, a saloon to met your friends or to take some rest, a corner with a fire and an other place with 2 PC for a free access to Internet. i appreciated to be able to look at my mails very easily.My room (207) was nice too, enough large for 2 two people, well decorated, good bed, flat screen, open mini bar (all included), nice bathroom. All is clean and the stuff dont disturb your stay.The breakfast was in the same way, well appreciated, you can be fat very quicky !!All the stuff is young with good skills and like to help you if needed. A special thank to Nancy for her smile !Just 2 remarks for me :- TV device was a bit old (4\/3 flat screen) and doesn t work very well, some issues to switch on and change the channel.- there are 2 separeted taps in the bathroom for hot and cold water..good quality but it was uneasy to fine ajust the temperature especially because the tap for hot tap was in the wrong direction (turn left to stop water). it was made for purpose but not a good idea in fact because unusual.As a conclusion Banks Mansion is a very good hotel as we should like to find everywhere in the world. Excellent in its category ","annotations":[{"endOffset":615,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":611}]}
