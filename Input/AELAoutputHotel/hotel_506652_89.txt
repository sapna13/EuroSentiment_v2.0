{"text":"Overall a good experience SERVICEWe found it really good, however when we were there one of the guests had an argument with one of the staff about a misbooking. All staff speak very good English and are friendly and helpful.COSTI found it less expensive to book directly with the hotel. I think it was a pretty reasonable price at 130 euros per night for my wife and myself. Don't forget that you get charged an extra 7% tax on top of the room rate.CLEANLINESSExcellent throughout. It was spotless, although there was a slight smell of cigarette smoke in our room which was hardly noticeable.LOCATION \/ TRAVELAs the other reviewers have said the hotel location is at placa espanya. Easy to get to from the airport. Costs about 25 euros by taxi or about 4 euros by aerobus. The metro (underground \/ tube) is about 3 minutes walk away, just the other side of the old bull ring (the conversion from a bull ring to a shopping centre has been designed by a UK architect who also designed Madrid airport...). The tourist bus goes from just the other side of the roundabout which is about 3 minutes walk away.Get an all inclusive ticket from one of the official tourist stalls before you leave the airport. They cover travel by aerobus, metro, tourist bus and give discounts for entry to attractions.The hotel is next to a main road and construction is still going on at the bull ring so opt for an upper room.Make sure you get to see the fountain display just across the road which starts around 7pm - ask at reception.FOOD AND DRINKThere is no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. Bummer. However there is a supermarket just down the street where you can get bits and bobs. The hotel offers breakfast at 12 euros, but no lunch or dinner. They have a pretty funky bar as well, but we didn't drink there. Try the maoz bars ([--]) for lunch as they are really tasty and keep you going at 4 euros a shot.FACILITIESThere are eight floors to the hotel. If you can, stay on floor seven as they have larger rooms and are really comfortable. Floor eight is the pool area which is great! You can see around the placa from there.If you smoke try to stop, but failing that there is a balcony to each room where you can go to feed your desire. If you do, I hope you don't suffer from vertigo as the balcony is about 18 inches wide with a glass side.The rooms have flat screen TVs, but why would you want to watch TV in Barcelona? They also have mini bars and a fridge. The bathrooms are very X-Men - magneto like in their tiling but very well done. The shower sprays water over the back of the bath so watch out for that.We would stay there again, and I think we probably will.
