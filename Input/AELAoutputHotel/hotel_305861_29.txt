{"text":"pretty good I booked this having read the reviews here and was forced to book a suite because our young child and baby could not be accomodated in a standard or deluxe room. As it was we had to have our son on existing bedding with us (two single beds) or otherwise take two rooms (but they didn't have any connecting available so our family would have been seperated). We found this a problem all around Hong Kong where rooms are small.Having said all that I was comparing the suite price about NZ$320 with what I could get in Malaysia, where I live and on that comparison it didn't come up too well. The hotel itself was great in other respects - the pool and views fantastic and the food and service were fine too. If you were booking a standard room as a couple this hotel would be great value and reasonably well located (though I won't say perfectly located - we stayed in Wan Chai later and it was easier to get around from there). If you are booking a suite, it was nice, a little bit tired but pretty good, though not super cheap. Still the views were amazing!The location, not far from the Tin Hau station and close to the trams that run the length of the island was fine, though it's a little away. I didn't mind too much as Causeway Bay is great and has tons of restaurants and shops. We bought takeaway food a lot because of the kids. There is a good Thai restaurant down the road (turn right when you reach the station and continue on the road with the trams) I think called Bangkok Thai (there aren't many so you'll find it). Sogo Department store has a giant food hall at the bottom and they sell excellent takeaway sushi (being japanese and all...) for tired sightseers.Overall a pretty good choice I think. In this price range, the best I could find anyway (but like others said there aren't many bargains in HK).
