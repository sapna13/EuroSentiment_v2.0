{"text":"Fantastic Place to Stay! I have just returned from an excellent 2 night stay at the Intercontinental Frankfurt. The hotel, staff and location were absolutely perfect and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.We arrived early (10am) and, as expected, were told that our room was not yet ready but if we took a seat, they'd call housekeeping and ask them to get our room ready. As we were going out for the day, we told them to take their time and checked our luggage into the bag store without a problem.We had a twin standard room in the City Wing. This is the wing that people here seem to have been less impressed with but I found everything just perfect. Access to the City Wing is across the street to the main reception but there is a carpeted underpassage within the hotel so you can get from reception to your room without going outside! Our room was on the 19th floor and had a fantastic view of the city. No complaints - it was beautiful at night with all the lights. A different type of beautiful to the river view no doubt, but it was certainly not ugly.The room itself was comfortable and tastefully furnished. Not modern, but fine. The beds were very comfortable and there were two different types of pillow to choose from. Non-allergenic or down pillows were available on request.The bathroom was large and the shower was excellent. A robe and slippers were provided for each guest and there were plenty of towels and Elemeris toiletries which were high quality. There were also cotton wool balls, Q tips, a shower cap and sewing kit provided in the bathroom as well as a hairdryer and a magnifying mirror for shaving \/ make up.The room facilities were good - an electronic safe, kettle (which was the only bad feature - it didn't have a spout and was a nightmare to pour with), tea and coffee, minibar, TV, iron and trouser press and a shoe shine service where you could leave your shoes outside your room to be cleaned overnight (free of charge).Our rate included breakfast and this was amazing. As the hotel is full of business people from many countries, the breakfast buffet was very international and included Asian food, curry, cereal, toast, pastries, ham, cheese, cooked selections, juice, yogurt, fruit and so on. The biggest choice I've ever come across and beautifully presented.We dined at Leon's Italian restaurant (access via city wing) on both nights of our stay and again this was excellent. The food is very well priced (from 6 euro for a pizza, 9 euro for a pasta dish) and the staff were very attentive. The food was served very quickly. If you're thinking of dining there, it is worth making a reservation or getting there early as it was busy.Finally, the location was perfect for us. On arrival, we took the short walk from the station (Hauptbahnhof) - the hotel was easy to find and the short walk felt safe and away from the red light district that is to the other side of the station. Getting around was easy, if you didn't want to walk to the shopping areas, the subway (U-bahn) from the Hauptbahnhof was easy to get to and goes to the main areas of the city. We also took a walk by the nearby River Main which was very pleasant.
