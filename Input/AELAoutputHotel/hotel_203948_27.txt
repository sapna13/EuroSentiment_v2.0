{"text":"Can't beat the location. We have just returned from a 3 night city break in Florence. I booked a family suite at the Pendini for my husband and I and our two children (21 and 18). We walked from the station and it took about 10mins. The location is its best feature. It's very easy to get to any of the major attractions (not that Florence is huge...most places are an easy walk)The entrance is just off the Piazza Della Republica, down a tiled corridor. The lift is tiny, but seviceable. Reception is on the 4th floor of this grand but tired building and service was friendly enough if you made the effort.Our suite was on the 3rd floor with windows into the courtyard, making it quite dark unless you opened the shutters fully. It was clean if a little dated and the rooms were serviced and fresh towels put out every day. (The towels were bright white, big and fluffy). There were two bedrooms and a shared bathroom.The beds were comfortable enough, although after a day of museums, gardens and piazzas, we could have slept on concrete! We did notice an odd smell in our room and couldn't track it down.The walls were a bit thin and you could hear the people in the adjoining suite when they were watching TV or laughing.The bathroom was large and clean, although the push button on the toilet was temperamental and my husband did some running repairs. There was also a strange smell in this room at times. The shower in the bath was good...plenty of hot water and fairly powerful, but the shower screen was very wobbly and had to be leant against the shelf to keep it from falling on the floor!Breakfast was taken in the room which is in the arch. It was ok...a couple of choices of cereal, sticky croissants (which were brought in fresh every day) breakfast rolls and various jams and 'dairylea\/la vache qui rit' type cheese. There were some ham and cheese slices also, some fruit and yoghurt.Orange juice was from cartons but it was ok. Coffee,milk and hot water were from thermos jugs and there was a selection of tea bags. There was a wide range of people and nationalities who stayed here from students to families with young children, young couples to families like us with older children. Internet access was free...you just sign in and sign out.Overall the Pendini was fine for a short break.
