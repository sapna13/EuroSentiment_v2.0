{"text":"Disappointment at the Palace Just back from a week at the Palace. I was, to say the least, disappointed with the resort. I'll start with the rooms. Ours was a partial ocean view. Building number 2, right next door to a construction zone that began digging, banging, and hammering at 6 A.M. The beds were old and very lumpy, the white terry bathrobes were at best dingy grey. Maid service, and we tipped, was below average. Throughout the week we had, on one occasion each, a dirty coffee pot, no face clothes, one bath towel, mini bar not replenished, and barely enough water to make a pot of coffee.The staff spoke very little to no english. The only conversation I had with any staff member was in French as he had come from Haiti.The beach was OK. I had to put on alot of bug spary after being bitten by sand fleas.There are so many palm trees, we had to move our lounge chairs 5 times a day to be in the sun. The pool was really nice. The food was tolerable. The best food was at the French restaurant. (Which is not included and averages $30.00 per person, without wine) We ate more often at the Barcelo Caribe and Barcelo Beach than at the Palace. The bartenders were great. They were always smiling and in a good mood. They were very happy to refill insulated mugs. A word of advice on bringing money.......bring lots. The ATM, located only at the Plaza, will only give you Dominican Dollars and the resorts will not change it to US $.There is a good size flea market just down the beach. They have a lot of vendors, who all want your business. Be prepared to bargain and don't pay more than one half of their asking price. Check out......if front desk tells you they will provide you with a courtesy room, don't believe it! Fortunately we left the resort at 1 P.M. so we could shower in our own room. However we had friends who left at 6P.M and 8 of them had no courtesy room. The 2 that did get the room, had no towels and had another couple barge in on them while they were still in the room.All in all it was an OK trip. I had to learn not to sweat the little things. But I will definately not be returning to the Palace.
