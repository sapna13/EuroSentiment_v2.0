{"text":"Truely Fantastic Arrived back from our holiday just over a week ago and i'm still gutted that we had to come home. everything about this hotel was FANTASTIC, the staff are wonderful they cannot help you enough but please don't expect all things done straight away.....you are running off a dominican clock from the minute you land....we never found this to be a real problem as when your on holiday there should be no rush anyway its about being relaxed!?!?Transfer from the airport was fine, check in no problems or waiting at all, room......eeerrrmmm it was ok it was no palace but it was clean and comfortable and clean towels and bed linen daily.....our maid was a little sweetie, she used to make animals out of clothes we had left on our beds (nice touch i thought!!) bless!!the food was great, i'm an extremely fussy eater yet always managed to find something suitable....we tried nearly all the restaurants while we were there too and they were all delicious....wasabi the Japanese had to be the best though, there are 8 people to a table and you have a chef cook your food infront of you and the food was FANTASTIC....i dread to think how much you would pay for something like that back here!!!Entertainment is also very good, theres a different show to watch each night, you can see how hard the staff work putting these shows together. The animation team to me are fantastic, they are out there from like 8 in the morning with stretching classes till 11 at night when the show ends then off they pop to the disco on the resort to keep entertaining guests and entertain they do!!!....they smile constantly lovely lovely people!!!We went on quite a few of the excursions too (word to the wise....book with Fredy at the Coco tours stand next to the main pool) well either him or Andy....they are lovely.....i used to go and book tours with them and find my self still sat chatting 2 hours later ha ha, they were both stars!!!we went to Saona Island, Catalina Island, Horse riding, Buggy adventure, Swimming with dolphins and snorkeling with sharks and stingrays there isn't 1 that i could say oh you must try that because to me they were all equally good!! and none of them that expensive either!!!i could ramble on forever about my holiday....but i'm sure you get the gist that i had an amazing time!!if you are considering going to this resort my advise to you is GO GO GO.....if you are after a big chill out or if you want action packed you really will have the best of both worlds here!!x ","annotations":[{"endOffset":579,"mention":"palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":573},{"endOffset":754,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":750},{"endOffset":1415,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":1411}]}
