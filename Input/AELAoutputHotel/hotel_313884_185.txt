{"text":"What can i say?? My wife and I (ages 33 and 31from Portugal) stayed at the PCP July 15-21,2007, but NO VIP guests. This was not our first all inclusive. After reading ALL the reviews, our only concern for our much anticipated stay was the weather. Allow us to thank all of our fellow trip advisor members for taking the time to share their thoughts. Here's ours, we will try to be as brief and thorough as possible.CHECK IN: smooth although I was denied room requested in building 5000 or 4000, because I was not VIP guest, I found that hard to believe, because I read that other guests with no VIP were in building 5000 or 4000, so we went to 3000. I quickly realized that begging and pleading was getting me nowhere.  We were instructed to find our building and room without assistance. (our luggage would follow). Not that we would have had difficultly, but we expected to be escourted with our luggage and shown to our room properly. We are not uppity people, but we have been to enough resorts to know and appreciate quality and class. We settled into our room 3124, slightly disappointed, but happy to get our vacation underway. THE ROOM, was very accomodating, although, the AC worked quietly only on low fan speed. The fridge was warm.THE BATHROOM was spacious with double sinks, one drained very,very slowly. Hot water, good pressure at all times. The bath towels are a disgrace, 2 stars at best. They were small, some frayed, rough and tinted gray.. We regret to inform you that the FOOD IS BORDERING ON AWFUL in the buffet!!!!. Just as a recent reviewer stated, the ala carte restaurants are a pity. We came to realize that there is something not quite right , we went to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√∂l Bacio√à√\u2020\u2022?the Italian (Lasanha was good), √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢amma Mia√à√\u2020\u2022?other Italian in Tropical (porc with hot sauce was good), Tex Mex (the best filet mignon ever!!), El Sombrero the Mexican in Tropical (with nice porc and beef) and the Chinese that I don√à?√¨t remember the name as also good√à√\u2020\u2022?Despite these shortcomings, we are actually looking forward to returning because the beautiful beach, R  R, no kids and hopefully better weather is what it's all about for us. When you stay at the PCP, please keep in mind that you get what you pay for. The major disappointment, all things considered, would be the food. The weather is always a gamble.  In conclusion, the beautiful grounds, white sand beach, gorgeous turquoise waters, pleasant service people (front desk not included), spotless  spacious rooms were the highlights that couldn't be ruined by the afore mentioned drawbacks.We would recommend this resort for those who can temporarily put aside their culinary discretion to enjoy the otherwise positive benefits. As for us, we will re visit the Trip Advisor web site in search of true Luxury Resorts, because overall, many little disappointments add up to one large disappointment .Last Note: The resort is Emilio (from Lobby Bar) and Emilio is the resort√à√\u2020\u2022?if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ understand please ask for Emilio and you will see!!
