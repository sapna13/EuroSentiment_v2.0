{"text":"5-star boutique hotel, but hostile and unfriendly to paying guests This is a fine hotel and fun for the first few visits. It is very expensive. The rooms are well equipped and comfortable. Internet performance (wired and wireless) was OK, but could be slow during peak hours. This property is NOT walking distance from the Shinjuku station. With luggage, it is necessary to take a taxi. The location is a tad awkward. Shinjuku is in the financial district, and this area shuts down after 6pm √à√\u2020\u2022?an important point I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l get to in a minute. The fitness center is adequate, but much below standards for a 5-star boutique hotel. A small indoor lap pool is in the center. Most irritating, hotel guests can use the fitness center for no charge, but if you want to take a shower, a significant fee is tacked on to your bill. Everything at this hotel seems to be al la carte √à√\u2020\u2022?including access to the restaurants.I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe stayed at this property 3 times and won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be back. For business travel, I find the Park Hyatt to be unfriendly, unwelcoming, and openly hostile to paying hotel guests. Management seems to be more interested in keeping the place trendy rather than comfortable. The main, buffet-style restaurant, Girandole, is average, quite dull, with patchy service. Kozue, the Japanese restaurant, is unexceptional and very expensive. I found English to be a problem at Kozue. I had trouble ordering a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬£arge hot sake√à√\u2020\u2022? This leaves the trendy New York Bar\/Grill at the top as the only dining option. The New York Bar\/Grill is the place made famous by Bill Murray in the movie √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022?ost in Translation√à√\u2020\u2022? Hotel guests are NOT welcome at the New York Bar\/Grill √à√\u2020\u2022?the hotel inflicts a large cover charge for all during the hours a business traveler would be eating. The cover charge is significant √à√\u2020\u2022?large enough that the statement √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂\u2020f you have to ask √à√\u2020\u2022?you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ afford it√à√\u2020\u2022?applies. Should you pay to get in, the drinks start at $16 ($USD) and go up from there. A hamburger is $45 ($USD). The food, however, is much better and the view is terrific. But at the end of a long day, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ tired and jet-lagged: I just want to get something to eat and drink. I find it maddening that as a paying hotel guest, I am not allowed or welcomed into the only restaurant that has passable food.
