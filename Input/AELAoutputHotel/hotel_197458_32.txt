{"text":"Very special little hotel!!! My niece and I spent four wonderful days in Paris. We had an absoluteball and plan to return next spring. I found the Hotel Duret on the internet and we were absolutely thrilled. The hotel is in the 16th Arrondisement on the rue Duret; it is a block or so from the Arc de Triomphe and within a 2 minute walk to the Metro. Also there are bus stops nearby. We booked a deluxe, twin bedded room and we were delighted. The room was very large with a window overlooking the rooftops of Paris (it was like being in a movie). The bathroom was sleek and modern with slate floors and an enormous bathtub with shower and a huge sink. Very American for those who are afraid of small European bathrooms. There was a heated towel rack where we dried our underwear after rinsing them out!!!Downstairs there is a lovely little bar with small tables and comfy sofas to sit on; the breakfast room is nice (but we only had breakfast there once because 16 euros is a lot for breakfast but it's good if you want it); and there is another small lounge with a laptop computer to access the Internet (free!!).I have only ONE, tiny complaint . . . the elevator is very, very small!! Only two people can squeeze on at a time and only if you aren't too fat!!! But we easily overlooked that. Everything else was wonderful.The people at the front desk were so kind and suffered through our stupid questions with a smile!! They all spoke English well enough so there wasn't a problem.There are restaurants all around: I recommend the bakery at the end of the street; amazing pastries along with good sandwiches and hot dishes. Nobody spoke English but we got by on our limited French. There is a restaurant to the left as you go out the front door of the hotel called Camille. Very nice food and the waiter\/owner, whoever he was, was so nice and cheery. We laughed so hard and had a great time.There are numerous restaurants up and down all the streets and they are all good. It was so much fun eating at the sidewalk cafes.All in all, the Hotel Duret was simply wonderful and I would not hesitate to stay there again.
