{"text":"Hong Kong's Grande Dame Still Grand Hong Kong's Grande Dame Still GrandI have been traveling with my family of 5 (including young children) for 3 weeks through Japan and Hong Kong. We booked into the Peninsula for a 5-night stay to finish off our summer vacation before returning to the US. I have to say that the Peninsula delivered on all of its promises. The front desk was efficient, gracious and extremely helpful. We were given 2 beautiful rooms on the 24th floor facing away from the harbor (make sure to book a harbor view, it is worth everything). There is much construction in the neighborhood and t we were rattled out of bed the first morning at 7am by the sounds of pneumatic jackhammers (not the fault of the hotel). After a glorious breakfast in the huge lobby restaurant, we explained our noise issue with the manager. With class and efficiency he provided us with 2 glorious rooms with full frontal views of Victoria Harbor and Hong Kong Island and they were wonderfully QUIET! The Peninsula holds an historic place in the building of this dynamic city. The hotel clearly operates with a deep understanding of this past and I hope that this ensures its future as of one of the world√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ great hotels. Here are some quick bullet points: Get a harbor view or stay elsewhere. It is just too special. Kowloon should not be considered a step-sister to Hong Kong Island. It is dynamic, interesting and the Star Ferry is just a short walk from the hotel so the distance is just not an issue. Be sure to visit the Lady√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ market on Kowloon. High Tea at the Peninsula is a must (even if you stay elsewhere but get a reservation if you can. The wait can be quite long. This is a signature Hong Kong experience. Avoid √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?\u201AÑ¢poon√à√\u2020\u2022?at the Intercontinental, Hong Kong. It exposes one of the less desirable aspects of HK life, its social elitism and blatant age discrimination. We have traveled worldwide with our children and this was the first time we were rejected for a table because we were dining with children. The reservation was booked through the wonderful concierge staff at the Peninsula. The hostess and manager were rude and un apologetic. Bad form Mr. Ducasse - your staff at Mix in Las Vegas is so warm to my family . We certainly had high hopes for Spoon and expected more from you. Enough said. We tuned these lemons into lemonade and dined instead at Nobu√à√\u2020\u2022?next to Spoon at the Intercontinental. Great meal, ambiance and staff. I Highly recommend Nobu. Finally, we experienced Dim Sum at Maxim√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Palace in City Hall, HK. Another must if you are in HK for a Sunday. Overall, the Peninsula was the foundation to a fantastic stay in HK. Cheers to the PHK Staff and long live the Grande Dame of Kawloon.I wish to share one hopefully helpful observation after years of traveling abroad with children: We have found that the places that are most welcoming of our children are categorically the finest establishments and most rewarding experiences. Those that are not usually are disappointing at best. If you book a hotel and they flinch at your traveling with children I recommend that you find another. All the best from the Road.
