{"text":"Enjoyed the Barcelo Dominican Beach I travelled to the Barcelo Dominican Beach resort in Punta Cana with my wife, brother  sister and their significant others. We were there for a week in early December. The weather was a little hit and miss with clouds and showers occasionally. Check in was a little slow but it all depends how many people arrive at the same time. We were greeted with a cold beverage while we were waiting which was a nice touch. Overall the resort and grounds were beautiful. The rooms were adequate and kept very clean. They were a little dated but we weren't in Punta Cana to sit in the rooms. The beach was incredible and the ocean was very refreshing. The pool was very nice, a little cool when you first went in but great once you got use to it. We really enjoyed the Wasabi restaurant and wished we would have went there sooner. We also checked out the Italian restaurant. It was alright and some selections were better than others. I enjoyed the fillet mignon there. The buffet restaurants were fine also and you could always find something to eat. The pizzas were very good also. We walked down to the market one day and were mobbed by the vendors. They are quite pushy and have a hard time taking no for an answer. We walked down the beach to the right of the resort for quite a ways and found a couple of shops where the vendors were a little better to deal with and not as pushy. We met some very nice people from all over the world there and had a great time with them. We also did the Bavarro Runners tour and enjoyed it immensely. It is always nice to get away from the resorts and see the country side. Overall we would like to return again someday.
