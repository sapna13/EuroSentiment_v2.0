{"text":"Average, considering the location Our check-in was probably the worst part of our 3-day stay, so that is part of why I put average. We checked in Jan 2nd, post-NYE to get the cheaper rates. We even checked in fairly late in the evening, and still ran into issues at check-in... There was quite a wait to even get a clean room (others were also waiting in the lobby with us to get one), and then we went to the room assigned and it smelled AWFUL! They are smaller rooms, so it was fairly evident that someone had vomited in the room\/bathroom over NYE, and they were still cleaning up two days later.... The smell was so overwhelming that we requested a new room, even if it meant waiting all over again! The other party that was waiting for a room when we checked in was still there, and finally left for another hotel because they were so fed up with waiting. THey gave us another room, in which we found someone else's complimentary honeymoon bottle of champagne, and had to call the front desk to make sure they didn't give us some poor honeymooners' room!! After the first night, everything settled down and we had an enjoyable stay. Rooms are small, and some have good views (we had to give up our good view to get rid of the vomit room...boo!) but the hotel seemed average to me, considering where it was located within Sydney. I have to give the staff credit for taking care of all our issues, albeit slowly. One poor front-desk gentleman had been there for 14 hours without any breaks, and still went out of his way to help get people checked into the rooms. Hope you check-in is better than ours!
