{"text":"Thanks Tripadvisor! We visited in March when the weather was perfect. We booked a month early and used the AAA rate. Very very economical, and we used the tripadvisor reviews to make our choice. We arrived and checked our luggage in as the rooms were not quite ready. Receptions staff was great. The lobby hearkens to early 20th century Bavarian hotels. Very nice. Daily tea available for guests in the afternoons.Room was great. No AC, but in the bay, you'll only need it in the summer. The room looked similar to the pictures on their website and spacious because the flat screen tv was wall mounted and no furniture other than the desk and an extra chair were present. Beds were a bit old but still comfortable. The bathroom was very cleanThere is good complimentary coffee and tea in the mornings, but you just have to be willing to go to the 9th floor to get it.All in all, you can't go wrong with the Kensington park. Location is amazing. It's a 5 minute walk from the Powell Bart station and is next to the Powell cable car line, and the closest stop is literally fifty paces up powell. It is really in Union Square and close to the major shopping. It is only a 10 minute walk to China town. The #30 bus that goes to the Wharf\/Ghiradelli square area as well as the Palace of fine arts is on stockton which is the next street after powell, and the closest bus stop is only a few hundred yards down union and up stockton.There is a Walgreens on the same block as the hotel, right around the corner if you need basic goods and snacks. You might spring for a disposable cooler and some ice (the ice machines are only on floors 9 and 12). There is also a Borders a few steps away in case you need some Seattle's best coffee or a guidebook. Caveats:-no bathroom in the lobby-no AC-ice not convenient, and no ice bucket linersDespite that, I definitely recommend the hotel.
