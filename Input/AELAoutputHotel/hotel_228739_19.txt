{"text":"Not Just Three Stars Very generally speaking, I think some hotels are over-rated at this web site. I believe some travelers are so happy to be traveling that less than acceptable hotels are rated highly because of the euphoria that comes with new experience. I am a frequent traveler, doing at least four, two week, holiday trips annually, and Paris is a favorite destination for me.I stayed in this hotel in mid-July and found it delightful. In my opinion, this hotel is exceeds its three star rating. The service was over the top, the room was a great size (considering it is in Paris), and no doubt, it is one of the cleanest hotels I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. Throw a EUR 5 tip to the maid on the first day of your stay and ask for more towels. Sadly, the hotel does not offer a sufficient number of towels if one is to 'cabin in for a day.The bedding √à√\u2020\u2022?especially the pillows √à√\u2020\u2022?was wonderful. Even though two twins were jammed together, they did not separate. The rooms appear to be sound-proof as we heard none of the neighbors and none, it appears, complained about us. The toiletries are top notch, the staff is much more than accommodating, and the neighborhood is quite acceptable to me considering I remain situationally aware due to my frequent travels to even more frequently, unfriendly destinations.There is a modest tabac just across the street for coffee and small necessities and a wonderful boulangerie just around the corner offering lovely croissants, beautiful tarts, and pastries. The Trocadero is close by as well with many tourist trap cafes which are generally unremarkable. The Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ de l'Homme, located in the Mus√ã√\u2022√ñe de l'Homme (in the Trocadero's winged Palais de Chaillot) offers one of the most appealing views of the city I can possibly imagine. It is simply spectacular. The cafe is open into the later hours, so one can view the lights of la Tour d√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©¬¢iffel and in the warm summer night. It was very romantic. The food was not particularly interesting.The hotel bar is small to non-existent and was not appealing. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ try the breakfast because we keep unusually late hours. There is room service available for breakfast or, one may choose to visit the dining room. I understand a petit dejeuner is offered as well, but we never partook of the fare as we were seldom awake before 2:00 PM. If one decides to order a bottle of Champagne, the service is unusually prompt and the price is quite reasonable, considering one is ordering room service at a Paris hotel.Except for Hilton, I prefer boutique hotels to the larger chains. This place will not disappoint if you prefer personalized service at a very reasonable price.
