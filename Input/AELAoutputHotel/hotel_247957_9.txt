{"text":"I'll try somewhere different next time The grounds are well kept, the pools clean. The maid staff kept our room clean, and were happy to provide extra towels, etc. on a small tip daily. Food is plentiful around the resort and was mediocre, relative to all-inclusives. The drinks were weak at the beach, but the bartender in the lobby knew how to mix them up for us. Although clean, our room accomodations were terrible, and we were refused the double bed room we had booked through our agent. I slept on a rollaway for the five days I was there, since we only had one king bed for the other party I was with. Occidental's response was that they had no responsibility to provide anything but a room. So sorry for us. Before I knew better, I booked a scuba excursion at the hut at the hotel beach. The boat was little and broken down, as was the scuba equipment, and the dives were handled dangerously and unprofessionally. Then I found a scuba provider (ScubaCaribe) at the resort next door and they are wonderful, clean and professional for any water excursion or activity you may want. I would suggest taking a walk down the beach and check them out before you book anything at the Occidental or with the reps in their lobby. You can find their ScubaCaribe sign on the beach to the left of the Occidental. They will take you on scuba\/snorkel tours on the other side of the island to Catalina or Saona and seem to have a larger variety of excursions than what is offered at the Occidental.
