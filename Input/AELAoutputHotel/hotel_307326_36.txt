{"text":"Perfect Hotel for our trip We stayed at the Century Southern Tower from 26\/12\/07 to 02\/01\/08 and cannot find fault with the hotel. We arrived 12 hours later than expected and were concerned that our room may have been taken but we were given a room on the top floor which we were very happy about. It was a smoking room but it did not small of smoke at all so was worth the risk. We had an amazing view and although it was cloudy we knew that if we got a clear day we would be able to see Mt Fuji. The room was very modern and clean and we were even provided with robes which were replaced with clean ones everyday. The bed was very big and there was enough room for us to live comfortably for 5 days. On the 3rd Day we got a view of Mt Fuji which was amazing and well worth being on that side of the hotel.The hotel reception staff were brilliant and helped every time we asked them a question. On the 2nd day my husband had a very bad cold and went to ask the reception to write down a phrase that he could take into a chemist √à√\u2020\u2022?they went one step better and gave him some medication! The next day we needed to know what time the last train back from Roppongi was and they checked there and then online for us. On the last day we needed to know about the Narita express times and prices and they provided all this for us straight away. My only minor complaint is that the hotel bar closed quite early for us.We ate at the Japanese restaurant in the hotel as we were given some discount vouchers. It was expensive but if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mind paying around √ä√£¬¢100 for a meal ( with wine) then I definitely recommend the Tepanyaki restaurant. You sit in a semi circle and have the food prepared right in front of you and are told about each dish by an English speaking chef. He advised us very well on what to order according to our tastes and the steak was amazing.Places I can recommend to eat include, The Chelsea caf√ã√\u2022√ñ for sandwiches, the Indian restaurant within the Southern Tower complex, Arawan Thai restaurant in Roppongi. I thought I would struggle as I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat fish but I ate amazing food everyday and a lot of places do have English menus if you look for them.If I ever went back to Tokyo, which I think I might, I would definitely stay at this hotel again √à√\u2020\u2022?the location was perfect for what we wanted to do and there was always somewhere to go for a drink\/eat\/shopping and the staff could not be more helpful.
