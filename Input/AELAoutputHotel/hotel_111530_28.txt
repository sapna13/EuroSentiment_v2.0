{"text":"Great Meeting Facilities; Rooms Need Work This hotel typifies Adams Mark Hotels' efforts to slowly shut down the brand. In typical AMH fashion, the hotel sports a fine staff but the physical plant condition is average, at best.The good: the location of this hotel is in the heart of downtown Dallas, with easy access to shopping, dining, and attractions. The staff members are numerous, warm, and friendly, and attend to requests readily and with grace. On a surprising note, the meeting and banquet facilities are well above average in condition, service, and food quality √à√\u2020\u2022?our group enjoyed banquet breakfasts, lunches, and dinners during our three day meeting and they were handled flawlessly.The bad: the guestrooms. The bed is very comfortable, but the rooms are small, much smaller than standard convention hotels. The walls are thin and you can easily hear the TV and talking from the room next door. The clock radio is annoyingly difficult to use, and the in-room coffee maker is the old-style four-cup glass pot that shows little evidence of having been cleaned in recent weeks. The bathroom is tiny, with undersized bathtubs, and the weak water pressure leaves you with only a trickle of a shower. For some reason, hot water is plentiful in the morning but at any other time of day, forget it√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√¢old water ran for nearly 30 minutes when I tried to shower before dinner. Be sure to ask for a room in the renovated South Tower, or what they now call the Tower Royale. Finally, when oh when will hotels learn that if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e not from their city, you really don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ care to receive the local paper in the morning! I awoke to find the Dallas newspaper at my door this morning and learned later that USA Today is available only on request, and only if not too many people request it. Minor item, but one that a good convention hotel should understand.The staff are telling us that the hotel is converting to a Sheraton in the coming weeks. Let√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ see if they can correct the rooms-related annoyances and make this hotel a truly solid downtown hotel√à√\u2020\u2022?\/p> ","annotations":[{"endOffset":983,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":977}]}
