{"text":"Fabulous family room This was my second stay at the Tryp Apolo and will definitely be booking again in the future.We booked a Spiderman themed family room which sounded a bit tacky but it was a good deal. In reality it was a very well thoughtout room (Room 575). It was spacious and clean. The children had large bunk beds in a room containing a desk, TV and armchairs, separated from mum and dad by sliding doors. The Spiderman theme was subtle ... pillowcases, cushions and a few posters.It is probably one of the best family rooms I have stayed in. (Also stayed in the Pere IV in Barcelona which is also a good family hotel but the location is not as good as the Tryp Apolo.)I booked direct through solmelia.com. This allows you to join the MAS scheme giving you additional benefits when staying in any of their hotels ... complimentary newspapers, special deals etc.The room had a mini bar although no tea and coffee facilities. There is a TV, air-con, safe, pillow menu, bath robe, slippers and an extensive supply of complimentary products including the usual suspects, and a few nice touches like a 'tired foot kit' etc.We didn't eat in the hotel on this visit, however during my last stay I had the breakfast which was excellent ... buffet style with lots of choice.This hotel is so well located. You are literally minutes from the port and la ramblas. We found a short cut which takes you along the back of the maritime museum and onto la ramblas.All in all I would recommend this hotel and look forward to our next visit ... hopefully very soon.
