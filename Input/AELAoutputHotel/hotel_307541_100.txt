{"text":"Bali Hyatt - Could be anywhere in the world On arrival at the hotel the staff were very friendly. However, the hotel lacks any sense of Balinese culture and any traveller coming from Europe will find they have travelled a long way to be somewhere that they could have found very much nearer home. Despite travelling in october there were lots of children at the hotel, and the Bali Hyatt is by no means a relaxing option. I am glad I was not on a honeymoon or I would have been very disppointed. Many people writing seem to have stayed in the Regency rooms, which are indeed very much more private, but you pay for that privalege and unless you do that I would not recommend this hotel.One thing that got extremely noticable with the Bali Hyatt was the prices charged by the hotel. Most drinks were over 5 times as much as you could pay if you walked down the road to a local shop, and the essence of this hotel is money money money, virtually nothing is included. Even taxi prices get hiked up for the privalege of them ordering it for you. Bali hyatt prices were very similar to that of UK hotels, a far cry from what you read in the guide books.Despite this it is a nice hotel with lovely gardens, it is just not somewhere that I would advise any European jet setter to go to, bear in mind this hotel is catering for Australian's who see Bali as the UK sees the Spanish Costa's. There are beautiful hotels nearby that appear to retain far more Balinese culture than the Bali Hyatt, which has none.
