{"text":"Decent, centralized place to stay in Amsterdam St. Christopher's Winston is definitely a YOUTH hostel. I'm 23 and felt old, compared to the 18 year old, fresh out of high school roommates of mine. The rooms were adequate, and the en-suite showers and toilet were convenient. The hostel even provides guests with shampoo and conditioner packets, which came in handy throughout our 3 months in Europe. Breakfast is the same as pretty much every hostel we encountered...cereal, bread, coffee, tea, milk, etc. Nothing fancy, but nice enough. The hostel is about a 5 minute walk from the main square, and about a 15 minute walk (with heavy backpacks) from the train station, so it's pretty easy to find. It is literally in the middle of the red light district, so that's kinda cool if you're into that thing. Free tours pick up on weekdays at the hostel, and I would definitely take advantage of that...the tours are free and then you tip the tour guides. It's a good 3 1\/2 hour tour of the city that really gets you acquainted with Amsterdam, and gives you lots of information you wouldn't know on your own.One of the things I disliked was the bar downstairs. Other hostels I stayed at that had bars were primarily filled with hostel guests. This bar is popular for EVERYONE so if you're trying to get to your room at night you have to wade through a sea of drunken teenagers, which can be annoying. The noise was at times loud enough to hear in the bedrooms but not too bad. If you're a major partier, you'll be happy. If not, you might get annoyed.Another thing, is the alley it's in is kinda sketchy. Drug dealers try to sell you things 24 hours a day, which made me a little nervous. They never seemed to be too harassing though.Overall, I enjoyed my stay here. It stays true to the Amsterdam feel, and you really can get a sense of this unique city.
