{"text":"Great Getaway I would like to begin by stating that my boyfriend and I are well traveled and I am quite picky about all things accomodation and food related. That being said, I am so happy that I chose to spend four nights at Excellence in May. A few tweaks are needed, but what resort doesn't have some things to do? Four nights was just enough time to gain five pounds from eating the extensive (but not so healthy) food three times a day. Vegetarians, beware. I eat seafood, which helped tremendously.We opted for the Club level, which I believe was good choice. Not only do you have an air-conditiioned area besides your room but there are English magazines, food all-day, cappaccino, unlimited internet, upgraded liquor (we often ordered our drinks to go from the Club where the Cuervo margheritas are ten times better than those on the beach) and of course keeping up with occasional Yankee game. Plus, if there weren't any towels left by the pool (which happened a few times) the Club was able to supply them. It is small, but it is also a nice luxury to have. There isn't a separate pool area but there is a separate beach - nice in case there aren't any other chairs left but we never had a problem either way.The beach is amazing;so clean and well-maintained. While I was dissapointed that you cannot jet-ski in Punta Cana, it is a great beach to walk along. The rooms were very nice, nothing too luxurious save for the jacuzzi bath tub. We chose a Garden View, which was great because we were only in our room at night.The food: We ate a Chez Isabelle twice in four nights. It is the only restaurant that I believe is 5 star quality (excellent service, white tablecloth, well-cooked food). While Barcelona and Lobster House were fine, they were not the caliber that a five star resort should have. Dessert is just so-so everywhere - the mini pastries left at the concierge are much better. Breakfast was nice, though I wish there were some a la carte choices. Two choices for lunch - Lobster Box, which was nice though a little unreliable and Toscana for a buffet. I sometimes preferred eating at the Club where the food was a bit more upscale at times.I found the activities a bit pathetic. While horseback riding was enjoyable, the dance lessons were a joke and I saw two people doing aerobics.I would definitely recommend this resort to young and older couples looking for a relaxing getaway. Of all of the all-inclusives I have been to, this was the most beautifully appointed, had the best food and most importantly, an amazing beach.
