{"text":"I loved it and we're going again We stayed at this hotel for 3 days starting Sept 5th. Once we drove up to the property we were taken away. It is very clean and the guys in valet were helpful with places to eat and other pieces of information from the time we arrived until the day we left. We stayed in room 311 which overlooked the street of Kuhio. We had a kitchenette, a seperate living area (which turned out to be a sofabed) and bedroom. There were sliding doors in both the living area and bedroom that led to the balcony of course with table and chairs...(which we enjoyed during the early, early morning hours).I've noticed other reviewers were complaining about the noise of the A\/C but we had no noise from the A\/C in our room. I kept the temp at 74 and luckly the noise from the street was not bad. That might have to do with the bed. Once we laid in that comfortable bed and the best pillows I've every rested on I couldn't hear anything.We walked to the beach daily and woke up around 5am to watch the sunset on the last day. It was beautiful. The beach was a 5-10 min walk. It depends on which way you want to walk. We walked about 2 blocks up Kuhio then turned right for 2 blocks. After shopping all day we came back to the hotel to rest in the lounge room and sat in the massage chairs. I feel asleep once because those chairs are wonderful. There was a game system in our room as well as in the lounge area (2 tvs) you just have to go to the check-in desk to get games.The breakfast at the Spada was great. The hotel gave us free vouchers for each day we booked. The staff was wonderful and very friendly. We have enjoyed our stay so much that we have already booked our room for March '09.
