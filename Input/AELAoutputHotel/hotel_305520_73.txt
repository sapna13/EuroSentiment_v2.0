{"text":"Clean, Comfortable, w\/ wonderful Exec Lounge We really enjoyed our stay in Singapore and this hotel was a pleasure. Yes the rooms are on the small side, but ours was attractively furnished and decorated with an Asian theme, very clean and comfortable, and most importantly -- quiet! We were in the Executive Suites though, so I can't describe the regular rooms.One of the best parts is the Executive Lounge on the top floor. It is well-staffed and the friendly attendants are helpful without being obtrusive. There is a selection of newspapers for the taking. The buffet is glorious, with all kinds of wonderful pastries, fruits, meats and smoked salmon, yogurt, cereal and even a short-order cook standing by to make your eggs however you like. One can also partake of Asian dishes here too. We ate far too much for breakfast, and in the afternoon a snack buffet is set out, and in the evening, more hors d'oueveres and snacks. The hotel itself is full of fun shops and restaurants. There is even a tailor, and one should get some custom-made clothes when visiting Singapore. There is also a pool and fitness center but we did not have a chance to visit as we were too busy sightseeing. There was also a tour coordinator located in the lobby who booked us on a sightseeing expedition to the nocturnal zoo -- transportation included and made everything so easy.My one complaint is that an open lounge area is located in the hotel lobby, with smoking permitted, so the entire lobby and adjoining cafe smells of cigarette smoke which is a real bugaboo with me; consequently we didn't spend any time there at all.
