{"text":"Lovely place but... Really Big My Fiance and I - age 31  26 just returned fromteh Gran Bahia Principe - Bavaro. Our stay was from April 24 - May 1st.Over all we had a fantastic time. But this resort if huge. We stayed in RM 24105 which is close to the beach and I was still having a hard time finding my room on the last day of our vacation. It isn't the kind of resort that you can run back to your room to grab something you need. Running back to your rooms means jumping on a tram and going for a 15 -20 minutes ride.Check in - Fast and Easy.Golden vs Normal - we purchased the golden package. What that truly means is 4 a la carte dinners vs 3, tons of beach towels vs. Towel Card, a room close to the beach vs close to the main lobbies and buffet, access to 3 pool vs 2, Housecoats and slippers. If I were to do it again it wouldn't purchase the Golden package. Being closer to the beach means further away from the buffet. Food - Good enough. We always foudn something yummy.Beach - really nice. Busy - but you can always find a chair.Pool - well kept. There is 3 pools so your should always be able to find a chair.Shopping - Pueblo Principe is the shopping area. My advice - go into the stores and check out the pricing on items. You can't bargain with the stores. Then if you want to go bargain with the vendors go ahead. The vendors start their pricing 3 x what the stores are asking. So it might be cheaper just to purchase what you are looking for from the store if the vendor won't lower their price.Rooms - really nice. Maid service was great. Needed an iron and that arrived in 5 mins. Had an Alarm clock in our room. It didn't work and I asked for a replacement that never arrived. No bugs or anything. We did have a ground floor room.Entertainment - Okay. The shows were kinda boring so we didn't attend many.Activites - their wasn't much to do on the resort so we went and did a bunch of excursions.Swimming with the dolphins - a lot of fun but you only get to swin with the Dolphin for 10 minutes. That is located in a zoo. So after you can go see all the Animals.Half Day.Dunbugee - Boring. They just drive around the streets. I wouldn't do that again. Half day.Bavaro Runner Tour - great tour. You go horseback riding, then to a ranch farm, then lunch, then cigar factory then sugar cane field then a different beach. Its a full day tour but you get to learn a lot about the Domincan.Speed Boats and snokeling - this was the best one. You drive a speed boat about 15 mintues to a platform in the middle of the ocean to go snorkeling on a coral reef for an hour then you drive the the boat back. Half day but great experience.I would go back to Punta Cana again but I look for a smaller resort. This resort was really busy and big. I prefer something a little smaller.
