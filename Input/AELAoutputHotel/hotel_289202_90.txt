{"text":"Wonderful Antiche Figure My husband and I stayed at Hotel Antiche Figure last week of March for our first visit to Venice. The hotel is perfectly situated right by the water near the airport shuttle depot and the Ferrovia (train station). This is a big factor if you plan to take the train to other parts of Italy and have a luggage or two, or if you will take the train to Venice. Hotel is across from sestiere of Cannaregio, which has a lot of gelato places and restaurants.We upgraded to a deluxe room for 30 euros a night including breakfast. Not bad at all. The room was nicely decorated and the bathroom quite roomy. We had 3 windows that overlooked the water and the street. Our room was on the second floor and contrary to what most people said they experienced at hotels in Venice and Italy as a whole, it was quiet at night and even early morning. We kind of expected it would be noisy, but we're surprised in a very good way that it wasn't. Traditional Italian breakfast had quite a bit of options and cappuccino was better made by one of the servers than from the machine. All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. It's romantic yet not cheesy. The concierge was very helpful and nice, too. I'd stay here again if I come back to Venice. Another one I highly recommend is the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari. The exterior looks rather plain but once you set foot in, you'll be more than amazed. Jaw-dropping, really. They said it rivals St. Mark's Basilica for top billing and I completely agree. Don't miss it.
