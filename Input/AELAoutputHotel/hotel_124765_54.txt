{"text":"Convenient location with great customer service I booked this hotel on priceline. I was a little wary at first since I could not find reviews for this hotel, but I later realized that what they now call Hotel 480 was actually the former Crowne Plaza Union Square.First off, the hotel is very clean and the staff are very pleasant. Even when I called beforehand to confirm my reservation, the front desk was very helpful and very willing to note my room preferences. Usually, when I book with other hotels using Priceline, I get a lot of what we have left is what you get type of responses, but not this hotel. Their pleasant, efficient service continued when I checked in in person. I had a guest with me and they even automatically asked her what her name was, just in case we lost keys and she needed to get in.Room - they honored our request and put us on the 20th floor with a nice view. The windows span the wall and give you a very expansive, airy feel. The room is cozy, but very clean and tastefully decorated. We got a king bed that was rather comfortable - wasn't the best of the beds I've slept in, but not bad.There were a couple of annoyances, however. First, valet parking at $43 + 14% tax (almost 50!) is just absurd. The second night, I found local garage parking for about $26 overnight. Secondly, internet service in the room is restricted to wired only. Normally that would be fine, but my gf and I both had to do work and were using separate computers. Without wireless, we couldn't do that at the same time.All in all, this hotel is great, beats many 4 stars that I've stayed in before, and is well worth it (especially given the low fare we found using priceline). I definitely recommend it. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":885,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":881}]}
