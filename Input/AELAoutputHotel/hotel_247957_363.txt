{"text":"Honeymoon in June My wife and I were married on June 16 and stayed at the occidental from June 18-25. Overall we were very pleased. We booked with Apple vacations.Beach: The beach was picture perfect. Clear, warm water. There was always somewhere to sit, just be sure to go early in the morning if you want a hut. Pools: The pools were very clean, huge, and not crowded at all. The swim up bar was the place to be and we never had a problem getting a drink. There were lots of cool people hanging out there.Rooms: We were in building 13 right at the beach and the room was sufficient. It had a king size bed, 28 flat screen TV with cable, there were plenty of American channels to watch while relaxing, everything was clean, but it did get mildewy in there. We left a few bucks and few trinkets for the maid√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ everyday and we always returned to find animals made out of towels, bottle of rum, flowers, etc... Service: The service was up and down. As everyone else has said the front desk reps aren't the most helpful. But the bartenders were great and they did not push you to tip. I tipped everyone for the first two days and had 3 different bartenders outright tell me not to tip, and they would not give me change to continue tipping. I'm pretty big on making strong drinks, and the bartenders were too. I suggest the cubalibre. 3 parts rum, 1 part Pepsi, 1 lime. Good stuff. Also try the Tiki Tiki. Shopping: We didn't leave the resort for shopping due to the horror stories. But there are 5 shops on the resort, outside before you get to check in, including a market. There is a shop next to the beach buffet. And there are lots of vendors in front of the restaurants on the weekend. We bought all kinds of stuff. BARGAIN. We never paid more then half of what the vendors were asking. Excursions: Be sure to book your excursions for the weekends because this place gets crowded then. Take my advice on this. We took the excursion to Saona Island our 3rd day there. It was great!! Swimming with the star fish, speed boat rides there, catamaran ride back, some of the best food of the trip, strong drinks the whole time. However, they neglected to tell us that it was 2 hours away each direction from the resort. This was horrible. We wouldn't have taken this trip if we had known it was so far away. So we didn't take anymore excursions. However we heard that the Kontiki Party Boat was a blast (booze cruise). Nighttime shows: The shows were fun. They always asked for volunteers to come up for different games and we had a lot of fun. FOOD:Reservations: You can make reservations for the al a carte restaurants either at 8am in the morning for the same day, or at 2:30pm for the following day. This is done in lobby in person, not by phone. Let me start by saying that my wife and I are somewhat picky eaters. Brazillian restaurant = Excellent! Best food of the trip by far. Italian = Terrible. Tastes like low grade spachettio's.Taco kiosk: Horrible. Spent the next 5 days back and forth to the bathroom.Pizza kiosk: Good, be sure that the crust is cooked all the way thru. I got one that the dough was not cooked all the way and ended up face to face with the toilet afterwards. Deep fried buffet on top of the swim up bar: Good stuff, french fries, nacho's with salsa and cheese, onion rings, etc...Buffet: Oh the buffet...this was a little scary. The crapes were great for breakfast, the bread was good, the cantaloupe was good, the grilled chicken on a roll was good. That's it. The rest was horrible. To sum up the food, all in all it was extremely disappointing. I will never go back strictly because of the food. However there is enough there to keep you alive. Other then that we had a blast and loved every minute of it. A typical day at the resort: 10am: Wake up11am: BreakfastNoon: Swim up bar or at the beach. Either way you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e drinking. 4pm: Drunk or just about drunk.4:30pm: Every one goes back to their rooms for ciesta.7-8pm: Everyone comes back out for dinner, drinks, etc... Good times...Rick and Kim ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1367,"mention":"Pepsi","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pepsi"],"startOffset":1362},{"endOffset":3266,"mention":"french fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":3254},{"endOffset":3273,"mention":"nacho","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nachos"],"startOffset":3268},{"endOffset":3273,"mention":"nacho","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nachos"],"startOffset":3268},{"endOffset":3413,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":3408},{"endOffset":3413,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":3408},{"endOffset":3413,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":3408},{"endOffset":3478,"mention":"roll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread_roll"],"startOffset":3474},{"endOffset":3478,"mention":"roll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread_roll"],"startOffset":3474},{"endOffset":3478,"mention":"roll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread_roll"],"startOffset":3474}]}
