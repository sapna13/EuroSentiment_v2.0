{"text":"As comfortable as ever! I live in NYC, but needed to stay in a hotel this past weekend. This is the second time in the last couple of years that I've stayed at The Muse and I just love it. The beds and linens are so comfortable. The bathrooms\/bathtubs are perfectly sized and lovely. I especially like the L' Occitane Verbena soap and the the bathrobes. I actually thought the room service from The District (the hotel restaurant) was better this time than the last. Try the thin crust pizzas. If you have time...I always love Tintol the Portuguese restaurant across the street. Great wines!The Muse is super dog friendly. One day I was out and left the dog there with the do not disturb sign. Someone from housekeeping left probably the nicest message I've ever gotten from a hotel staff person. They offered to come clean the room until 9:30pm that night. That is just so nice.If you are visiting NYC and want to be in the heart of the city...the location is so great. You are in Times Square, but off on a side street so it isn't as crazy. You are close to everything...the subways, museums, theater, etc. If you can get a deal on a room...I say go for it. The rooms are decent in size. The gym is fine, but not huge. I would say that a deal here would be $225 or less on a king deluxe room. You wouldn't feel like you are being ripped off.The lobby can get crowded with large groups trying to check in---but it is a rare hotel in NYC where this doesn't happen. The staff certainly seemed to be on top of it and working as quickly as possible. One note: I thought the whole hotel was wireless, but it is just the lobby. In the rooms you do have a high speed connection at the desk and it is around $11\/day. That is the one thing they need to update in the hotel.
