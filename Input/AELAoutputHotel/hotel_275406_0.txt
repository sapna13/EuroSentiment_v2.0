{"text":"Very good and some bad! My partner and I stayed at the NH Amsterdam Centre hotel for one night in October 2008. We booked the hotel through hotels.nl and paid 135 euros for a standard room. We booked the hotels through a special deal where we were allocated one of the four NH hotels in central Amsterdam. I named two hotels that we could have preferred to stay in which were much more central than the Amsterdam Centre but were allocated this hotel (I did call the company and asked to be changed but this was not possible). All in all the hotel was very luxurious and certainly worth a 5 star rating. Our room was very clean and came with many extras such as slippers, bath robe and a choice of pillows. I had requested a king or queen size bed but ended up with two single beds pushed together-I came falling down the middle during the night! We had a lovely shower although our original booking information said that we would also have a bath. We didn't eat or drink at the hotel as it was very expensive (25 euro pp for breakfast!), however, I guess you would expect this from a 5 star hotel. I also heard someone complaining that they had to pay to use the hotel's gym facilities-this person was under the impression that the website indicated that this was included.So...despite some problems, my partner and I had a very enjoyable trip. To anyone visiting the hotel, we would strongly recommend a visit the BOLS museam around the corner (opposite the Van Gogh museum)-it's 10 euros to visit but for that price you get a cocktail of your choice included and numerous samples of the various liquors-we left quite drunk!!!
