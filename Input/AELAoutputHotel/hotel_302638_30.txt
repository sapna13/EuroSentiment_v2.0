{"text":"5 Star enjoyment Part of the package was being picked up from the airport, which was great, and then a half hour drive to the resort.Quickly booked in and the bags taken to the room, which was spacious with a nice clean bathroom and small but functional balcony.All the meals were good and a show on the lawn each night which was local and topical and a BBQ to accompany it. All the food was to a high standard, same goes for the hotel staff. Nothing seems to be too much trouble for they, a big smile all the time from everyone makes this a perfect and relaxing holiday.The pool was great, the drinks from the pool bar just keep on flowing and if you just want to laze around all day and get a tan - that's OK as there are lots of pool loungers and lots of sun beds on the private beach.We upgraded to the Grand Suite when we had a surprise visit from our daughter who was still on her backpacking world trip, and wow, what a room, double hight ceiling, twin balconies, what a fab appartment, and right next to the spa, where we had a nice massage on a couple of occasions.We took a trip around the island, visited a silver jewelery factory and shop, a monkey sanctuary and the elephant ride was fun. Had lunch by the volcano's and went shopping in Kuta and Denpasser.So overall, a fun packed break which was as busy or as relaxing as you wanted to make it.The resort is worth it's 5 stars, would I go back there? Indeed I would. If you are thinking about going there - think no longer and just book it, you wont regret it!
