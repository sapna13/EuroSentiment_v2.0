{"text":"What Is Not To Like I too was a bit trepidatious about staying here after reading the postings. Were those people staying at the same hotel???I traveled with another family and we were a party of 7 and were all treated as guests. Complaints about the breakfast room being dark were unfounded. The food was the same every morning but there was certainly enough of a selection that you could enjoy. The meats and cheeses were great. We took an early moring train to Rome one day and arranged to leave the hotel at 6 AM with breakfast to go . Thank you to the staff for that accomodation.We had rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floors and the rooms were great. They looked like the the rooms that were advertised on the web. I did email ahead and asked to make sure that we would be getting the rooms that have been upgraded. They looked out on the main Via and yes it does get a bit noisy from the pedestrians below so we just closed the window. The beds are hard but that did not stop us from getting a good nights sleep.It was truly beautiful to hear the bells each day from the Bell Tower. The Hotel is ideally located to all the main sights. The funny comment on our trip is when asked how far away an attraction or destination was from the hotel, the answer was 10 minutes.I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be in the heart of Florence, close to the Duomo, The Accademia, the Uffizi Gallery, the San Lorenzo Market, the train station...I could go on. Don't miss the view from the rooftop of the Hotel. Just spectacular.
