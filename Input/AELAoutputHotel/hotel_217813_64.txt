{"text":"Does the job with great service When I booked this hotel, one of the main considerations was proximity to Pier 35 as we were taking a cruise to Alaska. We settled on the Holiday Inn Express after trolling through the many reviews on the different hotels in the Fisherman's Wharf area, and I'm happy to say it fit the bill exactly. If you're looking for a hotel with lots of history and character, don't come here. However, if all you need is a comfortable bed, a quiet room, a safe location and friendly service it's perfect. Previous reviews had also mentioned asking for a room facing the courtyard to minimise noise - I included this when making my internet booking, and our wish was granted, with our room also being on the top floor. Our flight from Australia was scheduled to arrive around 10.30am, but a quick call to the hotel a couple of days before confirmed they had a luggage room if we needed to kill a couple of hours before check-in. Imagine our surprise and pleasure when, on arriving at the hotel around midday, we were given our room straight away. The hotel has a free business centre near reception, with two PCs with internet access, plus a printer. There's also a breakfast area on the ground floor, with a free continental breakfast included in the price. It's not exactly gourmet, and our first experience there was a little overwhelming as a large school group were staying - enough said! However, the Hollywood Cafe a couple of doors down did a great lunchtime BLT, so I'd imagine their breakfast was pretty good too. There's a pretty good sports bar\/restaurant right across the street, plus there's also a Safeway and a Walgreens a block or so east on North Point. We found the staff unfailingly helpful and friendly, the bed was very comfortable, and the room EXTREMELY quiet. The hotel's just far enough away from the main action at Fisherman's Wharf to be quiet, but is just a five minute walk away.Once we checked out, Pier 35 was an easy walk of 5 blocks, towing our bags along. While this style of hotel may not be to everyone's taste, it does the job well.
