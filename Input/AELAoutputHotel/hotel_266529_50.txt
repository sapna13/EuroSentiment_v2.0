{"text":"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location My sister, mother and I stayed at the Hotel Europa for 3 nights (ok only 2, but more about that later). It was beautiful, less than a minute walk to two metro stations, right on el Puerta del Sol, the heart of Madrid. The room was clean and large, especially compared to others we have experienced in European hotels.Interesting note: you have to leave your key card in the holder by the door or the electronic systems (lights, AC) will power down after a few minutes.The hotel restaurant is nice, not cheap, but reasonably priced. The food is good, the waiters don't speak a lot of english, but you can get by. It's a great place to people watch, as you are almost on el Puerta del Sol, lots of people are always walking by.The staff is very friendly, they all speak some english, one gentleman in particular speaks perfect english as well as perfect spanish. There is free internet access in the lobby, they ask that you limit your time to 15 minutes per room.The only problem we had with our entire trip was the fiasco of getting to the airport Friday morning. We were all set to take the shuttle to the airport, until we realized it was E20 per person and they only accepted cash, which we did not have enough of as our trip was almost over. Our flight left at 7:15, and the Madrid metro doesn't begin daily service until 6:00. We ended up staying the night in the airport. So my advice to someone about leaving Madrid is to book a flight no earlier than late morning, unless you want to spend the money on a shuttle or taxi, or have someone who can personally drive you to the airport.
