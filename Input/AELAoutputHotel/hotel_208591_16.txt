{"text":"Great location, just remember it's a one-star hotel The best thing about the Hotel Lloret is its location right at the top of the Ramblas, near Plaza Catalunya. This puts you right between the Barri Gotic and L'Eixample, and right next to a major metro stop. Other positives include the friendly and helpful staff and the bathroom, which looked recently renovated. Also, the room price is relatively low for Barcelona.However, it's important to keep in mind that the Lloret is a one star hotel, and just an average one at that. Here are the negatives based on my recent trip there (I stayed 3 nights):-While the room was clean for the most part, there was a stain on my bedsheets and I did see a roach in our room the second night. That could have been a fluke, but it's never fun to have bugs in your room. -I was on the 2nd floor off Carrer Tallers (a side street) and even with the windows closed it was very noisy. I rarely have trouble falling asleep at night but I did here. Bring earplugs!-Skip the breakfast. It's bread with jam and butter and pastries from a box. Coffee from a machine, which was okay. You can get better for less at just about any cafe. If I go to Barcelona again, I will probably spend a little more to stay somewhere nicer. However, if you're looking for something cheap but nicer than a hostal, the Lloret is okay, and the location really can't be beat.
