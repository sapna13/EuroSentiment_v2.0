{"text":"Sofitel New York--Great Stay for the Money Let's face it, New York City hotels are very expensive. We were able to stay in October at the Sofitel New York, in a suite, for about the cost of staying in a basic room in many of the other NYC hotels. Our suite was on the top floor of the hotel. It was spacious, with complimentary boxes of chocolate and bottles of water daily, turndown service, a deep, sunken tub and high end bath amenities. The bed was a little too soft for our tastes--with its deep down topper, but otherwise everything about the room was perfect.The only real complaint I have is that one morning something happened to the hot water and it took 40 minutes before we could shower (before the problem was fixed and hot water was available again.) The front desk staff, the three concierges we dealt with, the housekeeping staff--all were friendly and first rate. Go to the concierge for lunch\/dinner recommendations. We did a couple of times and ate some of the best food ever. We strongly recommend the Osteria al Doge, which the concierge recommended. Though it is pricey, it has the best Italian food. The Gaby bar, in the Sofitel, serves delicious drinks and has quick food service. The Gaby restaurant, on the other hand, has good food, but the service was lacking and the place had a lot of empty tables on the Thursday night we were there. On our next stay to New York, we will definitely stay at the Sofitel once again.
