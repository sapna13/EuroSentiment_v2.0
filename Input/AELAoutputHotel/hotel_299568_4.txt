{"text":"awesome resort right on a beautiful clean beach We just got back from 5 nights stay in the Tropical terrace room and all I can say is that it was amazing. I have stayed in alot of resorts around the world and I thought the smaller size of this resort made it more personal and friendlier than the others.We were lucky as the resort wasnt busy when we were there so it was easy to get a lounge on the beach and relax all day. The water was very clear and clean and the swimming area is one of the biggest along the Nusa Dua coast. The water sport activity's actually make it more fun as you can watch people all day going past and it isn't as noisy as most people said. If you want to do water sport activity's walk down the beach and book direct through the operators as it is alot cheaper than the activity counter at the resort. The beach bar was great, especially the happy hour(Buy one, get one free) from 5 to 7 every night. The meals on the beach for lunch and tea were good, great pizza, get an accor membership as all meals are half price.The breaky buffet was great but I reconmend not doing the buffet tea, heaps of restaurants down the road which were fantastic and cheap. Eat at the one with the big pizza oven out front, we had no problems there.Our room was very clean and we couldnt hear any noise at night and it was a nice stroll to the pool or beach. The pool is good but as the ocean was so clean we so we spent everyday in it and only had one swim in the pool.The staff are very friendly but tend to be a little slow with service but who cares, we weren't in a rush. We also stayed at the sofitel in Seminyak but wished we stayed extra nights at the Novotel as it was so more relaxed and personal.I give it my thumbs up and hope to go back next year ","annotations":[{"endOffset":970,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":967},{"endOffset":970,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":967},{"endOffset":970,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":967},{"endOffset":993,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":988},{"endOffset":993,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":988},{"endOffset":1115,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1112},{"endOffset":1222,"mention":"pizza oven","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1212},{"endOffset":1339,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1335}]}
