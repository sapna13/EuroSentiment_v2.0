{"text":"Lovely place We just returned from our trip and a wonderful stay at Relais Bosquet. It's as charming and friendly a place as you could ask fort, and in a great location. Our room was spotless and spacious, with all the amenities we could want, including a safe and a mini-bar. It also had very handy electric blinds that could be lowered, which was a big help, since it stayed light surprisingly late there. There was also an internet terminal in the lobby for checking e-mail , and free newspapers in French and English.Frederica and Christian were incredibly helpful with everything, including dinner reservations, taxis, and anything else we needed.The Rue Cler neighborhood where the hotel is located is a nice quiet spot, but very well situated. You can walk to quite a bit (You're especially close to the Eiffel Tower and the Invalides) and there is a Metro station (Ecole Militaire) only about a 5 minute walk away. There are two wonderful bakeries within a block of the hotel (one practically downstairs), and we got pastries for our breakfast most days. There is also a small grocery store just a few steps away, and many other food shops and produce stands very close. The hotel serves a continental breakfast, but it was not included with our room and was a little pricey (15 euros a person), so we did not eat there. There are also several cafes very close at hand where you can sit down for a breakfast and watch the world go by.
