{"text":"Wonderful lovely Lenox We came to the Lenox in Boston to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday and go see Bruce Springsteen at the Garden. I wasn't sure where to stay, the choices were overwhelming. It was my first trip to Boston and I wanted the perfect location.I chose the Lenox by the rave reviews on this site. And it exceeded expectations. The old fashioned but updated hotel was exactly what we hoped for. We upgraded to room 900 which included a wood burning fireplace. Ask for bellman Jimmy Fisher. He's a sweet fellow who's been here for over 60 years and has stories about previous occupants from the glamorous eras goneby. He had our fire ready for us upon our return from a show at the Roxy. The concierge team of, Karolyn and Cindy directed us to the best Italian restaurants in the North End. We loved Terramia and sister, Antico Forno, wood burning pizza, wine, open faced raviolo, more wine. Awesome.The bed was comfortable, pillows fluffy and cozy. Our room overlooked the Boston Marathon finish line. We ate breakfast at the Azure, the hotel restaurant and the malt waffles melt in your mouth. Delicious!We did the Duck tour, sounds corny but Captain Amnesia gave us a fun overview of the Historical highlights along with lots of personality and inside peeks into stuff we'd never get from guidebooks.Bruce rocked the Garden, played a mix of his old and new magic and again, we were surrounded by friendly, interesting Bostonians.Great service, clean, cozy rooms and great customer service.
