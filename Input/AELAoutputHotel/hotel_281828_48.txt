{"text":"Best Hotel In Seattle I live near seattle and frequently have business meetings at this hotel.. after my first visit to the fairmont seattle I wanted to come back with my family we enjoyed it so much that we go here as oftend as we can(my daughter loves this hotel so much she had her birthday here).I have stayed at numerous Seattle hotels but none was as good as this one... Service:The service here is expectational for a five star hotel, it meets up to it's fairmont name.-Very very kid friendly, [ at every visit my two kids recieved a complimentry cookies and milk delivered to our room.. the milk was cold and the cookies are always still warm from the oven which is always a nice touch ] -while staying here during christmas time my kids would recieve a complimentary gift package with a bunch of fun toys and games, they quite enjoyed them :)-also, almost always we are upgraded to a suite -by the pool they offer complimentry water bottles and sometimes complimentry gatorade...In the morning they offer hot tea which is a nice thing to wake up to.-toys are by the pool such as kick boards and such for people to use.-here is a tip ask for some ecalyptus for the sauna at the pools front desk they will give you some, complimentry ROOMS- The rooms are nice and well equiped with esentials -2 robes and slippers are availible for use, if you are traveling with kids call housekeeping and order 2 kids robes which are made smaller. ANY OTHER FACTS:- The lobby is beautifully decorated.-when it is raining (which seems to occur often in seattle) ask for an umbrella they will lend you one for the day.-try to come in during christmas they bring in a huge tree decorated to a certain theme... also this year they had a gingerbread sculpture of this hotel which was very cool to look at.-if you want a good seafood dinner go to the hotel restaurantI have eaten here many times and have never been disatisfied with the taste ( the sirloin burger is phenomanal so are the fish dishes.. look at the specials)If you have chosen this hotel to stay at for your seattle visit you have not chosen wrong!! You will enjoy every minute of this wonderful city and just as great, hotel!!
