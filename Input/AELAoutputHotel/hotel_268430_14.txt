{"text":"Isla Verde at it's best! We enjoyed a week and a half at the Isla Verde Courtyard Marriott and loved every minute! The 12th Floor beachfront Suite had a stunning view of the beach, ocean and San Juan skyline. The evening sunsets on the balcony were exactly the relaxing moments we were looking for.We were impressed by the service we received at every level at the resort. From the moment we arrived at the front door and were helped with our vehicle and bags, we felt like we were welcome and knew we would be well-cared for. The front desk personnel were always helpful and pleasant. The room was exceptionnally maintained by the staff. The enitre resort property was immaculate and cared for - it made our stay so enjoyable.Our suite became our home away from home - the beds were very comfortable, and we had plenty of room to spread out with our kids. With the Olympics on TV during our visit - our kids really enjoyed the nice television set - and allowed us to enjoy the nightlife a the resort. The staff was so respectful of our time in our room - going to great lengths to clean it around our schedule.The Restaurants were fabulous. The food at the Salsa Restaurant provided the authentic Puerto Rican cooking that we were looking for. Although it's always good to get out and enjoy the variety restaurants in the neighborhood have to offer - it would have been very easy to eat every meal right at the resort. The beach front higher end restaurant Sirena was just relaxing, delicious experience. The Fish and Polenta dish I enjoyed was out of this world! The breakfast buffet was large and provided a delicious breakfast to all of our different tastes. Our kids loved Banana - getting their nightly treat there to enjoy in the room!The pool was wonderful - surrounded by beautiful palm trees and the beach just steps away. Our whole family enjoyed every moment we spent in the sun and water! The staff was so helpful in getting to the tourist sites as well - their directions to the Bacardi Factory were right on and made the trip so easy.All in all, we were astounded with the warm smiles, friendly attitudes of the staff, and how much we enjoyed our stay! We will be recommending the Courtyard by Marriott Isla Verde Resort to everyone we know! We'll be back again ourselves too!
