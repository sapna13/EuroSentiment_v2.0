{"text":"Great Customer Service We like small boutique hotels, and since we are members of Kimpton, naturally we looked at Kimpton hotels while researching for hotels in NYC. We chose The Muse over the other Kimpton for our one week visit to NYC .The goods:- Great Customer ServiceStaff, from the front desk to housekeeping was very helpful and friendly. They were always smiling and saying hello when we walked by. A few even remembered and greeted us by our names each time we walked by. - We requested a higher floor, away from the crowd. We received our requested room without any problems. This is very important for us because a lot of times, even after we requested for a specific room, we never got the room we requested and would be given excuses by the hotel.- The room and bathroom are pretty spacious for NY standard. - The bed was very comfortable. I have trouble sleeping through the night, but I slept through the nights the whole time I was there.- Complimentary wine was served daily from 5-6pm in the lobby. It's nice. We took this time to relax and catch up. - Location location location. This hotel is about 1\/2 block away from Times Square and a few blocks from 5th Avenue. There's always something to do and something to eat. You will never grow bored or go hungry here. The bads:- As much as we loved how friendly the housekeeping staff was, we were disappointed by the cleanseness. There was mildew growing around the tub. The bath rope had blonde hair (we're not blonde) which made us think it was not washed since the last use. There were black stains on our white comforter. The carpet was dirty. Our white socks turned black walking around in the room. - The lobby is tiny, and it gets really packed during the complimentary wine hour. It's kind of hard to be relaxed when you are worried someone might trip over you.- Check your bill daily. Both our room and our friends' room were charged for movies we didn't order three days in a row. We finally asked to block the pay-preview channels. I must note that the charges were taken out without any problems. Overall, it's a nice hotel. Most likely we will stay here again. The people made our stay nice. They should work on their housekeeping though.
