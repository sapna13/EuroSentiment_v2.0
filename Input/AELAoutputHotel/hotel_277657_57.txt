{"text":"Nice location but that is all Hotel has a nice location on the canal but unless you are looking out the window, you can't enjoy the view. Also there is construction currently on the canal and it is loud in the morning.We had the Vermeer room. We were told we could take the lift to the floor the room was on but when we went to take it, a man working on the building was quietly telling us to not use it. We wondered how safe it is.Room has a strong flowery smell and the tiny beds are hard and pillows are lumpy.The walls in the hotel are paper thin. You can hear everything people are saying\/doing. I could even hear someone zipping up their bags.There is no tv, no radio and the phone was broken in the room. Although we advised the staff that it was broken, it was never fixed. No internet either.There is only a tiny closet for you to hang clothes. No dresser.One morning at breakfast I noticed mouse poop on the table. They also leave the eggs unrefrigerated in the kitchen. I would stick with just the coffee.There is noone around in the evening and early morning which may make it difficult to check in or out early\/late.Security is dicey as one time we came in throught the back (as directed by staff) and a man followed us in (holding up a key). We had no idea if he worked there.Staff is nice.This hotel is inexpensive but I cannot recommend it soley on the price and nice location.
