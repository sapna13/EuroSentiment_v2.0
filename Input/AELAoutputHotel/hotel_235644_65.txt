{"text":"Had a fantastic time! if you can - stay here! Second time at Disneyland Paris and decided to book the Disney Hotel (stayed at Explorers last time). Although We had no real issue with the Explorers this choice was certainly worth the extra cost. Mainly due to quiter and more pleasant\/civilised environment, excellent breakfasts (hot and cold varieties and plenty of choice) and proper seating instead of 'school dinner' type services, characters present within the hotel every day where the kids got the majority of their autographs, excellent hotel staff service and convenient access to the park at all times. Sure it's expensive wherever you go but you need to do your homework in advance and just be willing to go and spend every last penny to get the enjoyment and 'Disney feeling!'. We stayed in a standard room having attempted to enquire about a club room but in the end were not dissapointed as it was both spacious (amble wardrobes  cupboards, big bathroom, desk, bay Window and TV  Mini bar etc including choclate coins that were left on the pillows for our return from the park each day (nice touch!). Did not eat at the resturants in the hotel but they did look good including the characters who appeared to be around the eating areas also. Price guide (from memory based on what we had\/seen);Beer : √ä√£¬¢4 a pintCocktail : √ä√£¬¢8Glass Wine : √ä√£¬¢5Buffet in one of the Resturants : 34 Euros Adult, 12 Euros ChildOne observation which has nothing to do with the hotel but with Disney in general - many Europeans outside the UK DO NOT portray a level of politeness and understand a queue or 'waiting thier turn' system here! yes we all want our kids to have fun and get autographs etc., but why does simple decent manners go out the window at EuroDisney compared to anywhere else abroad? So many times we were faced with situations which left us speechless. Not a slur on any country as I have visited the mainstream ones many times but somehow people take on a different persona when in EuroDisney and become downright rude when the either want to get on a ride, on a bus, queue for food\/snack or get a characters autograph in the park.big tip - if you plan to go to the Disney Village for food, try and get there before the main Park or Disney Studios close otherwise you will be left queing for a long time to get in anywhere. Favourite Disney Village food places were Ludwigs Catsle and Rain Forrest Cafe - Planet Hollywood has very little atmosphere.
