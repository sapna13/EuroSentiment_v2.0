{"text":"Wonderful Experience! We absolutely loved Dreams. It was our first time at an all inclusive and were very pleased. Anyone who is not happy with the food are way too picky and should rethink going to an all inclusive like Dreams. There were so many options that I can not imagine not finding something that you would like. We would rate the food from good to great. Many choices for breakfast, include fresh made omelettes, pancakes, french toast and made to order fresh fruit drinks etc..After a couple days we knew what items were more to our liking. Service everywhere was excellent and with a smile. These Dominican people are very hard workers and work long hours while retaining their smiles. There is a language barrier at times when trying to communicate, but it never caused too much of a problem. The pool is absolutely amazing. Bring your own inflatable float so as not to be disappointed to not find a float provided by the resort. Relaxing by floating in the pool is definitely stress relieving. Like other reviewers, I agree, go to the beach to the left and the water is better, and the floor of the ocean is more sandy. The water is not as blue- green as other areas in the Caribbean, but this did not alter our opinion of the resort. The pool makes up for it. Entertainment was very good, just don't expect Broadway or Vegas quality shows. The room attendants do a great job cleaning the rooms and do a special turn down service in the evening using fresh flowers accents . People comment on the 1 hr bus ride to the resort from the airport. Yes, the road is bumpy, but we used Prieto transportation, and rode on a very comfortable large tour type bus and found it interesting and also humbling to see how some Native Dominicans live. We felt truly blessed for what we have. I highly recommend this resort to all, it definitely stands up well to our wonderful cruises we've done in the past . If I was a person to repeat a vacation, this would definitely be one.
