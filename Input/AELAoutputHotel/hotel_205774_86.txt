{"text":"Great service, great price! Hotel Kursaal, simply put, exceeded my expectations. I stayed there with two friends for a month-long trek through Europe, so cost was at the forefront of our minds. I believe we got the room for around $50 per person per night for a triple.The location is excellent - it's within a five minute walk from the train station, and within 15 minute walking distance (or less) to the majority of places like the Duomo, Uffizi, David, etc. - though, of course, Florence is such a small city and cabs reasonably cheap that you don't need to worry that much about where your hotel is, but still, it was convenient.They offer a continental breakfast and, unlike other places I have stayed at, actually live up to the name. Their comfortable dining room offers all you can eat, and they have all manner of food, coffee, tea, and juice that you want.But far and away the best part was the staff. The ladies at the reception were *extremely* helpful [and, may I say, extremely attractive? =c)]. We wanted to book a wine tour, and they took care of the entire ordeal; even when the first few leads they found were unavailable, they made extra effort. Then, when a hitchup occurred after one of the tours, they were able to contact the company and translate for us in resolving the dispute. They went above and beyond, and I would gladly stay here again if I return to Florence. Great job, guys!
