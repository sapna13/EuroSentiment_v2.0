{"text":"almost perfect holiday having read mixed reviews on this site we were not quite sure what to expect. We write as a 40 something English couple who have no option other than to suffer the terrible service industries thrust upon us in the uk : bad service, rip off prices, queues, small portions of mediocre food etc. Not to mention the traffic !Our opinion is that many of the complaints about this resort are from non uk residents who may be more familiar with higher standards of service\/environment than we have in the uk. It is all relative and one has to balance everything before making an informed choice or judgement.The fact that hardly anyone including the staff spoke English was a blessing.We didnt have a clue what most people were talking about and it was great. The staff do their best even though some of them havent got a clue what you are talking about beyond basics but who cares ?POSITIVES-- clean, friendly, great food, lovely cold beer (that often refilled itself without asking) selection of proper cocktails, spacious pool areas and grounds, numerous bars and restaurants,large rooms with all inclusive mini bar (nice touch)NEGATIVES-- the shady spots on beach are reserved the night before, there is no problem getting a lounger but no way will you get shade. The people who do this dont occupy these beds until the hottest part of the day when they move in from the sun. Also men selling trips on beach are a real pain. The looky looky men are not a problem.One tip apart from ignoring them is to sit back from sea as they do not venture too far inlandCONCLUSION-- do yourself a favour and go ","annotations":[]}
