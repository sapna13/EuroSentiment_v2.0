{"text":"Dream honeymoon hotel My husband and I booked in to the Riu Bambu for our honeymoon at the end of May. As soon as we arrived the hotel staff were very attentive and quickly checked us in. Within about ten minutes of arriving at our room the porter arrived with our bags. The room was spacious and clean. All the staff were very friendly and always had a big smile, but so would I if I lived in such a beautiful country! Our maid Marisol was just fantastic, she was so cheery and really put so much effort in to having our room spic and span. Also, as she knew we were honeymooners she also filled our room with flowers every day. We also recieved a bottle of rum and a fab painting from the manager to celebrate our wedding.The beach just speaks for its self, it really is paradise. Every morning and afternoon we made a habit of having a long stroll along the miles and miles of white sand. We did'nt ever use the pool as I think its a waste when there is such a beautiful beach on your door step but it looked nice enough.We were really pleased with the food and drinks, some nights there were some odd choices on the menu but we always found something that we enjoyed. The al la carte restaurants were ok but we found we preferred the main restaurant.I think the best thing of the resort is the staff, especially the entertainment staff,they really do try and make your stay as great as they can. Some of the shows are a bit naff but they try so hard to get everyone involved and enjoying themselves you really can't help but laugh.To sum it up we had a great holiday and you never know may return for a second honey moon in the future ;-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":885,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":880}]}
