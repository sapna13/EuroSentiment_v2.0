{"text":"Karen and John Adamthwaite, Newcastle, NSW Australia - Loved it Antiche Figure, Venice, Italy.Date 26\/27October 2006.What a great hotel. We had a booking for four couples, two had booked canal view rooms and the other two normal rooms. We had just arrived off the Marco Polo Cruise and had to walk from the overseas terminal to the hotel as no transport was available so we just followed the signs to Piazzale Roma and then followed the signs to the trains station. Only took 15 minutes in total. Ten of us arrived at the hotel at 9.30am, eight were staying and the other couple we travelling from Venice to Rome by train at 1pm. On our arrival Alessandro was marvellous he allowed our other friends to leave their luggage until they left on the train and that allowed them to explore Venice for a few hours.From the moment we walked in Alessandro was only too pleased to assist us with maps and information on Venice. We stayed two nights (not enough) and that afternoon we bought a 24 hour Vaporetta ticket from across the Canal, good value. Only takes 10 minutes to get to St Mark's Square and it is an exciting way to travel around Venice, especially when you do not have much time. We also used the ticket to go over to the island of Lido, what a pretty place, it even has cars and buses.Before our arrival at the Antiche Figure I emailed them and asked if they could book the Secret Itinerary of Doge's Palace which they did so without any bother. Francesca emailed me a booking number and all we had to do was arrive there and go to the Information desk and get out tickets. This tour takes you to parts of Doge's Palace that the general tours do not take you. Well worth it. Two of us had canal view rooms, and the other two couples had the other rooms. All four rooms we great. My room was 411 and every morning I would stand at the window and look at all the traffic and goings on on the grand canal, loved it. Bathroom was huge and our bedroom was huge. It is lovely to sit out at the tables out the front of the hotel and have a few glasses of wine and just people watch.This hotel has everything, even free internet access in the lobby. How good is that., especially when internet cafes charge so much throughout Italy.This was the best hotel we stayed at during our 4 weeks away and would have no hesitation in staying there again, even if I couldn't get a canal view room. All four couples found this to be the best, not one complaint.Congragulations Alessandro, Francesca, and the lovely lady who served us our wine of an afternoon, I'm sorry I didn't get your name. Antiche Figure exceeding all our expectations and thank you for your hospitality.Karen And John Adamthwaite, Newcastle, NSW, Australia ","annotations":[{"endOffset":37,"mention":"Newcastle","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Newcastle_Brown_Ale"],"startOffset":28},{"endOffset":1627,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":1621},{"endOffset":2701,"mention":"Newcastle","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Newcastle_Brown_Ale"],"startOffset":2692}]}
