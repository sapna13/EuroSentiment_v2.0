{"text":"Never again! My sister in law booked us here April 23-25. I was a bit hesitant after reading earlier negative reviews. But since she was paying, I didn't complain. Then it all began...First of all, no doubt the hotel is strategically located if you're the type of person who'd love to see downtown Seattle by foot. But the rooms are a bit tight, specially if you have more than 3 luggages (we were on a tour of the West Coast and had a 7yr old). On our first day, at the hallway outside our room on the 5th floor, 2 male staff members were chatting about personal issues. As I got out of our room to head for the elevator, they didn't even say hi or anything. Worse, they didn't even budge an inch from where they were having their conversation to give way. It was I who had to say excuse me to get through.Our unpleasant stay became from bad to worse when on the morning of our 2nd day, the water in the toilet bowl, sink and the shower turned brown! My wife quickly pulled out my 7yr old out of the shower and dried her up. To my wife's surprise, the brown stuff stuck on to the towel!After reporting this to the front desk, a maintenance man in dirty uniform came to say that they had just renovated that floor and to let the water run for a few minutes. I told him that my sister in law was in another room and their bathroom water wasn't brown. The front desk female staff calls to say that I could use another room to shower and it was left unlocked. When I got to that room, guess what? It was locked. I bumped into another hotel guest on the same floor and she says her husband had to pour water down the toilet bowl to assist the flusher. The only good thing about this hotel is the food and the service at the ground floor restaurant, Max's. Sorry Ramada Downtown Seattle, I give you a two thumbs down! ","annotations":[]}
