{"text":"The Westin: Pricey, safe, pricey, clean, pricey... busy. This was my 3rd time at the Westin on Time Square, of which the first 2 times were 'business' and while I appreciated the comfortable bed, I didn't really explore the Westin until I recently stayed there for a private occasion.Let's remember: It is after all NY. A lot of things in New York are overpriced. But first of all: the room. Certainly very comfortable beds, but after having spent at other places between my first two stays and this one, I have to say I was not as impressed as I had been a few years back. The Westin obviously upgraded to plasma flats screen TV's since then, so that's nice. I remember the furniture to be a little nice (I didn't have an extra ottoman in this room, but a rather ugly and not very comfortable chair w\/ a stool). The bathroom was nice, even though it would be nice if the glas sliding door allows to be locked from the inside.The food in the hotel is outragiously overpriced. At least in my opinion. I spent one night at the hotel bar and consumed a ginger ale and a martini for together $22 dollars. From former experience I decided not to visit the steak house in the bottom floor of the hotel, which back then I did for breakfast and also found the pricing not relevant to the quality \/ amount of food served.Instead I frequent the European Cafe next door which in my opinion makes excellent salads, flat breads, breakfast foods, etc. One morning we even had them deliver, which they'll w\/out extra charge, just that you have to pick it up from the front desk\/security, because the Westin doesn't allow room deliveries from the outside.The Westin is conveniently connected to restaurants (a Shevy's Mexican restaurant which by the way has refreshing top shelf margaritas and food to go that is nicely packed and portioned generously, just in case you rather eat in your room), a Starbucks in the bottom floor, a movie theater, etc. Given the fact that it was a VERY hot summer weekend, the a\/c cooled inside connection walk ways were quite refreshing. Location? Well, what's there to say? The Westin on Time Square says just that: the buzzing Time Square in front of it. If you are looking for the typical tourist New York experience, then its location is perfect. We could see Madam Tousseau's and Ripley's Believe it Or Not from our window, along w\/ the typical view you would have from a top floor high rise in the city.Would I go back there? I am not sure. I now believe that there are comparable and\/or even better hotels in that area. Plus, I don't know if I would choose such a tourist-driven area again for a visit. I think I would rather go to a little more 'authentic' in a more quiet neighborhood, possibly a BB.... The Westin - certainly not a bad choice, and if you want to be on the safe side, check in a hotel that appears to be safe, clean, central, etc. Be prepared to avoid the hotel options in regards to food unless you don't mind paying $30 for a chicken sandwich. But there are options to eat out everywhere around the Westin, not a problem!
