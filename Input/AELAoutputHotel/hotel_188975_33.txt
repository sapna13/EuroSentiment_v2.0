{"text":"Very Nice Hotel I surprised my mother with a trip to Paris and London. I wanted to stay at the best hotels and per this website I booked at the Four Seasons. The room was very nice and very european. A lot of antiques and furniture I have only seen on TV... I felt a little out of sorts being in the hotel. It is very high class and since my mother and I are just your average middle class Americans we were taken aback. The concerige was excellent and all the staffers were very nice about the language barrier... In all it was a nice visit. Room service was great but very expensive. Just get used to it all being expensive. The hotel is in a great location and very close to the giant Luis Vuitton store if you are into shopping. Paris is gorgeous and the hotel is just another highlight. We did have some interesting encounteres with the locals who seemed to be a little amused by our attire... but oh well we didn't wear the thigh high boots and leggings... it seems most of the women there wear that type of thing. If I ever go back to Paris I would probably stay at a different hotel... Not for anything that the hotel did because it was excellent... but like I said earlier... we felt a little out of sorts being in such a fancy hotel... But it really is a wonderful place and I would highly recommend it.
