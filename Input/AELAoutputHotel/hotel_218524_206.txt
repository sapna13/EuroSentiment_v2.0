{"text":"Ok... But not 'Excellente' My boyfriend and I just got back from spending a week at the Excellence. We booked through Thomas Cook.As you have probably read from the other reviews, the road to the hotel is bad. It's quite bumpy and the driving skills over there are appalling, but because we were in an air conditioned coach, it didn't really bother me that much.The arrival at the hotel was ok - i was expecting a bit more after the reviews some people had written on here - my boyfriend had a cold class of sparkling wine, but when I asked for a non-alcoholic drink because i'm 8 weeks pregnant I got the dirtiest look ever and didn't receive a drink!!The first room they put us in was very nice, but there was no handle on the toilet and literally no water in the cistern - this I did not expect from the resort! There was also extreme condensation on the windows and the room smelt of mould. We rang Hector on the front desk and he assured us that we would be moved to a different room within half an hour. We waited for about an hour beofre ringing again and finally got moved to another room in the same building. Even then, we had to call out the maintenance guy to fix our bath and tv... We had room service for our first dinner and I hardly even touched it - the burger was almost raw. Over the next few days the service we received from the hotel definitely improved although we encountered more problems because of Thomas Cook. The emergency number they had given to the hotel was incorrect and so we left a voicemail on a random number expecting them to get back to us within the hour as they had promised, ofcourse they never did. If you book through Thomas Cook or any other UK travel agent, I wouldn't recommend going on any of the excursions they offer - we went on three and thought they were all over-priced and not worth spending a day out of the well kept beach and resort.. We went on the Reef Explorer which was the best, Isla Catalina which was a complete waste of our time and the Bavaro Splash which we're waiting for a refund on from Thomas Cook. Unless you are a James Bond wannabe, I don't recommend this trip at all!!The Food:I expected better from the restaurants if I'm honest. I didn't think the food was up to the standard of the hotel, but everyone is different.Overall, I probably won't be recommending this resort or be returning to the Dominican Republic.
