{"text":"Good hotel if you're looking for a quiet holiday. We were introduced to this hotel by a travel agent who gave rave reviews. A quick check with Tripadvisor confirmed his opinions of the place. The hotel's rates is very affordable for its standards, and offers decent amenities comparable to the best hotels which Bali has to offer.The hotel is situated in a convenient location, near the airport and within 30 minutes of Kuta. Most of the local drivers are familiar with the hotel which is a bonus especially when arranging transport to and from spas, restaurants and other destinations.However, if you're looking to travel to the Kuta and Ubud area often, note that the daily taxi rides will probably burn a substantial hole in your pocket after a while. But if you're looking for a quiet holiday away from the crowds, then this hotel is great with its private beach facility.The hotel staff, like most Balinese people, were very polite and generous with their smiles. Most requests were swiftly attended to, even at late hours. Check-out timing is pretty flexible even if you arrange for it last-minute, as in our case.On the negative side, some of the hotel's facilities are rather old. The safe deposit box in our room could not be used and the wiring of the lights was faulty, flickering once in a while. Also, be prepared to have to travel a fair bit for meals if you're not very keen on consuming the hotel's food. Overall, it was nevertheless an enjoyable experience. ","annotations":[]}
