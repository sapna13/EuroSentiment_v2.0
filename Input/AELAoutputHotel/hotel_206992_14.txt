{"text":"Nice Hotel; Great Location My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Moderno for five days during the early part of October, 2007. We arrived in Madrid via train from Toledo, and took the metro to Puerta Del Sol, knowing that the hotel was nearby. We spotted the hotel immediately upon emerging from the Puerta Del Sol metro station, literally a mere stone's throw away. The helpful staff efficiently checked us in, and we were off on our adventures in Madrid. The location of Hotel Moderno is nearly perfect for both people who like to walk a lot, as my wife and I do, and for users of public transit. Plaza Mayor, for example, is only about a five-minute walk away. The street upon which Hotel Moderno is situated, Arenal, is a broad pedestrian walkway lined with interesting shops and restaurants.  In addition to seeing the sights and visiting the wonderful museums in Madrid, we were interested in learning more about, and purchasing, some Spanish olive oil to take home with us. Upon inquiry of the hotel staff regarding shops specializing in olive oil, we were, given not only the name of and directions to such a shop, but also a short course in Spanish olive oil, including history, geographic origins, and taste characteristics of classic varities such as picual, hojiblanca, and arbequina, including a sample tasting! The lobby of the hotel is relatively small, but very welcoming. Our room was small, but comfortable, with a roomy outdoor deck overlooking the pedestrian avenue,Arenal.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Madrid at the Hotel Moderno, and would certainly recommend it to others.
