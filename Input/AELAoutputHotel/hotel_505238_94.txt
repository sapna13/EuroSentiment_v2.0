{"text":"OK When you first walk into the Barcelona Princess your initial thoughts are all positive. It looks stylish and has a nice ambience. It feels like a good 4* business hotel. After 90 min wait to check in because of √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√≥omputer problems√à√\u2020\u2022?your enthusiasm wanes but the free drink helps the time pass by. On walking into the room I was initially impressed until I realised that it was a twin room rather than the ordered king size bed. After another wait and battle with the receptionist I get moved to a better room but still without a king size bed she promised. Apparently the hotel is full and I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ fancy queuing another 30 mins to try and change rooms again!My new room has a balcony which is rendered useless because it has no table and chairs and over looked by the whole hotel! I have a proper bath with shower, but the cheap shower fixing has broken in a previous life and has been super glued together. Every time I turn the shower off the shower head falls off and either hits my toes or head! The sink is also badly designed√à√\u2020\u2022? It has no plug! Also no soap dishes√à√\u2020\u2022?when you turn the tap for hot you get cold etc. The only saving grace is the excellent blackout blinds. Made me late on one occasion!Lifts√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√∂?ifts√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√∂?ifts! Lack of them! This hotel has 3 lifts for 26 floors. It needs at least 6. At peak times you can end up waiting 10 mins for a lift! RidiculousOnce you start seeing the cracks in this hotel they just keep on coming. It will look very tired in another 2 years time.
