{"text":"Bloody Awful - not worth the stress! What a nightmare.Noisy rooms; the walls seem to be made of paper - you can literally hear EVERYTHING in the adjacent rooms and down the corridors; The staff are unfriendly, unhelpful and have MEGA attitude; and in general, Travelodge is a complete rip off for what you get; We stayed our last couple of nights in the Amora for EXACTLY the same price - the Amora is pure, 5*, luxury... :)On arrival at Travelodge, the front desk 'took a copy' of our credit card incase we incurred additional expenses - fine, this is a standard procedure. What they didn't tell us, is they actually withdrew $500 from our account. Front desk said numerous times they'd sorted it out, and then after 5 days when the money still wasn't back in our account, they told us to go to our bank and sort it out ourselves.... Oh-kaaaaay.... Hello? We're on holiday? Our bank is in another country.... Anyway - your own bank can't refund money that someone else has taken?!!? They didn't refund the money until a week AFTER we'd arrived home, and Westpac in Sydney (we went in there to ask for advice as Travelodge wouldn't offer any!) told us they've had this happen numerous times - Travelodge say they're taking an imprint of your card, but actually hold back the funds from your account, and then refuse to tell their own bank to refund it - you have to wait 10 working days for it to be automatically go back into your account.Just don't do it - it's not worth the price, stress or hassle!
