{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague! This is the third time I've stayed here, spending the night to catch a 'plane early the next morning. Three times and they're out.(1) There are two Steigenberger Airport Hotels. The busses that take you to them are staffed by nice guys who have no idea which hotel you are going to. I had no idea there were two hotels with the same name. I found out as I went about 15 miles away to a very nice country hotel, not mine. 30 euros later I was at the correct hotel. No one would accept responsibility for the mix-up. No one would reimburse me for the taxi ride. Everyone agreed that it was confusing that there were two hotels with the same name, but I was told you should know where you are going. I tried repeatedly with the Manager to express my frustration -- no one would have known. I was told by a waitress that this happens quite often. The manager was rude and frankly insulting, insinuating that I was stupid.(2) I was assigned a room but when I got to my floor it did not exist. I went back downstairs and the receptionists (who had witnessed my conversation with the Manager) were giggling. They hadn't told me I had to go to a different elevator bank. I asked why and was told you didn't ask. They stood there and watched me go up the WRONG elevator.(3) I was starving but the lobby restaurant was packed and couldn't serve me right away. I went to the other hotel restaurant because it had a buffet line. BIG MISTAKE. The food was the worst I have ever had in my life. Worse than the worse institutional food I've seen. I ate what I could and consumed a lot of bread. The meats were disgusting, the vegetables were soft and watery, the fish tasted off and the cold salads were not cold. On top of this a bottle of water cost 8 euros.(4) I asked for 7.30 wakeup call. I awoke at 7.40. I called downstairs, thinking my watch was off. They insisted I did not ask for a wakeup call. Of course I did. I took a shower and at 8.00 the phone rang, my wake-up call.(5) Checking out I asked for the United Airlines terminal. I was directed to one of two busses. I asked the receptionist twice about it and she insisted I know what I am talking about. I asked the driver but he did not speak one word of English. No one on the bus had a clue. We went to the WRONG terminal. I had to find a shuttle bus and take it to the other terminal, a far distance. Fortunately I had enough time.This hotel has a GREAT location but frankly the staff is so incompetent and rude that I'll not again stay here. A pity for them. I control where my staff (20 people) stays in FRA, and I can tell you it will never be at Steigenberger Airport Hotel again. EVER. AVOID THE PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE.
