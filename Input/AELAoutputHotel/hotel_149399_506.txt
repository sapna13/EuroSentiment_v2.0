{"text":"Our 5th stay at Melia We went to Melia for the 5th time on Dec. 7th and were there for 10 days. I guess I don't have to tell you that we love this beautiful resort. We went, for the first time, when we celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary, and we've been going every Dec. since then. We've taking our children, four of them, although not at the same time because of their school schedule, and they all love it. Two of them have been going for the last three years during easter vacation and have made many friends. They are looking forward to go this easter and have made reservations already. The employees are the best... We love Robert and Rosemary at the Turey Buffet and also Emilio at the bar there. Magda, the waitress at the bar by the Fun Pub,,,,we love you....and of course Maria at the bar by the Casino...she is going to marry a fellow from Chicago when????? Also, although we don't have small children, we got very close to Ruth from the Kids Club, a very responsible young lady whom we have adopted as our godchild.You have to meet , Jerry , the cook from the Japanese Restaurant, some personality....(our favorite restaurant)This last time we took my mom, who turned 85 years old there and she loved it. The beautiful gardens, the walk from our room, on building 35, to the front lobby, she refused to take the train...The pools are unbelievable, well kept and organized. About the people harassing you to purchase a time share, just say you are not interested and they will not bother you again. If you encounter a problem with the room or with anything else, just call the front desk and they will send you help...probably not as fast as you would expect it but don't get upset, you're on vacation....The beach is gorgeous....seaweed?? it's cleaned every morning... Well, I could go on and on with a lot more but in short I just want to recommend this resort to everyone that is looking to spend some time in heaven.....
