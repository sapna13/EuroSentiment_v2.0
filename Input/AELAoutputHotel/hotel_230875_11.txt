{"text":"Fantastic location in the heart of Amsterdam I visited the Radisson SAS on my own to attend a course in September.Having not been to Amsterdam before, I didnt know what to expect, but the hotel is located really centrally and the main tourist areas are just around the corner.The hotels rates in my opinion are expensive for the quality of the hotel - it is perfectly pleasant but nothing special - I suppose it is the location that you pay for.The hotel is oddly split accross both sides of the street, so if you are staying in the side opposite to the main section, then you do have to go up and down in order to go under the street and then back up in the lift to the rooms.The rooms were pleasant and I was pleased to see travelling on my own that you could get BBC1 etc on the television. I had breakfast and lunch in the main restaurant and it was very pleasant..The hotel has a small gym, which was pretty well equipped and well kept for a hotel gym, there were 3 cardio machines, free weights and about 5 weight machines - and unusually for hotels with small gyms it was all in good working order.I am thinking of going back to Amsterdam for a leisure trip, the only thing that would put me off about this hotel is the price in comparison for what you get -it was 239 euros a night for a single room.
