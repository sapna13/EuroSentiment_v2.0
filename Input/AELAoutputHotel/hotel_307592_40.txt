{"text":"Amazing Amankila Our stay at Amankila was nothing short of superb. This has to be one of the best resorts in the world, and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not hard to see why.On arrival in Bali, we were whisked away from Denpasar Airport by our driver in a stylish jeep complete with cold drinks, huge white pillows and a personal ipod. We enjoyed the trip through the quaint little villages but when we arrived at Amankila we were awestruck! Shortly after we checked in, we lay by the three-tiered swimming pool, ordered lunch, and not long after that, an Amankila dacquiri √à√\u2020\u2022?a taste sensation that I can not seem to recreate quite the same way at home! Full capacity at Amankila is modest at about 45, meaning most days we felt like the only people at the resort! On days we felt like a break from lazing about, swimming and reading (yes that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ possible) there were plenty of fun activities on offer. We loved the trek to Abian Canang -our guide was really friendly and informative- but be prepared for a serious workout √à√\u2020\u2022?those hills are steep! The scuba diving is great, and caters for first timers, and a real highlight for me were the daily outdoor yoga sessions, done late in the afternoon while soaking in the breathtaking views of the ocean. Another Amankila highlight is the food √à√\u2020\u2022?it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ just sensational. The gourmet pizza at the beach club was devine, along with the private dinner on the beach √à√\u2020\u2022?complete with your own chef, who created the menu to suit our tastes, and waiters √à√\u2020\u2022?it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ one of the most romantic things I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe ever done. We felt so well looked after the whole time we were there and appreciated the extreme care taken to ensure everything was perfect. It was all the subtle Amankila touches that really make the resort what it is, such as having our shoes cleaned after the trek. The staff are so friendly and efficient, and Tracy the general manager was truly lovely. We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l definitely be back!
