{"text":"Pleased with the Sheraton Centro Historico I stayed 4 nights at the Sheraton Centro Historico and was pleased with this hotel overall.I got a very good rate from the Sheraton website. Upon check in, i received a high floor room, as requested, with a view towards the zocalo, which is about a 10-15 minute walk away.The best thing about this hotel for me were the restaurants. El Cardinal, just off the lobby, is packed from the moment it opens to the moment it closes (unfortunately, i'm not sure if it's open for dinner, but it's definitely good for breakfast and lunch at any time), and with reason: the food (Mexican) and service are amazing. Try the tamarind margaritas if you can. There's always at least a 30 minute wait but somebody told me afterwards that if you are a hotel guest, you might get priority on the waitlist. Even if you're not staying at this hotel, however, i highly recommend El Cardinal.There is also a restaurant on the 6th floor, with an adjoining rooftop terrace. It's a lovely serene environment with food that they call comfort and I would call mostly Italian. Again, great, fresh food, and a nice oasis in the city (open from 7am until 5pm). Both restaurants are open continuously, so you can have breakfast at 10:30am, or lunch at 3pm, if you like. This worked great with my erratic schedule.The rooms were fine, with the usual, comfortable Sheraton beds  Neutrogena amenities, but nothing to write home about. The wireless internet access was very weak, so i did end up getting a cable, which worked well. Charges for the internet were $10 per day. As for the complaints by other travelers, i found both pen and paper next to the telephones, a bathmat next to the bath, my mirror didn't steam up and the TV, while not the latest in technology, worked just fine. In addition, the service, from the front desk to the bellmen to the housekeeping staff, was professional and friendly.Unfortunately, the location --near the historic center -- was not the best for me, as I was here for work and ended up spending nearly all my time in Polanco, so I should have stayed there. Polanco is about a half hour's taxi ride away in traffic (and there is always traffic), so this became pretty inconvenient.
