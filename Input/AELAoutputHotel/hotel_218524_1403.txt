{"text":"Totally Amazing Secrets I am sat at home now after 14 excellent days at secrets excellence, I took my wife for our first surprise wedding anniversary, on arriving at the hotel we upgraded from a garden view room to the excellent club into a sea view honeymoon suite. Before going I was getting very worried at the reports I was reading from people across the water and I was so close to changing to go to Mexico as I wanted to make sure it would be great for us on our anniversary, but the date we wanted our travel agent could not accomadate us, and now I am so pleased that they could not. This is a third world country, you have to remember this, the staff from the cleaners to the management were always smiling and saying its my pleasure, and I did not feel this was false, they said it as they ment it. I cant remember individual names as we met so many but they were all wonderful. The food and drinks were great, we always found something to eat that we liked in all the resturants, and the drinks that some people say are watered down, well ours wernt, in fact they tasted like a lot of whiskey with a tot of coke. The whole place from rooms to the ground were kept very clean infact if you get up early about 6am you will see the cleaners hoovering out the swimming pool, towles were made into many diffents animals which my wife really enjoved, in the rooms, on upgrading to the excellence club, we found this to be more personal service, and santo and won were great waiters, internet access is free on two computers provided, but some people would stay on for an hour or more at a time when other people were waiting to use them, even thought there is a sign to say if people are waiting it would be curtisory, to let people on after about 10 mins, but we were there for an holiday not just to us an internet. We did not watch many shows in the evening but we did enjoy and would recomend the michael jackson show and the beach party. OVERALL THE HOTEL IS A MUST FOR ROMANTICS AND IS ADULTS ONLY IT WAS EXCELLENTE!!!
