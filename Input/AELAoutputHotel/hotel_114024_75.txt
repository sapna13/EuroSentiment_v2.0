{"text":"Kind and Gracious Staff My family stayed at the Royal Hawaiian during a very difficult time - my mother was on her deathbed and doing home hospice and we couldn't stay at my parents house (who live in Honolulu). Needless to say we weren't into having a wild time in Waikiki. We wanted to be some place quiet and homey - a retreat from days spent saying good-bye to my mom - and therefore I immediately thought of the Royal Hawaiian. It had been my mother's favorite hotel in Honolulu since we moved there in the late 1960s. Only problem was that they were fully booked for a convention! However they managed to accomadate us - a miracle really - and gave us a very large suite in the old building. It was really quiet despite the convention. The hotel staff were kind beyond belief. At one point the front desk manager babysat my five year old daughter while I had to take care of an urgent matter. We stayed for over two weeks - so we really got to know the hotel and staff. It really felt like home during one of the worst times in my life. It's true the rooms need upgrading - but if you want quiet and charm in Waikiki this is it - everything else is boring. The beach is fantastic. It's not a Ritz or Four Seasons - so please don't expect that - but it is good for what it is - an old world hotel. And you're in the center of everything. I will always remember the staff's kindness. Mahalo.
