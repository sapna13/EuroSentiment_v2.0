{"text":"Best Vacation Ive ever had I have traveled the world, i have seen many things. It is important to say that this truly was the best experience i have ever had. iberostar bavaro punta cana was the most memorable vacation I have ever been on. There is so much to do, and the staff was icredible. They welcome you with such a warm greeting and you truly feel like you are at home. The staff at Disney World at first are kind to you, and then slack off as if they dont want to be there. At Iberostar Bavaro it is their home. They are so kind, and not to mention very talented. Some of the best dancers i have ever seen are right there at that fantastic resort. I have never been to a beach party at one in the morning, or scuba dived in a pool until this trip. Every thing was incredible. I was a fan of the dancing that took place wherever you walked. I truly appreciated the dedicated men and women who took the extra minutes to keep up the resort grounds ultimately making it the nicest and cleanest. I strongly recommend this resort. It is child friendly, and suitable for all ages with so much to do if you want to be active, or a beach if you just want to relax and enjoy the famous Coco Loco. Oh yea, and dont forget about the all inclusive plan that comes with the hotel, i guess i forgot to mention that little detail. This makes the resort 100 times better. It is a relief to not carry a cell phone around, or money, and not know the time. It is without a doubt the best vacation to take your family, or a loved one on. Words cant even explain my stay at the Iberostar Bavaro. ","annotations":[]}
