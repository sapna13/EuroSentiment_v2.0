{"text":"Good room nice staff closer to downtown is located in Tukwila My family stayed here after walking away from Howard Johnsons down the street. This hotel sits one block back from Hwy 99. There is a coffee shop next to the hotel that the local taxi drivers hang out at. Some other reviers have regarded as scary. They are devout Muslims. The closed down card room that is on the other side of the street and af ew blocks down will soon be turned in to a mosque. Just felt the need to clear up how  Scary some feel the area is. This section of Tukwila is under going a major facelift.  The staff at the Ramada were very nice and offered late check out to my family after hearing about our trouble at the nasty motel down the street. The management was changed in 2007. I felt this was a good place to stay for a night or to be close to downtown with out the high price of the downtown rooms. In downtown Seattle you can expect to pay over $ 180.00 a night off season. When we arrived at 11: 30 PM after a long journey on the train and canceling a prior reservation at another nasty motel. They understood and let us look at the room prior to checking in. My family enjoyed the stay had a nice clean room with a comfy bed. They were on the 2nd floor and had no noise issues. The lobby had a nice clean smell. Unlike the other 2 hotels or motels we walked in to. Got a good deal on the price was $20.00 less than the other ickey hotels. So don't let the other rating scare you. I think things have changed for the better at this location. They are about five to ten minutes from the airport but closer to downtown, ","annotations":[{"endOffset":14,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":10},{"endOffset":14,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":10},{"endOffset":202,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":196},{"endOffset":202,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":196},{"endOffset":1188,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1184},{"endOffset":1290,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1286}]}
