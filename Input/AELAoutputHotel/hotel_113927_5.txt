{"text":"Great Budget Hotel! At only $39.99 a night for a cozy queen my girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay... for the price that is. It was a smaller than average room however we had a booked weekend and didnt spend more than 1-2 hours (aside from sleep and showering) in the room on any given day. Being from the city myself I did not notice the Lombard Street traffic noise mentioned by others. The hotel has convenient access to many bus lines on Lombard and Van Ness streets and the times we needed a cab we had to do no more than walk outside and wait a mere minute or two to flag one down. We were completely content with the room... clean, maintained and a very comfy queen bed.The TV worked fine and a staff was very helpful in all aspects including directions, places to eat, providing and iron and board and also which bus\/bart lines would be most convenient to our required destinations. Best of all, it is within walking distance of the Presidio and Fishermans Wharf - which we took advantage of a few times. Word of advice, use the Fort Mason park walkway which runs along the bay for some great sceanic views and glimpses of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge on your way to the Wharf instead of walking along the streets. For Mason is only 2-3 blocks north of the hotel. If there was one complaint it was the shower head is placed too low and is unadjustable. Not a problem for my girlfriend but definitely for anyone above the height of 5'6 as I am. However, I would definitely stay here again should I be in need of a budget hotel. ","annotations":[]}
