{"text":"Did exactly what it said on the tin As you may have already gathered from the multitude of glowing write ups on this hotel it is absolutely tremendous. The whole experience from initial booking to final check out was excellent. As many people have already said we found the best rate on the hotels own web site, there was also the opportunity to book breakfasts at a significant discount, paying as you dine can be pricey. There is also the opportunity to Skype the hotel through their web site to sort out and queries\/problems you may have. Just prior to arrival we received a welcome email informing us of what offers were available, which was nice touch. Our family room was fantastic on the 32nd floor. Great views of Hong Kong and the bed was indeed blissful. The room was excellently equipped and the mini bar had a good variety of drinks at a reasonable price. The pool area is superbly located on the roof of the hotel with excellent panoramic views of Hong Kong. The Chuen Spa provides virtually every type of massage and treatment available and is well worth a visit. Many people have commented on the surrounding area of the hotel being a bit dodgy, but I think that it what makes the Langham even more special. Busy street markets just round the corner, the Langham Place mall accessible via a covered walkway, much cheaper breakfast alternatives exist in here as well, and the MTR are only 5 mins from your room. My family and I never felt threatened once whilst in Hong Kong. Perhaps the Langham√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ biggest plus point are it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ superb staff. Everyone of them has obviously been well trained, as from the door staff to the management I came into contact with, they were polite, helpful and extremely proud to be of service. The breakfast buffet selection was excellent with all the food of a high standard. Complementary internet is available on the 6th and via the TV in your room for a daily tariff. I would strongly recommend that anyone visiting Hong Kong try the Langham Place Hotel as it is fantastic.
