{"text":"Wonderful stay at a beautiful hotel! I went to China and Japan with my boyfriend on business and he made all the travel arrangements - which is unusal for me because I'm somewhat of a research freak. BUT, this time I left it up to him (and his company) to choose where we stayed and I just went with it.On the last leg (and night) of a 10-day trip, we landed at the Westin Tokyo and we were pleasantly surprised!Check-in was very fast and my boyfriend upgraded us to a Club\/Executive room which included free breakfast and happy hour for an extra $700 yen\/night - totally worth it! I think we paid $350 total for our night stay.Back to the Club floor later, but let's start with the lobby! Really, really beautiful!! Lots of highly polished black marble, soaring ceilings and just very pleasing to the eye. There is a cafe\/bakery, a formal restaurant and a restaurant\/bar right off the loby - and that's all the farther we got past the room and the Club floor - so I can't speak of the other amenities in the hotel.Our room was 1608 and we had an amazing view of the city and the Tokyo Tower! It was cool during the day, but stunning at night! We got some great photos!! I only read a few reviews, but the one mentioning no view must have stayed on a very low floor or on another side of the building I never saw. BEAUTIFUL!The room was very large and had the super comfortable Heavenly Bed (king), a sofa and table, desk and another table and chair....very roomy. The bedding is white, crisp and soft - the pillows comfy. And the bathroom was gorgeous! Big bath tub, separate shower and a large vanity. Very, very nice!The bath products smelled great, there were lots of towels and they provided us with a travelers kit with a brush, toothbrush, q-tips, etc which you could take with you if you chose. Nice touch.We took advantage of the Club\/Executive floor and headed up there after we checked in. There was a nice assortment of hard alcohol, beer, 2 red and 2 white wines, as well as juices and sodas. They also served really nice appetizers including salmon, chicken, duck and various other snacks. We sat and enjoyed several glasses of wine and the food, along with the beautiful view!!In the morning the breakfast consisted of the usual - eggs, sausage, fruits, pastries, cereals, juices, etc and they were quick to replenish plates.We did eat at the restaurant in the bar area - Brian got a chicken sandwich and I got the risotto (we had maxed out on Chinese and sushi!) and we thought it was fine. Not fabulous, but good. The prices were moderately high, but it's Tokyo and you're in a hotel!!! We expected to pay $15 for a chicken sandwich! There are several places nearby that we passed in the cab that looked very cute if you don't want to pay hotel prices.We felt the hotel was lovely and we were very happy with our stay. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this Westin to all of my friends.The only thing I'd say is that if you are looking for action, this really isn't the location for you. My boyfriend though he booked a hotel in Ginza, but this was miles away and would take 20+ minutes by cab to get there. We did take a cab to the Roppongi District and that main street was BUSY!!! Lots of clubs and restaurants to choose from. I think if we were to go again on our own (sans business,) we'd choose to stay in a more convenient area. If you are looking for a beautiful hotel in a quiet and upscale part of Tokyo, this is the place for you!Lisampls ","annotations":[{"endOffset":644,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":640},{"endOffset":644,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":640},{"endOffset":644,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":640},{"endOffset":644,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":640},{"endOffset":644,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":640},{"endOffset":644,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":640},{"endOffset":644,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":640},{"endOffset":953,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":949},{"endOffset":953,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":949},{"endOffset":1492,"mention":"crisp","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Potato_chip"],"startOffset":1487},{"endOffset":1807,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1803},{"endOffset":1917,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1913},{"endOffset":1969,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1964},{"endOffset":1969,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1964},{"endOffset":1969,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1964},{"endOffset":1969,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1964},{"endOffset":2034,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2030},{"endOffset":2277,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":2269},{"endOffset":2415,"mention":"chicken sandwich","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chicken_sandwich"],"startOffset":2399},{"endOffset":2466,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":2459},{"endOffset":2466,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":2459},{"endOffset":2466,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":2459},{"endOffset":2649,"mention":"chicken sandwich","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chicken_sandwich"],"startOffset":2633}]}
