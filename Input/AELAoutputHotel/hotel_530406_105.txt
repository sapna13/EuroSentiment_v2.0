{"text":"Excelllent in 2006 but definately gone doown hill in 2007 We stayed here in May 2006 and had a wonderful time and as we were both in need of a nice quiet break again in September 2007, we booked to come back as we knew (thought we knew) what we were coming to as the last thing we wanted was any stress by turning up to a hotel with problems. However this was not the case.We travelled with First Choice again. Great flight, nice roomy seats etc. Definateley the best travel airline we have travelled on for long haul.Arrived at the hotel all great UNTIL WE WENT TO GET A NICE SHOWER BEFORE DINNER. No hot water pressure, just a dribble coming out of the tap, and then sometimes nothing. Room otherwise fine so no complaints, thought all would be OK the next day.Went to the tour reps meeting and listed the water as a problem and also saw someone getting compensated for not hot water for 10 days and someone else moving hotel room in the hope of some hot water. Checked with the rep and found out that there was a problem but should be fixed soon. (We found out from Guest Services when we were checking out that the whole resort is affected and this was due to damamged pipes they thought but they cannot find the problem (as at 8th Oct). Everything else at the hotel was as before, food excellent, rooms nice (they were decorating some villa blocks while we were there but this did not affect us), and everything else seemd fine except for the beach restaurant not opening at night. I was a bit disappointed that the free catermeran was now only available for half hour a day whereas last year it was an hour but otherwise fine. No problems with the swimming pools and except for the problems I have written about all OK.2 days later we went to the lobby area and Mikes Coffee Bar (highly recommended) but were greeted by pneumatic drills. They were digging up half of the floor of the lobby knocking out the lobby bar and making the remainder of the lobby unusable due to all the dust  noise. (Not related to the Hot water problem thiugh we were told.) Perhaps no big deal except that the weather was rainy for a lot of the week and this meant that the only place you could sit was in your room or Mikes Coffee Bar. I was going stir crazy!!!!After 6 days, although the drilling work had stopped we still had no hot water so we requested to be moved for our second week by First Choice. The rep Jennifer Cole had been excellent thoughout and she arranged this for us straight away without quiibling. The hotel were great about it even paying the cost of the cab fare to the Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana and the extra money we had to pay to move to this slighly upgraded hotel. They seemed embarrassed by it all and it must be said they appeared to move anyone who wanted to move without quibbling.Would I recommend going there? Definately YES .......BUT make sure before you go from your travel company that the hot water problem is fixed. Overall the hotel is great but NOT WITHOUTANY HOT WATER TO WASH OFF THE SUN CREAMS!!!
