{"text":"No Wonder it's # 1 As the title states, Hotel Luxembourg Parc rates #1 on tripadvisor and after visiting the property it is no suprise! After a whirlwind business trip to London and Paris inspecting nearly 25 hotels, Luxembourg Parc was the last on the trip. As my coworkers and I all agreed, the best was saved for last!Where to start...location, location, location! Located in the Latin Quarter\/St Germain des Pres area on the left bank - in my opinion, where one can truly EXPERIENCE Paris. This is where one finds the local Parisian markets, traditional Parisian boulangeries (bakeries) and numerous brasseries (a casual cafe also operating as a restaurant serving single dishes and other meals.) In addition to experiencing the real Paris, all the attractions of Central Paris including the Louvre, Notre Dame, Musee d Orsay, St Sulpice etc are within a casual stroll or short ride via the metro. There are 4 metro stations in the area so sightseeing opportunities are endless!Once you enter the reception area of the hotel you will begin to realize the impeccable service offered. The hotel is very traditional and Parisian in decor - classical and elegant. Dark wood tones and classical works of art enhance the romance one thinks of when they think of Paris. Its 23 Rooms are traditional yet elegant decorated in 3 themes - Louis XV, Louis XVI and Napoleon III. Rooms feature antique furnishings and pieces of classical art, marble bathrooms, Scandinavian goose down bedding, sattelite television and free wireless internet. Breakfast at the hotel includes a variety of pastries, meats, cheeses, fruits, yogurts etc.The Hotel Luxembourg Parc is best described as a retreat rather than a hotel. I would definately recommend this hotel to discerning clients as well as couples celebrating their honeymoon or anniversary.
