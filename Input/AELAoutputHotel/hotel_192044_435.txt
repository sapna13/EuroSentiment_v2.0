{"text":"A very nice hotel, great location A great place to stay and i would certainly choose the london bridge hotel for my next trip to london. The rooms (i stayed on two different occasions) were clean, the staff helpful and friendly, the continental breakfast was sufficient and they even had a nice fruit salad (made with fresh fruit, not the tinned kind), which was a real treat. The only suggestion i would have with regard to the rooms (and the reason why i am giving a four-star and not a five-star rating) is that they check the mattresses (i am specifically speaking of room 316). The bed had two mattresses and one, i guess the side preferred by most guests, was very noticeably worn out. I did not mind as i had the bed to myself and slept on the other side but it would not have been very nice if there were two people staying in the room and one of them would have had to sleep on the worn out mattress.But besides that, the london bridge hotel is great value for money (i paid about 70 GBP per night incl. continental breakfast, booked at Skoosh), the location is certainly second to none, the surrounding area is not a hotel hell as you would find in areas such as around earls court or paddington station and everything you need (shops, restaurants) is within easy walking distance.  Also, getting to the hotel from gatwick and city airport is a piece of cake. For those arriving from city airport, the best and stair-free way to the hotel is to use the borough high street exit (use the escalator exit to reach street level, the other exit would have you on the wrong side of the road), turn right when you leave the station and the second road to your right is london bridge street.
