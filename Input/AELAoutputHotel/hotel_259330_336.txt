{"text":"Nothing too special Ok so...Myself and my boyfriend went here about a year ago during spring break in March. Overall it was not TOO bad but somethings need some touching up. 1st when we had arrived we attempted to check and informed them that we had requested a King size bed and they had told us it was not a problem. We also had read other She spoke very little english and we wrote spanish notes to her everyday thanking her for cleaning the room. (HINT: Most people that work for the hotel are poor and appreciate any gratuity you give me. We brought gifts just little things from the dollar stores back home for ex.: Crayons, coloring books, hair accessories. Also we left $2.00 a day.) They are so appreciative, since we take so much for granted and most of them have nothing. Besides the room being a mess when we came we couldnt have asked to be any closer to the beach and the pool. You walked down the stairs and there was the beach. Beautiful beach and Pools (2). The drinks there be carefull....they can be deadly LOL. We learned that our 2nd day at the resort. Luiz who is the nicest man at the hotel works in the sports bar with the mini casino (just a few slot machines) he works during the day and smiles his whole shift. Such a wonderful man. Everytime we entered the bar he would great us with a great big smile and only spoke a few words of english (my boyfriend speaks a lil spanish). They talked about baseball since we are from Boston. On our 2nd day around1pm we decided to give him a lil visit and have a few drinks. We were drunk by 3pm and passed out by 4pm in our rooms. We didnt wake up til the next day with huuuuge hangovers what a mess. Anyway he knows most drinks and most of the bartenders there dont know any drinks except a few. Luiz knew many more. But all I can say is go see him he's an amazing man! =)The food ehhh.....wasnt too appealing. The buffet im not sure if im just not open minded to new things but I couldnt tell what half the stuff was. So just be cautious. Be careful in the morning during the omelete line. The line gets so long that they rush making the omeletes and a few times our omelete was not fully cooked and oozed raw egg. During the day we went to the snack bar right at the beach and got pizza and fries and if we didnt have that to eat we would have starved. We ate that everyday (not very healthy). 2 nights we were to the grill my boyfriend had Filet mignon and I had grilled chicken. It wasnt too bad. The filet was a little fatty but not too bad. I hate when I read that people bash resorts and im not trying to scare anyone away. If you are open minded to new things and not concerned on what you are eating them maybe it can work for you! All in all it wasnt too bad of a resort I would not go again tho only because we want to try Jamaica or Cancun this year. p.s. you can never leave the hotel unless you are going on an excursion. You will realize when you are on your way to the hotel and you see people with guns guarding apartment complexes.
