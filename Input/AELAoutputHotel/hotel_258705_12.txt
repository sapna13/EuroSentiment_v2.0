{"text":"Not Common at all... My wife and I just returned from a 3-night stay at the Commonwealth, and it was a great experience. As other reviewers have stated, the staff at this hotel are all extremely polite and helpful. The concierge was rarely at his station when we walked by, but the front desk staff were always available to answer any questions we had. When I inquired about a good local place to grab a quick breakfast on the run, I was a bit disappointed that the only place suggested by the front desk was the in-hotel Eastern Standard restaurant. Detecting that this wasn't going to be fast enough to meet our schedule, another guest piped in that there was a good bagel shop directly across the street. We also neglected to bring a USB cable with us to download pictured from our camera to our laptop we had brought with us. I had hoped the staff would be able to track one down that we could borrow, but alas they were unable, so we ended up running to the CVS up the road and purchasing a new memory card.One other complaint was the thin walls detectable from the bathrooms. I could clearly hear the bathroom being used either directly next door or above me while I was in the bathroom.One other thing to be aware of is the cost of parking at this hotel. Each night will set you back $39!Aside from those few hiccups, our stay was outstanding. The room was gorgeous. We had drinks at the Foundation lounge at the bottom of the hotel, and that was a pleasant experience as well. The access to the Kenmore station came in very handy for getting around town.I would certainly recommend this hotel to others and though there are other hotels I'd like to try in Boston, I would return to the Commonwealth in the future.
