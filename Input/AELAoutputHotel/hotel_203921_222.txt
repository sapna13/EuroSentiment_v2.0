{"text":"A jewel in Florence...what a find!! We visited Rome, Sorrento, Tuscany, Florence and Venice for two and a half weeks in early July 2006. We stayed at the Hotel David during our Florence stay and were thoroughly pleased and impressed with this hotel.The staff was second to none (they recommended restaurants that were delightful), booked us reservations at the Uffizi and Accademia in advance of our arrival (the lines would have been awful but we pretty much just walked into these museums), advised us on transport to the central historic area (it's walkable but the bus is right outside the door of the hotel and so easy to take), and made us feel welcome in so many other ways. Again, the entire staff (we interacted with at least three front desk people during our stay) was this helpful and pleaseant -- how nice!The hotel itself had very nice rooms that were clean, roomy, air conditioned and had nice bathroom. The rooms were impeccably clean and the chambermaid kept it that way every day. Not overly fancy, but just fine for us.In the early evening the hotel puts out various canapes and other finger-foods, wines and juices so the guests can chat and relax in the wonderul lobby area. This area was so pleasant, with all types of travel books, a chess board, sofas and chairs and an outside oasis to unwind from a busy day of sightseeing. They also grant all guests access (at no cost) to a lobby computer so you can check your e-mail, etc.)Breakfast was very nice -- cappucino, espresso, american coffee, hot chocolate, yogurts, cheeses, meats, pastries, fresh fruits, etc. We were at the hotel for three days and had enough variety to keep it new each day. The location in my mind was a nice benefit. Close enough to the central historical district to easily catch a bus in (or walk) but far enough to be away from the hoards of tourists, etc. It was a welcome respite to relax at the hotel after a hot and busy day of doing tourist stuff in Florence.This hotel is a find! It has all of the charm, service and comfort that we needed or desired. BTW, my wife accidently left a piece of jewelry on the vanity in the bathroom upon our departure. When we called from Venice they located the jewelry and mailed it to us back in the U.S. (without even asking for reimbursement!!) . It arrived within a week of us returning home. That's special!!So, if you're looking for a really nice place to stay while enjoying Florence then look no further!! We know where we'll be staying next time we visit Florence and where we'll suggest our friends stay when they visit -- Hotel David!!!
