{"text":"Beautiful Catalonia One word can describe my trip to Catalonia Bavaro, Amazing! I Stayed at Catalonia from May 23rd until May 30th. I had done some research before going on vacation and I wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really sure if Catalonia would be a suitable place for two 20 year old friends. I was defiantly wrong. We had an amazing time, met amazing people and loved every second of it. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l break down some things about what to expect if you decide to go there. I am going to start off by saying that if you are going here expecting a *5* star hotel at American or Canadian standards you will be disappointed. You just have to remember that the Dominican is a poor country and their standards cannot be compared to ours. Food √à√\u2020\u2022?I personally enjoyed the food, I know some people didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner are an open buffet with the exception of the 4 A La Carte Restaurants: Italian, Steak House, Mexican, and Japanese. The food at the restaurants was really good; it had surpassed all my expectations. I absolutely recommend the pizza by the pool it is AMAZING! I was told that drinks are watered down which absolutely not true, if you feel that there is not enough liquor in your drink let the bartender know and they will be more than happy to add more liquor. Entertainment √à√\u2020\u2022?The Disco was always empty don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go in hopes of finding an amazing party in there. We had a great time despite the fact that there were only about 10 people a night. The nightly shows were always fun to watch something different every night which made it fun. The Entertainment Team literally works 24 hours a day; they will do anything and everything to ensure that you are having a good time. They have games setup at different times of the day by the pool and the beach and dancing at night after the shows. Room √à√\u2020\u2022?Our room was in building 4 which was right across the beach and beside the pool. The room had two beds and was fairly big; we did not spend much time in there. I know some people had problems with their rooms and they were able to move into new rooms. As many people may know the Dominican is a tropical country therefore there are many insects such as cockroaches. In the event that you have a cockroach in your room a staff member will come with a can of raid and kill it. The rooms are always kept clean by the maids and the fridge is always filled with drinks. Beach \/ Pool √à√\u2020\u2022?The Beach is beautiful, the pool is a great place to lounge around and have a drink at the swim bar. Staff √à√\u2020\u2022?I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think our trip would have been as amazing as it was without the Staff at Catalonia. From what I saw, most of the staff consists of teens and they work long days. You will see the same person that served you for breakfast at 8 am serving you at dinner at 9 pm. They are really friend, always smiling and saying √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¥la√à√\u2020\u2022? They work really hard and I bet most of make more in a day than they make a month. Tipping them is always nice especially the maid that cleans the room. All in all I loved this place I recommend it to anyone and everyone I would absolutely return in a heart beat without a second though.
