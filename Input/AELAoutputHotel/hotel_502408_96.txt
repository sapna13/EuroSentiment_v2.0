{"text":"Great base to explore New York We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of Feb\/start of March. We based our choice on the great reviews on Tripadvisor, and were not diappointed.The staff at the hotel were always friendly and accommodating, and extremely polite. When returning after being out for the day the doorman would be sure to say 'Welcome home'. This was our first trip to New York, but everyone tells us about the tiny room sizes - this was an exception. Our room was actually pretty huge - although the kitchen was tiny, but adequate. Well decorated, lacking for nothing. Air con \/ heating was quick to adapt to new settings. Only complaint would be the noise. Again, not having stayed in NY before, maybe this is the same everywhere, but we were shocked by the incessant noise from the traffic on the street below - we were on the 5th floor. The cabs honking drove us mad as it happened every few seconds, and started early and finished very late. Location-wise we thought it was great. Out of the very touristy areas around Times Square etc, but still within easy reach of everything. We mostly walked everywhere and found it no trouble - although on the 2 occasions we used the metro we found the nearest stop was only 3-4 mins walk away.Breakfast was good - although a greater selection would have made it better, but then I always think that in US hotels. The club room was great, mostly there was only ourselves and perhaps one other set of people there. You could sit and relax, read a paper, have a free coffee\/snack. They actually say that you can return the to club room on any future trip to NY, even if you don't stay at their hotel. I think this is a bit of a gimmick as they know most people won't take them up on the offer, but I will certainly bear it in mind if I return to New York.The lifts were reliable and quick - I have been to places before where you have to wait ages to get up\/down which is not fun if you are several floors up - but no such problems here.One thing lacking was wireless internet access. Not a huge problem, but it's pretty standard nowasdays and would have been nice to have. You could pay for wired-in access but it was quite steep per day so not worth it.Overall thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely return.
