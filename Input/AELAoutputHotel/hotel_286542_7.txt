{"text":"wonderful We stayed in a 2 bedroom from June 25-July 2 and loved the canyon villas. There is so much room and it was wonderful to have free wireless available. Every morning my husband and I walked over to the JWmarriott for coffee and danish at the Starbucks which opens very early for the golfers. It was a very pleasant walk - we did it about 7am. Even though the days were usually 112 degrees, it really didn't bother us. usually from 2-5 if we weren't in the pool, we either went to the movies at the huge shopping complex nearby or were in room there. we even enjoyed the 2 great hot tubs in all that heat. The bigger pool was cooler than I prefer, probably because of the waterfall, so we used the 'lap' pool that wasn't restricted to laps. I loved looking at mountains in the distance everywhere. One day we went swimming at the marriott as I was excited about the lazy river. our cards didn't work in the gate, but someone was there to let us in and told us the villa cards never work. we got tubes and went around about 5 times and then went back to villa. that very night we got a voice mail saying the next day the tubes would be $10\/day for a person! I was very glad we went the day we did. we didn't go back. I really think that is terrible. there were plenty of tubes and people used them when they wanted and then put them back. we had a nice pool at the villas so never went swimming again at the marriott. it was so easy to take our rental car and drive to the villas. the roads are all very easy. the shopping complex is so great- has so many restaurants. we ate there each evening. we also saw 2 movies there. we went to mini golf about 12 minutes away and one day went bowling right when it opened and got fantastic rate per game. we took the morning tour in the desert where we were able to shoot six shooters, potato gun and throw tomahawk. my 17 year old thought that was one of best highlights. we took the whole day detours trip to grand canyon. you go to sedona, see the red rocks, have 30minutes in a shopping area, then off to helicopter spot by grand canyon. all 12 of us in the van did it and it was amazing. little pricey but it was a highlight. then off to the south rim and saw the grand canyon from 3 different locations. breathtaking. on way back we stopped at navajo trading post. long day, but wonderful. we also went to heard museum one day which my husband and son found boring, but I enjoyed. we went to taliesin west one morning- get there when they open and definitely take their umbrella to walk around. it was too expensive for what they offered, but I did enjoy it. I really recommend the villas. the price was so much more reasonable that the hotel, we had so much space and the wireless internet was free.
