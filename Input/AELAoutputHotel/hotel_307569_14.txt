{"text":"Rustic luxury at Komaneka We stayed at the Komaneka for 4 days at the beginning of July. We have 2 children (15 and 8) so we booked a standard room for them and a luxurious pool villa for us (Its our money after all!). The hotel organised transfers for us from Denpasar. The young driver was fabulous. Bintang and cold towels arranged to de-stress us from the money grabbers at the airport (that's just the immigration guys). The drive to Ubud is pretty short but transport in Bali is very slow so be prepared for a longer than anticipated journey....everywhere.The hotel reception is beautiful with a water theme. We were given drinks on arrival by young, attentive staff. First impressions were excellent. It was dark when we arrived but the beautiful hotel grounds were apparent. The kids room opened on to a rice paddy and our pool villa opened on to a gorge with coconut palms and banana trees. The bathroom of our villa was ostensibly open air and had a pond surrounding our bath inhabited by Koi and a couple of toads. Quite fabulous! Add to this the grass roof of the villa and it was a unique feeling. To my mind there is no point traveling half way round the world to stay in a corporate, western hotel chain room. The house geckos completed the picture.Ubud is a working, vibrant town, so be prepared that no matter where you are there is noise. Cockerels, mopeds, cars, farm workers etc. A lie in in Ubud may not be possible if you are a light sleeper like me. Exit from the comparative tranquility of Komaneka and you hit the maelstrom of Jalang monkey forest! At one end the monkeys and the other the market. In between there are wonderful shops and a thousand taxi drivers looking to take you around Bali. The market is an assault on your senses and not to be missed, and a word of warning, never come between a monkey and its banana! They do bite and scratch and steal.We only breakfasted at Komaneka but this was very good. Remember, you are in the far east, so don't complain that the eggs benedict isn't up to standard! Go for local food. Tropical fruit , nasi goreng and Balinese kopi, all wondeful and accompanied by live Gamelan. I remember being dismayed by a couple of Americans who complained that the Balinese didn't know how to mix a bloody mary! Get a life!The staff were excellent at booking excursions and restaurants for us. I recommend treking up Mt Batur to see the sunrise and the Elephant safari. Casa Luna was a fabulous 'fusion' restaurant and Katut's Place offered a truly unique mix of Balinese food and cultural commentary.In the words of Dorothy 'this sure isn't Kansas'. Once you accept that, you'll appreciate the wonders of Komaneka and Ubud.
