{"text":"A+ for Paris' Dad You can look at this hotel in a couples of ways that can sway your star rating but here are a couple of observation I had when my husband and I traveled to the caribe hilton earlier this Feb.1. Your best bet for a relaxing vacation is always choosing the best room you can get. (remember this resort is one of the oldest in san juan...so new areas have been built some rooms upgraded and redesigned...you can have a low floor, high floor) I think the rooms can vary at caribe hilton this can sway your rating....our room was great with great view2. Your in san juan area if your looking just to stay on el caribe premisses that have a little built up laggon area, a number of pools, a shopping plaza with a starbucks, clothing, shoes....so if you really want to stay put you could....but most people I would believe want to venture ot to old san juan or condado area....to see the scene or possilbly to go to a casino....in the neighboring area of condado...most of those hotels have them...el condado, marriott...etc...you could actually walk there but the bridge that connects caribe hilton area with condado area is a little dark at night to cross...i would cab it3. food there is a mortons on premises....also hilton breakfast buffet...was ok......if you not a morning person ...you can just goto starbucks...but if you plan on eating breakfast everyday try to get breakfast included...could be pricey if you don't.4. the hotel staff were excellent and there advice ...right on the money....they told us to go to a place for seafood named aquaviva in old san juan...when we were about to go exploring...the place was yummy...cerviche great...so were the oysters rockafeller...we even got to see an equestrian street show (just happened to be going on the weekend we visited) hole thing was delightful...we stumbled on a place called ropa vieja while walking in condado...was a great dinner!!!!5. the pools were clean and beautiful....be careful who you sit next to though....one women was on her cell loudly...talking about her stupid haphazard posting of her CV on monster.com...yap yap...and how she was getting job offers...new york ...penn....NJ...if your reading this and this was you....women you got to learn to be discreet...you were too...loud...we didn't need to know your business but man we had no chioce....lol...(sorry I got off track :o) back to my review): 6. Bar areas.....very nice.....even to just check out....big screen tv indoors near main lobby...great......live music....greatwe didn't mind paying for our liquor (were from NY and bars can be pricey)BUT so people doing this (tip: drinks expensive: Get plastic cups from bar (buy a drink, keep cup) then store bears liquor in your room that you bought from airport or from shops, groceries stores (not many in the area so try to find some when your getting there or out and about otherwise you will need transportation to get to a place that has it at a good price). 7. Great location-If you stay in isla verde where a majority of the hotels are....you will have to deal with the noise of the airport...very very loud I saw reviews where for a couple of seconds you can't hear your own conversations......caribe hilton was in a perfect location....further away from airport.....only heard prop planes from small airport in the area and that was occasional.8.Room service -yummy9. history - this hotel has history...thats why the have so much grounds becuase they had this area for so long...most hotels don't have so much area---as you can tell by the fort on the premisses with nice views of ocean crashing on rocks...there is a view of the lagoon...there is a small beach area...very diverse...the grounds are well kept and they have a beautiful veranda area with swans...very peacefulThis hotel definetly is what you make of it and your trip...If you get a nice room, happen to have great weather and go exploring...youll get the best out of this hotel...Happy travels!!!! Hasta la vista!!!!
