{"text":"Very charming, great location, no frills The Moore Hotel is an incredibly charming old building with a fantastic location in downtown Seattle. It's just minutes from Pike Place and within walking distance of many other attractions.I booked the Moore because it was one of the least expensive places to stay with easy access to the city's center. We arrived late on a Wednesday night and were leaving Seattle late afternoon on a Thursday, so wanted to maximize our time to see Seattle. We parked our car down the street without much trouble and left it there overnight. There was some noise from the street at night, but it wasn't a big deal.The rooms are no frills. Both my friends and I booked ensuite rooms with two beds in each room. The rooms had a fan but no air conditioning (and given that high temperatures are rare in Seattle, this wasn't a problem). Although the rooms show their age, they were clean and charming -- the bathroom had an old-style cast-iron bath with legs. The towels were made up by housekeeping to resemble a swan, which was a nice touch. Doors on the room were very old-style: wooden doors with key locks from both the outside and the inside. There was also a single computer with internet access near the front desk for free use. The check-in desk staff were polite, friendly, and helpful when asked for advice about the local area.I would recommend the Moore Hotel for individual travellers, students, and even families who don't mind a very no-frills inexpensive hotel in return for a fantastic location. It's quite a charming place with an old-style feel to it, and I would certainly stay there again.
