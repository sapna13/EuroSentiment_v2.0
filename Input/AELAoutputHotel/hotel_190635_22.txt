{"text":"5 star room, 3 star service and pool My wife and I stayed at the Arts for vacation. The room was very nice and very clean. 5 star room by US standards. The food at the restaurants was very good, but not excellent, and very expensive. The wine selection is very large. The staff at the restaurants however, were superb. The hotel staff on the other hand missed the mark. Here is where the hotel lets you down. I asked for two types of pillows in the online request. The front desk receptionist confirmed my request. When we got to the room we found the request not met. I had trouble working the phone (I don't know if it was me or the phone). I called for help 4 times and each time I was told help was on the way. No help arrived. I requested a birthday cake for my wife to be delievered at a particular time in writing and recieved confirmation in writing. The cake was not delivered on time. It took a lot of work to get it sorted out. I made a reservation at one of the restaurants in writing and recieved confirmation in writing. When we arrived at the restaurant, they had no record of the reservation. When I needed help printing a boarding pass the floor attendant was worthless and gave me the wrong information. Another issue was the pool. There is only one pool which is outdoors. The pool was icy cold so if you go at a time other than high season, you may be in for a shock. The view from the pool is poor. The pool is small and there is not enough lounge chairs. Bar service ends at 5pm (I think) or at least way before I thought it should. There is a casino next door which brought in some guests you would not normally have at such a hotel. Reminded me of a sceen out of the movie Swingers. The crowd around the casino is a bit annoying outside as well.The hotel is not on the beach, but very close and the closest I saw (about 100 yards). All and all, I would not stay there again because the hotel simply lacked the service one expects with a 5 star hotel and particularly when you are paying 5 star prices.However, if service is not important and all you want is a 5 star room close to the beach, then I would recommend it.
