{"text":"Wonderful Experience at the Watertown Hotel Just got back from a one-week stay at the Watertown Hotel. My husband was there teaching at the University of Washington and I was a tag along. The hotel is very clean, the staff is very helpful and the breakfast every morning was just right. I used the shuttle service every day. Jim, the driver, was so nice and put up with the questions I asked every day about things to do in Seattle. The rooms are very comfortable and included a small refrigerator, microwave, room safe, and ample drawer space for all your stuff. Must use your room key to get above the lobby entrance. It is a five-block walk to the University. Did not use the bicycles, because there are lots of hills (much to my surprise). Free wine-tasting every evening. There is a great mall downhill from the University area with shopping, restaurants, and two grocery stores. So, very safe, clean rooms, excellent service, free parking in an underground garage, free breakfast, free shuttle service to various locations, great weather while we were there, great experience. Going back next year, will go back to the Watertown. Good place for business visitor, families, and groups. There were at least two women's volleyball teams staying there. Things I can recommend doing in Seattle: Sightseeing tour of the city to get your bearings. Go to the Space Needle, but for the best view of the city, pay $3, go to the top of the Columbia Center at 5th and Columbia. Pike Place Market-could go every day for food, people watching and street musicians. Walk about the waterfront. Take a short cruise around the harbor. Drive about 30 minutes away from Seattle and see Snoqualmie Falls. Took a 25-minute seaplane city tour with Kenmore Air from Lake Union area. UNBELIEVABLE. Did not have time to go to Victoria, but plan to take a seaplane and do this next year. Good restaurants on Lake Union. That's All!
