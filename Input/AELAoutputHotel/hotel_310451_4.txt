{"text":"Loved Four Points Well, checked in at the resort after a major storm had destroyed most of the south. Couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even tell the resort had been hit. The grounds were clean and looked just like the pictures. The Sheraton was located in the middle of million dollar homes on a big golf course surrounded by a big fence. The property looked incredible. The resort was empty. Not very many people there which was very nice!!! Had the pool and beach to ourselves. The beach is about a one-minute walk down a path. The beach was nice (not as nice as the Dominican) and the water was clear and very warm. The room was just ok!!! Nothing fancy. The staff at the hotel was very helpful. Everyone was so nice and went out of their way to make you feel at home. The food was awesome!!! Never had a bad meal the week I was there. You should rent a car. There are a lot of nice restaurants on the other side of the property that you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ walk to. The casino was kind of small but no complaints. My wife won $1000.00 playing Roulette, which paid for our entire trip. While your there, you must go to Culebra Island on the snorkeling trip. There is a tour company called East Winds that will take you for 89.00 per person for about 8 hours. The boat leaves from a small town about 25 minutes from the resort. BEST BEACH I HAVE EVER BEEN TO IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!! Culebra is an incredible place that makes you feel like you have no problems. Looks like something you would see in a dream. Well we will definitely be back as soon as possible. If you looking for exciting nightlife this is not your place...kind of slow...but slow is good!!!!
