{"text":"Likes  Frequently stay at this Holiday Inn. It's not as upscale or antisceptic as the Hilton or Doubletree. In general it is quite ok. and it offers a few amenities that I like far better than either of those hotels. The 24 hour pool, jacuzzi and gym access is GREAT. More hotels should have this available since their guests generally arrive late and leave fairly early the next day. Physical access is limited by use of the room key which lends a security feature that the Hilton does not have.The jacuzzi needs resurfacing - it looks pretty grungy. The jets need fixing as there is almost no power coming from them. Unlike the pool at many hotels, this swimming pool is big enough to do laps. It is one reason I LOVE staying at this hotel. It is kept at an excellent temperature for swimming or playing = not too cold, not too warm. Internet access was free at the business center until this most recent trip. The old computer was replaced with a newer flat screen model and now they require credit card input and charge after five minutes. I was very disappointed to see the loss of this customer service amenity. The rooms are clean and the beds comfortable everytime I've been there.PARKING charges are less than other hotels ($9). I find the whole parking charge thing at Seattle Airport hotels to be a complete RACKET. I wish there was a way for customers to revolt. (Ironically .. the two star hotels usually offer FREE parking to guests!!)This hotel is close to Denny's so if hungry it's easy to pop over and get a salad or snack for far less than the hotel restaurant.
