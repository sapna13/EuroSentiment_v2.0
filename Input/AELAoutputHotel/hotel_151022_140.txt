{"text":"Plenty of vitamin R (rhum of course) We just came back from a week stay; and it was more than we expected. Our arrival was prompt on time thanks to Sunwing, the hotel staff gave us information on the hotel and brought us to our room immediately after arrival. No waiting... Our first room had an odor of humidity; we right away went back to reception to ask for a room change. It was done immediately and they moved us to another room with a king size bed. The grounds keeping are clean and tidy; the staff are always working and they look like busy bees... The bars are great, very generous in the vitamin R; you can ask for any drink we suggest the Coco Feliz or the Coco Loco. Don't forget your mug; keep in mind the environment !!! Food... what can we say... plenty for everyone's taste. We certainly did not go ungry. And we recommend that you try the steak house; the sirloin steak was cooked to perfection. Great settings with the pink flamingos all around the restaurant. The beach is nice; it is cleaned up every morning for the seaweed; you must reserve a hut early moring like before 7:00 am. People do not sleep in... you may even encounter a tourist that race you for a spot...if you want to be in the shade. If you want to lay in the sun all day; there are many chairs that is not the problem. Pool is nice and clean. Staff is courteous and respectful; they want to make sure you have a good time but they are not pushy to force you in activities. Our only complaints are: the shows and our bed. If you are going for the night shows don't expect too much; they try their best. Our bed was hard as a rock. Excursions: a must go is Saona Island and catamaran. We had a great time; beautiful ocean and vitamin R for all. We also did the shopping tour; the shopping tour includes a visit of a rhum factory (don't expect a big facotry it looks more like a bootleging outfit, then they bring you to an outside shopping plaza and after to the supermarket. It was worth it for the supermarket stop for purchasing coffee, vanilla and rhum. Otherwise we found out that the vendors that come to the hotel on Tuesday and Thursday have better prices than the plaza vendors. Be prepaired to bargain like almost a third of what they are asking and then you meet almost in the middle. They accept american and domincan pesos. It was a safe excursions and it gives you a good ideas of how the locals live. It is a peaceful resort; if you are looking for disco and rock  roll this is not the resort for you. You may take the disco excursions at night but we did not do it. Our check out was as easy as the check in. No surprises. Thanks to Sunwing our arrival was on time and our return was 45 min. early. Great service all around.
