{"text":"Agree with other reviews Before choosing this hotel, I read the reviews here on Trip Advisor, and when staying at this hotel I found the reviews to be accurate. The fantastic location of the hotel is its best point. I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in Boston! The staff was also reasonably pleasant.It is a little drab for a supposedly luxury hotel. The carpet in my room didn't look very clean and the wall looked scuffed. One of my pillowcases was stained. Otherwise the room was large and comfortable.I was sorry to find that the bathroom door did not have a lock - instead it had a sliding door like a closet door. And the lighting in the room was inadequate. It was difficult to read by the little light provided.Some reviewers have complained about ice not being available, but ice buckets were brought to my room every night except the first and last night of my stay. I would have preferred to receive ice every night.I ordered room service once and the food was pretty good. There was a coffeemaker in the room, as well as an iron, a hair dryer, a safe, a daily newspaper, and bottled water. I appreciated all of this very much.Overall this hotel did not quite match my expectations for such an expensive hotel, but it was a pleasant and comfortable place to stay. I liked the staff and the low-key lobby, and I didn't feel out of place even in blue jeans. I think the price of the hotel is justified by its great location and pleasant atmosphere, and I would go back again.
