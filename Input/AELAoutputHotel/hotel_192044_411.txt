{"text":"Not that great I would reconsider spending your money at this hotel. We had a standard double room with the English breakfast for 5 nights. The service was sub standard and the rooms very very small. Unfortunately they also clutter the rooms full of unnecessary chairs and other bits which makes unpacking and storing your suitcases as difficult as possible. We were first given a smokers room which stank horribly, but then after requesting a new room, quickly moved to a new floor. The bed was like a microwaved piece of marshmallow and very uncomfortable. Nice flat panel wide screen TV's in the bedrooms, but that's about it. Don't get tempted to keep your own drinks cool in the room fridge as it's computerized and automatically charges you after 20 seconds of opening it. Internet access was expensive, and only about 1 in 3 people at the hotel spoke any English which made things frustrating - forget trying to ask the room service staff anything because they won't understand you! A work colleague had organized surprise Champagne for my wife's Birthday during breakfast, but even though they tried to charge his card, they never actually supplied us with the Champagne. The cold English breakfast is hardly worth the effort and you're better off going out to eat. All in all, a clean hotel with modern look in a handy location due to the proximity of the train station, but too many things let it down to reconsider it at this price level.
