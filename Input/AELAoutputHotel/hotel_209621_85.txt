{"text":"Not Bad This was my birthday trip and after getting a good price from Priceline I was worried about what to expect after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. Customer service was excellent. The rooms are spacious , but the carpet in the hallways need good cleaning. From reading previous reviews I stayed on the 5th floor so I did not hear the music from the lounges at night. When I went down to the third floor to the exercise room ,you were able to hear the music and it is loud.The hotel resturant has a special three course dinner from 5:00 P.M. to 7:00 P.M. for $19.95 and the food was very tasty. The hotel next door, the Hilton ,have several resturants but they are a bit pricey especially Morton Steakhouse. There is a Subway sandwich shop if you want something simple. I went to Old San Juan one day by public transportation for 50cents. You can catch the bus down the block across the street and it brings you back the same place. If you take a taxicab it will charge you $10.00 to go and $10.00 to come back. If you are a walker when you come out the hotel front door make a right and you can walk to a beach park . If you are a true walker you can take the same path to Old San Juan ,but it gets hot quick and you must start out early in the morning. I did it myself it is over 2 miles.There is an additonal municipal fee and hotel tariff of $21.00 per day added to your stay that is not told to you on check in but I had read about it in one the previous reviews on tripadvisor so it was not a shock. There is a computer room ,free of charge to use in the lobby in a separate room .They will offer to charge you $10.00 for an internet chord at the front desk to use your computer in your room.I personally will stay here again.
