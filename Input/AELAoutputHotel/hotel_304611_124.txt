{"text":"Nice Hotel, one or two minor gripes The Royal Plaza has a great location being on the junction of Scotts Road and Orchard Road. If shopping is your thing then this could be the hotel for you. By prior arrangement the hotel agreed to let us leave some baggage with them whilst we went to Malaysia for 4 days. The concierge were very helpful and the check in was smooth. As there were 3 of us we needed an extra bed for our son. This took up a significant amount of the free space in the room. The room, a deluxe, is ideal for a couple but not a family of three. The bathroom was lovely, small and functional. Be aware that many rooms only have a shower and not a bath. On the negative side we found the free mini-bar a bit of a con. You get 4 soft drinks and 2 Tiger beers, just adding a couple of half bottles of wine would have made a difference. My advice would be don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother with the free mini bar and buy what you want at the 7-11 across the road, this will probably significantly reduce the room charge. The pool area was also a bit of a let down, there is a massive bar there but it is never manned, all they need to do is put a small fridge in the shaded area and fill it with bottled water. This would make ordering drinks less troublesome and allow you to quench your thirst without a half hour delay. The gym was advertised as state-of-the-art, it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ. They had done the old trick with mirrors to male it look twice the size, but the equipment on offer was limited and not of particularly good quality. The entrance foyer is spectacular, ornately decorated and at night with all the candles lit looks lovely. The bar areas are also very nice and the staff are very attentive, though again they have so many different promotions on drinks that it is very easy to get confused, this includes the staff. Breakfast was included in the price and was very good with an excellent choice of western and eastern menus on offer. All in all the Royal Plaza is a good hotel to stay in, the deluxe rooms are not suitable for families and the pool and gym could do with upgrading but our experience there was generally a pleasant one.
