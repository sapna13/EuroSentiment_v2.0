{"text":"Nice stay at the Affinia 50 My family and I spent four nights in the Affinia 50 in April. Overall we enjoyed our stay. The hotel was clean and sleek, with very comfortable bedding. The doormen and house keeping were excellent. The front desk and the conceirge desk seemed to be slightly overwhelmed at times. Street noise was only noticable on a few occasions.We spent the first two nights in a Junior Suite. The room was very spacious with a king and a queen sleeper sofa. The bathroom was spacious and there was plenty of room for storage. The kids didn't complain too much about sleeping on the fold out. The kitchenette was a nice feature. It's alway nice to have fridge stocked with drinks. We stayed in this room over the weekend due to availability. It was a bit pricey.The second half of our trip we stayed in a room a 2-queen room. This was a bit smaller, with a tight bathroom. However, both beds were very comfortable and everyone slept very well. There was a kitchenette in this room as well. The weekday prices on this room were quite reasonable.We never tried the food the breakfast at the hotel.Valet parking for the stay was easy and convenient ,but expensive. There is a parking deck across the street, but I never took the time to check it out.The hotel is just a block southeast of the Waldorf Astoria. It is only a few blocks from many mid-town attractions without being in the middle of the crowds. Subway stops are very convenient. There are several good places to eat within 200 yards. We particularly enjoyed Ess-A-Bagel and Chin Chin.
