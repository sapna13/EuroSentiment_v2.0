{"text":"Fantastic Place. My Girlfriend and I went to Riu Naiboa in Punta Cana\/ Bavaro on 17\/08\/2006 for two weeks. Having read some mixed reviews we were unsure of what to expect, but we need not have worried. The hotel itself was clean and smart, however if you expect five star luxury like you get in a top London hotel you will be disappointed. The people who work in the hotels are really friendly and welcoming, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been to many hotels across the world and the people in the Naiboa are far the friendliest. I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ comment on other reviews but both my girlfriend and I felt really welcome as soon as we stepped off the coach.The people in the animation team work so hard and go out of their way to make sure you having a good time, but are also happy to let you be should you want to do nothing. Although neither my Girlfriend nor I got involved with any activities the animation staff always said hello to us. The room we had was on the 3rd floor over looking the pool. It was clean and tidy. We tipped the maids 100DP occasionally and everyday we had a heart or swan shaped towel left out for us. You do have to go get a hairdryer from reception as the rooms do not have any fitted, however we never found this a problem and we were always able to get one straight away. The buffet restaurant had a wide range of foods to eat, I am a fussy eater but I was able to eat something everyday and neither of us had any stomach problems. The steak restaurant which you have to book in advance was disappointing, however if you like you steak rare to medium then you will love it. The pool was fantastic, we were always able to get a sun bed regardless of when we got up and it was never too noisy unlike some hotels we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been to. The real attraction for us was the beach, which is simply amazing. Miles of clear sea and white sandy beach√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, it is a picture postcard location. Again you could easily get a sun bed, however shade is a slight problem as you have to use palm trees, however this does add to the romance of the place. Water sports are available on the beach as well, whilst you can use the beach bars and restaurants to get yourself a spot of lunch and drink. Every Thursday the Caribbean street gets turned into a carnival with dancing and cocktail bars, it is worth going to see and experience. Finally we went on three trips, Marinarium, Saona Island and helicopter views. All three and fantastic trips and well worth it. Both my girlfriend and I had a wonderful holiday and did not want to leave and go back to cold wet UK. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted to go to Dominican Republic as it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ an amazing place.
