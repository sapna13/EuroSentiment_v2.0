{"text":"Fabulous Lenox Hotel This hotel is superbly located in the Back Bay area of Boston next to the Prudential shopping centre which has hundreds of shops. It is also next to Beacon street a very rich neighbourhood. It is 2 minutes walk from Copely Square were the Trinity church is and a markets is held there once a week. Also it is next to the public library and I advise that everyone goes in the library for their breakfast, it is the most wonderful setting I have ever been in, its like a roman paradise abd you would never know it exisied from the outside, please go in and have your bagels in the tranquil setting of the fountain and roman pillars on the bisto tables its truly fantastic. Also go up the Skywalk in the Prudential Tower again fabulous and not many people know about it take some ID with you though. We used the Grey Line tours daily to different states, like Maine, New Hampshire and these trips are worth every penny if you do not want to drive, well organised and plenty to see and do. We went to \\maine and went in a white horse and cart around the streets that no tour bus could get around what a fabulous tour really recommended. Again the coach will pick you up from you hotel and drop you off so there are no worries!!! Then hop on the tube  T to Harvard University and watch all the students reading in the square, and look around the dorms what a fasinating place have lunch on one of the pavement cafes and listen to the students playing whatever instruments at the time are being played. From the Hotel you can walk a few hundred metrers to Boston Common and the Public Gardens beautiful on a lovely warm wintery day. We walked to downtown along Tremont Street tpicked up the Freedom Trail which is indicated by a red brick line and followed it all the way down to Quincy Market and the harbour side boats. It only takes about twenty minutes and it is a very safe walk. Have your lunch on the cafe at the bayside they give you a bleeper if busy so you can walk around until your table is ready very good food indeed. Quincy Market has all the street entertainers, lots of shops but I bought some gifts from the small carts which I later found half the price in the downtown shops so beware of that. I think the Back Bay area is the best place to stay as you are near the back bay river and you can still walk to the harbour downtown area to take the harbour cruises. You also have the boston common for walks etc. Finally I would like to add I was unsure as to if Boston was a safe city as you hear so many stories, it was absolutely 100% safe infact the safest place in America I was ever in and would definately be returning again for the next fall and i will be staying in the Lenox hotel again.
