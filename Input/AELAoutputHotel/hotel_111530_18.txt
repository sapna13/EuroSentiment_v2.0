{"text":"Good Experience at this hotel Valet was professional and hospitable. My husband and I were here for a Board Meeting - so its good for business travelers. Gift Shop is really stocked w\/alot of items you may need on the go (toieltries, etc). Parking was convenient w\/standard cost of $12-14 for guests. The guestroom we had was in the South Tower on the 18th Flr w\/slight view,very, very small guest room with King bed for two but functional, granite top countertops\/floors in bath and granite counter top for the Flat Screen TV!!! The bathroom was super small as well about the size of an interior room on a cruise ship. Shower\/bathtub was narrow and restrictive to bathe in. Decor: Attempting but not consistently the best - The A\/C unit countertop finish needs fixing, the finish was chipping and slightly hanging off. Cosmetic observation. New Coffee dispenser brews cup instead of pot which is good. Chairs are not, not, not comfortable at all. ALL of the chairs were extremely narrow. Room service was timely and decent good. But expensive (hot oatmeal and side bacon (4 slices) was a total of $35 !! We have stayed at other hotels that have top quality service 4-5 Star and the pricing was conducive to the quality of food received. We sometimes have to do alot of room service due to schedules but this hotel we didn't. the restaurant is much better and hot food guarnteed. The breakfast buffet was wonderful. Lobby area is spacious and the desk clerks were very professional and kind at check-in. Hallways\/elevators clean and decor nicely. Our colleagues had a beautiful guestroom just two doors down from us and it was extremely spacious. Their bathroom was a bit dated in decor though - lighting really bad like in an old gas station. This property was literally transitioning from Adams Mark to Sheraton during our stay - so when this happens it can be unsettling for guests but it was good and didn't affect us in anyway. Our general assembly meetings competed with a youth cheerleading competition and they were located upstairs above our meeting room and shook the floors to the level of the chandeliers on our floor were in earthquake mode with dust coming down...whew! All in all we would probably stay there again and would recommend it to our colleagues for the sake of convenience and location. Hope this review helps in your travel planning.
