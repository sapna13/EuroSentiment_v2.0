{"text":"Nice Resort! Have just returned from the Sirenis Coctal room side. Was told by travel agent we would have the run of two side by side hotels owned by Sirenis, it is just one big resort, don't be fooled. Arrived at night and after over an hour bus ride from airport we were impressed by the front lobby. When we got to our rooms, weren't so impressed a 3 star at best. However they were kept clean enough and anything you needed fixed ( which was quite a bit) was fixed promptly. When travelling are not too particular about rooms as long as clean and comfortable good enough. Don't sit on a plane for 7 hours to hang out in our room. If rooms are where you hang out not the hotel for you. Couldn't wait to see resort in the morning. The resort is very nice, it is an older resort but the grounds are kept beautifully. There are little things to pick apart (for goodness sakes replace the speakers on the walkway down to the beach!) but really a lovely resort! The beach was honestly not the white sand I was expecting but it was still very nice. I am a bit negative because travelling over the holidays you pay 5 star prices and get 3 and a half star resorts. This is certainly no 5! The food was good, and always presnted nicely. They sure know how to pour a drink! No watered down booze here. It has a great pool for children the kids loved it. Not too worry about too much topless if taking kids, never been to a resort with so many women wearing bikini tops! The staff is kind and very helpful. If travelling with teenagers who are only happy when spending $100 a day you will want to stay closer to town as any excursion is an hour on the bus. We did the Monster safari and it was very good, hung out at resort the rest of the time. If you just want to kick back and relax for a week not worry about shopping or excursions a good place to stay. We will return just not for the rip off holiday prices! All in all a nice place to stay but don't pay for a 5 star!
