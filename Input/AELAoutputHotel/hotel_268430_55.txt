{"text":"Really Great Spot We just spent six nights at this hotel and had a completely fine time. Here are some of the positives:- extremely well run- friendly and accomodating staff; particularly concierge, wait staff, front desk- fun and free entertainment- clean and perfectly air conditioned room; fine housekeeping- fabulous beach, very good pools- attractive and well maintained grounds; wonderful sunsets!- great location near airport, bus line (we used the A5 into Old Town), rain forest, museums and attractions of San Juan and Old San Juan, nearby small towns.- fair 'hotel' prices in bars and restaurants, where the food could be very, very goodThere's a small casino we did not visit.I travel a great deal on business and pleasure and if you read my reviews on tripadvisor you know I hold no prisoners. So many American resorts are like our major airlines (e.g American, the one we flew down from Boston on): miserable customer service, lack of attention to detail, ripoff prices. So if I had a beef you would hear about it here! I simply do not. Of course, there are always little glitches, and here are a couple:- there must have been molasses in the wireless\/ethernet system; communication was often at a turtle's pace, but they did offer wireless in rooms (!) and there was a nice business center to take up slack.; if you go try to use it off hours- service in the more expensive outdoor restaurant could be very slow, and one evening an appetizer was forgotten (quickly made up by free wine), though we thought the food extremely good. In the indoor restaurant service was over the top friendly (at one point we had female staff fighting over who was helping us the most!) and, happily, they had a standard menu, not buffet every night.The airplane noise issue was there, but it was something most folks just laughed off; my thought was that the hotel should provide a printout of departures so we could try to check on what plane was going where in the world. Our room was pretty well soundproofed. Some things we enjoyed particularly included the magnificent National Gallery and the Puerto Rican Museum of Art (with a wonderful garden and absolutely five star food). The former has a breathtaking lighting system to illuminate landscapes by Oller and other famous PR painters; just magnificent and maybe the highlight of our trip. We went to a a very good beach restaurant over at Pinones (Soliel), and enjoyed a free pickup and return., and Roberto, our tour guide to the rain forest was great; he imparted a tremendous amount of information on Puerto Rico and the gorgeous forest. The fact that the day the PR governor and some buddies were arrested by the feds for corruption led to some wonderful background political info and constant updates on 'breaking news'. Oh, if you do travel American AIrlines avoid the bar-restaurant near gate 7. Ultimately you will have to choose between your flight and food; just about the worst service we've ever had anywhere and for crying out loud they are in an airport!So to sum up, our first trip to Puerto Rico was very enjoyable and it was made better by one of the best resorts of its kind we have ever visited; as a regular Marriott user I was very pleased because some Courtyards can be pretty scruffy. This place is clean, efficient, friendly, well-located, fairly priced and not pretentious. I suspect we'll go back!
