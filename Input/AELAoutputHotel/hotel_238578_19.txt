{"text":"Great hotel - cheap price, top location, clean, comfortable and friendly! I stayed in a twin room with a friend during February at the very reasonable price of √à√\u2020√ü?0 for the night. The hotel itself was literally a stones throw away from The Rijksmuseum and also the van Gogh museum yet the room seemed wonderfully quiet and calm even with the window wide open. It's also just a minutes walk from the Hobbemastraat tram stop which is serviced regularly by the number 2 and the number 5 tram from Central Station and the main city areas such as Dam Square. On arrival, half an hour earlier than check-in time, our room was already available and we were able to access it straight away. The room itself was clean and fairly narrow but there was ample space for 2 really comfortable single beds, a 2 seater desk and a wardrobe. The windows were large and airy and the hotel allowed smoking in the rooms (I'm not sure if this was true of all of the rooms so if you are a non-smoker then this may be a negative for you). The en-suite bathroom was small and space to pass by the sink was at a premium but it was functional enough with a good shower and towels provided. Breakfast is served from 7.30 - 10.00 in a good sized downstairs breakfast room. We were welcomed to have some breakfast despite not arriving until 9.55 and there was still plenty of choice with cereals, fruit salad, yoghurts, bread and preserves on offer as well as a selection of cold meats and cheeses and the usual fresh fruit juices and tea\/coffee machine. The staff at reception were both friendly and helpful, offering maps and suggestions of good places to eat. On top of this, the hotel offers a luggage storage service so even after check-out, you are welcome to store your luggage leaving you free to further explore the city. Perhaps the only negative we experienced is that we would have liked to have had tea and coffee making facilities in the room itself but this is only a minor downside to a very good value for money hotel. There was also a bar within the hotel which we did not drink at but looked perfectly pleasant. I would certainly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a fairly cheap and cheerful place to stay when visiting Amsterdam.
