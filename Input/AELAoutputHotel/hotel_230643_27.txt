{"text":"Great Location Just returned from Barcelona Universal having had a fantastic 5 days.Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was small but clean and quiet with a safe, mini bar etc. On the down side it didn't have any external windows but on the plus side it meant it was a very quiet room which I had requested.The pool as already noted by others is small but so refreshing after a day's sightseeing and the views from the terrace are wonderful. It did get a bit crowded at the end of the day but I managed to get a deckchair each day without a problem.The hotel is literally 5 mins from Las Ramblas and has a metro station immediately outside making it easy to get to the tourist sights. However the city is compact and generally it is easy to walk everywhere. We enjoyed a leisurely stroll to the beach and the Gaudi houses.I really loved Barcelona and would definately recommend this hotel. Like any city take care with your belongings and use the safe which is free. We did meet others who had bags stolen as they got out of a taxi and there were always a few tourists in the police station around the corner. We didn't experience any problems although we noted a few shady characters on the metro but we didn't take any chances.We found the restaurants on La Ramblas are very expensive as they add a surcharge for eating outside but we managed to eat well just off La Ramblas. It is however worth paying the extra for a drink on La Ramblas just to experience the street entertainment which is very funny. ","annotations":[]}
