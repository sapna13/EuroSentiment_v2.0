{"text":"Great Location  We just got back from an 8 day italy trip. 3 nights in rome, 2 in Florence  2 in venice. We booked using europeandestinations.comI choose this hotel for the location. I have a teenage daughter and when I found out it was next to Cartier, I knew she'd get a kick out of it. When we got there, I couldn't believe it not only is it next to Cartier. It's across the street from Prada and on the same block as all of the fancy stores - Gucci and so many others! If you're going to rome, I would skip the fancy stores at the Spanish Steps. They're all here and are significantly less crowded!What also surprised me was that I didn't realize how close it is to everything else! My husband has a bad leg and we mostly cabbed it in Rome but here we walked to EVERYTHIING. It's a few blocks to the Uffuizzi and the Duomo and the Ponte Vecchio and more!The hotel itself is very cute. It has an old fashioned lift where you need to close the door. The proprietors were wonderful. It's run by an old italian women and her son. It was very clean. It had a relatively new bathroom and it was decorated fairly well with unique pieces in every room - Some a little older than others. The accomodations weren't exactly luxury - not like our hotel in Rome - Albergo del Senato, but we had two room (for a family of 4) and it worked well. If I went back, I would definitely choose to stay there again. It also had a great roof deck and had a sitting room that had a computer you could access for free and get internet! Just as an fyi in rome we stayed in the Albergo del Senato. I would definetely recommend that to anyone and in venice stayed at the Hotel Commercio  Pellegrino which also had a great location and I would also recommend that - I'm writing a review of those also.Good Luck!
