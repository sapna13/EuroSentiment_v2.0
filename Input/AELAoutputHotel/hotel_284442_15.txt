{"text":"Beautiful grounds Waianae is not the paradise that you would expect in Hawaii. But when you come upon the resort it all changes. We had a beautiful view with flowers and trees. The birds are friendly and we enjoyed feeding them along with the ducks, peacock and cats that run around the grounds. Don't worry, they don't bother you unless you want them to. We did see a mongoose here and there along with a centerpede and gecko.That's all part of Island living. We enjoyed being away from Wakiki and the traffic there. We were able to get around the Island without any problem.The bad points are the tent people all over Waianae beaches. You can't enjoy the beaches there. Not that we encountered any problems with them. We just stayed away.We did have one encounter at a beach from someone who didn't appreciate people from the main land. He tried to get into our car when we were on the beach. We left after a brief encounter with him. One couple had their trunk broken into..........lesson one- never leave anything in your trunk. There are those that look for rental cars and make their living braking into the trunks.Only major problem at the resort was that we waited three hours for our room to be ready, they compt us 2 desserts and 2 breakfasts for the wait. We had 2 days the maid never showed up, not a biggy though. Food was OK. Burger was great. (no restaraunts close by unless you want Mc Donalds, KFC or Burger King. Hotel wait staff were a little slow. We usually had to track them down when we were done eating or needing something.All in all........great view, nice people, beautiful clean grounds, comfy room (take a second floor), great weather. We will go back without a doubt.Oh, another thing. Plan on hiking a lot. You can't drive to where the rooms are. You do a lot of walking. this is not the place for someone who can't hike. A great place for exercise though!Parking lot gets quite full at night so you walk even further.Give it a shot.............we had a nice time.
