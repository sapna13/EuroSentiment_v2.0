{"text":"Fantastic Resort! We just got back from Bahia Principe last night, and the hotel was wonderful! The pools were great, the beach was terrific. The a la carte resturants were not too busy for reservations, but we chose only to use 2 of our 4 a la cartes. We preferred having a variety at the buffet.We ate at the Italian Resturant, and the Garden Grill. The appetizers at the garden grill were the best, probably the most americanized you will find.There is no food would say to beware of, we didn't have any problems with upset stomachs.There were always tons of beach chairs when we went to the beach, early morning, late afternoon, anytime of the day. same with deck chairs at the poolsThis was our honeymoon, and to be honest, that was the only disappointment. They don't do much for honeymooners here, they give you a plate of fruit (which we didn't even know what it was, except for the two banana's) and the smallest bottle of wine possible.We booked our vacation through redtag.ca and sunwing vacations, and it was incredibly easy. Tickets were at the airport, the trasnfer bus from Punta Cana airport to Bahia Principe, one of the hotel resp was on the bus to check us in on the bus, no long lines for check in.The other thing that was awesome is that there were tons of canadians at the resort, and alot of them had tired other resorts in Punta Cana, and all said they preferred Bahia Principe. So if you're trying to decide, this hotel isn't a risk, book it!!! Any other questions if you have any, feel free to email me, heatherlina@hotmail.com ","annotations":[]}
