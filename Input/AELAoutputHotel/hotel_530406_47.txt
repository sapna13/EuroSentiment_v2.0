{"text":"Hotel is not safe for kids The hotel is located in the nice place, but there are main problems:1. There are many wild dogs are on the beach. They run into hotel property barking, releasing parasites, and spreading feces. They endanger kids and actually everybody on the beach. I tried to draw attention of the management and people in charge of security on the beach but nobody cares. The staff√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ responsibility for keeping people safe was ignorant. The dogs also licked out of people√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ cups at the beach when they were in the water or elsewhere. 2. When we arrived there at night, a train-bus was supposed to take us and many newcomers to their rooms. Unfortunately for newcomers there is only 1 small train-bus which is always full of people especially at night time. The lobby staff is ignorant and suggested for me and many other newcomers to wait. We waited for an hour and after tough talk with the supervisor, we finally got to our room.3. Entertainment was flat, nothing bad and nothing good; I would say it is much disorganized and not interesting. It depends how much alcohol you consume during the entertainment. 4. Compared to other hotels that my family and I have previously stayed in the area, (Bahia Principe, Sirenis) I would give this hotel a maximum of 3 and a half.The food in the hotel is satisfactory. The gardening is very well done. The pool was closed during some of the time that I had stayed in the hotel.The internet rental fee is expensive.The Mike√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ coffee shop is very good.
