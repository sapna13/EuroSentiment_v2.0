{"text":"Great weekend getaway Went back to the Four Seasons in December with family for a quick four day break before the holidays. Valet parking was efficient (had a rental car which is necessary in this area). Valet parking was great, car was always there when I called ahead).Check-in was also efficient. Booked a deluxe bay suite for my wife and 3 1\/2 year old son. Room was very large and spacious. 1 king bed in bedroom with sofa and couch in living room. Only regretted that they only had one DVD and it was only in bedroom and not in living room. Brought some movies along so son watched them in bed which was ok. I guess I could have asked for another DVD player but wasnt worth it at the time. We had room service for breakfast the first morning. I was disappointed that food wasn't that hot and scrambled eggs for my son tasted like they were powdered. Bill was over $70 so though it could have been better. Recommend having breakfast in restaurant downstairs as food was better. Also had a very nice lunch in the restaurant (desert was very good). For dinners, we made our way to South Beach so can't comment on the dinners.Swimming pool is heated and my son had a great time. Pool valets set up your chairs and brought water, etc. We had a few snacks one day and it was quite good. The salads are light and refreshing.Overall, we had a great time and would go back. South Beach was so crazy (traffic was terrible) that we were glad to come back to the Four Seasons at night.
