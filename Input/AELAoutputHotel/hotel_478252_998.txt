{"text":"Long weekend relaxation and Partying Just got back from a 5 night vacation at the bahia with 12 guys and girls all ages 17-20 it was amazing. The resort is very beutiful and in great condition. The Beach: very clean water and clean sand lots of chairs with plenty of shade if needed. The water sports are so much fun including the little sailboats and kayaks. I reccomend Bringing Your own snorkle and mask. The Pools: Thier are many! all clean and u will get great service, you will not wait more than a few seconds for a a drink!Dining: The buffets all seem to be good no one i was with had any problems only went to 2 ala cartes the japaneese def being my favrotie.Bars and Nightlife: Their are bars you can get drinks at all over the resort ... a nice place to hang out and get the night started after dinner is the lobby bar before you head to the casino or nightclub where it gets crazyThe rooms: All clean big spaces very good housekeeping service i left them a 2 dollar tip daily and wrote them a note in spanish and they stocked the minibar with all beers and bottled water.Met and talked to many poeple who have vacationed in punta cana several times they all said the bahia principle was def the best... Overall very fun vacation cant wait to go back.. i definetly would recommend young singles or large groups looking to have a fun day and crazy night to visit this resort.
