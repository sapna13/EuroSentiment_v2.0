{"text":"a great deal for the price I stayed at the Mayflower after reading the good reviews on Trip Advisor and getting a great rate for the week. The room was only $80 per night, which is very low for San Francisco. For that price, we had a relatively nice and clean room on the 5th floor of the hotel. Our room faced onto Bush Street which can be noisy in the morning, so request a room on the other side of the building if that that may be an issue you. The location of the hotel is fantastic. If you don't mind climbing a steep hill, the California Street cable car line is only two blocks away, providing easy access to the financial district and the Ferry Building. It is also only two or three blocks from the Powell street line, which goes to Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf. Union Square is within easy walking distance as are many restaurants and cafes. The Mayflower is next door to a small market and deli, which was extra convenient since my room had a small kitchenette with a refrigerator. If you don't wake up in time for the continental breakfast (coffee, juice and toast) it is nice to have access to your own refrigerator. Another bonus is that the hotel has its own parking garage. Many hotels in the city charge guests up to $35 per day, but the Mayflower only charged me $10 even though they quoted $20. This included in\/out privileges, but you must ask the front desk attendant to open the garage for you as the door is not automatic. The only warning is that the garage is very small. Not only are the spaces small, but the entrance to it is very small as well. Definitely don't plan on parking here if you have an SUV, or even anything larger than our Civic. Overall, the Mayflower is a great hotel. If you don't expect a 5-star room, you will be pleased with the free wireless access and cute details of a quirky old building. Definitely, the price is good for such a great location.
