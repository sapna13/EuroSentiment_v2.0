{"text":"The BEST!!! Wow! Just came back from 3 nights at Amandari, 4 nights at Amankila and 7 nights in Amanjiwo. Amankila is Amazing! We had room #33 (pool suite) and it was great! The room is great, especially considering it was 15 years old. The outside was magnificent. Our terrace was huge as was our pool. We had a daybed and a table with two chairs for outdoor dining. These were in the covered area of the terrace. Then we had a queen size recliner located in the shade (due to trees and an umbrella) and then we also had two single recliners located in the sun. So, whatever you wanted to do-sleep, suntan or stay in the shade, you could do it without dragging furniture as you had to do at Amandari. From day one, they knew our names and always referred to us as such. The staff was friendly and great. Everytime we left our room, we would come back to find that it was cleaned and refreshed. We had complimentary cookies and chips and it was always refilled. Within 10 minutes of arriving, we received a bottle of champagne (as we did at Amandari and Amanjiwo) for our welcome. It was very romantic and there was only one kid there (who was older and very quiet). The excursions are great (you get one a day on the Bali experience). The picnic lunch was unbelievable. There was so much food and it was wonderful. The only bad thing was that our last night, the food was really bad. It must have been a different chef from all the previous nights because they were fairly good.If we ever went back to Indonesia, this is our number #1 choice to return to over Amandari and Amanjiwo.MT ","annotations":[{"endOffset":79,"mention":"Amankila","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Amankila"],"startOffset":71},{"endOffset":104,"mention":"Amanjiwo","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Amanjiwo"],"startOffset":96},{"endOffset":114,"mention":"Amankila","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Amankila"],"startOffset":106},{"endOffset":923,"mention":"cookies","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cookie"],"startOffset":916},{"endOffset":933,"mention":"chips","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Potato_chip","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":928},{"endOffset":1062,"mention":"Amanjiwo","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Amanjiwo"],"startOffset":1054}]}
