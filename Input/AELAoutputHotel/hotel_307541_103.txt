{"text":"Very good, but not great I have stayed in many hotels in Sanur. I like Sanur. It is a perfect place to relax outside of the hustle and bustle of Bali. A nice street with lots of hotels and good restaurants. Previous holidays I choose the Puri and Griya Santrian. The first because of the reviews, the second because of the price and location.This time the Hyatt. I remembered it was in the middle of Sanur, so you could easily walk to either side of the town. It's about a 5 to 10 minute walk either way. Nothing is really happening directly outside of the hotel. The hotel has 2 swimming pools, but neither really felt fantastic. The grounds are very large and well kept. Pool area is nice with only a few deck chair battles. Plenty of sun, plenty of shade. The pool bar and restaurant are great and the food and drinks are recommended. At night the main restaurant is not particulary cosy. The food is great, but for a romantic dinner, flee elsewhere. Breakfast deserves a special mention. Probably the best I have had on all my travels. Impressive. If only they would just serve the tea and coffee a little quicker. But truly a great start of the day!!The rooms are good. I had a garden view room (you only spent the night in your room, so a sea view doesn't contribute anything in my belief) which is fine. Nice large bed, nice bathroom (in need of some small maintenance), nice balcony and a TV with lots of channels (also English). Great Internet services at a whopping $12,50 a day (or less if you only check your mail), which is expensive to Balines standards. I use whopping with a smile however. Great value for a fast wireless connection.Staff and service were great. I really need to mention the Spa. A real spa where they give you a real facial, not just a couple of masks and a massage. No: they got the works. It is prices in dollars and a facial is $65. Again, expensive for Bali, but worth it. All in all a nice experience, but not great because the overall feel of the hotel grounds (pool area especially) did not impress. maybe I expected something like the Grand Bali Hyatt... I would recommend this hotel for a stay in Sanur, closely followed by the Puri Santrian, which looses on business services and the fact they have no TV with satellite channels (I travel alone and every once in a while I like my TV).
