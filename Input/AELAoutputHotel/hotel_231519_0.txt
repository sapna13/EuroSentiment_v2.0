{"text":"Staff were fantastic We arrived as a mature couple for a three day break and the staff were friendly, polite and spoke excelent English. Having said that the hotel rooms did not come up to 4* more like a 3*. The first room we were offered was a twin with good view - but a twin. The second was a double with about 45cm (18) either side of the bed! We settled on the third room, D\/ble, view of the busy street below and Juliet balcony. The room was comfortable, the bed suited us but it was on the hard side. There were no tea\/coffee making facilities but we have experience of Spanish \/ continental hotels so we take our own travel kettle etc. with us. We did find the system about the sun roof terrace rather bizarre; there was no bar and the reception had to organise drinks etc for you and there is a large notice stating - Only food and drinks purchased from the hotel can be consumed - The breakfast was of a simplistic continental style with plenty of choice for all but rather expensive as an extra to the daily rate but convenient. The hotel is very close - 3\/5 mins. walk of The Ramblas, Placa de Catallunya, cafes and shopping. We would reccomend the tourist tour bus √à√\u2020√ü?0 each but it does give a headset commentary and saves hours map reading. There is an internet in the hotel but we found a local internet cafe for a couple of Euros for one hour spread over our three day visit. On departure our flight had been delayed and the hotel allowed us to vacate the room and store our luggage in a safe holding room. Barcelona is very expensive and watch out for pick-pockets but we would recommend everybody visit it for the experience. We took the airport bus for √à√\u2020√ü?.50 caught at the airport but get off at Placa Universitat for Hotel Inglaterra BUT you have to catch the return journey at Placa Catalunya which worked out great and very efficient.
