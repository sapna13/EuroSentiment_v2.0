{"text":"Great location, wrong resort Well, we arrived at the hotel at around 1pm to check into our room. When we had first arrived we were not acknowledged for about 15 minutes and there had not even been a line. We then approached a man named Orlando who did not smile and seemed rather in a bad mood. After finding our reservation, I explained to Orlando that it had been our anniversary and if we can have a room with at least somewhat of a view. Orlando promised us the world and then checked us into a DIRTY room (the tub was filthy with red liquid, the beds were slept in, and the mini bar has dirt all on the floor in front of it). We returned to the desk and kindly asked to be moved. We then moved into a room that had been a couple of doors down but literally in company of a nest of bugs coming out of the ceiling. At this point, our patience had worn thin and then after a THIRD room change, we received a standard accomodation. Throughout the duration of our stay we experienced great tropical weather in Punta Cana, however, the all inclusive package they mention in the brochure did not specify that there would be several a various bugs in our food as well. To end it short before I become reminded of a terrible stay, PUNTA CANA IS BEAUTIFUL, but be very careful as to where you choose to spend your time there. ","annotations":[]}
