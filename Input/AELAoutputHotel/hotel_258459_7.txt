{"text":"Great Location and Service The Russell has the perfect location. It's a small, quirky boutique hotel directly across the street from the Circular Quay. This was our first trip to Sydney and we were thankful to be so close to the typical touristy action. Upon arrival, we were a bit confused where to check in (past the restaurant and up the stairs), but once we arrived, we were greeted warmly and allowed to check in early (we were so thankful). The staff was all tremendously helpful and friendly. They insisted on carrying our bags up for us, even though we said we could manage. The stairs are a bit narrow and I don't recommend this hotel for someone who may have difficulty with steps. The building itself is dated, but absolutely as clean as they can get it to be. Our room was the standard room with shared bath for $145 AUD. If you want to be pampered, DO NOT book this room. It is very small, with no TV or AC. We found it to be comfortable though and the shared bath was never a problem. The breakfast was adequate for me, but my husband usually felt a little hungry after finishing. A laptop was provided during business hours for your convenience, however we brought our own and the hotel just provided us with a wireless key. The connection in the room was sketchy (as it was not intended to reach that far), but the lobby area is no problem. I loved the small touches that the hotel provided. The sitting room was great with loads of books about Australia and other things. I would recommend the hotel if you can accept the quirkiness that comes with it. ","annotations":[]}
