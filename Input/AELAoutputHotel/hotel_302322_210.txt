{"text":"Excellent We stayed here as part of our Honeymoon (a stop over on the way back from Australia). We had our room automatically upgraded, and boy, what an upgrade, a corner suite on the top floor 5 doors down from the Presidential Suite. Large Lounge, Large Bedroom, 2 bathrooms with excellent views of the Hong Kong Island skyline. The roof top pool is excellent with great views. One side is fully glazed to you can also see the views from underwater!It is a little out of the main part, (a suburb really) but the local shops and facilities are very good. There is a ferry terminal behind the hotel. The hotel runs a regular free shuttle into town that runs quite late and is well worth it.If you can, most nights at about 8, there is a light show. Basically every major building on either side of the bay is lit up in time to music played over the public address system. All free. We saw it from behind the cultural centre\/symphony hall across the road from the Peninsular Hotel.We were room only. The floor we were on was a sort of √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Øembers club√à√\u2020\u2022?floor with a private restaurant and lounge. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat there but it looked quite good. We got room service a few times, which was also good and not too extortionate. We had our last nights meal in the in the Chinese restaurant, Hoi Yat Heen which was very tasty.We would certainly stay here again next time we are in Hong Kong.
