{"text":"Nothing special We stayed at the Alila for the last 5 days of our honeymoon and while there was nothing wrong, we didn't feel there was anything special about the place. There was just no comparison with our first hotel, the Samaya in Seminyak.We stayed in a ground floor room with outdoor shower. The room was very tastefully decorated but was quite small and the bathroom felt very cramped. At the Samaya in Seminyak we had a private pools in the garden of our huge villa (the bathroom there was the size of the whole room at the Alila) so we were used to having more space. You could also hear people in the rooms above and to the side so felt less private and intimate.The setting is beautiful and the views amazing but the public areas are too small. There were not nearly enough sunbeds by the pool, one afternoon I saw an elderly couple being shown to two mats laid on the concrete as there were no sunbeds available! We were quite lucky and always managed to get beds.Everything you would expect was there, complimentary drinks by the pool, afternoon tea, nightly turndown, well appointed rooms and the service was generally very good if a little slow and lacking the refinement we'd found in Seminyak.We had our own car, which was really useful as the hotel is about 15 minutes out of town and the free shuttle only runs during the day. We loved Ubud and ate in some lovely restaurants, our favourite was Nomad, on the main road. We used the hotel as a base for exploring the area which worked well.We ate at the hotel twice. Once was a special Seafood BBQ, which was gorgeous and on the other occasion we booked a romantic dinner which was served in a candle lit open sided pavillion down by the river. That was pure heaven and we would thoroughly recommend it. It was so private and secluded, perfect for the last night of our honeymoon. We couldn't fault the food.Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Alila and it had everything you would expect from a top class hotel. However it felt small and lacked the refinement of our previous hotel. I lost track of the times we said 'it's not like the Samaya'. If we went back to Ubud we would probably stay somewhere else, the Alila didn't wow us enough for a return visit.
