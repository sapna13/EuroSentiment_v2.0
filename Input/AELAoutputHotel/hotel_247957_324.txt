{"text":"Stolen suitcase in just 15 minutes Upon arriving at the Occidental Grand Flamenco on Friday, July 13 and less than 15 minutes later, one of my two baggage, which contained about 3000.00 $ in belongings of my wife and mine, got lost.After two hours of waiting, a lady that posed as the manager (we later found out she wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ) informed us that the hotel personnel could not locate the suitcase. I asked to call the police but the fake manager saystold us that if I want to speak to the police √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√∂ should go to my room and mark the zero√à√\u2020\u2022?to call them myself. At that moment we realized we had made a very bad decision booking this hotel. Despite the situation, we decided to give the hotel personnel an opportunity to find our suitcase.On Saturday, July 14, One of the hotel employee took us to the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºogo Shop to get some clothes. Later that day, the security personnel indicated me that there were √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µossibilities√à√\u2020\u2022?that my suitcase was in the airport, but the next day Mr. Brea (the security manager) indicated me that the suitcase was not in the airport. I ask to call the police once again, and I was told by Mr. Brea that the police is not going to come to the hotel. In short, I ended up going to the police with Mr. Brea and other hotel personnel, the trip was at least 40 minutes in every direction.On Monday, the 16th of July, I finally get to talk to the hotel general manager, Mr. Puente which very kindly agrees to return me the money of my stay, invites me to a weekend back to the hotel and gives me access to the Royal Club. Also he assures me that my claim for the lost suitcase will be submitted to the hotel's insurance. Later that day I returned to the airport to verify if my suitcase is there at Mr. Puente's request. Surprisingly my suitcase was in the airport. After my suitcase appears and back to the hotel I received a call from Mr. Puente, in which he exempts the hotel of any fault, he indicates me that the personnel of the American Airlines assured him that the suitcase never left the airport and proceeds to ask me back for the clothes that the hotel had bought for my wife and for me.On Tuesday, the 17th of July, after returning the clothes the hotel √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µurchased√à√\u2020\u2022?for me and my wife, I received a message of which Mr. Brea stating that there were two t-shirts missing in the bundle that I returned. Of course after all this ordeal and having one day left on our vacations, I was very upset and I replied to Mr. Brea though one of the assistants, that this was our last day in the hotel and that I was not going lose one more time looking for two shirts, if this matter was so important, that he can let me know to give him the number of my credit card so he can charge them. Later Mr. Brea leaves a message where he says that I can forget about the matter.On Thursday, the 19th of July, before leaving Punta Cana, I stopped in the offices of AA and find out though one of the managers, that the suitcase was entered in the computer two day after my arrival and that there were no claims for a lost suitcase. In other words the accusations of Mr. Puente were unfounded because I did not take the wrong suitcase from the airport otherwise someone would have claimed as lost. I supposed that somebody from the hotel took my suitcase; load it in another taxi and my suitcase ended up in the airport. As you can see the service in this hotel is probably the worse I have seen, people are not trained to handle situations like the one we went through and in order to make themselves look good, they will place the blame of their lack of professionalism on you. In addition to this is worth saying that our room leaked every time it rained, the bathroom door did not close, the power would go out everyday and the air conditioner was inexistent. We booked through American Express Travel, which misrepresent this hotel as a 4 star. If you value your time off and your money, book somewhere else this is not a 4 star hotel and needless to say you wont be given a 4 star treatment, probably not even a 2.
