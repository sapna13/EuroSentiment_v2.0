{"text":"Great find in a great city This is a great budget hotel, a 2 min walk from the main train station F.S.M.N. When you come off the train, exit the station at the right hand exit. If you walk down a few steps and look to your right you will see the hotel signs. We had a triple room which had 4 beds and a table and chairs. The bathroom only had a shower, which was fine for us and the room and bathroom were cleaned every day. The hotel is on a main road, so if noise bothers you, ask for a room at the back of the hotel or take ear plugs. The breakfast selection was limited to cereals, toast, ham, cheese, scrambled eggs and pastries but all very tasty. All of the major attractions are within walking distance from the hotel. They will give you a great map when you check in. The hotel recommended a great restaurant within a 5 min walk and Za Za on Piazza del Mercato Centrale, 26r is well worth a visit. For those who love chocolate try Hemmingway, a cool little cafe\/bar at Piazza Piattellina 9r. It's worth taking the no 7 local bus to Fiesole, a beautiful village in the hills (only 25 mins on the bus). The bus stops are located on the main road leading to the Duomo. Buy your tickets at a newspaper stand before you board. Florence is a lovely city, and I would recommend visiting it out with the peak summer season.
