{"text":"Fantastic value I booked the Hotel Agon Opera after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and of course the price helped, this hotel is a fabulous bargain.I would liken it more to a BB however, it has no bar or restaurant, what it does though, it is very good at. A comfotable bed, a clean room with a safe, a hot shower with great pressure and the best locality in town, if these things are all that you need then book it. Be aware tea and coffee facilities are not provided.Getting to the Agon from Schonefeld is a dream, we bought our Welcome card from the newsagents in the arrivals hall, it cover all transport for 72 hours and comes complete with a discount book, we did use the coupons and probably saved almost as much as the cards original price, the price is 22 Euros. Once you have your card leave the terminal and look left, follow the covered walkway to the train station, about 3 minutes on foot, train RB14 from platform 7 or RB 7 from platform 5 both go to Zoolisgher Garten Station ( you will find yourself at Zoo station a lot during your break ) validate your ticket on the platform in the little red box, the 72 hours is valid from the time stamped, don't forget as checks are made. Once at Zoo station find your way out, there are several exits but head for the one with the bus stops outside, go to position 2 and wait for bus 110, the direction will be stated as Oskar-Helene-Heim, it is either the 3rd or 4th stop for Olivaer Platz, get off the bus, look across the Ku'Damm and the Agon Opera is opposite.We arrived 3 hours prior to the stated check-in time, our room was ready though and we were unpacked within an hour of the plane touching down.The Ku'Damm is a beautiful avenue to stroll down, it is home to the most expensive of designer shops, label lovers will really enjoy it, very close to the hotel are Cartier, Gucci, Louis Vuitton and a host of others. Exploration of the side streets close to the Agon Opera will reveal some excellent and reasonably priced restaurants, especially recommended is the Malaysian, come out of the hotel, cross the road and walk left ( uphill ) take the next right and then it sort of forks to the right, not far along, on the left is the restaurant, no English menu in the window but there is inside.
