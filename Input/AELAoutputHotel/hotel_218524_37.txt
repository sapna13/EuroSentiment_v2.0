{"text":"Excellante! We just got back yesterday from a one week stay at the Excellence Resort in Punta Cana. I had done my research online and found that with the exception of the food, there were almost 100% positive things that people had to say about this resort. It all lived up to be true. The resort was magical. My wife and I went with 2 friends of ours and were blown away. The pool and beach were spectacular. As tropical beach rooms go, the rooms were nicely appointed with an open feel. Bathtub in the room, shower in the bathroom, was a nice tough. The only negative thing I can say about this experience was the food. Even though at all the restaurants you ordered from menus, the food was prepared banquet style. What I mean by this is that it was not as hot and fresh as food would typically be that is prepared for you. If you are a person that typically eats in nice restaurants in cities like New York, San Francisco, etc... you will probably rate this food around a C+ or B-. Though I am not typically a buffet type person, I would highly recommend you go to their buffet for both Breakfast and Lunch. You will not be disappointed as they will prepare eggs, meats, pastas individually for you. Lastly on the food, steer clear of the Lobster House. It was the only restaurant that highly disappointed us. Every place else (the mexican, french, italian, etc..) provided the ambiance, a decent meal, wine, etc... for a very nice evening. Outside of the food, the resort and its people were truly amazing. We will definitely go back!This review was written by an ad agency executive who travels almost half the year in mostly big cities like LA, New York, Las Vegas and San Francisco. I am lucky enough to entertain clients in very fine restaurants and would probably be considered a food snob.
