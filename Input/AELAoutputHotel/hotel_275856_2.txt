{"text":"Some disappointments First the good part: Location was fantastic. Our windows literally looked directly at the Duomo. We walked to almost all the major sights on our list. Beautiful decor and appointments throughout. Our room very contemporary, the salon-breakfast room traditional. Buffet breakfast well stocked with coffee, tea, chocolate, pastries, breads, cheeses, yogurt, juices. Extra charge for eggs, etc. with which we did not bother. Notebook computer available in salon for guest use. All that was great, but given the challenges and disappointments we encountered, we would have been better off going elsewhere and saving quite a few Euros a night. My daughter and I were traveling together and wanted a two room suite so that each of us would have our own space. We were told that the Dome suite would work very nicely. The price of 500 Euros was steep, but we thought sharing the same suite and viewing the Dome from our suite would be great fun. To our surprise and disappointment, the two rooms were actually separated only by a curtain -- not our idea of a two room suite. Before booking we explained that I have a problem with stairs and were told that access to the suite from the elevator landing was up only 8 stairs. There were actually 15 stairs which doesn't sound like a big difference, but definitely was for me. The room got very warm, but when we asked that the air conditioning be turned on, we were told that only heat was available this time of year. When I suggested that at 500 Euros a night air conditioning should be possible, arrangements were finally made. There were ongoing communication problems with reception staff. We were told that two massages could not be scheduled simultaneously and so agreed to two separate massage times. When two therapists arrived with no prior notice to us that simultaneous massages were possible after all, my daughter had already left to assure privacy to me. Lesson learned: confirm all arrangements at least twice.
