{"text":"Better than ever, the Chedi Club goes from strength to strength It's always difficult going back to somewhere you've stayed and had a wonderful holiday, with a big question mark over whether it will be as good as your last visit, or the often fonder, more generous and sentimental memories you attach to a great holiday.From my many years of staying at five star hotels for work and leisure travel, one of the greatest frustrations is that the experience between one visit to a hotel and the next can be totally different. It seems consistency for many of the bigger or seemingly best hotels is hard to achieve.As it's not the cheapest hotel we've stayed at, we approached our return to the Chedi Club with some of those concerns in mind. Rest assured, after a week in the hotel (three nights in a spa villa, four in a pool villa), we judged our stay to be as good, maybe even better, than the last visit in March 2007. This is a hotel that achieves a consistent, high standard of service - always delivered with great warmth - that very few hotels seem to be able to deliver. While our butler, Arka, has moved on, many of the other staff are the same, in the restaurant, by the pool, or in the gift shop, and were as warm and welcoming as we remembered from last year. One very notable change is a new chef in the restaurant. Only a week and a half (at the time of our stay) into his new position, chef has already made a positive impact. If you're visiting, I highly recommend trying a new duck salad starter, or dessert trio (strawberry filled warm chocolate cake; vanilla bean icecream encircled in a deliciously thin layer of fresh chocolate biscuit; and strawberry soup). We were fortunate enough to be able to preview these, which I understand will be new additions to the menu, as while we both enjoy the Indonesian menu, some new additions to the international menu will be a very welcome addition.We initially wanted 7 nights in the pool villa. Due to high occupancy rates, this was not available, but the combination of three nights in a spa villa, inclusive of daily spa treatments, with four nights in the pool villa turned out to be a magic combination. I recommend asking for one of the pool villas overlooking the rice fields (numbered 5-9). If you're staying for an extended period, and don't mind a room move, the mix of spa and pool villas, is also recommended.One area I think there could be some improvement is with the butler's knowledge and ability to recommend art, craft, shopping or tour recommendations. Our butler this stay, while great in other regards, wasn't as knowledgeable in this important area as we would have liked.That said, we plan to return again next year.Other things to do:We did book a hotel car one day to visit the temple at Besaki, have lunch overlooking the volcano at Kintamani, and enjoy a coffee tasting at a nearby coffee plantation, and visit the terraced rice fields near Ubud. Highly recommended - especially with such an outstanding driver\/tour guide.Venturing outside the hotel to eat, I'd suggest (in Ubud) Mozaic, Nuri's Warung, or Terazo. All quite different experiences, but good. Try the martinis or cosmopolitans at Nuri's.
