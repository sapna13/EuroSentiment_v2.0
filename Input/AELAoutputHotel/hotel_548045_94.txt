{"text":"Great Expectations Being a luxury hotel junkie, I had to stay at the Four Seasons Hong Kong to try it out when I was there for a wedding. As Tripadvisor reviews were largely superlative in their praise for the hotel, I had great expectations.1. RoomsI loved the fact that the room was large by Hong Kong standards and the bathroom was fantastic! The flat screen TV in the bathroom and the rainshower were fabulous. The hotel had also provided his and her bath amenities. ( However, this did not quite compare with the Banyan Tree which gave personalised bathroom kits in a fabulous bag and it would be great if the Four Seasons could follow suit.)Unlike the Landmark Hong Kong, the windows were in the bedroom and not in the bathroom - no worries with privacy there! You could also draw open the curtains to read by light of day rather than slouching around without natural light.The noise insulation in the room was good. (I could not hear any traffic or corridor noise during my stay.)One nice touch was the complimentary tea and coffee facitilies offered by the Four Seasons. This is in contrast to other Four Seasons hotels I've stayed at in other parts of the world where you have had to pay for a pot of hot coffee.I would recommend paying slightly more for a harbour view room as the peak view rooms look onto the office buildings which made for a somewhat depressing urban view.2. ServiceThe check in and check out service was impressive. However, it was disappointing that I had to call three times to ask for my morning newspapers to be delivered before dashing off to work at 8am. Room service breakfast was also average. I had better breakfast downstairs in the Blu Bar which had wonderful pastries and fruit.The shuttle bus service to Airport Express is very convenient, but it is a shame that there was only one bus which meant that a guest had to wait for the bus to make its rounds. The bus queue was also not well managed (at the hotel end) by the doorman as a couple of guests queue-barged in front of me.The gym and the pool facilities were wonderful and the staff were very helpful! The gym overlooked the harbour with a view of Kowloon.3. There will always be a brideIt seems that Four Seasons Hong Kong is the chi-chi place to see and be seen for wedding dinners and lunches. Local society congregates here for celebrations, I spotted Stanley Lai and Richard Li while I was there; who knows who you might see?
