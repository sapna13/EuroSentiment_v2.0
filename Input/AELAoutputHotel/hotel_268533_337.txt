{"text":"Very good Pros and Cons--------------------Pros -------1. Great location - ideal for dinner,walks,transport etc etc2. Nice rooms - very comfy bed, Aveda toiletries, free wireless internet, funky bathrobes, nice trendy slippers ( ask reception for them - no charge ) , dvd\/cd player in room, super decor.3. Bell staff - very kind, polite, helpfull and infomative.4. Blue Mermaid restaurant - great breakfast, you can add it to your room bill.5. Free wine reception - between 5 and 6 each evening - very popular and decent wine.6. Housekeeping - rooms spotless and all toiletries and towells replenished every day. Also all of the housekeeping staff were very polite and would always welcome you in the corridor.7. Turnaround service available nightly on request with a nice chocolate on the pillow.Cons--------1. Rooms - ours was an inner courtyard view and hence you couldnt open the window or blinds as the people in the room opposite would be able to see what was going on in your room. Room also a little on the small side but not really a problem.2. Front desk staff - quite frankly were an utter waste of time - we were wanting to buy the bathrobes however they had no idea of sizes, designs and avaialbility ( at $120 each I want to know whats on offer ). We asked for a coffee machine on 3 occassions but it never arrived. We asked for a turndown service which only happened half way through our stay after requesting it again on 3 occassions. These guys and girls were pretty rude especially the guy who checked us in and was the ONLY person on the whole of our honeymoon roadtrip to the states not to make us feel special. Many of them also seemed to struggle to have a comprehension of the English language or more likely just couldnt be bothered to show any interest in your query.So to sum up - the only things that stopped this being a perfect experience can ba overcome by having a room with an outside view ( not inner courtyard ), and by ensuring your experiences with the front desk staff ( all others were lovely ) are restricted to check in and check out.We would definatly stay here again.
