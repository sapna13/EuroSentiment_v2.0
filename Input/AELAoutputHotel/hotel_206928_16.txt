{"text":"Solid 3* in a 5* location We are just back after spending 5 nights at the Citadines over New Years. Finding suitable European accommodations for a family of 4 (18months and 6 year old children) is never easy but the Citadines have been a saviour. We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe stayed at several and would rank the Barcelona location as a solid 3*. Great location with fabulous market and Starbucks 2min away. Room for the family to unwind and nice to be able to tuck the kids in and have a bottle of wine to wrap up the day. We walked to the zoo, aquarium and beach. Metro connections were also convenient. We found the staff very helpful and although the room was not cleaned daily we expected that. If we wanted the 5 Star treatment we could of squeezed into the Meridian across the road for twice the price (if they took the 4 of us in one room). When we arrived home we realized that we had left our 18month old√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ stuffed teddy bear in the room. You can imagine how traumatic this was. I emailed the hotel immediately and they replied the next day to say that housekeeping had found it next to the trash bin and assumed that it was rubbish so it was thrown out. Mistakes happen but the manager asked us to send a photo and other details. She promptly replied that although the Gund cat was not available in Europe they had ordered one from the US and shipped it directly to us. In my mind this was above and beyond the call of duty and a good indication of their attention to customer satisfaction. We will return! ","annotations":[]}
