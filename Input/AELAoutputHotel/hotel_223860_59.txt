{"text":"Great Experience!! We stayed @ the Desert Ridge from 10\/29-11\/2\/07  had a wonderful time. We have fallen in love with AZ  love it! We were treated with great respect  tremendous concern the entire time we were at Desert Ridge. The food was great! It is pricey, but part of it was convenience. It was great to order a burger by the pool  have it delivered. We wanted to treat ourselves  we certainly received it.Lots of Pros~nice room, great service, onsite free washer\/dryer (don't have to pack as much!)  lots of activities. I did the early morning walk @ the Spa, was very invigorating  fun. Not the desert walk as anticipated but fun. The Spa was great, pricey, but no more than any other Resort Spa. There is oncare childcare but I would not take children here, this is a resort for adults to enjoy, very peaceful.Cons~The only complaint was a problem with connecting with the internet. It is NOT FREE, but was free @ the SpringHill Suites that I stayed at the night before???? It also worked @ S.H.Suites! It did not work in my room @ D.R., IBAHN reps indicated it was my computer that needed an updated form of software. But it work on IBAHN at the S.H. Suites  not on IBAHN @ Desert Ridge. The D.R. has many conventions\/meetings. I think a real negative is the internet issue. You can't have the number of people in the hotel for business or otherwise  have internet problems.I also had additional charges on my bill. Because of this website, I checked my bill half way thru my stay  again the night before. I immediately contacted the desk  had the charges removed (phone calls, internet service, see above). Don't let this keep you from going to one of the most wonderful vacations I have ever had!!! The Desert Ridge is great!!!I would return in a heartbeat!!! Eat @ Roy's!! Put your feet up  enjoy!!
