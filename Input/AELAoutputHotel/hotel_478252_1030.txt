{"text":"Fantastic Hotel - Dont bother reading bad reviews from picky people My husband and I have stayed at many all inclusives before and I would like to say that I could not fault the hotel, beach, pool, food, grounds or otherwise. It really is truly lovely and worth every penny.However, I would like to make notes about the following:1. There are a lot of topless sunbathers. Bathing in this fashion is normally conducted by people who are either in their later years or who need some kind of attention. If this offends you please do not go to this hotel.2. People will continue to stump out cigarettes on the beach. This causes enourmous aggravation and being non smokers, there were times we were being hit by smoke from all directions. It is a shame that people do not look after the environment.3. I got pushed by 1 male guests as I was coming up the stairs to the bar on the beach, and one other male guest also cut me up in conversation with a member of the bar staff. This also caused me aggravation and I could not believe how rude these people were.Please note that the only negative comments I can make are from some of the guests themselves and NOT the hotel, whose service is second to none.I also seem to get tired reading a lot of the reviews about the americans putting the europeans down and vice versa in the reviews I read. Please remember to describe your experiences, you do not necessarily have to put down peoples nationalities. It can be quite offensive and also to put people in the same barrel is also quite short sighted.This hotel was brilliant. If you have the chance to see how people live in the Dom Rep, or go through Higuey, you will understand that these people could do no more in terms of everything that they do. It saddens me that people could complain about such silly little things. Remember this when you visit! ","annotations":[]}
