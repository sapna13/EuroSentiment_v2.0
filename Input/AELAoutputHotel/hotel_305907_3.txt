{"text":"Fantastic- 4-5 star level service, great value This hotel is up to the standards of any four star property in Asia (which is several steps above the equiviliant in the US or Europe). I frequently travel in the region, usually at high-end luxury properties. If there are two things I value most in any hotel, its uniqueness and flexibility. I hate generic chains, and this hotel is anything but. Its pure class, without being generic- little decorative touches make all the difference. The location is not central (although there is a metro only a 10 min indoor - through a mall- walk from your room), but I was here for a conference at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the location was perfect. Took only 25 min door to door, including the university shuttle bus. I stayed on the executive floor, which was definitely worth the relatively small upgrade price. Free breakfast in a private executive room, with at most 2-3 other people was a welcome respite from the chaos of the restaurant downstairs filled with mainlanders. Was also a nice place to wind down in the evening, with snacks that mitigated my need for dinner at all. The food was excellent, the fruit perfectly ripe (often wanna-be luxury hotels will hug the letter, not the spirit of luxury in things like this- providing fruit, but not checking the quality, etc). Fruit in my room. Drinks free from the minibar and available in the executive lounge across the hall all day\/night. Free internet included. Great views.This hotel excels in the details. Fabrics are rich and interesting, everything works perfectly, service is thoughtful but not intrusive.Biggest fluffiest pillows I have ever had! Tasteful and unique decor.Only downsides- the airport shuttle, although included in the price of my room, comes infrequently, and they lost my reservation on the way here. Just grab a cab- cheap and quick, especially after a long flight. The hot water was variable from the shower, which had a tendency to go from cool to scalding every 5 min or so, but was manageable once you got used to the tap. Room service food was not very good, but thats to be expected, even in the nicest places in Asia.One of the best values I have seen- US$160 for the executive room, with tax included. Book from the hotel or the website- its much cheaper.
