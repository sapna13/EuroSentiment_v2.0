{"text":"Awesome for a 1st trip Wow, where should a start.... it was our 1st trip ever for me and my boyfriend and we would go back in a heart beat.The staff is awesome, i have never seen people enjoy their job so much. They are always smiling and at your service.The buffet at the beach kind a sucks, its always the same thing every single day. But its really practical because you are right on the beach and you dont need to be dressep up, you can just go in your bathing suit. So thats pretty cool.The a la carte restaurant were pretty good we thought, we tried the Tex Mex, Mexican, The sea food place, and the very best one is La Cava'' the one we had included on our VIP package. We had the lobster and it was absolutely devine. And also its pretty much the only place that you can buy decent wine instead of the crapy house wine that they serve you and all the other restaurants.The resort is so well kept, they are always busy cleaning. Our room was on the top floor, which was nice cause we had the cathedral seiling. The fact that its an ''adult only'' resort is awesome, not that i dont like kids cause we have a daughter but its really nice to get away and be only with other adults.Anyway i am probably forgetting some stuff, but the main line is.....its awesome. If you have questions you can ask me.Ciao ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1143,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1139},{"endOffset":1143,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1139},{"endOffset":1143,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1139},{"endOffset":1143,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1139},{"endOffset":1143,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1139},{"endOffset":1143,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1139},{"endOffset":1143,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1139}]}
