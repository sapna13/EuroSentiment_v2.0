{"text":"Bavaro Experience We just have returned from Bavaro staying there during the week of December 12-19.What we liked: Grounds - well maintained Beach - is usually clean and well taken care of There are opportunities to take pictures with different animals like iguana, parrots, snake, monkeys (this was especially of interest to small kids).As the platinum guests we did use and liked the services of the Platinum lounge: free internet, nice drinks, relaxed atmosphere, massage, and other conveniences. This was a quite positive aspect of the vacation.To summarize the rest of the impressions:- Restaurants: we didn't like any of the a la carte restaurants at all.The only one I would recommend: El Pescador. The service and food were very good and deserved a tip. The rest of the restaurants surprised me with the lack of basic service or\/and not very tasteful food. Even the garment restaurant Liceys - had absolutely No concept of service. The food , when it finally arrived, was salty. We waited for the appetizers for at least 1.5 hours and were getting just smiles instead of food from some of the waiters when they had a minute to spare with us (and the rest of the empty tables in this place).Getting any drinks in the main buffet - was an interesting task. Sometimes it took 3 waiters to understand that we need one sprite drink; sometimes this still was not enough. Even appreciating that this resort doesn't have the automation\/technology foundation and eveyrthing is based on simple papers and writing down manual work, it is amazing how one person never knew what other wrote in the same notebook the first person was using.It absolutely felt like left hand doesn't have a clue what the right one does.While booking the restaraunt or having any agreement and discussion with one person, as soon as you would come 10 minutes after to continue the previous discussion - the next in a row would look a the same shared book\/notebook and would have No indication at all on the previous discussion.It meant that you would need to start your explanations\/orders\/reservations from ground zero like you have not done this before.Overall services in the resort I would rate as around 2-3 stars. The room service was always at the time when it was not convenient to us like they were just waiting for this moment. Finally we approached the Platinum lounge and specified the time for the room service. It helped probably just for one time.The shows were low quality with Spanish as the main language, not even a little attempt to have some translation into English.The kids club: no really kids activities, no English, nobody spent quality time with the kids and our kids were not impressed at all.Overall: it is a beautiful resort but I'm quite surprised with the services or lack of services on this property.Would I recommend this resort to anyone else: Nope.The concept of the fundamental services approach, when everything is supposed to be geared towards the client conveniences - is definitely a foreign concept in this resort.Again, if you come not from North America and are comfortable with this style of the services, you should be then fine here. If you do come from places like Canada , US where there are basic rules and standards already established: you may not be a very happy camper here!
