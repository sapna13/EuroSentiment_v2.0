{"text":"Beautiful Resort on the Outside My husband and I booked at the new section of the resort. I walked in the room, I saw a 1 person jacuzz that was a big turn off they need to state that on the website.Also there was mold in are room 9110. Major mosquitoe problem.And other bugs spiders, cockrocahes,flys. I think they were coming out of the floor drains, cracks. The room only had a prime job not a coat of paint on the walls. We had them spray are room about 4 times we needed a mosquitoe netting for are bed.Aso I originaly I had reservation at the edenh real arena and changed plans because of construction. It also was going on at the Bavaro Suites.About 8am to 8pm. I couldnt even take a nap because of the noise.No turn down service, No daily news breifs,No alarm clock,No big screen movies on the beach,No jet skis, No waiter service on the beach. No water Trampoline, A piano bar with no piano. The restuarnt alacarte reservation desk was a joke. Did not get 1 time that we wanted all week. We were told come back the next day .Also I realize its a tropical place but they had a RAT PROBLEM . I ALSO SAW A COCKROACH ON THE MAIN BUFFET. I also fill I would of been better off taking the run of the house room. My freind was happy with here cheaper room. Now the good part of the vacation the beach the weather the ocean was wonderful. The waiter service was great the drinks were strong,flowers were beautiful. The water sport guys did a wonderful job. Entertainment staff did a great job'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''.I would go back to punta cana again. The main problem room did not get what you pay for. Reservations for ALACARTE DINNING. Also pools were clean public restrooms , beach , hotel grounds,I would like to have drinks garnish more with fresh fruit.I am planning on going back to punta cana because I thought the people are very freindly.THE WEATHER WAS GREAT:::::::::::::::::::::: April 5th to 12th.
