{"text":"Not to be recommended if you have a choice I was booked into this hotel by my company while staying in Tokyo on business. I was moved here from the Radisson because the Shiba Park is only a few minutes' walk from our office. In many ways I wish I had insisted on staying at the Radisson, and put up with the additional travel.The good points: the room was very clean with a comfortable bed. And that's about all.The bad points: although the reception area promises at least a reasonable experience, the room itself didn't live up to my expectations. It was very old fashioned and appeared to have been built perhaps in the 1970s and never refurbished since then. Everything about it said tired and old.This was a single room, but even so the bathroom was tiny, cheaply decorated and some of the fittings were in serious need of renewal.There was very little storage space: three small drawers and a fixture on the wall which was supposed to serve as a wardrobe; it is simply insufficient for a week's business stay anywhere in the world.I didn't use the hotel's restaurants. I did however take breakfast every day of my stay and that also left much to be desired. There was no fresh fruit at all, only the tinned variety in syrup offering a morning sugar overload. The coffee was rough and bitter. The choice of pastries was meagre and unreliable, i.e. different every day (perhaps that was a deliberate policy?)To summarise I would avoid this hotel if you can. There are much better ones in the area (as some of my colleagues know!)
