{"text":"Great place to stay I stayed here with my husband for five nights on a trip that started out as a family visit, but quickly became a business trip as well. This hotel was perfect for both. Staff were very welcoming at check in and extremely helpful throughout our stay.The rooms are spacious, the beds large and comfortable, there is plenty of hanging and storage space and the bathrooms are huge and very well appointed (exactly like the Four Seasons in New York if you know that one). We booked at a very reasonable rate through booking.com.The location is convenient, easy walking distance from the CN Tower and lots of shopping, but not right in the middle of things so the street is quiet and it's a good location to pick up a cab and easy for cars to wait there.Last Monday morning, with no notice at all, the Business Centre (thank you again, Carmen) accepted two large documents by email and printed out four colour copies in minutes, delivering them in record time. This is the best and most efficient service I have ever had from a hotel business centre anywhere in the world.If I have any gripes it is that the bakery (the informal restaurant) is a little small and feels very exposed with glass walls on two sides. They really must buy new teapots - if you order tea there there is no way of avoiding having most of it on the table!If I ever return to Toronto, I will definitely stay in the Soho Metropolitan.
