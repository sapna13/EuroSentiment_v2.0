{"text":"Loved the Melia Caribe Tropical I went to this resort with my 12 year old daughter, also my eldest daughter who celebrated her 30th birthday there, her partner and their two children ages 3 and 5. We were a bit worried about all the negative reviews that we read before we went, and we should not have worried. We stayed at the resort from the 8th til the 22nd Dec. and we had a great time. We left London, Gatwick with First Choice flying Premier Class which was GREAT definley doing Premier again. We had booked Royal Service at the resort, so okay the rooms are not great, but the service was BRILLIANT we had two enjoining suites the people could not do enough for us The food was Excellent we tried all of the resteraunts except the japanese as that was closed.We enjoyed the Gabi that was our favorite also the Thai. My daughters 30th Birthday was wicked the people at the Gabi made it very special for her and the Birhtday cake was lovely.The Royal Service have their own Lounge which has free internet also nibbles and drinks throughout the day and the people there could not do enough for you. The childrens entertainment team were good and also the entertainment at night was very good. There was special touches at the Royal Service like the small hand towels in the washrooms, the lovely smell of oils in the Gabi, and the pool area I like the fact that Royal Service have their own pool and part of the beach., and their own resteraunt.Our butler Manny was great he ran a nice bath for us with oils and flowers, and turned our beds down in the evening. Room service was great maid service was every day and that also was great , The people are very friendly, and we would all go back again ","annotations":[{"endOffset":934,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":930},{"endOffset":1489,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1485}]}
