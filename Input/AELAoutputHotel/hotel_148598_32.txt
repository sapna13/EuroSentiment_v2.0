{"text":"nothing to bring us back We were glad we read the reviews before we went to PR and signed up for the Wyndham rewards. The outside grounds and pool areas were beautiful and clean at all times. The inside of the hotel was sooo cold and the rooms were average. We had an ocean view. Many people had trouble with their room cards and trying to unlock their doors.One time we made 3 trips down to front desk until it worked. Then later in the week, the cards failed again.The cappucino colored sand beach was semi-clean ( a lot of straws and buried cups) right in front of the main entrance to the beach but a short distance (yards away) it was very dirty with vegetative debris, broken glass, washed up pots and pans, a guitar, a snorkel and mask and latex gloves. The hotel rented water sports equipment in this area.There is a sign as you enter the sand that you are off hotel property and there are no lifeguards on duty. A local man, 29 yrs old,drowned in that area as we arrived. His pregnant fiance was saved but some people we talked to who were there said there was not much effort made to save him. Be careful in the water. It is the Atlantic Ocean and there are jellyfish, also.The rainforest is gorgeous. Depending on how you walk to the falls, the path is very narrow (16-18). It is paved but if you walk down the river trail, it is steep and slippery with moisture and moss. Our guide told us he has fallen in every type of shoe he has worn. Leaving the falls and going the same direction, the path was dry and uphill. We had more time to look around and not worry about our footing.Book your kayak trip to the bioluminescent bay through the concierge. The price is the same as doing it on your own and you have very reliable guides(5 of them) and they are very concerned with your safety. Water is not deep most of the way but it really is dark. The experience is wonderful.The food we had was very average. Chicken pot pie and meatloaf on a menu at the hotel left us scratching our heads. Were we in PR? Our meal at the Italian restaurant at the hotel was 5 star. All other food, including our meal at Richie's was just ok.
