{"text":"Nice resort, but there are a few things to be aware of ... The reviews on Tripadvisor played the key role in my selecting the Ib. Bavaro, so upon my return I decided to contribute as well.I sent the resort an e-mail about a week before arrival asking for a newly refurbished room, with a king size bed, and close to the beach and pool. I was actually surprised when upon arrival, this is exactly the room that they had ready for us and even referred to my e-mail! The front desk people were very nice, spoke good English and had us checked in in less than 5 minutes. The resort itself is very nice - you almost feel like you are in a tropical paradise. The room was excellent - felt new, was very clean, no smells of any kind, the AC worked well, and the bathroom was excellent. The pool, however, could use a face lift. The paint on the bottom is missing in a number of places and it just does not look that great.The beach was excellent - lots of palapas (never a need to reserve in advance), nice white sand. The water, however, was very dirty - lots of garbage floating (plastic bags, etc.) and lots of sea weeds. Coulld be the time of the year, I do not know.The food was fairly good as well, especially for an all inclusive resort. However, you are only allowed to make 3 reservations (if you are staying for 7 nights) for the specialty restaurants. We went to the French, Mediterranean and Japanese. We liked the first two, but Japanese was very weak (for someone from New York), and the service was bad. The buffett itself was great on most nights. It was impossible to get into the specialty restaurants for the other nights. They tell you to call and check on cancellations, but each time I called there were none. Yet, when we went to our restaurants, they were half empty. This I simply do not understand. Also, they only had two specialty restaurants open each night.The evening shows were pretty bad. A few were funny (where they made use of the guests), but others (where they actually tried to put on a show) were terrible and we walked out in the middle of many. Service can definitely be improved. They are way too laid back. On the day of out check out, I called and asked for the bags to be picked up and no one ever showed up. Overall - decent resort to go to, good food, nice beach and OK service. Could be much better though. Personally, I will not return there.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
