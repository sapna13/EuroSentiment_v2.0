{"text":"Clean comfortable well located base in HK I stayed at the Novotel for 5 nights during a business trip to Hong Kong. I was attending a conference at the Hong Kong convention centre. The novotel provided a great base for doing this, there is an elevated, covered walkway starting across the street from the hotel that takes you straight to the convention centre (10min walk) past shops, an asian supermarket, bars, restaurants and banks. The walkway also takes you to the ferry terminal where you can catch the ferry to the other side of HK harbour and the shops in Kowloon The hotel is in wanchai which seemd a safe neighbourhood, there are some shops close buy and the wanchai computer centre ( a 3 storey hive of small cellphone, computer and electronic shops) is close by if you are looking for a new gadget ( but make sure you buy from someone offering an international warranty if making a large purchase). At night parts of wanchai seem a bit seedy and there did seem to be a few undesirable bars and nightclubs open up in the evening but this is typical of any large city and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really put me off the hotel or the location. We got a taxi to Soho where the restaurants and bars are a bit more trendy. (Taxis in HK are VERY cheap in the city centre) The hotel itself was clean, the staff were helpful and the room was a standard well presented Novotel style room, double room with two very comfortable single beds, flat scrren LCD TV, desk with wired broadband (no Wifi in room), clean bathroom and AC. Most of the double rooms in HK seem to consist of 2 single beds so if you want a double bed you should make sure you specify this at the time of booking. The hotel restaurant served a reasonably priced breakfast with a combination of western and asian buffet and cooked to order selections. My only real critisism was the baggage storage facility while I was waiting to checkin for my room and after checkout while waiting for the bus to the airport, which consisted of tying the left luggage together with rope and leaving them in the main foyer √à√\u2020\u2022?this needs to be worked on. In all a good hotel and I would recommend it and I would stay there again for a business or holiday trip. ","annotations":[]}
