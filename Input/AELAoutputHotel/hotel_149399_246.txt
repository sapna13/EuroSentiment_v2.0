{"text":"Relaxation at it's finest! My husband and I (and best friend and her husband) went to Melia Caribe Tropical in December of 2007 to celebrate our 40th birthdays. It was fantastic and exactly what we were looking for.First of all, upgrade to Royal Service. It was the best $300 investment I ever made. Royal Service gives you nicer rooms, a nicer pool, better alcohol and first choice for restaurant reservations. The pool for Royal Service was not crowded at all. It has large beds under huts right next to the pool. The pool even has covered lounge areas in the pool. The drinks were fantastic and top shelf alcohol was available upon request.I would not recommend the spa. It was less than relaxing, very noisy, not very clean. They have two spas so if you get a package, you do part of the package at one location then go to the other location for the remainder of the package. The restaurants are great. We especially enjoyed the Japanese restaurant. The room was very spacious and clean. We did have to call twice for assistance in repairing our air conditioning but they did come fix it and left two CROSS wallets on our bed with an apology letter. Don't pay for the wireless internet. The only place you can get wireless is near the computer stations. We could not get wireless to work by the pools or in our rooms. The Royal Service lounge does have 2 computers with 20 minutes of free internet a day. The resort is an open air resort. It was amazing to me at how clean the resort was being an open air resort. We found it beautiful. The staff was very friendly. They were willing to help in any way. We did find they would accept tipping but did not act as though it were required. We can't wait to go back and take the kids too. They had an amazing high and low ropes course that the kids would love. They had trams to take you through the resort as it was huge. Our room was a long way from the beach but we spent most time at the beautiful pool anyway. ","annotations":[]}
