{"text":"the magic almost defies description Chedi Tanah, Ubud, what can we say, the magic almost defies description, exclusive Bali (especially for those who don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ware their luggage!)  If you want to experience pure Balinese luxury look no further √à√\u2020\u2022?Chedi club is intimate, private and gorgeously chic √à√\u2020\u2022?the same quality one would expect from Amman or 4 Seasons with out the price tag. An exquisite private estate resting smack bang on the edge of working rice paddy fields. The views tranquil and soothing are best captured at sun set sinking a cocktail or we felt, even better, a guided tour down through the paddy fields and back up through one of the local villages √à√\u2020\u2022?take your camera for amazing photos that look like they come straight out of national geographic.The Chedi Club is definitely value for money there is so much included for instance- free mini bar, laundry, daily American breakfast in suite\/ villa or the restaurant, limo service to Ubud, yoga, afternoon tea, happy hour, transfer to and from airport, butler service (with pool villa) We had pool villa No.9 situated on the corner of 2 paddy fields, it was so peaceful the only sounds were that of the wind chimes and the lady cooing the birds away√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®?totally magical. Our Butler could not go unmentioned, Suewena was 1st class he made our holiday at Chedi seamless and special√à√\u2020\u2022?from booking restaurants, spa treatments, bring tea, arranging tours, general knowledge of the local area to tidying our villa that looked like a cyclone had hit every morning. The main pool is serene and landscaped in Balinese surroundings, it made a nice break form our private villa - you could happily survive without a private pool√à√\u2020\u2022?If you had to√à√\u2020\u2022?We believe we had the ideal combination, four days in Chedi Ubud relaxing and totally chilling then we transferred for a few days of funky chic at the Legian on the beach, two completely different experiences but made for the perfect holiday. If you like Chedi Muscat you will love these two other hotels √à√\u2020\u2022?GHM have the mix just right its affordable luxury that has managed to capture the spirit of the culture in each hotel making each one an experience but with the same service and quality you come to expect. This is our 3rd Chedi experience and we are just wondering where will be out 4th. One small word of warning on smart hotels in Bali √à√\u2020\u2022?wine from the near by Australia √à√\u2020\u2022?not to mention France or US seems to cost a fortune √à√\u2020\u2022?if you like fine wine √à√\u2020\u2022?bring a few of your own.
