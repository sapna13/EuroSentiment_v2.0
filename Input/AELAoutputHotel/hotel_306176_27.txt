{"text":"Average Hotel but Above average Service The Grand Plaza Park Hotel is in a very good location if you're in Singapore for shopping because it is just outside the Funan IT Mall, very near the Suntec Mall and Marina Square and is across the City Hall MRT station -- where you can get on the MRT and in ten minutes you're in Orchard Road for more shopping. Also, it's just a hop and a skip to the smaller Raffles City Mall where there's a great mix of brand name stores.Unfortunately, I can't bring myself to rave about the hotel facilities as I found the rooms and the amenities to be much less than what I had expected for the price they charged. The room was small and quite worn down (with a large and scary stain on the carpet). The furniture really needed to be changed and the beds were not too comfortable. The business facilities were much better. The function rooms were very nice, high ceiling, spacious and very conducive for meetings. Service though was very warm, attentive, efficient. All staff had a professional yet welcoming air. I was impressed with check in and check out service as it was conducted with great speed and courtesy. Doormen and bellhop service also very efficient and on the night I checked out, which was quite late, the doorman had to go out and secure a cab for me on the main road -- everything was done with great service. I was quite impressed.I give the hotel top marks for service but they do need a major renovation.
