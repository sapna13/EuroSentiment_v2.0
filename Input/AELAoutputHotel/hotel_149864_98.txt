{"text":"Great time!!  We just returned from a week at this resort and wanted to share some of our thoughts. The resort is located on a beautiful, private stretch of beach and the hotel had a very friendly welcoming atmosphere to it. Our family has been to several resorts throughout the Caribbean and this was by far the best if you're looking for activites for your kids. I have two boys, 12 and 17. My 12 year old absolutely loved this place. He spent all of his waking hours with his new friends and GO's(who are terrific)and participated in every activity. He showed up everyday in late afternoon for a shower and I would have to drag him back to our room at night so I could go to bed. My 17 year old only participated in the activities that interested him and spent most of his time at the beach with us. Our hotel room wasn't anything to write home about but it was clean, and I would definitly advise you to get a room with a balcony otherwise anything wet doesn't have a chance to dryout. The shows were performed by the GO's and 'painful to watch' doesn't begin to describe it. Some nights were just brutal. However we really enjoyed the 'Circus' show and the 'Kid's Night.' The food was pretty good and there was always a huge variety to please everyone. We met people from all over the world but the majority were from France or Quebec, Canada. Unfortunately we left with an unfavourable impression of French speaking people. The ones we encountered were rude and arrogant or just plain thoughtless. (I'm sure others would have something more positive to say.)Overal this is a great family resort that is warm and friendly. The staff and GO's really go out of their way to make this place a comfortable and relaxing holiday. ","annotations":[]}
