{"text":"Bygone glamor I've stayed here before, but not for at least 8 years. The hotel has become drab, run-down, with staff who seem a bit pretentious and a concierge who was impatient and unhelpful. When you enter the hotel, the lobby is just sad -- not a lot of furniture, rather bare bones, and nothing welcoming or cheerful. Elevators in different areas of the hotel, some in rather unusual locations (and not pretty). The room I had was large with a good desk and working area. The beds were mediocre -- mattresses seem worn, but comforters are lovely. I had good closet space and nice furniture. Lighting in room could be better. Some things seemed to be updated in the room, but others, such as the torn wall paper, were not. The bathroom was old, with mint green tile from another era. The toilet in the bathroom was in its own stall -- rather strange, but practical if you're sharing with someone you don't know well. Water pressure was terrible and the temperature control was non-existent so it was easy to scald yourself when taking a shower -- putting the water even on lukewarm could vary to scalding without warning. The handheld shower was attached to the hose strangely so that it is inevitable that the hose hits you or rests on you as you hold the showerhead. Cleaning of rooms is poor for this level hotel (hair on bathroom floor after cleaning, cup used for tea not cleaned). Amenities are many in addition to the standard shampoo and gel -- they add toothbrush, razor, bath sponge, comb -- but the quality is fair. The very small soaps made me go out to buy a decent bar of soap that doesn't disappear so quickly (especially if you want to wash out any clothes). Wireless internet in rooms is good but expensive at 22Euro (about $29) for 1 day. Small safe in room. Minibar is bizarre -- if you move anything in it, you are charged for the item. You have to inform the desk if you have moved any items so that they do not charge you if you didn't use the item.Great location! Could not be more central - right on the central square (Dam). You can walk to almost everything. For the money, I'd rather go elsewhere next time. This was the grande dame of hotels in Amsterdam -- I'm afraid her glory days are long behind her. I am sure you can do better.
