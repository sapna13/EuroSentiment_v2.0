{"text":"Best of 3 5-star hotels I stayed at in Italy A recent trip to Italy was the first time for me in Europe, and this was not only the best hotel of the three that we stayed at, but as good as (or better than) any Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, or Peninsula in the U.S. We stayed at the Bauer Il Palazzo in Venice and the Grand Hotel Parco dei Principei in Rome, and this place greatly outclassed both of those. The staff was excellent, and unlike most 5-star hotels, I didn't get the feeling they were acting nice because it is an expensive hotel, they seemed to genuinely like their jobs. The rooms, although slightly on the small size, were in great shape and well appointed, with excellent views (our party had five rooms). The location is probably the best in Firenze (that sounds so much better than Florence), close to the major attractions and great to walk around and reach little restaurants on side streets, and on the lively Piazza del Repubblica. The food in the hotel was excellent - our biggest mistake in Firenze was eating at one of the restaurants facing the Savoy on the square the day we arrived - the food at the Savoy was sooo much better.The bar was even great. I was shocked that a bar in Italy would know how to make a perfect Margarita, and not use cheap Tequila (their local wine list was good also).There's alot for us to see in Europe, but I really want to return to the Savoy soon.
