{"text":"Loved Hotel Fita My husband and I had one of the large rooms with a little sitting area that looks out over the schoolyard across the street.We had a king-size bed with two twin-sized duvets beneath a king-size bedspread--not standard U.S. practice. But based on our experiences during the previous two weeks driving around Germany and Switzerland, putting two twin-sized duvets on a double bed was standard at all the BBs we stayed at. This was also the case in the private home of our German host couple.We felt that the room was always well cleaned. During a 6-day stay, the only comment we would make is that it took two days for wine glasses to be removed from the room. Now, you should also know how the wine glasses got there: One of the staff members brought us wine and nuts on our first night because we arrived late in the evening like basket cases after a six-hour drive from Germany that should have taken three hours. Adriaan took great pity on us and brought up that little treat, which was so, so welcome.We met the owner and, as a very hearty Dutchman, he can definitely seem a bit larger than life. But he was perfectly pleasant and very helpful. Now let me tell you more wonderful things about Hotel Fita: a friendly staff that is there to please you; free use of a computer for Internet access just outside the breakfast room; free--yes, free--laundry service (can you imagine how wonderful that was for us after traveling for two weeks?); a lovely buffet breakfast; steps from the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum, and well-located for walking anywhere in the Centrum; and a resident wire-haired dachshund named Bella who will cheer all guests who are missing their pups at home.In our opinion, you can't go wrong with Hotel Fita.
