{"text":"Amazing serivce and beautiful hotel This hotel was everything that it promised to be, and more. The location is fantastic, right around the corner from Grand Central Station. It is situated in a beautiful brownstone building on the corner of Madison and 41st, and the interior is just as elegant as it look on the website. The second floor lounge is a great place to relax after a hard day, the hotel provides free wine and cheese there every evening from 5 - 8pm and you can just grab a good book, rest your feet and enjoy the surprsingly good wine and prosecco on offer. Breakfast is also served in the second floor lounge and is quite basic, but certainly does the job - especially in city where most hotels are room only. There is a good choice of cereals, bagels, buns, pastries, sweet or savoury spreads, eggs, delicious fruit salad, juices, and different flavours of tea and coffee. We requested the room that we wanted in advance and were told that staff cannot promise any particular rooms in advance - however, we were lucky and got our first choice anyway. As most other reviews have pointed out the rooms here are tiny, but they are perfectly formed and very comfortable. We were on the 9th floor and you could hear traffic noise, but this is a small boutique hotel in New York City, you expect to hear some noise and the benefits more than make up for the small room and the traffic noise.Perhaps the greatest asset of this hotel are the staff, they booked restaurants and attraction tickets for us, nothing was too much trouble. Everyone was so friendly and helpful and gave a very personal service. We would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to anyone visiting New York. A general tip for getting around in New York, don't be afraid to use the Subway, especially staying so close to Grand Central. It was much easier and cleaner than we expected and at $24 for a week pass it was by far the best way to get around. In the evenings we caught cabs everywhere - but they are also much cheaper than we expected and easy to just flag down (but make sure you know the address of anywhere you are going - not one driver we had could have got to restaurant just on its name) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":767,"mention":"bagels","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bagel"],"startOffset":761},{"endOffset":773,"mention":"buns","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bun"],"startOffset":769},{"endOffset":783,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":775},{"endOffset":838,"mention":"fruit salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fruit_salad"],"startOffset":827},{"endOffset":877,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":874},{"endOffset":888,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":882}]}
