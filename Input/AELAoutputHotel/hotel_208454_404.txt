{"text":"chic stylish hotel with brilliant location Location is brilliant , in between 5th and 6th avenvue on 44th Street , 1 block to Times Square(2 minutes) , 10 minutes up to central park  saks \/ bloomingdales and 10 minutes down to empire state's building and Macys. The Hotel is very stylish and chic , not a theme park hotel like the Marriott times square. We arrived at 3am after a 5hour delay on Virgin atlantic flights in Heathrow to be shown to a 3rd floor King deluxe room , The room had no view  was very noisey as next to hotels airconditioning system , we stayed that night as we were knackered but at 8am the next morning they arranged to move us to 18th Floor deluxe king whilst we were out sight seeing. Sounds so silly and i can't beleive i am writing this but The beds  pillows are so comfortable,.The Gaby bar is nice but very very expensive we got a glass of wine each free with our Sofitel privelgde card welcome drinks voucher and liked the atmosphere so decided to order another wine each, but got a bit of a shock at the bill which was √ä√£¬¢20 for 2 glasses of wine . but hey this is a top end hotel in New York !!Amazing steak's at Del Frescos steakhouse around the corner on 49th Street which was recommended and booked by concerige at the hotel . Truely AMAZING!!!! 12oz fillet highly recommended , the following night we cancelled our reservation at the high end stuffy restaurant of the moment Craft after just 3 minutes in there to go back to Del Fresco. Concerige also told us about 2 diners for Breakfast brooklyn dinner around the corner and Red Flame  on the same street both very good , very cheap and very very flling!!I Would definatley recommend this as a top end Chic stylish quiet hotel, It is worth spending the extra √ä√£¬¢100 over a 3 days stay compared to the other Chain hotel, Enjoy ","annotations":[{"endOffset":321,"mention":"park hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":311}]}
