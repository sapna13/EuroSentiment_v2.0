{"text":"Great Time - Good Deal Left on Feb 28 and home on Mar 6. Wishing that the white stuff falling now was Saona Island sand.Booked trip on a Tuesday and left on Thursday. Great deal. Very good value for your money. We just wanted a fast and cheaper get away and were pleasantly surprised.Beach was awesome. Sufficient lounge chairs and when we couldn't find one, did not hesitate to sit in the sand. One side of the beach is quieter than the other.Room (we were in the 3600 block) was extremely clean. Pleasant and efficient maids. Showers were the best. Always hot water and lots of water pressure. Lighting was no problem. (Last year we brought our own light bulbs). Flatscreen TV with lots to watch. Mattress was hard but we weren't bothered. See Reception for key to wall safe.Meals....average food in the buffet. Always found something we liked. Try the pizza by the pool. We also found an abundance of impatient people. Somehow manners seem to fall to the wayside when food and drinks are involved. Our patience pervailed just the same. Be prepared to rise above.Drinks were plentiful. Only domestic labels. $7 buys you premium brands. We are beer drinkers and loved the Brahma. Poured from bottles. We bought beer from duty free to keep in the hotel fridge. The IFA has 3 pools. One closet to the beach very quiet. The animated pool right outside our door and was tons o' fun. Make a point to find the jacuzzi's. They are located by the villas.Our tour rep failed to tell us about the purchase of phone cards. We learned this last year. Cheap way to call home. Go to the Pharmacy and ask to purchase a card. We paid $4 to talk for 12 minutes. Plenty of time to check in. You can call from your room phone. Just dial 0 and you can get instructions in english.We did the Saona Island day trip. Beautiful is all we can say. We also paid $30 each extra for lobster. Not worth it.Bring your own beach towel if room permits. $20 if you lose hotel towel (and we did!). Thermos for your drinks are also great to bring along. We tipped but doesn't seem to matter. Bring lots of US dollar bills.All in all very pleasantly surprised by the 3.5 star property. Hope this review wasnt too long. Just wanted to share the small things that helped us.
