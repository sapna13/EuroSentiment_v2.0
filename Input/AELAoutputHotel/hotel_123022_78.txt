{"text":"Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even think about staying here unless you have a car. After reading all the reviews about this hotel I booked it straight away for a weekend stay in Seattle. I was really expecting something wonderful but really the hotel is just ok. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ nothing special. Breakfast is waffles, bagels, bread and cereal - nothing to get particularly excited about there. The free coffee is handy enough but really who gets that bothered about spending a couple of dollars on coffee during their holidays.As we discovered Seattle is not one of those cities that is nice to walk around. The hotel actually looks quite near to the Space Needle but when we tried to walk there the route really looks like some sort of demilitarised zone, with no other pedestrians, four lane highways, pavements with weeds growing out of the cracks and rundown businesses. My visions of a nice stroll to downtown Seattle sadly came to nothing. If you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a car don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stay here, stay downtown. I spent extra on an upgrade for a view of the lake but the lake is really not that stunning so it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ really not worth spending any extra on that. The shuttle is handy but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ recommended that you book in advance and if you are downtown you have to wait for them to pick you up. As we preferred to do things on the spur of the moment we ended up getting taxis most of the time (there is a regular city bus service which runs past the hotel but I would definitely not recommend this after dark). Basically this is just a regular 3 star hotel in a not very nice location. The free internet was handy (especially when we tried to rearrange our flights to see if we could leave Seattle early). The rooms are standard 3 star rooms, absolutely nothing fancy in the way of decoration, however in our upgraded lake view room the bathroom was so small that the sink was in the bedroom and there was no wardrobe - just a space with a rail and some hangers. Reception constantly stank of disinfectant. I always spend a long time on Trip Advisor booking hotels before I go away and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ never been wrong √à√\u2020\u2022?until now. For the money I spent (including the taxis) I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ sure I could have found a deal in a much higher standard 4 star hotel downtown.
