{"text":"Disappointed --- Not a 5-star hotel at all The Bilderberg Garden Hotel is located in a lovely neighborhood to the south of central Amsterdam, within a 10 minute walk of the Van Gogh Museum and the Rijksmuseum. It is a pleasant location with lots of greenery, set among beautiful houses, lovely shops nearby, and canals to explore. The hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ brochures and website information describe the area of the hotel quite accurately. However, it is over-rated as a 5-star hotel and over-priced. Most of the rooms look like a typical 3-star hotel would look in the US with similarly modest furnishings. The room we stayed in was rather worn-out and needed updating, carpet-cleaning, etc. Staff at the desk were polite but not well-informed and not especially helpful. There is a rather spartan √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√®usiness Center√à√\u2020\u2022?consisting of 2 computers and a printer in the hallway of the lower level of the hotel. There is no Fitness Center or pool. Several guidebooks described this hotel as a top-level hotel with beautiful furnishings, etc. Maybe this is true of selected rooms, but it seems that most rooms are not like this at all. Beware √à√\u2020\u2022?guidebooks say that rooms have Jacuzzis. This is not the case for the average room here. One guidebook called the Lobby √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºpectacular.√à√\u2020\u2022?We thought it was rather small and darkly lit --- not very inviting at all. We felt ripped off by the high prices of this place and left after 2 nights to move to a real 5-star hotel in the center of Amsterdam. We are not sure why the guidebooks have gone so far wrong on this place. Unless you stay in the very top-level rooms, you will not find this to be a 5-star hotel. If you want a quiet and pleasant suburban location, walking distance to the big museums, and a rather unspectacular and somewhat over-priced hotel, this is it. ","annotations":[]}
