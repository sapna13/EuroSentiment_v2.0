{"text":"Hotel Stay Let Down By Sloppy Mistake As a surprise start to our stay at the Sofitel New York my father had arranged with the hotel for a bottle of champagne (paid for by him) to be in our room on arrival. The champagne, in an ice bucket with glasses, was in the room but the housekeeping staff had forgotten to leave the note he had requested explaining who it was from. So, suspecting that the champagne was not complimentary and with no idea to the contrary, we left it unopened where we found it and there it stayed for the week of our stay and that was how it was left on our departure. Bizarrely, although housekeeping were (obviously) in our room on a regular basis, no one thought to enquire why we hadn't enjoyed our bottle of champagne. Confirming our thoughts, of course, that it wasn't complimentary. You can imagine our disappointment on our arrival back in the UK to discover we could have enjoyed that bottle of champagne - at any time during our stay! On phoning the hotel, guest relations apologised (as one might hope) and said they would refund my father the cost of the bottle of champagne - the least they could do! However, that could not change the fact that we'd missed out on what would have been a lovely start to our holiday. Also, on check in at the hotel, I was told my credit card would be charged $700 at that time for those additional services (mini-bar, telephone calls etc) that we might use during our stay. I said I did not object to paying for these things after our stay, clearly, but thought it unacceptable that my card would be charged in advance for services I might not use. Because of my objection, the 'pre-charge' was revised to $300 but it was not the best start to our stay. In the event, we ended up only making $15 worth of phone calls which I paid for in cash. These two experiences let down a stay at what was otherwise a pleasant and comfortable hotel. ","annotations":[]}
