{"text":"A n Enjoyable Christmas Break 5 Days of Christmas We have just returned from a Christmas Break in Berlin. Our Hotel, Argon Opera, so called because all the rooms are named after an Opera, as more than we had expected. Located in Olivaer Platz, Kurfustendam, it had excellent transport connections that easily took you to every part of the city. Bus 109, and others , stopped outside the Hotel door, taking you to Zoo Station, linking up with the S  U bahns. For travel to and from Tegel Airport, take the 10 minute service of bus 109 to Olivaer Platz ,which is announced on the bus, (2.3 euros - a taxi costs about 25 euros The hotel was clean, the staff friendly and very helpful. The breakfast was plentiful and good, many different cereals, meats, breads, cheeses, scrambled and boiled eggs, fruit juices, fruit and cake - 'fill your boots'. The breakfast room is on the 6th floor overlooking Ku'damm. We stayed in room 107, a large room overlooking the street, but very good double-glazing cut out all the traffic noise. We were also fortunate that the room also had a well equipped disabled shower room and toilet in addition to the en-suite facilities ------ no waiting to use the bathroom. For getting around on the easy to use public transport, a 2 or 3 day Welcome Card is a must. It allows you to use buses, U  S bahns, trams as many times as you want, but don;t forget to validaye it before first use. We 'knocked hell ' out of our tickets, travelling to extremes of the City, and also to the outer towns of Potsdam (Schloss Sansoussi) and Oranienberg (Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp. Buses 200 and 201 run from Zoo Banhof to Alexander Platz, passing many sites, hop off and on as you please. I would not hesitate to use Argon Opera again on our next visit to Berlin - hopefully in the summer.
