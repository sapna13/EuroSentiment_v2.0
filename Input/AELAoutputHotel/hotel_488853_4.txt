{"text":"Well, you do get what you pay for. Won't be staying here again. I had a mixed reaction with the front desk personnel. An old woman at the desk was quite abrupt and rude. A male receptionist I spoke with was very nice though. I woke up the last day with bed bug bites, so beware of bed bugs. The room was very average. As another reviewer pointed out, the front lobby is gorgeous but very misleading in terms of first impressions. Your room will definitely be plain. My room's door did not even completely fit the door slot, so there was enough room for a cold draft to get in during the night, as well as the noises of cars, people, and airplanes. The glass windows were not the kind you could open. There was a good air conditioning\/heating unit underneath the window with the ability to automatically control the temperature to the degree. There was a work desk, two chairs, and a small circular table. Not really much in terms of tv programming; don't expect a LCD tv. They charge for wi-fi service. I did bring my laptop but chose not to use it so I can't really comment on its quality. The shuttle service serves four local motels including Good Nite Inn. It supposedly runs every 30 or so minutes from 4am until past midnight. There were times when the shuttle seemed to take far longer than 30 minutes, so be patient. Other airport shuttles seemed to be much more consistent and come more often, but maybe it was my imagination. It drops off at the international terminal, domestic terminal, and BART (Bay Area Rapid Transport), which is your high-speed rail gateway to downtown San Francisco. I highly recommend BART if staying at an airport-area hotel. The Chinese Beijing Buffet on the hotel's site was absolutely disgusting. I was set back a small fortune (including being charged separately for a drink). I had to deal with poor service (I had to wait about 20-30 minutes after I was seated to be served my first drink and then I had to chase down another waiter for a straw). There were pretty much all young people with bad attitudes employed there. I also found a hair amongst some of the chicken I got. I could not finish my dinner and I might as well have flushed the money down the toilet. But there really is not much in terms of restaurants. However, there are other restaurants at the nearby Holiday Inn and Four Points by Sheraton. There also is an IHOP and Wendy's a short walk away, as well as a Food Mart at a gas station. One note: if you choose to go to San Francisco, please remember that BART operates only during select hours (i.e. from about 4am-12am on weekdays, but only 6am-12am on Sat and 8am-12am on Sun). Also, most of the big museums I wanted to visit were closed on Mondays, much to my disappointment (Legion of Honor, De Young, Asian Art Museum). So do your research beforehand carefully as I had pretty much nothing to do on that Monday except go to the Golden Gate Bridge.
