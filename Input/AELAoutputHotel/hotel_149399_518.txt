{"text":"Paradise, even with three kids under 6 We stayed at the Melia from 1\/25\/07-2\/1\/07, their were 5 of us, 41, 38, 6, 3 and 10 months. I had read all of the reviews and was prepared for anything. Overall, this was a fantastic vacation! We had upgraded to the Royal Service and had a 1 bedroom suite. The resort is very large but absolutely beautiful. The grounds are well kept with vibrant flowers, small ponds, flamingo's and peacocks. The beach is amazing, pink sand as far as the eye can see, palm trees everywhere, just amazing. Their are two sides to the resort, the Tropical side has the kids club versus the Caribe, except for that they are identical.We used the kids club to let our 10 month old nap and the girls their were extremely nice and great with the kids. They have a jungle gym and activities all day for older kids and they seemed to do a great job with this as well.Our room was spacious and attractive, maid service was excellent, overall the staff at the Royal Service were extremely helpful and made every effort to accomodate. I used them every day to make dinner reservations and never had a problem getting the time or restaurant we wanted. We ate at the Chinese, Italian, Mexican, Seafood. They arll were good with the Chinese being the best. We had brought a portable DVD player for the kids to watch while dinner was being prepared and it turned out to work great not only for the kids but the staff always looked to stop and see what was playing. We had breakfast at the Gabi club and lunch at the beach buffets. The Gabi club food was good as well were the pool facilities and atmosphere being extremely relaxing. Only complaint., As you would image with a buffet, some things are good some are bad.  We did get a babysitter one night, $10 US per hour, $15 for 2 kids and was very pleased with this, the staff member was very good and had children of her own.Having small kids, we did not do any shows but loved swinging on the gliders each night with the kids talking about the day and what they wanted to do the next day. We did take a glass bottom boat and snorkeling tour from the beach but other than that not one reason to leave the resort, it is that great.Keep in mind-This is a very international resort, majority are from Europe, -United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, France, Russia. Very cool to meet people from all over and everyone was extremely nice. Be prepared though, Europeans have a different idea of what to wear on the beach! Quite a few topless as well, but not a big deal.Overall, you cannot go wrong here, beautiful place, very friendly and helpful staff that make every effort to speak English and accomodate any request. We did tip a few dollars at meals and left the maids a small gift each day. Do not think it is needed but definitely appreciated.Already planning our next trip there!
