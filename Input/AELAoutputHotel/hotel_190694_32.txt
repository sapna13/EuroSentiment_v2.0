{"text":"Adlon World-class hotel Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Adlon. I decided to stay there because of its central location right next to the Brandenburg Gate and on the heel of Unter den Linden. Without a doubt it was the right choice. The hotel is within walking distance of many tourist sites including the Gate, the Holocaust Memorial, the beautiful and fascinating Mitte district and its many Cold War and WWII sites, Potsdammer Platz, and even Museum Island if you're an ambitious walker. If not, the S-Bahn is down the block. It's central location, however, means that you'll be surrounded by tourists looking for the perfect photo of the Gate, or the infamous Michael Jackson balcony at the hotel. There is construction outside the hotel, with a new S-bahn entrance being built, but you won't notice it at all from inside the building.I stayed in a Deluxe room overlooking the architecturally transparent Arts Academy, so it's not necessary to book a room overlooking Brandenburg Gate in order to get an interesting view. The windows open so I could easily also see the Reichstag and other buildings.The service is excellent, what you'd expect at a 5 star hotel. The food is also first rate, though expensive, so you might just pop over to the Starbucks across the street for breakfast. The lobby of the hotel was reminiscent of a more formal Peabody Hotel (Memphis) or an old-school hotel whose lobby is a gathering place for locals. The business center was always accessible, with 3 computers available for internet use. The staff was attentive and friendly, though formal. In fact if I have a complaint about this hotel, it would be its formality. I never felt quite as comfortable as I did at, say, the Halekulani or the Peabody. Overall, if I were to return to Berlin I might try a hotel more in the center of Mitte with a little less formality, but if you don't mind the stiffness, I highly recommend this hotel.
