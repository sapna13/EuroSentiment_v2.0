{"text":"Intercontinental - Loved It - Great for Weddings We are from Australia and were engaged in Bali one year prior. At the time we were staying at the Hilton in Nusa Dua, however found it very average although the service was very good. We then decided to have our wedding in Bali in April 2006 and after searching through endless venues and locations we decided on the Intercontinental, the entire service was organised in house and my wife did a wonderful job arranging it all the way from Australia, with the assistance of the Intercontinental Function's Staff in less than 3 weeks without ever viewing any of it until we arrived a few days prior. All staff involved at the Intercon were fantastic and more than helpful. Our decision to Marry in Bali at the Intercon was superb and we will always look back with the most fondest of memories. At the Intercon we stayed in a Club Room and it was the best ever bar none (we have been to Bali 4 times in the last 3 years) and all staff were extremely attentive and very friendly and warm people.We had originally booked to stay at the Intercon for 5 days only however after accessing our next hotel (The Ramada) we decided to cancel and stay at the Intercon for 2 weeks. Our decision to stay was not only based on the beautiful surrounds of this delightful hotel but by the wonderful staff that made you feel as though you were the only guests. These lovely people always knew how to make you feel at home, from always remembering what you enjoyed to eat and drink to always addressing you by name with a smile, nothing was too much trouble.We are returning again to the Intercon for Christmas and New Year and could not ever imagine staying anywhere else in Bali.We are very much looking forward to catching up with the Staff at the Intercon that made our Holiday and Wedding so enjoyable.
