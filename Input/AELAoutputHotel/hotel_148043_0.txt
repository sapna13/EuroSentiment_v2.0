{"text":"El Convento - a great place to stay despite the problems Stayed at El Convento for a week in December 2008.Location √à√\u2020\u2022?Pretty much unbeatable if you want to stay in the Old City. Three sides of the hotel face onto quiet side streets, so there should not be too much noise from the numerous bars and restaurants near by.Building √à√\u2020\u2022?Converted convent with open galleries round a central courtyard, Very attractive but somewhat run down. Loads of character and this makes you feel that you are not an ordinary tourist but part of the Old City √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºcene√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>Reception etc √à√\u2020\u2022?pretty goodRoom √à√\u2020\u2022?Classic colonial style with high ceiling. Quite spacious √à√\u2020\u2022?but again somewhat run down with odd bits falling off here and there. Air conditioning incredibly noisy and not really powerful enough. Even when turned off there was lots of obtrusive roar from the air conditioning duct Balcony √à√\u2020\u2022?too hot to sit out most of the time.Public areas √à√\u2020\u2022?great roof terraces with views over the old city and the seas √à√\u2020\u2022?probably one of the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ nicest featureBreakfast √à√\u2020\u2022?expensive. Best to have some of the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ free coffee and go out to one of the local cafes.Staff √à√\u2020\u2022?friendly and responsive, but facing an uphill battle keeping the old building running.Food etc. Excellent free coffee and free bottled water available all the time. Free wine and cheese reception on roof terrace in evening really good and great opportunity to meet the other guests. Manager around to greet and chat to guest a really nice touch. Two bar\/restaurants on site offer interesting tapas and local cuisine.Overall √à√\u2020\u2022?If you are looking for Ritz Carlton levels of comfort don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stay here.. However as an authentic place to stay in the old city the El Convento is still hard to beat.
