{"text":"Phenominal as Always! It's been 2 years since we had the pleasure of staying at the Riu Palace Macao. It was probably our 6th or 7th trip to this wonderful resort. We always travel with TNT but they really need to get their act togther. Leaving Boston - It was beautiful, We were supposed to leave at 10:00 AM, a Stewardess from X-tra Airlines called sick in 1 Hour prior to departure thus delaying the flight - The Airlines did manage to get a replacement but we left almost 1 hour late. This is a reflection on TNT for using this airline.Riu Palace Macao - Upon arrival they noticed we had been there many times and they upgraded us to a beautful suite.The Place HAS NOT fallen into Disrepair as some earlier posts have reported. It is still as intimate and warm as it always has been. The Only dis-repair we saw was that a number of chairs by the pool were cracked and broken and needed to be replaced - an easy fix.The Food at the main dining room was exquisite. Filet Mignon, Nice pasta station, anything you want If you can't find something excellent to eat - stay home. Our only complaint was that Lunchtime at the Caribe grill the wait staff was very un-attentive - Oh well, we tip and we tip well but not on those days!The Japanese Restaurant was excellent! The only thing they need to do is put on a CD with some Dulcimer music plunking on it (Maybe I'll send one) for atmosphere. Major Note to all: MEN Long pants are a requirement - We were very glad to see that the dress code was enforced and men had to go and dress. Blue Jeans is NOT considered dress pants - get some nice linens or khakis - you're only embarrasing yourself!  We did walk over to the new RIU Palace Punta Cana - It is very cold and sterile - alot of nasty vile drunks hanging around the pool and attractive (And not so attractive) people who wanted to be seen and show off what they considered a body. No Thank you WAY to high maintenance for us! Note to Americans - Please do NOT bring your cut -off jeans to wear as a bathing suit - Tacky, Tacky - we saw a dude (from America) wearing his red-neck cut -off jeans - Buy a bathing suit -Unfortunately you are embarrassing all of us!Last Note to All: The RIU Palace Macao is NOT a place for young crying 3 and 4 year olds - There were several and you parents should be ashamed for letting them wail\/scream and distrupt everybody's vacation! The Pool here is very deep and is not a childs pool - Go to the RIU Bamboo where they have a kids club! You can't tell me your children had fun swimming on the top step!Coming Home - Once again the Flight was delayed by 2 hours - no explanation!All is well at the Macao, Enjoy, and Relax! It's wonderful!
