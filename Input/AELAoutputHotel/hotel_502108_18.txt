{"text":"Great Hotel This hotel was simply great, even though they tried to charge me for a breakfast i didnt have. This was however solved pretty quickly after they checked the signatures and they didnt match...Beware of the breakfast costing you a smaller fortune at √à√\u2020√ü?7.Try the pastry shop under the Tiergarten S-bahn Station for breakfast or take the train to Zoologischer garten.The location is right besides (25meters) the Tiergarten S-bahn station. (One stop from Zoologischer garten, 2minute ride)Beware that the closest U-Bahn station is a good 400-500m away even though is seems closer on most maps.The hotel seems to have a pretty good isolation though, since i couldnt hear the frequent traintraffic until opening the window.There is really nothing bad to be said about this hotel. Working AC. Clean new\/refurbished rooms. Excellent service. Very stylish and clean bathroom and WC. (They were separate, excellent!)And as i stated the isolation in the hotel is good, I was convinced for a few days that we were the only ones living on the whole floor even though my girlfriend claimed otherwise.Burger King is about 100meters away if You need a quick meal.And a few tips: You need the keycard to operate the elevator. You NEED to use your keycard to get it to stop at the right floor. If Your are staying at floors 1 or 2, it might make sense to use the stairs (also requires keycard) even though the hotel staff doesnt seem too happy about it as it seems to be there just for evacution purposes.
