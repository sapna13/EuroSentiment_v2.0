{"text":"Fab hotel - luxurious and a great location! I travelled to Paris to see Robbie Williams at the Parc des Princes before we jetted off to Marbella on the second part of our trip. We stayed at the Terrass hotel in Paris for 3 nights. The hotel which is situated on a hillside was luxurious and the views were fabulous. We stopped in a room which had a double jacuzzi shower. The room was spacious and extremely secure with remote control shutters, however the view from our particular room was of other parts of the hotel though I am sure there are rooms with amazing views at the front of the hotel - so try and get one of those!I would recommend you eat in the Terrass restaurant (Terrace) which is situated if my memory serves me on the 5th floor and is open air. The views from the restaurant are amazing and at night the Eiffel Tower is lit up which makes it very special, the food was great and fine wine was on tap which helped creat a fabulous ambience and a great taste of Paris. The location is perfect, not too busy with tourists but mainly locals mulling around the chic boutiques and coffee shops. It is situated idylicly in the Montmartre region and within walking distance (though up hills) of the Sacre Couer. There are markets nearby which sell canvass paintings and lots of shops selling original art at very competitive prices. The food outside the hotel was great too, the smell of croissants filled the air and the whole trip felt relaxed as thats how the locals seem to carry out their day to day activities. The staff were helpful and friendly, but book early to get into the restaurant as its very popular. The staff kindly squeezed us in on a cancellation and nothing was too much for them. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable trip to Paris which was underpinned by my stay at the Terrass!
