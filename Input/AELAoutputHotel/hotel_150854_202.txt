{"text":"Gotta love a RIU! We're a 50ish couple who were looking for a lovely place to rest and recharge for 14 days and we found it at the RIU Macao. We were upgraded to a 3rd floor pool view from the garden view. We are extremely fussy about our food and the food was excellent. Always lots of yummy things to try. Too many to list! We did prefer the buffet to the specialty restaurants. Take the tour of the kitchens if you can. RIU's are justifiably proud of their operation. The room, which was a nice room but not a wow room, was kept very clean by our very nice maid. They were always scrubbing, gardening and tidying. The grounds are beautiful.The beach was lovely, lots of chaises in both sun and in the amazing palm grove. It never felt crowded. If you want more than one towel, ask for another towel card at the main desk...they don't care how many you have, they just want to keep track of them.Be sure to tip and take a moment to say hello...the people who work there really work hard on our behalf.If you have been to a RIU before, you know what to expect and although I feel that RIU's have come down a touch since we first began staying years ago, they still are a wonderful vacation destination. If you haven't been, you wouldn't know.We liked: food, size of resort, beach, ability to walk throughout the complex without having to take a tram, boardwalk on beach for night walkd, palm grove, friendly service, piano bar, rocking chairs on balcony...overall a great place for a rest.Didn't like: They need new shows...Michael Jackson needs to be replaced by another look alike.We would recommend this resort for couples and anyone looking for a place to chill. Singles went over the other resorts and the disco for entainment.We wouldn't recommend this resort for people with children as it is adult oriented with no children's programme.
