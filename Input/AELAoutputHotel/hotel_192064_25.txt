{"text":"The Hotel Chesterfield - a fabulous experience We stayed at the Hotel Chesterfield a few weeks ago and we are still talking about the wonderful time we had there.The rooms are beautiful with fine attention to detail. There were all the essential comforts one appreciates like a plush bathroom robe and slippers as well as the everyday essential such as internet access and business supplies.The hotel's restaurants and bar were top notch. My sister in law came in late one evening and we were delighted to find that the bar remains open late into the night and serves food for their guests. The food was quite delicious and very welcome after a long day of travel. We had a English breakfast every morning in the main dining area and tea in the conservatory. Every meal was well prepared and again there was fine attention to detail.Without a doubt the most impressive part of the stay was the dedicated and caring staff at the Hotel Chesterfield. Everyone was so friendly and attentive. They were truly concerned that our trip be a great experience that they planned every outing with us, helping us get reservations and play tickets and last minute cabs. On a particularly busy evening we were running late for the theatre and the usual line up of cabs were not in front of the hotel. The doorman said I should wait inside, out of the rain and he would get a cab. I was so impatient that I went outside and didn't see him. Thinking he went home I wasn't sure what to do. Just then a cab pulled up with the doorman in the back. He had run out to the busy main road to make sure I got a cab and made it in time for the curtain to go up. That is all you need to know about the staff. They are all fantastic! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":737,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":734}]}
