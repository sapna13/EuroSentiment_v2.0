{"text":"Gran Melia Fantastic 5 Star Resort My Husband and I just returned from Gran Melia in Puerto Rico.The trip was a little bit of business and pleasure. I can't understand some of the negative reviews on this resort. The resort is absolutley beautiful and everything is extremely clean. The rooms are incredable and also spotless. We did not meet one singel staff member that didn't have a smile on their face and were always asking if there is anything they can do for you and how are you enjoying your stay. They were terrific! The main pool is great. It as extremley large. You never had to fight for lounge chairs. We booked direct with the hotel and got an upgrade to the Ocean Front Royal Service Suite , which is well worth the additional money. Included with the Royal Service is complementary cocktails from 6 to 9 each evening in their private lounge. It also includes breakfast each day. The Royal Service guests had their own private pool. In the evening the resort has candles lit everywhere. They play very exotic \/ relaxing music all day and night. They have beautiful couches and comfy lounges through out the resort. The pools are spectacular. Their restaurants are very nice bur are expensive. This is to be expected at a 5 star resort though. The drinks are around $8 a drink.. Beautiful Golf Couses. The whole resort focused on complete relaxation. I just can't say enough about this resort. If you do go to Gran Melia you must have dinner (or lunch) at Richies Cafe. Richie picks you up from the resort and brings you back. The cafe is high up on a cliff with a wonderful view. The food is excellant!. the view and the food were so good we ate there three nights in a row. Richie is a wonderful host. I would reccommend the Gran Melia Resort to anyone who is looking for a relaxing pampered vacation.
