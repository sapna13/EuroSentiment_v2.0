{"text":"beautiful resort,very quiet just got back from puntacanta princess, hotel was beautiful,grounds were so clean pool was clean and plenty of room to swim and relax. if you want a good spot on the beach or pool its best to put a towel over your chair to save it and try to do it before 9:00.our room was the best we were near the beach and pool so we had a great view and close to everything. they said no tipping for drinks but to get good service best to tip $2each time you get a couple of drinks to get better service we also tipped the maid each day she always supplied us with plenty of drinks and clean towels. the food was the biggest let down the 1st 2 nights we made reservations at the mediterraneanmare nostrum we had surfturf not like at home my lobster was smaller than a golf ball and my husband did not even get any and the steak was like rubber. the next night we ate at the rio grande everyone said this was the best ,appetizer was chicken very good steak was horrible after that we ate at the buffet which was okay we never tried the caribe food because it all looked the same. all in all i would return to this resort if they keep it all adults it was so peaceful that you have to overlook the food. if you wanted to see shows you had to go to the caribe, we did a jeep safari ,ride definetly,would recommend you get to see beyond the resort area and its very safe you travel with about 10 other jeeps. so if you want a nice relaxing vacation and you are noy a picky eater then i would suggest this hotel.
