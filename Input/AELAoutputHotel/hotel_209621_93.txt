{"text":"Great time, friendly staff We stayed during Thanksgiving week. The Staff was courteous, friendly and very helpful. Loved the decor. I wasn't too impressed with the eating facilities or continental breakfast but that was easily overcome by visiting the Caribe Hilton next door. The food was good but just not much variety. The N-Lounge bar is quite nice but only open Thurs _ Sat. although the Atrium bar is open 24 hrs and very comfortable. We didn't make use of the fitness facilities or the Spa. The Spa seemed kind of pricey for the services offered.In the room literature they claim $5.00 for extra coffee packs but that proved to be false in our case. Wireless internet worked very well. Satellite or cable TV have many channels and about half were in english. The room was fairly large (compared to hotels in other countries I have visited, and even some in the US) , divided into an entry\/writing area, bedroom\/TV room and a sun room. The bathroom was good sized and the only complaint I had there was the water was not as hot as I prefer. It wasn't cold but just a little bit above what I would call warm. A few stains ( not too noticable) on the hallway carpets but I suppose to be expected from a hotel built in '46 or something like that. The pool area was vary nice but hardly used as well as the beach area. We spend most of our time enjoying the facilities at the Hilton next door. The Normandie also offered a substantial discount for AAA members. The location was good. Right between Old Town San Juan and Conado and the casinos. Walking distance to each or ride the A31 bus($.75 p\/p) or a fairly cheap and quick taxi ride ($10-12 around town, $19 to the airport) A budget rent a car facility inside the lobby, good service there also. I would recommend this hotel and plan to say again on my next trio to PR. It's not full out luxury but is very unique and well worth the stay unless you have money to burn.
