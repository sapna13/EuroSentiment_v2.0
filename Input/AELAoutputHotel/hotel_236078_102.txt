{"text":"Seven Bridges is absolutely charming! We loved our stay at the Seven Bridges. It is one of the best BB√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ we have ever stayed in, and we have stayed in a lot of places around the world.Having been to Amsterdam a ton of times in the last 15 years, we can say without any reservations that the Seven Bridges is the best place we have stayed in Amsterdam. Some people might think that it is expensive, but it is not when you compare it to the prices of other places in Amsterdam. We have slept in some very nice hotels in Amsterdam and paid less money, but the places are unbelievably small, so small that you can hardly turn around in them. That is fine for maybe one night, but more then that it gets a little tiring. One place we stayed at we had to put our suitcase under the bed when we were not using them because there was no where else to put them. Granted all of the places we have stayed at in Amsterdam have been old canal houses that have been turned into a hotel or BB, so we cannot say if the Seven Bridges is the best place to stay in Amsterdam, but it is the best non-chain hotel in Amsterdam by far. What is the point of traveling somewhere new if your hotel looks like any other place anywhere in the world? When you are traveling the place you sleep should have character and charm, which the Seven Bridges definitely does.The Seven Bridges feels like you are staying with a local. This last time we stayed in room 7 and our friends stayed in room 6 from June 14 to 19, 5 fantastic nights. We have stayed in room 6 on a previous visit, so opted to try room 7. The rooms have stunning wooden floors, art work decorates the walls, and the furniture is all antique. In a museum you would never be allowed even touch one of the chairs. We were glad that there was no wall to wall carpeting because in hotels they always seem a bit dirty. Instead there are lovely Persian carpets on the wooden floors, which wood floors are definitely more in line with something you would find inside of a true Dutch home. There are also floor to ceiling glass windows that look out onto the lovely canal. It is just stunning. Plus the bathrooms are unbelievably large for a canal side hotel. Next time we hope to stay next door in rooms A, B or C, and skip the breakfast. As much as we love the breakfast and it is so nice being able to chat with hosts of the Seven Bridges, we cannot wait to buy some of the yummy things from the bakeries and cheese shops nearby and make our own breakfasts. For 15 years we have tried to stay at the Seven Bridges, but could never get a reservation. We are very thankful that there are rules now to the reservation system because it has given us a chance to stay at this hotel. In the past it always seemed like they were full up, and we tried many months in advance. With the new system we increased the number of nights we were staying, so that we knew we would be able to book a room ahead of other people.A little tip for anyone going to Amsterdam, we met this lovely man named Max, who does private boat tours for friends. In order to become one of his friends please email him to set up when would be a good time to go during your visit, and to find out costs. He also does √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºlow food√à√\u2020\u2022?boat cruises. √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?\u201AÑ¢low food√à√\u2020\u2022?boat tours are leisurely paced cruises with a fantastic homemade meal served.
