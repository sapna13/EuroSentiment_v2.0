{"text":"Great little Hostel I've stayed at a quite a few hostels throughout my travels, and I believe that Sampaoli ranks highly among them. I am a 32 y.o. male, stayed for 7 days. The key points of interest for Sampaoli are:+ it's really close to the major attractions of Florence+ the staff (esp. Leonardo  Ricardo) are extremely friendly and helpful. + it was relatively quiet while I was there -- of course don't expect quiet sleep anywhere in Florence during the daytime!+ the room I stayed in (room 7) is a single with what Americans call a full sized bed, and has it's own private bathroom (quite nice). Other shared rooms have multiple beds and shared bathrooms -- all of which were quite clean. + Typical age ranges of the people visiting the hostel (during the week I was there) are 18 - 25, with a majority of Americans\/Canadians, Italian, some Japanese, some British, and Mexican... a really diverse but fun group. + Very safe environment: each room has a lock, and there are two doors to reach the outside. I would think this is an ideal hostel for solo female travelers (there were several during my stay). + Internet access is slow compared to the U.S. -- there are two computers for internet use, which are typically shut down at 10:00 pm to provide peace\/quiet for the nearby rooms. Secure wireless internet is also available, but I couldn't receive it in room 7 (furthest from router). + The hostel provides bar soap\/shampoo\/towels, maps of florence, guidebooks that you can borrow, a moderate selection of DVD movies that you can watch in your room, and a common refrigerator\/coffee grinder\/microwave, etc. + You may want to bring your own pillow or ask for extra ones, they are pretty flat there. + The roads from Santa Maria Novella (train\/bus station) to Sampaoli are paved with paving stones, and can be quite bumpy when dragging a suitcase (this is true of central Florence in general).+ Petty theft\/pickpocketing\/purse snatching\/suitcase snatching happens -- always be aware of these things. Your items are relatively safe in your room, I left my laptop there and money laying about for 7 days and nothing disappeared.  Overall my experience there was quite great and I highly recommend this hostel as a launching point for your Florence and surrounding area tours!
