{"text":"Loved the Berlin Mark A group of four guys from the US stayed in two rooms in the Berlin Mark for the week of November 21-27, 2008. I loved the hotel's location just off the K'dam and near the U and S Bahn. The rooms were comfortable, with nice linens and oversized pillows and the flat screen tv was a great touch. The bathroom was small, but adequate; the shower was probably the smallest one I have ever used, but none the less, got the job done. The daily breakfast was great, with almost anything you could possible want. It was a bit crowded in the late morning, but very well stocked most of the time.There were a couple of downsides. The room was HOT. Even with the steam heat completely cut off, we still had to open a window with it 0 degrees C outside. The hotel was also next to the Hard Rock Cafe, and when the window was open, there was a lot of late night noise, car noise and yelling from the direction of the HRC. However, it was still worth the money we paid.The previous review mentioned the rudeness of the staff. We were there the same time and we must have gotten a different staff. There were staff that were more friendly than others, but we were never made to feel unwelcome. In fact, one of the female staff went out of her way to find us reservations on a panaroma train as well as call taxis and recommend restaurtants. I had no issue with any staff whatsover.I would definitely stay at the Berlin Mark again. Its well situated for adventures all over the city and certainly is priced well.
