{"text":"Love the Marriott!!! At your service A very nice Marriott to stay at but they always are! Really comfy beds and nice clean rooms. It is very close to Pike Place Market a quick 5 minute walk and you are there. It is also close to transit and other tourist places like the pier, the aquarium and the ball fields. We walked from our hotel to Pacific Science center and it only took about 20 minutes. (there is a big hill to climb so if you are not into that you may want to take the bus.) The hotel staff are very knowledgable about the area and always willing to help. The restaurant is called the Fish House and is very very good! It is pricey ( $20-$36 US Per Entree) We went once in our week stay as a treat and a treat it was! Wonderful service staff and excellent meal! The breakfast was not included but you could get it from the restaurant meals ranged in price from $10.95-16.95 US. We found it more fun to walk to Pike Place market and go to Lowells or the Athenian for half the price. The only problem we encountered was the valet parking. It is $28US which is a bit more then other garages in the city but you do get in and out priveledges which you do not get at other garages. We were charged for our car as well as someone else's vehicle. The valet staff thought we were trying to scam them and they were demanding we pay! It was pretty good service up until that point. We found out that the valet service is a seperate company that the Marriott hires to do their valet( at this location) Once we got the front desk staff involved they were horrified by the treatment we were getting from the valet staff and they immediately sorted out the problem. The valet staff didnt even apologize for their mistake which we found to be annoying since we did drop a good amount of cash parking our car with them. Other then that small problem everything else was wonderful.
