{"text":"great location, service and price overall rating reflects heavy emphasis on value - this is far from a luxury, or a new or a newly refurbished or a full service hotel.the high value experience begins with booking and communicating directly with Varsa. her email communication is excellent - even when away from the inn on holiday. she booked a tour for us, responded with advice on itinerary scheduling, restaurant recommendations (pesce and yabbies coastal kitchen were both excellent), and advice on public transportation and possible walks. they secured our luggage for us when we arrived early the morning of check-in and let us park through the dinner hour after check-out. value for the price: $99 + 14% tax @ night for a double queen in an interesting  fun area of san francisco (in march) with FREE PARKING. our room offered a decent tv, desk\/chair, small area with counter\/mirror, hanging, frig  microwave adjacent to room with toilet\/shower. the furnishings and conditions were clean and adequate (not new or strikingly attractive). the beds were comfortable and fairly firm with some give. Our room was in the middle of the 2nd floor of a three floor structure. it is not thoroughly insulated. we heard some noise above of us one night and some street noise (it's a half block off of Van Ness). the noise fits in with the feel of a busy neighborhood - which we enjoyed. there are many restaurant choices for varying budgets within easy walking distance. we also walked to fisherman's wharf. We took the trolley or the bus to most sights. we did drive to muir woods (we thoroughly enjoyed our walk through there) and to one dinner on the coast at Sutro's at the Cliff House (absolutely incredible). We obviously enjoyed our stay at the castle inn. ","annotations":[]}
