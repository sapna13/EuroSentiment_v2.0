{"text":"Nice Hotel In Great Area This is the third hotel I have stayed at in Paris and it offers great bang for the buck. It is not grand but the rooms (we had the superior) are quite spacious for Paris and well appointed. The roll down shades which block out all the light are a nice feature as is the in room tea\/coffee maker, iron and ironing board and mini bar with room for your own items. The hotel is quite pleasant and homey and while you will have a comfortable bed don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect down pillows. In fact my only criticism is that like many of the boutique hotels in Paris there was no option but somewhat uncomfortable foam pillows.The staff is very friendly and although I speak French they speak fairly good English. Breakfast was tasty√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®√ì√µ√\u2020aker√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ basket with bread, croissant, chocolate croissant, fresh squeezed orange juice, cake, small package of cheese and unlimited coffee and tea. It is worth it if you drink a fair amount of coffee or tea in the morning as these are quite pricey at restaurants in Paris and you will pay for refills at those cafes, bistros or restaurants. You can also have ham and fresh cheese a boiled egg or cereal for a few euros more.What really makes this hotel is the decent room size coupled with the area. As many posters have pointed out you are right near Rue Cler and in a residential area of Paris. You therefore can go to local cheeses shops, bakeries, etc and feel like a part of a neighborhood as you will see many Parisians doing the same thing. There are also many good restaurants nearby on Rue St Dominique and a few other local streets. There is somewhat of a nightlife if what you are looking for is a late night caf√ã√\u2022√ñ scene and you will meet locals at those cafes. If you are looking for a bustling club scene night life I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think it is in this area. You are also quite close to the Metro and SNCR\/RER for other areas outside of Paris. After we left the hotel we spent 2 nights at The Intercontinental Grand Hotel. In contrast the Grand is as it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ name implies Grand. However it is right in the midst of a tourist area where I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think you experience the true Paris and you will pay through the nose for everything you might want although it will be expertly provided for you.The Relais Bosquet on the other hand had everything you might reasonably require in a great setting and area. I would stay here again without hesitation and think it is a very nice value for the money. As an aside we did pass Le Walt Hotel which is very close by and seemed online to be nicer but more expensive. They were booked so we stayed at Relais Bosquet. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ glad we did. Le Walt sits on a busy street and the rooms are supposedly quite small. It did not seem worth the extra money. In fact I am not aware of a hotel I would rather stay at in this area over Relais Bosquet.Oh and don't forget to try the bread at the bakery next door as well as at the corner of Rue Bosquet and Rue Cler.
