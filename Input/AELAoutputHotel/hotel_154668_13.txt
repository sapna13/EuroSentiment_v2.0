{"text":"I'd Happily Stay Here Again We spent two nights in the Samarkanda suite, and loved it. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ large and comfortable (including the bed, which didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ strike me as being hard at all, as others have mentioned), and the bathroom, with its glass ceiling, is fantastic, and had excellent water pressure √à√\u2020\u2022?and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ picky about my showers! Although the balcony is small, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ nice to be able to step outside and look out over the city, although the view is better from the windows overlooking Av. Reforma and the Independence Column, which is beautiful lit up at night.Not many city hotels offer complimentary breakfast, so we were pleased to have it included here √à√\u2020\u2022?nothing outstanding, but a decent selection of pastries, cereal, and fresh fruit, which was fine for me. We almost didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stay in the Zona Rosa because so many people refer to it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ having become seedy √à√\u2020\u2022?maybe it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ gone downhill from what it used to be, I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know, but coming from Washington, D.C., I found it to be a lot nicer than similar neighborhoods here; i.e., Georgetown, Dupont Circle. The proximity to the metro is also a plus √à√\u2020\u2022?we walked a lot during our stay in Mexico City, but also used the metro quite a bit, and found it to be easy and convenient, albeit very crowded at rush hour! But the trains come frequently, so if one is too packed to get onto, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ no big deal to wait for the next one.I would definitely stay at the Marco Polo again √à√\u2020\u2022?it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not only a fine hotel, but an outstanding value.
