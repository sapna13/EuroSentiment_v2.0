{"text":"Fantastic family holiday Our family of 12 had the most magical holiday at the Komaneka Resort. It was a family reunion as my siblings and families flew in from different parts of the world to gather in Bali with our aged parents. The location in Monkey Forest Rd was fantastic as there were so many restaurants and shops to keep all happy, but at the same time within the hotel it was so tranquil. Perfect! We had an assortment of rooms which had different views and sizes. The standard rooms facing the rice fields were smaller but the view made up for it. The ones without much view were larger and had better bathrooms. Then there was the pool villa next to the spa... Definitely the best, if you can afford it. The service was impeccable, rooms were clean and atmosphere was charming. I have visited Bali several times and am one of those who check out hotels as my holiday program. I have seen several top-knotch hotels and find that the Komaneka has a charming architecture (not too heavily traditional and not too modern); is reasonably priced; is convenient if you want to be able to walk to restaurants and shops; is tranquil because of neighbouring rice fields. The beds were heavenly. We had a magical dinner at the poolside which we had specially requested for the staff to arrange as it was my brother's birthday. The seafood was very good but nothing could beat the atmosphere as we were under the moon and stars with subtle lantern lights over the pool. ","annotations":[]}
