{"text":"Grotty hotel  We booked the Imperial hotel in Hong Kong online using elong.com which specialises in hotels in Asia and was recommended by one of their staff so we were confident it would be a good quality hotel - especially as it cost $1200 HKD per night. How wrong we were!We realised something was wrong when we walked through the door in reception mid Oct 2008 which was filled with suitcases across the floor and people everywhere. The room we were given in the Imperial hotel was 1712 located on the top floor. The small lift did work, but we were surprised when the doors opened to view a narrow hallway carpet covered in a dust sheet and a laundry trolley in the way. Our room was at the very end of a dimly lit corridor.On opening the door to the room the smell of damp hit home, along with the noise of an air-conditioning unit and a dehumidifier. The windows were locked shut so there was no way to vent this foul smell. To add to injury there was a hole in the wall.The room itself was fairly small though the bed was of reasonable size and the bathroom was compact with a bath, shower and WC which were clean but certainly not worth $1200 HKD ($154 USD or √ä√£¬¢90 GBP) per night.We decided to go for a walk to discuss options before returning, collecting our bags and leaving the Imperial Hotel. Total time from check-in to check-out being approx two hours. In view of this we asked for our money back, but the manager refused point-blank to return any money because we had booked the hotel online. The fact the service received and quality of room were sub-standard seemed to have been missed.My recommendation to any visitors to Hong Kong. The Imperial Hotel in Hong Kong is one hotel that should be avoided at all costs - there are plenty other hotels in Hong Kong at a similar price range offering far better facilities.Though I was forced to sign 'under duress' the credit card slip before leaving the Imperial Hotel in Hong Kong, though I will now be contacting my credit card company to demand a full refund.Basil Fawlty would have been proud of the totally crap service provided by the Imperial Hotel  staff. The word 'Imperial' being somewhat misleading, well apart from their service charge.My Recommendation - AVOID THE IMPERIAL HOTEL IN HONG KONG AT ALL COST!
