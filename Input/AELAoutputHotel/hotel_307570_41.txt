{"text":"12 years later, still a great resort My company arranged an internal sales conference at the Grand Hyatt Bali for 70 of us. Not until I arrived at the front door did I realize I had stayed at the same resort 12 years ago on holiday. Twelve years ago it was magical, and it hasn't changed much since then. It's a bit worn around the edges now, a bit more moss on the rocks, and the koi in the ponds are a bit bigger. The rooms were not quite as crisp and clean as before, but still a treat. The bed was firm and super-comfy. The lounge nook was as decadent as before. My first visit was pre-internet, but this time the in-room internet worked great. Not too expensive, but I hope you resist the temptation to even log in. Pay-per-view was OK, but I hope you avoid that also! Mini-bar was also relatively inexpensive for such a resort. Hint for buying a diet coke: go to the drug store in the shopping area of the Hyatt -- less than $0.99 instead of the $2.50 (or whatever) from the minibar and $3.00 at the bar.The restaurants seemed cheaper on this visit compared to 12 years ago. Breakfast was a bit so-so. But the Japanese restaurant has great sushi. The Salsa Verde is not Mexican, despite the name, but has good italian. If you're there for a corporate event, the buffets are a bit boring. I felt no need to leave the resort for the 4 days I was there, but went out to dinner in Kuta with colleagues. Don't bother. It's a long way to go just to have dinner in restaurants full of drunken Aussies!All in all, though, I'd stay there again. Better still if it's a visit not for work!
