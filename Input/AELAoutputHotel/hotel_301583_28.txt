{"text":"Does a raspberry sound have a phonetic spelling? I just stayed at Raffles for 1 night while passing through Singapore in transit.It must be said that Raffles is an institution, and a very famous one at that. Going to Singapore and not going to Raffles would be like going to Paris and not going to the Eiffel Tower: you know there are better things to do with your time and money but would somehow feel cheated if you didn't cross this off your list in your limited time away from home.The bedroom was okay. It was attractively decorated with dark wood floors and colonial furniture. Most of their rooms are off of exterior corrirdors so they tend to be quite dark. The bathroom however had some considerable mildew and the shower was built for someone shorter than 5 and a half feet. It also leaked a large amount of water onto the bathroom floor so the bathmat was wet upon exiting the shower.My main beef with Raffles however is the price, which is approaching extortion for the value you claim from it. Or more aptly, the value you don't claim from it. The Singapore Sling was apparently invented at Raffles and everyone that stays is of course encouraged to try it. Not having previously been to the Long Bar, I naively had grand colonial visions of people dressed in white linen under lazy fans and potted palms. Instead I was disappointed to find a carpet full of crushed peanut shells in yet another dark room. The price for 2 forgettable cocktails? $50. The rest of our stay followed suit. If you stay at home, turn off the lights, crush some peanuts into your carpet and drink Hawaiian punch through a straw, you can have a similar experience.
