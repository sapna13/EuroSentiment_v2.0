{"text":"Work in Progress La Casona is a self-described boutique hotel in a beutifully restored old mansion, conveniently located in Colonia Roma but a short walk to all the restaurants and nightlife of Condesa. We stayed two nights using a weekend special. It was $279 which included taxes, a ride to the airport, and a few other goodies. There is a metro station a few blocks away.The public areas of the hotel are attractive, with polished dark wood floors and railings, some music-related decor, and cozy dining and sitting areas. Our room was large, with balcony windows that opened to a quiet side street. The bathroom was equally large, and everything worked. well. Our room had a strong shower -- important for blasting off the smell and grime after a long day of exploring D.F.There were a couple of things that we felt could have been improved:The front desk service was inconsistent. The first day, the person seemed almost bothered when we had questions about the hotel or advice on getting around. The next two days, though, the service improved.The bedding was acceptable, but was not of the quality I would expect if paying the full rate of about $180 per night. This applies to both the mattress and the covers.Overall, I'd give it high marks for convenience and attractiveness, but take off a few points for service and comfort, not because they were terrible, but because they made the hotel feel like it was still a work in progress that hasn't quite reached the level of luxury and sophistication it is aiming for.
