{"text":"Noisy Little Hotel I was looking forward to staying at this hotel because of all the positive reviews, and after staying here for two nights this month, I will never stay again. First off, I must say the hotel is very clean and the staff incredibly friendly. My wife and I got there at around noon and were told my assigned room was not ready yet, and in fact the people hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ checked out yet (this was not a big deal to me since check in was 3 PM and I was just hoping to get a room earlier). They said if we wanted a room now, we could get one on the main hotel floor otherwise wait till check in. Since we had flown in on a red eye from San Francisco we opted for the room available now. Needless to say it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in, even for New York standards it seemed small, the door to the room almost touched the bed. We were about 50 feet from the check in desk and it was just plain noisy at all hours of the day. We were woken up by lobby nose both nights from arriving guests between midnight and 3 am several times (it seemed like people coming home from parties or a late night) who didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ realize people might actually be sleeping. It was downright ridiculous. I would have changed rooms after the first night, but because we were there for only 2 nights it was too much of a hassle. Also the room had a window that looked onto the balcony of two other rooms, and there were no privacy curtains, just drapes. So you had no choice but to close the curtains if you wanted privacy. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ use to most hotels having sheers and then curtains, but not this room, so basically we had to keep the drapes closed at all times. Also there were only 3 outlets available in the whole room. Two in the bathroom and one at the desk, all others were used and behind furniture. So trying to charge two computers and cell phones was nearly impossible, plus you had to work at the desk if you needed to plug in. For a newer hotel and a Hampton I was very surprised at the lack of plugs.My main issue was the noise; I imagine if we were on a different floor, I would have been happier. The only other issue was that there was not much to do in the general area. If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e in town to sightsee, or to do tourist stuff, I would recommend a hotel in a different neighborhood. ","annotations":[]}
