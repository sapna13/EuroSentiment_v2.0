{"text":"Great for the price This was a good hotel for the money. We were in town to go to the Childrens Hospital and it was perfect for that. They have shuttles for the hospitals, airport, and 3 other locations in the main part of the city. It was clean and well kept. The shuttle drivers were really nice and had a lot of information for any questions you have about the area. The area where the hotel is was not the best but they had a security guard inside the hotel. We made the mistake of walking to the hotel from further down Massachusets Ave. I would NOT recommend that. I would have taken a cab if we knew the area. I would suggest this hotel if you are going to the hospitals but as far as staying there and touring the city I would have chose another hotel closer to downtown. As the previous reviews stated there is a helicopter landing pad next to the hotel but where our room was we did not hear that. The worst part for us was the curtains on the windows in the room do not close so for us when the sun came up we were up too. When I booked it, it said everything was 2-3 miles away and I thought that would not be a problem. It is far from everything you want to do. If you take the shuttles there is a lot of waiting and the cabs are at least $10 each way. But the hotel is a reasonable price. You have a great breakfast in the morning with sausage, fruit, french toast sticks, eggs, muffins, bagels, and cereals. My advice is just to weigh the choices. We had a good experience at this hotel and we wanted a good price and a clean hotel to sleep at night and I think we got that.
