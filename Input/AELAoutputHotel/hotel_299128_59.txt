{"text":"OK but slightly rough around the edges We booked one of the club rooms at the Intercontinental Bali. This includes a pleasant meet and greet service at the airport where we were taken to a lounge while the hotel rep took care of customs for us. We were at the club check-in lounge in 15 to 20 minutes which helps if there are children in tow. Pros: 1. Club privileges include use of the club lounge and all day snacks and drinks. Unfortunately the snack portions were quite small and looked suscpiciously like recycled food from breakfast. 2. There are several swimming pools to choose from, with some interesting features like sprinklers, and comfortable poolside cabanas. Beach towels are abundant and the attendants bring chilled fruit around (very) occasionally.3. Kids club called Club J which is good for families with young children with a planned programme. We brought our child there 3 times. Unfortunately, on the third occasion, when we went back to the club to retrieve our progeny, she was watching TV with one of the club J attendants, who hastily changed the TV channel back to a kids' channel. I can only guess that she (the attendant) must have been watching something else on TV not meant for children. A planned programme is only useful if the management sticks to it really. 4. Nice beach right in front of the hotel; lovely sunset.Cons:1. The rooms are slightly dated.2. The hotel restaurants are quite pricey. Beware the fine dining Italian restaurant. You get charged an arm and leg for very mediocre food. A suggestion is to take a walk along the beach to one of the beachfront restaurants for reasonable fresh seafood. 3. Recycled food at the club lounge. Overall not an unpleasant experience but with several slip ups along the way. Unlike the hotel motto, we don't think we will go back.
