{"text":"Excellent location and service Stayed here for 3 nights in August 2006 and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel was perfectly located for the aerobus drop off - just a short stroll across the Plaza and you were at the door. The reception staff were extremely polite and helpful at all times and there was a constant supply of cava and nibbles on the reception desk. Our room was on the third floor overlooking the plaza so had a great view and we didnt experience any problems with traffic noise etc. The room itself was small, clean and functional - everything you need and great for the price. I tend to judge a hotel by its breakfast (the great breakfast reviews were what sold me on this hotel in the first place) and I wasnt disappointed. The staff were efficient and polite here too. The snacks in the first floor lobby were also excellent - a really nice touch and certainly kept us going until tapas time! Location wise - great for exploring just about every area of the city as its on the brink of las ramblas (very touristy but has to be done once), ciutat vella (find somewhere unexplored every time you enter) and the funky el born (loads of restaurants we simply didnt have time to try). If you arent foot shy then you'll get more of a feel for the place by exploring on foot - we walked miles - although the metro is handy too. Finally, some recommendations for dining out at night - Ginger wine and tapas bar was truly excellent for authentic and novel tapas. Located between Carrer Palma de Sant Just and Carrer Lledo - its a bit hidden away but definitely worth the search. Also worth checking out is origen 99.9% on Passeig del Born. They serve authentic Catalan dishes which are taster sized so you can order a few. Worth going in just to read the menu - more like a magazine with info about the origin of the dishes etc. They have a shop attached too where they have more Catalan goodies on sale. Barcelona def has lots to offer and theres always the beach if you run out of steam. As for the hotel, we would definitely recommend it as it had all the benefits of a well established chain hotel but with a friendly and personal touch.
