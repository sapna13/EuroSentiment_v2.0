{"text":"Centrally located hotel with cosy rooms Swissotel is located in the heart of the shopping district next to the Sydney Tower. From the airport, I took the train to the Town Hall Station but the taxis I hailed refused to take me to the hotel presumably because of the short distance. It took me a while to locate the hotel entrance. A walk across Myers Department Store led me to the elevators which took me up to the front desk. Check in was done in ten minutes - five minutes waiting for my turn (it was nearly 7pm) and five minutes for the usual check in routine.My room, somewhat smaller than what I had expected, was cosy and inviting with wood panelling and furniture, and a wall mounted flat screen TV. I had expected picture windows but found apartment-type windows from which I could see all the hotel's neighbouring buildings (a bit too close for comfort). I liked the kimonos and the nifty coffee maker, but could not help comparing Swissotel Sydney with its sister hotels in Bangkok and Singapore whose rooms are much more spacious and had nice city views. Location-wise, Swissotel Sydney is like Swissotel The Stamford in Singapore, with shopping in the same complex but the latter's rooms all come with balconies with full length sliding glass doors, better equipped meeting rooms, an in-house convention centre and the subway at its basement. However, Swissotel Sydney has newer rooms\/furniture and is just one block away from the monorail which serves the city centre. Both Swissotel Sydney and Swissotel Nai Lert Park (in Bangkok) appear to have been recently renovated but in terms of service, the latter stands out with its bellhops ever ready to lend a helping hand with luggage and hailing taxis, and smiling and helpful reception staff. Swissotel Sydney's staff were courteous and efficient but seemed to lack the X factor in making guests feel right at home. I think Swissotel Sydney suits the leisure traveller more than the business traveller. Broadband speeds are excellent but the meetign rooms while ok are not impressive; to reach the business district or the convention centre, one would still need to cab it or walk to the train station and monorail respectively. For shoppers with spare cash to splurge on nice hotels, Swissotel Sydney is a good base to drop off shopping bags before continuing with more retail therapy. It is also within walking distance to Hyde Park if one needs a respite from the city bustle, and Darling Harbour, with its watering holes can be reached on foot or via the monorail.
