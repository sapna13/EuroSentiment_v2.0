{"text":"Blew our minds! We arrived at the Shangri-la for a post 3 night stay after our Superstar Gemini cruise to give us something to look forward to. We had booked into the Horizon Club in the Tower Wing which gave us some extra luxuries like buffet breakfast, late checkout etc. When we checked in we were told they had upgraded us to the Valley Wing which was a wonderful surprise as I had read about it on Tripadvisor so knew what to expect!The rooms were magnificent... with every little luxury you could imagine.... L'Occitane products in the huge bathroom, t.v. in the bathroom, chocolates everynight, complimentary fruitbowl, complimentary Chinese tea,... the list goes on.To say the breakfasts were to die for is an understatement! The fresh fruit was so beautifully laid out and exotic that I even bypassed the pastries every day just to eat the fruit. I overindulged so much just at breakfast because it was so irresistable and never ever had to eat lunch while I was there.Moet champagne was free flowing and complimentary every day and the waiters were always around ready to top your glass up or tempt you with a cocktail of some sorts. Sandwiches and afternoon tea were always served every afternoon and between 5 and 7 you always got a little plate of beautiful canapes to accompany your drink!The staff here were amazing and never once did we feel like bogun Aussies sitting there in their beautiful lounges... they were always so friendly and respecful and we were always greeted with a genuine smile and hello.I would recommend this hotel to anyone and if you can afford it, upgrade to the Valley Wing as it is so well worth it. We will definitely return as it really is a lovely slice of heaven!
