{"text":"Very Good Experiences Having now stayed on four seperate occasions, I'm pleased to report that the Hilton Arc de Triomphe is a well maintained, pleasant, and friendly hotel on the west end of Paris, and this assessment has been consistent throughout. Some of the benefits to staying at this property are the larger room sizes (one can very comfortably fit a family of 4 into their Double Double room--an unusual feature in Paris where normally you can only get 2 people in a room), the proximity to the Metro (stop: Courcilles), the prices are generally less than other comparable properties, the neighborhood (8th arrondisement), and the staff (very friendly and helpful at all times, especially Olivier the concierge). Negatives include being slightly further out from the center of Paris--there is no direct Metro to the center of town so you must change trains, very expensive dining and bar, and the fact that is is an American chain so you are not really getting a real taste of Paris like you would in a smaller type hotel. Overall, most Americans will find this American chain a very good value and will be pleased with the space.Be warned, though, the rooms at the front of the hotel which face the street suffer from an incredible amount of street noise IF the window is open. My room was incredibly warm during my last stay here, and I was forced to have the window open, causing sleepless nights. Next time I will insist on a courtyard room to avoid this issue.
