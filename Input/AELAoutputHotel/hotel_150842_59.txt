{"text":"Great time had by all ! We just returned MAY 2nd from the Iberostar Dominicana. I always read the reviews but have never written one. We were originally booked at the Edenh but after reading all the negative reviews, we switched to the Iberostar square deal. My only complaint is that the Bavarro wasn't part of the deal and we didn't find that out until we got there. We could have gotten upgraded but it was just what everyone has said. You can stay at the Bavarro but you can't eat or drink there so we stayed at the Dominicana. The rooms were just average but they were so clean and our room was right by the pool. That was a perfect location. Every day about 10 o'clock the guys would go to the room and bring the bottled beer down to the pool in the ice bucket. That is how the day started every day.This is our 3rd time to Punta Cana. We have been to Aruba.Puerto Plata[didn't like] Puerto Vallarta[loved it,very old world Mexico]Cancun[about 8 times] and our favorite place Riviera Maya about 6 times. We were at the Ibeostar Maya in October which we were upgraded from the Lindo. This was the most fun we have had on all our trips. We were with two couples.We booked our 3 dinner reservations as soon as we got there and we had no problems. In fact I went back 2 days later and asked for another reservation because I told her that I really didn't like buffets so she gave us the Mexican restaurant. The Gourmet was the best. Everyone got the same thing. The main entree was lobster and it was wonderful. We also ate at the Oriental[it was great] and the Steak House[my least favorite[.The buffets were actually very good. I loved the Pasta station. This was the first place that I have ever liked their sweets..The best place for lunch was on the Dominicana side right by the pool. We got a table by the wall that separated the beach from the pool. It was so beautiful to sit and look at the beach and ocean. Every other day they grilled out. One day lobster,another day chicken,pork, or beef kabobs and half chickens. Three of the days they had a band playing for lunch and they would come and grab you to dance. This was the best entertainment we have ever had. The workers told us that they work 12-14 days straight and they go home for 3 days. How would we like that?The beach and pools are beautiful. We walked one day for 2 and a half hours. You can't do that at the Riviera Maya. We went to the huts 3 or 4 times and had fun bartering with them.At night the show is on the Dominicana side and a band is on the Punta Cana side. We had more fun with the band because they grabbed us all to dance. Afterwards two of the couples would go to the casino and we would go to the bar by the beach.The best alcohol is always at the lobby bars. They have all top shelf. I had Stollis and cranberry.This hotel forces you to relax which is what I needed. In Mexico we are always hopping the collectivo and going to Play de Carmen shopping and bringing presents back. The only things I brought back is what I could get at the huts. There is a new Hard Rock Cafe but it was a $20 taxi ride to and from.Overall this was the best time. The weather was great. The grounds,the pool and definetly the workers and entertainment were the best. If you don't have a good time, it is your own fault!
