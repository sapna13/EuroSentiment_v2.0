{"text":"Not the Wow Factor I Expected!!! Remember this my story and my expreiences. Let me start by stating the positive. The staff was friendly, polite, and accomedating. Like the fact that the hotel is right on the beach. The Lobby was nice and inviting. However, I didn't sleep in the lobby. Loved the hammocks. The pool area was kept clean when guest would leave their trash, towels or chair lounged back, the staff was readily available to get the area clean and organized. My kids loved the swimming pool wanted to stay all day. The pool wasn't terribly dirty just not as clean as it could have been. Visited the pool everyday. Hotel kid friendly just not any planned activities for them just a small game room. And if there were any actitivies wasn't informed. The pool grill food was good. Also the hotel offered complimentary bug repellant for the outdoor activities. By the way which you will need (no see um bugs), I was so sure I had got biten by bed bugs not sure which one it was. I questioned wether it was Bed Bugs because I was really disappointed with house keeping. Be aware my room wasn't vaccumed, balthroom floor or mirror washed, nor did they change the sheets my entire stay of 5 days. The outside of the bathtub stayed dirty that enitre time as well. Had to keep requesting extra towels and wash clothes to accomedate the amount of people in the room. I felt once they knew how many were in the room we shouldn't have had to ask anymore. The word suite was used in describing the rooms however, my experiences of a suite were bedroom with a seperate sitting area or room. Not the case with my room. I found it to be extremely small. It was considered a full ocean view room although we could see the ocean it just wasn't as enchanting as the price should have make it . Honestly, for the price it was just and average room. Like another review read I would have expected more for the price. The room wasn't nasty but it just wasn't fresh if you know what I mean. On the first night\/day the airplane noise is very annoying but after a while it's a non issue. Was also disappointed when my husband told one of The Sierra Restaurant employees that it was my birthday, they didn't even send out a complimentary dessert or anything. Last but not least our last day we ate for the 3rd time at the breakfast buffet. To be fair the other 2 times were ok but this last time my husband poured out a fly with his coffee from the coffee pot, the french toast was cold and the sausage was not throughly cooked. The staff did compensate for the inconvenience. Not saying I would not stay at the Marriott again. It just won't be my first choice.
