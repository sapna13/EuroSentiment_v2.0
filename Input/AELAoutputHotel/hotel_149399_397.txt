{"text":"Great Vacation My boyfriend and I stayed here the first week in June '07. We decided not to do the Royal Service option, but had family staying there at the same time who did, so we got a clear sense of the differences. If we had to do it again we would have payed the extra money for Royal Service. Not so much for the butler service and pillow menu, but for the much less crowded, nicer pool, the additional restaurant, a nicer room, premium liquor at the Royal Service bar, and better chairs at the beach.... beach chair drink service also would have been pretty nice! The on demand golf cart service also would have come in handy because this resort is BIG! The only negative that we could see with the Royal Service is that these are the rooms farthest away from the beach... although a golf cart will take you there whenever you request.A few negatives...We asked for a King size bed and got a room with two double beds (not full size... but double... a little bigger than a twin). We asked to move, but it was not possible the first night , and once we were settled we opted to stay put. The room was very nice though.The resort is very spread out. There is a shuttle service that runs around the resprt. But it always seemed to be going the opposit direction as us, and the golf carts are sort of like cabs in NYC... hail one down as it is going by if no one else is in it. HOWEVER, given the all-inclusive meals and drinks, we probably managed not to gain weight on the vacation because we walked everywhere, so this negative turned into a positive!The Sol Melia Vacation Club is a sort of a time-share run by the people who own the Melia Caribe Tropical. We were talked into doing the 90-minute vacation club presentation with the promise that it would really only take 30 minutes, and we would get gift certificates for a free massage at the spa. Be warned... this presentation WILL take the full 90-minutes. Ours actually took 2 hours. Some of the information was interesting, but it took us making it VERY clear that we were done and wanted to leave to get them to stop trying to get us to buy something then and there. We did get our free spa treatments though.... very nice! Just be aware that it will take the full 90 minutes (if not longer), and that they will give you the hard sell.All of that being said. We truly loved out vacation, and recommend this resort.... splurge for Royal Service, though. It is worth it!
