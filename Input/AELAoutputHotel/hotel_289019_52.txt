{"text":"Chandelier overdose! Arrived in Berlin after a long business trip in London, in order to celebrate 2 years anniversary with my partner. booked directly with the hotel's website since it had the best offer, better then all the other sites i know that offer hotels deals (expedia, tablet etc.) and based on the reviews on tripadvisor i chose the club room with lounge access. this is a good choice since you get a great room and access to the club lounge that offers 3 meals a day - buffet style - that turned out to be a real EUR saver.my feelings about this hotel are mixed. on the one hand, i agree with most of the reviews here, saying that the hotel is beautiful, the rooms luxurious, the service very personal and the spa small but really nice. however, this is a traditional hotel, very formal and, with a luck of a better expression - made me feel OLD (i'm 36).the clientele vary from 50+ years old - old money - people and\/or businessmen in Armani suits. everyone is talking really quietly and the atmosphere is frozen. it's not hip, not happening and worse of all √à√\u2020\u2022?has no pulse. so if you are looking for a happening hotel - forget it, this is NOT it. but if you are looking for traditional elegance - you will love the Ritz Berlin a last thought - for its caliber - the Ritz Berlin is really not that expensive. The room you get for 375 EU at the ritz berlin will cost you 700 in paris, and about 500 POUNDS in London. so if you are coming to Berlin this is really a good opportunity to stay where the REALLY reach people stay - and pay a reasonable price. but forget about fun and be prepared for stiff elegance.
