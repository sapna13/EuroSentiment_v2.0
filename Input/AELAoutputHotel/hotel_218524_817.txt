{"text":"We loved this resort! My partner and I spent our honeymoon at the Excellence Punta the second week in October and absolutely had a wonderful time. As a gay couple on our honeymoon naturally we were a bit unsure of peoples reactions. We were treated like royalty. My partner and I have 16 and 20 years experience in Hospitality and between us we have ran spas, inns, restaurants and I am a Certified Chef. The one detail that stands out in our minds is the personal and proffesional service we received from the warm and happy staff. Special thanks to Rey, Waldy, The Executive Chef Bert and Martinez who made us kick-ass omeletes every morning and all the wonderful staff at the Excellence Club!Here is our breakdown:Transportation: We read many reviews before we left that recommended we not take the bus as the trip to the resort was very rough. We booked a limo from the airport to the resort which was a huge waste of money. For $175.00 our limo was dirty, hot (horrible if no airconditioning), warm bottled water and I got hit in the head by the airconditioner vent which fell from the roof.,although the driver was very friendly . We decided to take a cab back to the airport it was airconditioned, spotless and the driver was very friendly. Food: It was awesome not to have to make reservations each evening! The food was diverse, fresh and you could have barbeque for lunch or dress up. The had take out and delivered Pizzas to the beach and rooms and all the restaurants were excellente! I particularily recommend the Lobster house. The only thing to note is that the mosquitos are quite aggressive, bring but repelent with deet and use it every evening. The days seem to be just fine with out but repellent.Activities\/Entertainment: The days were filled with endless activities which are posted in the lobby with alternates for rain days. We loved receiving our daily news letter the evening before so that we could make choices of what to do the day before. The evening entertainment was fantastic, they put a lot of effort into costumes and set design and the open air theatre is wonderful, this talented troupe performed in almost every show which changed every evening.Go horseback riding it is included and wonderful, there is a market on the way back just next to the resort which is much more affordable than the gift shops in the hotel they also had tons more product.Beach\/Pools: The pool was amazing and large, it spanned across the whole resort. We found an alternate two tier pool next to the night club that was quiet and wonderful. The bar served light snacks during the day. They have beach beds on both the beach and by the pools, they serve you drinks at both water spots as well.Bars: Have the drink of the day! It is always awesome but the Coco Loco's are out of this world. The champagne and house wine were quite good and they provide both high end alcohol and bar rail brands along with domestic beer.We are extremely well travelled and this was one of the cleaniest beaches and most beautiful in all of our travels, they will provide you with boogie boards and a guide (Franklin-totally knowledgable and sooo friendly) the waves can be a bit rough but the water was always like a warm and welcoming bath.Service: I cannot say enough about the service, the fact that people remembered our names right off the bat was amazing. We stayed in the Excellence Club that had a few added features but I must say that everyone at our resort no matter where they were staying felt like royalty. This hotel has outdone themselves in staff spirit, all the employees smile and sing as they work.Spa Services: As avid spa goers I have to tell you this is an absolutely breathtaking and spotless facility. The diverse services were performed perfectly by the welcoming staff.We should all be so lucky!
