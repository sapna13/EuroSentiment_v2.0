{"text":"Heaven here on earth!!!!! My daughter and I booked this trip a few days before going. We couldn't have made a better choice. The people that worked at the PCP were very friendly and efficient. We were waited on hand and foot with such beautiful smiles. They really went out of their way to make sure we had a great holiday!!!!We took lots of US one dollar bills for tips and they were very much appreciated. Many people did not tip and the staff still gave everyone excellent service. We especially loved the fillet mignon at the Tex Mex Restaurant. The theme nights at the buffet were excellent. We couldn't believe how much variety there was at the buffet during the week. On our last night there we enjoyed the Beach party or Dominicana night. It was heavenly to sit on the beach with the cool ocean breeze, sip Banana Mamas and eat such delicious food. We enjoyed the excursion to Dolphin Island. Although the one macaw tried to eat my daughter and she got quite a pinch on her shoulder. Swimming with the dolphins was a lot of fun. We also went on the sunset horseback riding excursion which was amazing. We got to explore some natural areas along the beach that hadn't been invaded by resorts. After an hour they stopped to give the horses a break and one of the guys climbed a tree and brought down coconuts for everyone. It was nice to have the opportunity to taste the milk. The resort couldn't have been cleaner. In the mornings the staff actually scrub the walkways. The beach is absolutely gorgeous and they had a ton of lounge chairs under grass umbrellas.
