{"text":"Great vacation, very few negatives My girlfriend and I spent two weeks from April 12th to the 26th. We were met by friends for the last week. We all had the VIP which I do recommend booking through your travel agency not at the resort. (cheaper)First off I will start with the few small things that bugged me while I was there.First, the Italians. I found them to be very rude and figure they had to be treated better than everyone else. One morning I really wanted to try archery and so I did. I went there in the morning when it opened and there are two targets\/ranges. One range being used by two men (Italian). And the other being used by everyone else. In 45 minutes I got to shoot three arrows, while the Italians had shot well over 50. I asked them if we could use their range and take turns but they shook their heads and act like they didn't understand anything and continued to shoot. Very rude. It was a minor problem and I shrugged it off and continued on.The only second problem I had outside of all the Italians was when my friend arrived into my second week for his first week. They arrived later in the evening and when they got food and their baggage we all went swimming in the ocean. We were lightly wrestling around when his bracelet caught mine and fell into the ocean. We went to the front desk at around midnight to get a new one. The guy said you had to have to old one or it was 50$ US. Long story short he came back in the morning and was very firm with the manager and finally got his bracelet for free. In the hotel room book it says they charge 2$US per bracelet. So just watch out for money scams. Most employees only earn 6-8$US per day.Rooms were great but try not to get a ground floor room in the cayenne sp? building close to the 24 hours bar\/snack bar, it can be very loud. Also the italian theatre, yes they have their own theatre, but it pales in comparison to the shows at the international theatre. The lirio building with the lower number, IE) 3201-3210 are closer to the beach and father away from the theatre.Food is great at the buffet and I never had a problem with the variety, although I am not a very picky eater. The al a cartes were fantastic, although I wouldn't recommend the lobster pieces and the Chinese, go for the duck, mmm. The other restaurants I found really good and always better than the buffet.Water sports were fun, catamarans and boogie boarding. Went banana boating once although with the VIP you get 1 hour per person per week of motorized water sports which include banana boating or a trip out to see the old tanker wrecked on the reef.Rooms, fine, always clean no problems. Although on our second week we are supposed to get a small bottle of rum and three cigars (per week) and after 4 days of calling and talking to guest services in person I finally got it delivered.The spa was great, we went the first week for our 20 min massage(VIP) and the next week we had to add 25 mins to our next one because it was so great. I believe it was 35$ for 25 extra min on top of our VIP. Very nice spa and massage rooms.Oh and the walk to the lobby is at most 10 mins from the rooms if you walk extremely slow. it took 10 mins most of the time because we were always stopping to take pictures of the beautiful scenery and animals.Theatre shows are extremely good and the Icebreaker show is always funny. Sit in the front row and its a sure thing you will get on stage once or twice.The Dominican staff are very friendly...not much to say about the Italians. The pool bar is great...can get in real trouble there. Overall I would go back in a heartbeat, but I think I might try something else in punta cana as this is my first time down there so I can compare. But any questions, send me a message. will try and get back to you asap.
