{"text":"One of my worst hotel experiences ever! I am usually careful to give only one star to the absolute worst of hotels. This one definitely earns it. Granted, I only booked this hotel because we had a rate from the conference I was attending. I did no homework on the place and simply bought the pitch that it was a designer hotel. What a mistake that was. I wish I had checked out the reviews beforehand. Anyone here praising the quirkiness of this place really has to be into design. I found nothing in the place designed. It was the strangest feeling I ever had in a hotel. Because this place was a former prison, I somehow felt totally creeped out by it. Further, my room was horrible. I booked the 4star (or whatever the rating is) room expecting something better. The room had linoleum flooring which was beaten up, the toilet was standing out in the open in the middle of the three small separate rooms (I presume three separate cells). The two sofas were completely ragged. The shower had mildew. The windows were beaten up. The only thing somewhat OK was the bed but not even that was anything more than standard. I also found the reception extremely unhelpful. The people were fairly rude and seemed bothered when I asked for them to call a taxi for example. The restaurant area is OK I guess but it simply is not enough for me to have anything but the worst of impressions from this place. Think long and hard if you really want to risk it booking this place. it might be the kind of place which floats your boat since you're into this type of experience. Yet, I highly doubt there are that many people who like this kind of thing. Maybe if Hostel 3 gets filmed, this is where they'll probably film it. You might get lucky and bump into a celebrity.
