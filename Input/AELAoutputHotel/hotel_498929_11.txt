{"text":"For Nature lovers ok with the Rough Edges Ok, here is the deal.I stayed at the Waka Shorea for 5 nights in August 2006. I was pretty curious about the Waka Shorea since I had a hard time finding any reviews of the place!The Waka Shorea is for Nature lovers unafraid of a few rough edges. The location of the Waka shorea is in a very remote part of the National Park. There are long hair deer ( more like mooses) and grey monkeys roaming the grounds. Waking up at the Waka shorea is kind of like being in a safari. The ocean was the clearest and bluest water I had experienced surrounding Bali. Snorkeling is truly amazing just off their peer. ( I have snorkeled in the Maldives, Tahiti, and Hawaii) They have sports center that gives mountain bike and hiking tours through the park. There are snorkeling trips everyday to the famous Deer island. I was traveling solo so I did not want to snorkel by myself so the Waka Shorea assisgned one of their divers to snorkel with me which was alot of fun. Go to station number 2 on the island. It was one of the best places I have ever snorkeled.Back to the hotel. If you are looking for a luxury hotel, the Waka Shorea is not your choice. Yet, being in such an amazing natural santuary made me forget about all the rough edges. They really need to have a reception area at the Waka shorea. It was hard getting a manager to speak with but when I did finally speak to one my request was always fulfilled.I wish they would have a bar where guests could relax and hang out.The food was ok. Fresh fish mixed in with some Balinese dishes at reasonable prices. They also had Italian and Inter continental food to please all tastes. They do make their own bread. The breakfasts are perfect with eggs, fruit, and fresh bread. There is no bar but you order a drink at the pool they will make one up for you. I saw several families with small children who seemed to be enjoying themselves, All the cabins are made with natural materials so it is very zen. They have 2 massage therapists working on the premises. I would not recommend the Waka for elderly people who have a problem with stairs since there are a few. Their beach is not that friendly since the low tide makes it impossible to enter the water without cutting yourself on the coral.All in all, it was the location of the Waka Shorea that is really special.If you are willing to give up some of that Western luxury to experience a truly unique location, then the Waka Shorea may be for you!
