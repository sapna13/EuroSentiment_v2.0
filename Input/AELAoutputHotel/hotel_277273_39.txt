{"text":"Great Hotel on Gran Via Just returned from this hotel at the end of October 2007. The hotel is right beside the GranVia Metro Station (travelled from Airport via metro with two changes). Arrived at the hotel on a Sunday evening (11pm). Desk staff very friendly and efficient. First impressions of room were good.... a hall way containing double wardrobe with plenty storage space, iron, ironing board, press and electronic safe. Off the hall were the bathroom (shower and deep bath) and the bedroom. The room had laminate flooring, very bright, not overly large but didn't feel claustrophobic.... twin beds which had the ability to be raise head and back section. The room (703) looked over onto the Gran Via (a six lane main cross avenue lined with shops\/ theatres and restaurants) although a vey noisy 24 hour street .... the double glazing and sound proofing was excellent and blocked out traffic noise and indeed I would say the room was very quiet. There was a small balcony looking onto the Gran Via.The breakfast serves until 10:30 probably some would say basic but nevertheless more than satisfactorily. The staff again were friendly. Selection of cold meats, cheese, cereals, juice and plenty of coffee\/tea.The hotel is well appointed and although other reviews mention the ladies of the night I would say they were few and didn't pester (unlike in other European capitals) albeit I was there with my wife but no problem from them. The hotel is right in the middle of Madrid and easy to walk to the parks, museums, shops and galleries. Plenty of pubs and food places (we did not dine in the hotel although the menu looked fine). On the subject of drink... the free mini bar was a nice touch and sums up this welcoming hotel.... I would certainly recommend this!
