{"text":"Almost ideal We just spent a week in one of the shophouse rooms at this hotel and found the place nearly perfect. Sure, it's not a grand luxe place with acres of marble and gardens and four swimming pools, but the public spaces are lovely, intimate, elegant, and pay attention to Singapore's history. Our shophouse room was also elegant and supremely comfortable with polished wood floors, a huge tiled bathroom with walk in shower and decent tub, biggish LCD TV with a good selection of channels, and all the other bits and pieces one expects at this level. Even better, the hotel is not on or near the hideous tourist frenzy of Orchard Road. Bugis Junction is not the raffish place it used to be, but is now a charming mix of old Singapore and new Singapore. The new National Libary is here and has free wifi if you don't wish to pay the SGD$30 a day for the hotel broadband. There's a covered shophouse street adjacent to the hotel with coffee shops and restaurants and a department store that has a nice big food court with lots of hawkers in its basement. You can eat and eat well here for very little, and that's important because the prices charged by the hotel for food and drink are pure highway robbery, and the main drawback of the place. The staff were consistently charming, friendly, and helpful (unlike the experiences of others on TripAdvisor) but we could have done without the constant knocking on our door on the morning of our checkout day to ask if we had yet gone. A great stay in a really good hotel, at a very decent price booked on the hotel's own website.
