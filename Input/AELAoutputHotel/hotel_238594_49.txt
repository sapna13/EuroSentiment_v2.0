{"text":"Trust the Reviews for this hotel! My wife  I stayed at the Hotel Montecarlo for two nights at the end of June. It is as good as other reviewers have stated (thank you). We were coming off a cruise so we would arrive at the hotel early in the day so I had emailed the hotel ahead of time to confirm they would have a luggage lock-up we could use (they had replied that they did). However, upon our arrival at about 10:00 am, presumably knowing we were arriving early, they informed us that they had our room ready. Impressive service! We got an updated room which was a little plain (art-deco-ish style) compared with many hotels we've stayed at, but very tastefully done. The bathroom was excellent, which is something that you don't always see in Europe. We had no problem with the dual beds making up the king-size bed that other reviewers have mentioned. The staff were great, explaining the various features of the room like the electric blinds, air conditioning and beds and they handed us some useful tourist books without our even asking. The room was clean, quiet and well maintained. What more could you ask for? We had the 11 Euro breakfast one morning, which was ok but about the only thing I would not rate as exceptional.This was our first visit to Barcelona and I was amazed at how good a location this hotel has. Besides being on La Ramblas, it is also near Placa Catalunya which is a transportation hub, if not the hub of the city. The Metro, buses, airport bus and city tour buses are just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. When we sadly left, we took the airport bus from there which only costs 4 Euros and 5 cents each. Overall, this hotel deserves its high rating. ","annotations":[]}
