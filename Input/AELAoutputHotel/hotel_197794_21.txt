{"text":"Great place - great location! I was a little late in booking a hotel for an upcoming conference, and I was looking for a place near the Central Train Station since I was arriving by train. The hotel I usually stay at (the Victoria - very nice too) was booked, so I used Google Earth - and found that the Black Tulip met my need of being near the train station - great! I read the reviews and didn't realize who the targeted clientele was until clicking onto the website (I'm a straight male - married). But the reviews sold me, the rate was excellent, so I booked it. I had a little trouble finding the hotel since it has a very discreet appearance. No sign or banners - just a doorbell with the hotel's name. Once I was there, the owner was very friendly and helpful - and made me feel welcome.I had the small room in the front facing the street - it was very quiet - no street parties - the accommodations were very pleasant and clean. Free wi-fi worked fine, and the bed was VERY comfortable. The room looked very cool with a super high ceiling - and a cage situated in a loft above the bathroom. :)Location is perfect if you're arriving by train; 5-10 minute walk. And it's right down the street from the infamous red-light district and the party part of town. But it is far enough away from the action to get a good night's sleep.One of the reviewers didn't like the breakfast - I thought it was fine: eggs to order, coffee, fresh fruit, bread and yogurt. What else would you want?I have stayed in Amsterdam a number of times, and comparatively speaking, this hotel exceeds the service and accommodations given at some of the 4-5 star hotels at half the price.Overall, I was very satisfied and would recommend this hotel to anyone who isn't bothered by SM lifestyles. Next time I'll bring my wife and stick her in the cage :).
