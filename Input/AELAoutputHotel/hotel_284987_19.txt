{"text":"Paradise at Gran Melia My husband and I stayed at the Gran Melia for five days. It was the most romantic and special five days we've had since our honeymoon! We wanted a beautiful quiet resort that was easy to get to and was reasonably priced. We took a direct flight and we did not have to deal with customs or passports. We booked the Royal Service package and as soon as we landed at the airport the wonderful royal service treatment began. Our ride to the hotel was easy and our check in was a snap. We were given a ride down a lovely path in a golf cart to our room. Our room was absolutely beautiful. It overlooked the Royal Service pool and the ocean. It was very clean, the bed was very soft and cozy and the best part to me was the sparkling tile floor. I'm not a big fan of rugs in hotel bedrooms. We had breakfast every morning in the cafe and ate dinner at the asian restaurant. All of our meals were delicious. The gym was perfectly sized for a resort. We never had to wait for a machine. I would go for a run out on the grounds-it's about 3.5 to the front gate and back-when I returned a fresh towel and water bottle was waiting for me. Relaxing by the pool on a Bali Bed was one of the highlights of our trip. With our hectic lives back home, I couldn't think of another way to spend our days. The views from the beds were spectacular and the service was fantastic. We would have our lunch there, we were offered a cold towel and Leslie truly knows how to make a delicious pina colada! Overall, I would recommend the Gran Melia to anyone who wants to take romantic getaway in absolute paradise. ","annotations":[]}
