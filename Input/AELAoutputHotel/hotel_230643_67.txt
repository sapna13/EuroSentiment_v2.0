{"text":"Nice hotel, Barcelona itself a BIG let down! Nice hotel, recently renovated, but very pricey drinks in the bar, breakfast\/food  mini bar (I had to pay √ä√£¬¢7 for 3 little bottles of coke out of the mini bar!!) - the rooms themselves are lovely although very noisy, according to the room info their all soundproofed but they can't be if I could hear the people next door using the toilet! The cleaners are very persistant banging on the doors in the morning and despite the do not disturb sign went in and cleaned my room, with the do not disturb sign thrown on the floor when I got back. It would have been nice if they were more courtious about not disturbing people and shouting down the corridors to one another at only 9am in the morning when people have had late nights and\/or are trying to get showered to go out.I have to say, apart from the Gaudi interest I really dont see what the appeal is about Barcelona - we were stared at constantly all weekend, the locals were very rude, there were prostitutes at night lingering the streets in intimidating groups, lots of homeless, pick pocketers (a man in our hotel had √ä√£¬¢300 stolen from his pocket on La Ramblas), the locals forced us into the road off the small pavements because they weren't prepared to compromise or give way and it was VERY expensive and I had 2 men approach me within a five minute period the first one running his fingers down my bare arms and making suggestive comments, when told to leave me alone I was greeted with a mouthful of english swear words, the second one just a few minutes later aimed straight for me trying to kiss me and touch me - both of these men were dirty, unkept, dodgy and very frightening and the unsafe feeling I got stayed with me all weekend. I smiled at everybody I made eye contact with in the streets and not one person smiled back, I met some American girls who said they had been told there was times in the day which are sociably acceptable to look at them and make eye contact, whether or not this is correct I'm not sure but I definately felt like we weren't welcome.There was old women begging everywhere for money and even whilst trying to get money out of the ATM in the bank opposite the hotel there was homeless people sleeping on the floor.The only good thing I have to say is about the Gaudi church which is still being completed, it was lovely, however, I wouldn't recommend Barcelona as a place to anyone and I would NEVER step foot back in this city! I've done some travelling in my lifetime but this has got to be the worst place I have ever been by far! Luckily I was my girly friends and we all made the most of it and really enjoyed each others company, but had I have been on my own there I would have been petrified.
