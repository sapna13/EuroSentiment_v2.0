{"text":"FANTASTIC! A+ HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE! BEST SERVICE! 5 stars overall!!!! The Langham Place in Mongkok has A+++ service! It is a beautiful hotel with various facitilies to suit families and business travellers.The service at this hotel is 5 stars. The staff are always friendly, willing to help, and will give you information where ever you need. Every single person who we encountered were fantastic and provided only the best customer service. As for the rooms they were presented beautifully and the option to choose a scented pillow for your individual needs is great. The room also has internet access in which you can connect to broadband services and there is also basic internet browsing on the tv. The other technology is the CISCO phones which allow you to get information about Hong Kong, foreign currency rates and you able to view maps on the screen. The ipod\/mp3 dock was also very useful in this day in age when everyone has one. The higher levels in which were staying were great you could see a great view! Overall very impressed with the rooms! This trip was certainly made better by the club L room - this level gives you free access to the internet, various books to read, a FANTASTIC view, and food and drinks always on hand. The best thing about this is that it is open 24hrs and there is always people on hand to help you - either for directions or different enquires. However the other facilities are great with an extensive gym, sauna,pool, spa, sitting rooms and dining areas.The location is great! It is in central Mongkok and there are various shops just across the street. I appreciated the accessibility to everything - for those tourists there were the ladies markets and various other attractions. The MTR is right nearby and therefore makes it easy to get to around Hong Kong. So overall with the helpful people, the lovely rooms, the location of the place and the great facilities it combines to make it a pleasurable hotel to stay. Would defintely stay there again! 5 stars!
