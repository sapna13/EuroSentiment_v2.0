{"text":"this is the best part of san juan the rest of the city I am not too crazy about especially after just been to aruba. we stayed at the club floor which is the lobby level. one benefit is that you avoid waiting for elevator that some people complained about. the balcony faces the garden and pool and very restricted view of the sea, it is bigger than the regular balcony, it can fit in a round table. the garden and pool are beautiful and plenty of lounge chairs. the chairs on the beach are free. the club floor has a nice club room with free continental breakfast and free cocktail hour from 5-7 with all you can drink and snacks. We ventured to OSJ one day, took the bus in front of the hotel all the way to the end, saw part of the city on the way ( taxi would go on freeway). at the pier, there are two free trolley buses you can take. you can get off any time and reboard and see most of OSJ with minimal effort . we had a nice lunch at Il perugino In OSJ.fontana di roma in howard johnson has good food and frienly family style dining. Pikoya in the museum is high end, the food is very good. Atlantica has the best fried calamali but the other items were not so good. we were not impressed with miro and BLT. the pool restaurant at the hotel is excellent for lunch, we ate hot dog and hamburger there three times. Although the hotel is excellent, we don't like SJ that much to warrant a return visit.
