{"text":"Can't get much better than this! This is without a doubt the best hotel I've ever stayed in. The staff were top notch and provided a lot of personal service, great recommendations and a relaxed and friendly vibe. The property itself is awesome in a nice location near the Rambla, but far enough removed so that once inside your sleeping room you hear nothing but silence (unless you've returned after turn down when you'll hear the Tivoli radio playing soft classical music). The rooms are funky, minimalist, and quite comfy. The bed was awesome, there was adequate storage for clothes and extra luggage on the shelves, and the save was very convenient. The bathroom was amazing...words cannot do that shower justice. It did my enviro mind well knowing that water was solar heated and being re-used, b\/c I definitely lingered in that shower for longer than normal! The vertical garden was a nice and unique touch, and the shade was great for creating a completely dark room. Across the hall, the lounge was so nice to come back to after a long day in the city. We'd pick up some drinks and snacks in the Tentempie (no addl. cost, of course!) and relax on the sofa while watching the nice sized LCD TV. I also opened the terrace doors a couple of times and chilled out in the hammock. Breakfasts were awesome...pancakes were amazing and like nothing I can make at home. The rooftop terrace was very nice and provided a beautiful view of the city and Tibidabo, and on the crowds below heading to\/from the Rambla. So, now for the negatives. The lighting in the room and lounge was not very good, but was adequate in the bathroom. Some of the light switches seemed not to operate anything or function correctly. The TV in the room had different (and less) channels available than the one in the lounge. Minor complaint I know, but it just seemed a bit strange. There were more English channels available in the lounge, which is where I watched the most TV...go figure. The wooden bikes looked very cool, and we were hoping to take a couple out for an hour or so for a ride to the beach. I never saw anywhere that there was an additional cost for the bikes before booking, however they quoted a rental rate of something like 15 euro for a 1\/2 day per bike. While that is not painfully expensive, I think they could do a better job of advertising the bikes as an amenity that costs extra. The only other negative is that I'm not still there.
