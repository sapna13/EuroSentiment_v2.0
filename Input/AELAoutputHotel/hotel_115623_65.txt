{"text":"Fine hotel, but for the $$$ we expected more We booked our final nite in San Fran at the Mark Hopkins because we wanted it to be a buffer for end-of-vacation blues. Having researched online (frommers\/trip advisor) we picked MH for its views and luxury as well as top of the hill location. We booked a KING room with VIEW (so not the lowest price offering). Upon check in we were informed we'd been given an upgrade to a suite (we figured it was from the Amex Platinum card automatic upgrade feature). So we go to our suite which in on the 16th floor (19th floor is where Top of the mark is). Our suite is this odd shaped room with the bathroom inbetween the bedroom and some weird little glass room that overlooks the roofs mechanical systems and has patio furniture in it (table and 4 chairs). The bathroom is only private if you close the bedroom door and the extra room's door. There were 2 double beds in the room. We booked a King and this upgrade was no upgrade. So we called down and asked to be moved and got a king room on the 14th floor (view looking out toward the bay but mainly saw the Hotel Huntington and that area). We were right in front of the elevator area but we just decided to stay there.The room was pretty small but the king bed was very comfortable, good linens and pillows. Nice bathrobes provided. Turndown service was two ghiradelli squares, no water. Overall the room was nice but not wow. At nite we went up to Top of the Mark for cocktails (we weren't up for the prix fixe menu at 7:30pm). We got there about 7:45pm and had to wait 15 mins to get a table for a drink. We had called the concierge and asked if they could make us a reservation at the Tonga Room over at the Fairmont. The concierge never called us back so after waiting around we called them again and they had not called the restaurant...more waiting for confirmation (we should have just called ourselves but since it was only 2 hours before we wanted to dine over there we thought having the MH call would help land a table). Tonga Room, BTW, is campy and fun.Overall we preferred our stay at the Harbour Court Hotel which is where we did the first half of our vacation and loved that hotel and paid 50% less for the room there. MH feels a little too corporate and if we want to do grand\/opulent\/luxury we will try the Fairmont or Mandarin next time.
