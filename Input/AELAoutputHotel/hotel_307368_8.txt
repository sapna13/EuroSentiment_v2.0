{"text":"Oh my god! the best hotel i`ve ever stayed in! WOW! this place is fantastic, they totally spoiled us and the service was absolutely amazing! nothing was too much trouble, everything was perfect.we only stayed for one night for a special birthday treat but it was worth every penny. the views were wonderful, the restaurant was really really pricey (900 pounds for 4 people for 5 course set menu and champagne) but [----] good. we spent a lot of time people watching in the lounge which was nice, lots of famous japanese stars as well as the odd international star. the staff in there were incredible, always attentive but not overbearing (we stayed there for 5 hours and no-one minded). the afternoon tea was so good. breakfast was a 3 course affair with perfectly cooked bacon and eggs (which i had totally been craving). my friend whose birthday it was said she felt they treated her like a princess.you have to visit the bar just for the lost in translation film references - but in here the cocktails were gorgeous, try the fries cooked in duck fat for a good accompaniment to the drinks. they do have a cover charge but i think this is to put off the torists coming to take snaps of the bar and protect your experience. only criticism would be the bad jazz in the bar on sunday night, and the fact that i had to check out at noon! - actually, the fact that i had to check out at all!if i had the money i would have stayed here for my whole time in tokyo - but i don`t think that i would ever leave the place to see the city!
