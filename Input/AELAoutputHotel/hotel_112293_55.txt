{"text":"Clean Hotel We stayed here because of the feedback it received from people on this website. I wouldnt say I was dissapointed but it wasnt what I expected. Upon arrival we parked in the hotels underground car park and checked in. Staff all looked very unhappy and we all got the impression they didnt want to be there, unfreindly and not even a little smile! Anyway back to the hotel....The room was wonderfully clean, compleatly spotless and of a reasonable size. We had a view of a brick wall and a small roof but we wernt there to look out of the window so this didnt bother us. The free internet in the rooms was brilliant and worked perfectly. There were no amenities or anything else in this hotel but we knew that before staying there. Location wise it was OK. Yes it does have some fantastic little places to eat within walking distance and loads of shops. It was a 20 minute walk up hill to the famous part of Lombard Street and possibly 30-40 mins to fishermans walk but there is a tram stop at this location so we took this to get us places. We eventually got fed up with this uphill walk and took a bus that goes just behind the hotel and is regular. We did have a car but parking was expensive and didnt want the hassle, public transport was good. Union Square was to far to walk and about $10 in a cab.I would recommend this hotel, its good value for money but next time I would like to be a little nearer the attractions such as fishermans walk \/ Union Square etc without having to take transport all the time as we spend most of our time in these places.
