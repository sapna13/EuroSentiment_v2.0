{"text":"Not that great...actually not very good at all I think this hotel is over rated and my overall stay was unsatisfactory. Unfortunately there was construction happening next door to the hotel which meant we were woken each morning by a jack hammer at 6.30am on week days. This admittedly is out of the hotel's control and just bad luck but we also had the room next to us playing their techno music so loud we could hear it clearly through the walls (even WITH the jack hammer in the background).The pool in the lobby is a quirky (some might say 'cool') feature but the unglamourous reality of it is that you can smell the overpowering scent of chlorine through out the hotel: in the lobby, in the breakfast room while having breakfast etc. which is not pleasant.Perhaps most importantly is that the Hotel QT is not cheap. For a supposedly reasonably priced boutique hotel it cost us $340 a night ($388 inclusive of all the taxes) for a twin bed room per night. And we stayed for 9 nights! With all the problems we had I will go elsewhere next time I'm in New York. With the rate we were charged I really feel we could've got more for our money elsewhere.Lastly, I know that some people prefer to stay in midtown in the centre of things but Times Square is heaving with crowds of mostly tourists 24\/7. After getting to know New York better during my vacation the areas of Soho, Greenich Village  the east side with their great shops, cool boutiques and restaurants are more appealing locales to stay in the city whilst still being central.
