{"text":"Overall a beautiful resort but with some pitfalls... Just got back from a 7 night stay at the Padma. Overall we had a very pleasant stay. We paid extra for the Club Lounge benefits and were moderately satisfied with what was on offer. The coctail\/drinks hour from 5-7pm with canapes was great for the first few nights but became a little dissapointing towards the end. The drinks were slow to come out and the empty platters were not getting replaced. The option to have breakfast in with the main dining hall, in room or at the private restaurant (Bella Rossa) overlooking the ocean was great. Breakfast at Bella Rossa was just beautiful and a definite highlight of the hotel. The hotel pool (and deck chairs) is not big enough to cater for all the guests. Although i disliked doing it, you must reserve your deck chairs with your towel before breakfast if you want to get a seat. The rooms were average. We stayed on the top floor ( with balcony). The real difference between the top  ground floor is the bathroom. The bathrooms on the ground floor are much nicer but we wanted a balcony. An upgrade to the bathrooms on the top floors are in deperate need. The bath\/shower were disgusting with its dirty, smelly old shower curtain. Apparently the standard rooms in the hotel arent nice at all. So overall if you stay at the Padma its worth paying the extra for the Garden Club privledges.Other positives included the excellent gym facilities, friendly staff, beautiful grounds and great location.
