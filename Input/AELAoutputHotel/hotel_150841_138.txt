{"text":"exceeded our expectations! We took a chance with Iberostar Bavaro. For the number of days we stayed there (8 days) it cost us about half of what it usually does in other highly-rated beach properties we had gone to. That the resort got such high ratings in trip advisor got us curious. The other thing was the availabilitly of direct flights and very short travel time to Dominican Republic.As we were being driven to the resort we thought, well we get what we pay for so we psyched ourselves up accordingly. Lo and behold! Iberostar Bavaro was just such a wonderful surprise. The property is extensive, grounds very well-maintained, staff very attentive, food good and drinks overflowing, sand and sea front fantastic! Iberostar Bavaro is one of 3 Iberostar properties in Punta Cana. The other 2 being Iberostar Punta Cana and Iberostar Dominicana. I believe these properties are at different grades though so that Bavaro is the prime property. The 3 are in one mini-city, fully-loaded (with a variety of restaurants, ATMs, a spa, a gym, clay tennis courts, local crafts, boutiques, casino, beach bars, hugh pools, aqua sports) that you don't need to leave the property at all. As guests in Bavaro, we were entitled up to 4 reservations in restaurants of our choice (beware! No walk-in's allowed in the restaurants unlike the buffet halls). We picked Mediterranean, the Steak House, Oriental. Then went again with the Seafood Mediterranean because the fish was just wonderful and the buffet appetizers (stuffed peppers with tuna, fried calamari with marinara sauce, seafood ceviche and salads) were worth a second trip. It was very surprising that for a resort of its size and accessibility, we never felt crowded at any time at all. Even the buffet halls, with its high ceilings, always felt airy. I had horrors of long lines at the buffet, long searches for seats but there were absolutely none the entire time we were there.The resort offered evening entertainment where families and couples could watch and even participate in! They had spoofs (sometimes cheesy), variety shows, games, dancing and singing, some film-showing. The nightly one- hour show ends at about 1030pm. However in the other Iberostar properties next door, there was open-air dancing with a live band. Late party-goers can then have a drink or snack at the buffet hall from 11pm-3am!If I can think of a caveat it will be for light sleepers. Make sure you book a room far enough from where the action is. Our room was in the 1300's, close to the beach pool and was peaceful.My husband and I had the most relaxing vacation and are seriously considering checking out other Iberostar properties next time in the Mediterranean.
