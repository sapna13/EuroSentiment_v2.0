{"text":"Great Place to be The hotel is well located and as a family it would cost about UDS10-12 to taxi from Tokyo Station which is what we did until we had time to get our bearings right instead of lugging bags through strange passageways. The staff are professional though some slightly aloof but almost all we met spoke great English and even delivered maps and directions clearly marked right up to our room at night. We found that we did not really need our heavy guidebooks. The cleaning staff were so courteous and honest and highly consistent. Depsite our mess the room always welcomed us in superb and almost identical generous fashion each evening. We had small rooms with railway noise though soft , despite request for quiet room. The bathroom is space-age with great auto toilets (in fact greatest toilets in the world are in Japan!). However if you are obese find another hotel! Literally the bathtub took its entire length and the width was 2.5 times the width of the bathtub. The heated mirror was great and the Thai (Thann) toiletries soothing. We found such an amazing choice of restaurants in the surriunding areas that we did not need to eat in the hotel. With JR pass we used the subway free of charge just by sticking to the JR Yamamote Line-(just show to the attendents do not bother with subway tickets on this line) gets you to Akihabara, Shinjuku etc from Shimbashi Stn which is 10-15 minutes walk. The secret to finding the hotel is to follow signs to Hamamatsucho (monorail station). Tokyo is amazingly safe even at night, There is a Family Mart downstairs as well as the AM\/PM mini supermarket. Stock up on drinks and snacks for the next adventure in this great megapolis. There is even a Sinagpore Hainan Chicken rice Rest. and Vie de France (see petite Japanese ladies roll out french pastries!) in Shiodome City Centre. Tsuijiki Fish market (15 minutes walk) great experience with almost alien species there but traffic in there can be dangerous.
