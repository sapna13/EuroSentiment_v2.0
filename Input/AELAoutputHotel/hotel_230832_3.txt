{"text":"Fantastic Duc de la Victoria My wife and I stayed in this hotel for five days and loved every minute of it. We accepted the offer of an upgrade to a Junior Suite for a price and were glad we did. The suite had an enormous bedroom with a king bed with an attached sitting room with lounge, bar fridge and second TV. The bathroom was large with bath\/shower decorated in marble with all of the expected amenities. Our room overlooked the central courtyard, not offering views but was extremely quiet. The air conditioning functioned as it should and was extremely quiet. The room was spotless on arrival and was kept this way for our entire stay.The breakfast area was well appointed and the staff very helpfull. The breakfast itself had everything a traveller could ask for.We had a car and were very pleased that the hotel had parking in a parking station within a two minute walk.We had a small problem with an attempted robbery whilst driving into Barcelona with some resultant minor damage to our vehicle. The hotel front desk staff could not have done more to help us resolve this issue. The location of the hotel could not have been better. In the old heart of the city only moments away from all the attractions this wonderfull city has to offer and in a pedestrian precinct so no problems with traffic or noise. La Rambla is only a 200 metre stroll from the front door offering many wonderfull restaurants and attractions and all forms of transport are equally close by.We will go back to this amazing city and stay again at this hotel.
