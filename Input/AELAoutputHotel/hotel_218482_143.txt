{"text":"Good resort and a couple of hints . . . Hola! Just returned from the Catalonia Bavaro. Enjoyed the stay. When you go, keep in mind a couple of things. Seems face cloths are an unheard of thing, so if you want one, bring your own. Towels were brought upon request. Bed wasn't the most comfy, but by the end of the week was fine. Lots of bottled water and local beer in the room fridge and by request. Leave notes on your pillow with a couple of US $1 and small candies, pencils, etc. Housekeeping staff seemed trustworthy and all seemed appreciative of the tips. The food was good... lettuce was available (not like Cuba), other vegetables and fresh fruits and juices also. Oatmeal at breakfast was fabulous!! We enjoyed the Japanese restaurant and the pool snack bar\/restaurant. Men may not wear open-toed shoes, shorts or sleeveless shirts in the restaurants (ok for buffets). Make your reservations early! In general, staff were good, but didn't seem very happy... except the fellows at the pool\/beach. (watch out for the 'chicken nazi' at the pool bar, though!)Loved the ability to walk on the beach for seeming miles. Kayaks were good too. If bare breasts bother you, you probably will be more comfortable at the pool area. Local 'merchants' are willing to ask for your business, but are not too pushy like Cancun. Only buy jewelry from an assured source... check 925 on the silver. My 'amber' turned out to be plastic.Enjoyed our room patio - shady with a hammock and rocking chairs. Great retreat from the crowded pool and hot sun.Brush up on your Spanish basics... many staff do not speak much english.Gracias! Enjoy!
