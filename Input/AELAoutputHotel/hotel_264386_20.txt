{"text":"Seedy mid-grade motel After the hairy 3.5 hour drive in traffic from San Juan airport we arrived at this property. It has a beautiful entrance drive and respectable lobby. After that it goes downhill. It took us 30 mins to check in because they had lost the booking of the people ahead of us and our booking too. There was only one person working the desk and she was also handling all phone calls in and around the property. There were no bellmen around when we arrived but some surfaced after we got settled in the long check in line. I switched rooms after my first night but neither matched my booking. The first was a double and the second a king handicapped room. Both were satisfactory by motel standards but both had various damage such as scuff marks on the walls, pee soaked blanket, broken shower head, low water pressure, worn appliances, toilet seat won't stay up, loud noise from the hallway, shower at crotch level, shower doesn't drain well, super loud window A\/C unit with the sound of marbles bouncing around, unmuffled noise from pool area and band, service attitude that the guests are here for the staff, not the other way around.The guests here seem to be overwhelmingly from New York, of middle class, 50+ lbs overweight, families with kids. You _will_ hear screaming kids here.The pool area is fine with a sunken swim up bar. The beach is fine but steep, maybe 10 yards from beach head to water at low tide.There is free internet in the lobby and it can also be accessed from a few rooms close to the lobby. Otherwise you'll see many people camped in the lobby to check their email. I've avoided the restaurants and eaten away from the hotel. The local area is fairly run down and does not have many attractive places to go.At night there is a two person band with tape backup playing at the pool bar until around midnight. They play with a very tired attitude - even poppy songs sound like muzak in their hands. ","annotations":[]}
