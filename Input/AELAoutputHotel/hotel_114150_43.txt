{"text":"Outstanding Location My husband and I stayed at the Millennium Bostonian for 5 nights for our anniversary at the end of July. As most reviews have expressed, I was getting weary about my hotel choice but hoped for the best. Check-in was effortless and our room was definitely not a Motel 6 and definitely not luxury as the brochure states (I'd say it was more like a nice Hampton Inn). We booked our trip on Priceline and didn't pay a luxury price so I was not disappointed in the least. This was our first trip to Boston and the hotel couldn't have been in a better location. It really is central to everything you would want to see and do. Most definitely take the metro train system (which is located about 2 blocks from the hotel) as it is by far the easiest way to get around Boston including getting to Cambridge and Fenway Park. We did not eat or drink at the hotel as the prices were quite high and there are too many other places that have real character. We spent a lot of time in the North End and had a fabulous meal at Villa Francesca. The waterfront is about 2 blocks away with great restaurants, parks and views of the harbor (take a sunset cruise). Quincy Market and Faneuil Hall are located directly across the street (shop and eat till you drop) and the Old Union Oyster House is right around the corner. If you like beer, the Samuel Adams brewery tour is a must as well as a pub crawl through Cambridge. Harvard Square is gorgeous and has some of the best pubs and food in the area. Do the Fenway Park tour (and catch a game if you can find tickets, we found some on-line) as the Green Monster might not be there forever. If you are into history, a guided tour of the Freedom Trail is a must. We only took a cab to and from the airport as everything is accessible by walking or by the metro. Overall, the hotel was in a perfect location, the concierge is extremely helpful, the accommodations were more than adequate (the bed is extremely comfortable), we did not have any problems with the noise level in or around the hotel and, if we do go back to Boston, we'll most definitely stay at this hotel but will only be booking through a discount hotel website. Enjoy your trip, we certainly did!
