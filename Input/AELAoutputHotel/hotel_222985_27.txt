{"text":"Horrible Service! This was my first trip to Miami and I hate to say, my WORST hotel stay ever. The hotel is very hard to find. It took us over an hour to locate even though we were less than a mile away from it off the interstate. The only signs on the hotel are the Ho and Suites sign that you see light up at night and the small one you see when directly in the luggage drop off area. After we finally found the hotel we were made to pay cash for a $19 a night valet charge. Upon checking in, we were made to give a credit card, although paid in full which I was fine with. Except for the fact that without letting me know it was being done, they put a funds hold on my credit card. The rooms are very cold since they are not carpeted as well as not cleaned well. There was dirt all over the bathroom and in the corners of the bedroom. I can completely see why the rooms are so dirty since after our first night we were not even given maid service until 5pm the next day at which time we refused service since we were getting ready for dinner. When I noticed on the second day of my stay that I had a hold on my credit card the man at the desk, in his broken english, told me that I would have to speak to a manager, whom happens to always be conveniently not available. Upon check out of the hotel I was told that I could not see a manager and the hold on my card would be reversed in 2 to 3 hours. Two days later, since the hold was still on my credit card, I searched and searched for a phone number for the hotel, since if you call 411 the phone number is not listed under anything, called the hotel to again try to speak to a manager or get a corporate phone number. Come to find out the managers are only there Monday through Friday from 9-5 and they are independently owned so you can not call a corporate office for complaints or problems. The one good part of the hotel would be the bartender, he was the ONLY friendly employee. ","annotations":[]}
