{"text":"OK but not great Myself and my boyfriend traveled to Dreams Punta Cana Resort on 23rd June for 10 nights. I was a little unsure of what to expect from reading some of the reviews but it wasn't as bad as some people make out. The drive from the airport to the hotel was quite scary to say the least. The Dominicans are lunatic drivers and the roads are full of potholes but you are in a poor country so what would you expect other than same! We didn't receive our glass of champagne on arrival but we didn't mind. The staff were very friendly and check in was very swift. We requested a double room in one of the newly renovated building blocks and thankfully we got same. The room was clean, the air conditioning worked and the mini bar was stocked. The room was compact but we weren't going to be spending much time in it. The pool was absolutely beautiful, just like in the brochure, however the BEACH was not so nice. We were very disappointed. There was seaweed all over it and the water wasn't what you would call caribbean water! It was very rough and full of rocks. I was told by one guest that the beach is actually not on the caribbean sea but on the Atlantic Ocean. We felt let down by this. You think of the caribbean and you think of white sand, turquoise water etc but not at Dreams. This hotel is fantastic for children and really it caters for all ages. The entertainment team made our trip, 50 cent, mickey mouse, usher, lucas and michael jackson. They were fantastic. Activities are arranged throughout the whole day, you'll not be bored.The mexican restaurant was disguisting. The french restaurant was beautiful, food very good. The chinese, oceanic and seaside restaurants were all just ok. The menus are quite limited and are never changed. The world cafe was ok but you got tired of the buffet over time. We got very sick from the food and were confined to our room for the last 2 days. Only drink bottled water and don't use ice cubes. Stay away from salads as the salad leaves etc are washed in the dirty water. Make sure you bring tablets for stomach aches and the other end!! You will definitely need them. We had a good trip but wouldn't go back, not because of the hotel but becuase we like to experience different places. I hope this review will be of some use to someone.
