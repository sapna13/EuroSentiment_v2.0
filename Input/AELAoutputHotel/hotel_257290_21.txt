{"text":"Wonderful Hotel Getting There: While a taxi is the quickest means to get to the hotel, I would strongly recommend (especially for those traveling solo) taking instead the subway, which will be about one-quarter of the cost of a taxi (including return). The subway stops at both the international and domestic terminals of the airport. Take it to the Wynyard Station and exit on York Street. Look to your left; the hotel is on the very next block, about 100 meters away. (It took me, from the time my plane landed in Sydney to the time I arrived at the hotel, exactly one hour; that included the time during which I had to wait to get my bags as the carousel.)Rooms: My room was fairly large. The bed was comfortable, and there was a fair amount of storage space. I had a refrigerator but no microwave. The staff at the Travelodge is very courteous and more than willing to answer questions and provide assistance to patrons.Fun: The Travelodge is in the heart of Sydney. It is about a 10-minute walk from Circular Quay and Sydney Tower, and 20-25 minutes from the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Circular Quay where the Sydney Opera House is located; it is also where one can catch the harbor ferries. Food: There is a restaurant at the hotel. Breakfast runs $20 (Australian) for the continental buffet and $25 for the hot buffet. Dinner will cost about $17-25 per entr√ã√\u2022√ñe. If you are on a tight budget or want to eat away from the hotel, there are numerous restaurants and bakeries nearby. I found several bakeries at Wynyard Station, and there is even a grocery store there. One can go through the station into one of the downtown shopping markets. For those looking for a quick cup of coffee or snack, Starbuck√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ is located across the street from the hotel. (Head toward Wynyard Station on York Street; you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ miss it.) Fitness: Sydney is an easy city to walk around. If you are looking for a gym, the hotel does have a fitness center, located on the 21st (top) floor. It has an elliptical machine, treadmill, bike, rowing machine, and dumbbells up to 10 kg. Internet: While there is internet access in the room, it is pricey. On the lobby floor are three computers that offer internet at the cost of $1 for 20 minutes time. One can also print material off at 20 cents a page. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1689,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1683}]}
