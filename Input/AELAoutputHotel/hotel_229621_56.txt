{"text":"Splendidly too quiet for me, though nice for the right person. I stayed here a few months ago. It was my first time traveling based on reviews from Tripadvisor.comWell, I learned that I am not looking for the same things as most travelers. Everyone seems concerned with how posh and quiet it is. I am only 34 and when I go out of town, I want to experience the city. The hotel plays a large part in that experience as I am always going too and from it.The neighborhood is nice, but a sleepy bedroom community, for Paris that is. While sightseeing you have to pass all the fun communities with plentiful cafes and parks to come back to the Splendid. I would have preferred a hotel in the 6th, 5th near the Pantheon or Ile de la Cite, after visiting them. There you have more cafes with the chairs on the sidewalks in rows, and art galleries and tons of unique boutiques, bakeries and more. That being said, it may be the perfect hotel for those who want peace and quiet ( though there is a bar down the sidestreet, that you can hear drunks yelling sometimes. I ran to my balcony to watch, excited by the prospect of life, they were too far to see though.) The streets had few people and no street life. Granted, it was August.The Champs is very close, but mostly just a bunch of shops I have here. Walk through it on your way to somewhere.The Arc de Triomphe is close, but once you have seen it...The hotel was nice. I paid a little more than I wanted to because of the reviews on here. I would have gladly paid more for a more idealized Parisian neighborhood and atmosphere. Like on TV, and that is what you get in the other neighborhoods I mentioned.I had some form of junior suite. Walk through the door,then a little cloakroom or place to put luggage and hang coats with a door that shut it from the bedroom, then the bedroom, pretty windows that sealed off traffic noise, a balcony, then to the right of the bedroom is a little sitting room, and off of that the bathroom, which was very nice and large for Europe. Semi-mildewy shower curtain. The room had a balcony and a view of a pretty Cap-Gemini Consulting office building. Nothing at all to look at to the left or the right.Breakfast was good! I liked it. Not too different from other hotels I have stayed at in London. Bins with eggs, bacon and sausage in one small area, and a longer table with breads, meats, cheeses, fruit, cereal and beverages. The entire breakfast room is smaller than most master bedrooms in the U.S. I look forward to breakfast as I like to see the other travelers and get my bearings for the day.There is not a bar that I noticed and no place where other patrons congregate or one can talk to the staff in a less formal manner.Overall, a nice place, but not worth the #8 spot on here in my opinion. Not even close. Tripadvisor needs to come up with a better ratings system besides singles, families and romance.
