{"text":"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly The location of this hotel can not be beat if you would like to stay within walking distance of Times Square and the theater district. Request a room on a high floor with a view and you will not be disappointed. The good: the customer service at this hotel is exemplary. The employees are helpful and aim to please. If you have any problems with your stay and talk to the employees about the problem in a calm manner, they will be very happy to please you. We stayed here during the Easter holiday weekend, and the bad is things were not perfect. We arrived well ahead of check-in time, and as the hotel was sold out the night prior to our arrival, rooms were not ready. We completed our early check in, dropped our bags with the bell-hop, and proceeded to site see in the city. Mistake #1: we assumed that a call back to check on the status of our rooms was not necessary, although they will give you a card with information to do so. I suggest you do make the call. When we arrived back to the hotel at 4:00PM (an hour after the official check-in time and six hours after we completed the early check-in process), one of the rooms in our party was not ready. They sent the family we were traveling with to the room after the computer showed it was clean. When the family arrived, it was not clean. The hotel quickly relocated the family to a suite. This particular suite was in a different part of the building. While the room had no view, it did have a very nice computer and access to a free continental breakfast and happy hour in a separate lounge area. The bathroom was larger, but the rest of the room did not seem any bigger than the room we had. The hotel also deducted 100.00 from the price of the room for the trouble the family went through with the room not being ready by check-in time. We had three problems of our own: they misplaced a bag, which they quickly found; the outlets stopped working after my daughter and I both used hairdryers at the same time (which was fixed within ten minutes); and the water was tepid on the day we checked out (they explained there was some problem they were working on that affected some rooms that day.) When I checked out and was asked, How was your stay? I informed the clerk of the three problems we encountered. The clerk for our room also made a nice deduction from our tab for the inconveninces we experienced. Both rooms were also provided coupons for numerous free drinks at one of the hotels two restaurants (including Shula's.)  The hotel itself reminded me of the Delano in Miami--two story high curtains; large white candles in glass containers the shapes of congos; a very modern feel to it--very nice in taste and decor. And again, the location was fantastic. Times Square and the theaters, are all within walking distance, as is Rockefeller Center for those whose stamina will allow them a fifteen to twenty minute walk. The subway, of course, is nearby as well. No ugly really exists for this hotel. The staff is extremely accomdating, so if you experience any problems, they will quickly remedy them. The location can't be beat. I am confident if you have a problem and calmly explain it to a front desk employee, they will do everything in their power to help you.
