{"text":"Pretty good stay overall We stayed in Seattle for one night here and the hotel itself was pretty nice. Check in was easy and we got to request a room on the top floor with a bay view earlier then the check-in time since we got there about 2 hours early. Check-in is at 3pm. We got a good rate on a King Bay view room with a kitchenette. The room was nice and big. There was a sitting room with tv. then the kitchen and bathroom. And, then you walked into the King room with a big window. The bed was super comfy!At first, we didn't think the neighborhood was very nice. It seemed a little ghetto as we drove down Western Avenue. But, we never walked down that way, we always walked up towards the Space Needle that was a short walk away. It was a nice walk too. The Queen Anne neighborhood just 2 blocks away was cute. There is a nice bar called Buckley's that we went to twice and it was enjoyable. It was very low key. We didn't walk to the market since it was a little too far to walk. It was only a mile or so but with some small hills on the way it wasn't our cup of tea. Instead we went to the Space Needle area and took the Monorail down to the Mall on 5th and walked 4 blocks to the market. It cost $4 round trip or $2 one-way.The free breakfast was great the next morning. They had a big buffet area and big seating room with dining tables. What was also nice was that they included free starbucks coffee packets in the rooms, and free popcorn. The only thing that sucked was no windows to open for fresh air and no fan in the bathroom. Kinda weird but I assumed they want to prevent smoking? Well, the toilet was clogged and they didn't have plungers in the bathroom so we had to have someone come up and plunge the toilet and replace the flusher. It wasn't too bad though, they were quick about it. The staff was nice.They had a suite shop in the lobby with snacks and beverages as well as souveniers to buy. I got a picture frame of $9 vs. $15 at a Seattle shop downtown. Go figure! They also provid toothbrushes and toothpaste for free if forgotten, which we did. The only thing I didn't like was that they charge $15 per car to park in their parking garage. I thought this was tacky. There was a parking lot adjacent that cost $5 to park until midnight all day on the weekends. But, we just paid the $15 to move our cars inside at night so they would be safe.Overall the stay was pretty good!
