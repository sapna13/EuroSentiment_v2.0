{"text":"Noisy, useless internet, robotic staff Checkin was quick - I had goofed up and was supposed to arrive the day before but the hotel still charged me a penalty of one day for not arriving but I wasn't surprised as this is just standard practice.The check-in staff are robots. I asked for a quiet room but didn't get it. My room was facing towards the harbour and it was very noisy - there was like a very loud train shunting noise or a bit like a pile driver that used to go on all night till 3.30am every night I was there. I was with a group who were on a business conference and anyone on the harbour side got this noise but if you were on the other side it wasn't there. Some of the group I was with also complained but got various answers as to what it was. I was there only 3 days and I just put up with the noise to the point where I got used to it.The hotel wi-fi internet was included in my room rate but it had a very annoying habit of loggin me out every 10 to 15 minutes. This also happened to other people in my group and we were doing presentations in the hotel and it was very annoying doing an hour long presentation and having to re-login every 10 minutes in front of an audience. I complained to the front desk that there was a problem with the internet and they responded they couldn't do anything as it was an IT problem but they didn't even ask me what the problem was so I responded Are you going to ask me what the problem is? at which I got the standard answer that it was an IT matter and they couldn't do anything about it - they never asked me what the problem was. Just robots.The room rate they quote was S$310 then they put on a service charge of 10% which is something I only found out about at the checkout so the real room rate is $341 plus they add on 7%.GST so the total comes to S$365 per night. Why don't they just quote the true rate of $341 plus GST rather than add a 10% service charge\/tip. They charge me including service chage and GST S$148 to launder 2 shirts, 3 T-shirts, 2 underpants and 3 pairs of socks. They chaged me including service charge and GST S$124 to print 116 pages in the Biz Centre.Room furniture is cheap but I found the bed hard but good. They have a kettle in the room which I like if you want to make a cup of tea. The shower is small but always had hot water. Everything worked well except the internet.Breakfast was good and we had lunch one day in the restaurant on the ground floor and it was very good.If they fixed the internet,got rid of the noise and put in real people at the check-in I would go back but as this is not likely I will not be returning.
