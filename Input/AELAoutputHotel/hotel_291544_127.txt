{"text":"GREAT STAY  We booked this executive room directly through Hilton. It was not cheap being around 410 euros a night. But it was an inside courtyard room with a panoramic view of the Effiel Tower in the distance approx. one mile away and an exterior deck that was about 18' x 5' in size. We could enjoy the Parisian weather in the mornings and watch the Eiffel Tower light up in the evening. A feature of being on the top floor and what Hilton calls their executive room was that you had a self-serve continental breakfast which included eggs, bacon, sausage, rolls\/croissants, cereals and juices. American newspapers were also available on the counter. All during the day they have snacks and in the evening all the liquor and soft drinks you could want. Red and white wines, vodka, bourbon, gin, cognacs and many others there although the wines were low end. Once again pour yourself as many or as few drinks as you desire. Also offered were several snacks like peanuts, chips and a couple of warm chicken satay or beef rolls, cheese and breads.  The room was good size approx.18 x 26 with a nicely appointed marble floor in the bathroom and separate shower and tub. The room is simple decor with a light touch of art deco 1930;s style. Closet and drawer space was good as well as having ironing board and iron in the closet when needed.  The lobby has alot of color and the restaurant offers very high dinner prices . We chose not to eat there as there were several cafes in the surrounding neighborhood.  The staff was very competent and conceige always willing to help. It is about a ten minute walk to Arc De Triomphe. It has a great public park (Parc Monceau) 200 yards away from the entry of this property.Try to not get a street room as it can be a bit noisy as we experienced when we arrived and had our room changed to the inside courtyard. Very easy to get taxis from the front.SUMMARY: The Hilton Arc De Triomphe is a clean property and a little removed from the Champs Elysees but close enough to walk. The cafes are a couple to a few blocks away but close enough. The area is safe at night. You can just get a standard room but get the inside courtyard and not a outside room. Get the executive room and you will enjoy the spa downstairs, gym area and free food and liquor upstairs in the executive lounge. Our 8 day stay there was a good one as there are many areas to stay in Paris. If you want quiet, clean and a n English speaking staff then you might want to pursue this Hilton. There are 4 other Hiltons in Paris but my opinion this was the nicest. This is a two year old property that once was a police department. My wife and I walked for miles each day observing the marvels of Paris. As we returned each day from another outing, we both agreed how much we enjoyed this Hilton. and would return again.
