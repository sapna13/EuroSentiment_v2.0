{"text":"Excellent in most ways My husband and I recently stayed at the EPC from June 26 until July 2. I've been reading reviews of the resort for over and month and couldn't wait to go. In most ways, the resort was everything the reviews have claimed it to be. The beach was amazing- with shaded chairs and beds easily available. We sat on the beach for hours, played in the waves, and walked the shore line everyday. There are only a couple of shops on each side of the resort and after the first day, the locals never bothered us again. I cannot say enought about how wonderful the beach was. Of course, the frequent drinks and delivered pizzas made the beach even better.Usually around 3:30 we would head over to the pools. Finding a raft was never difficult- although finding a chair in the shade was a bit more challenging. Truthfully, we only went to the pool to cool off and enjoy drinks from the swim up bar- and by 3:30 the bar was pretty well shaded anyway.I thought that our room was above average...that was our second room at least. The 1st room we were assigned was in building 14. It smelled moldy, and the air conditioning did not work. We immediately asked to move and found our 2nd room to be much better. We stayed in building 6 which was much closer to the action! It took a little while for the room to cool off- but after 24 hours it stayed rather chilly. The room was spacious and the bed gigantic! I am not sure what size the beds are, but we have a king sized at home and it was much larger than that!I would say that my only disappointment with EPC was the food. Perhaps I read too many awesome reviews of the restaurants and had too high of expectations. The food wasn't bad- just not excellent. (Excpet for at Agave- there the food was the best- although it was very hot in the dining room.) I will warn you that almost all of the meat entrees are covered in gravy...even at the Grill- where steak is their specialty. Many times we received a variation of what we ordered off the menu. We got many laughs out of trying to imagine how our entree might be different that it's discription. The funniest was when I ordered Apple pie with vanilla ice cream. I said to my husband If I only get vanilla icecream, I will be happy. He about died of laughter when I received my apple pie topped with orange sherbert. Wired. But like I said, the food wasn't bad- just not excellent. And you would probably like it even better if you are a fan of surprises! On a positive note, I highly recommend eating the lunches that are prepared on the beach. We ate the BBQ and the beef fajitas and they were awesome. Some of the best food we ate of the entire trip.Overall, we felt the EPC was a great value for the $. We stayed in their most basic room and enjoyed every minute of our trip. I say remember to have a sense of humor...and don't forget the sunscreen!
