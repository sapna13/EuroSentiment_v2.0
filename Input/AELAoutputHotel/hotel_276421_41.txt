{"text":"Would never go there again I did not have an enjoyable stay....at all. Yes there were some good things, but overall it was not the relaxing, fun vacation I was hoping for.The beach is great. The hotel nice and renovated...mostly, except the part where we had our rooms. The pools were good, but one was quite dirty. There is a nice coffee bar, one grose Caribbean restaurant, a good pizzeria, Mexican restaurant, and Asian restaurant. Unfortunately you have book quite in advance to get in. The buffet is pretty horrible, breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you are a tea drinker like me make sure you bring your own because they do not have any regular tea, the coffee on the other hand is really good. The drinks are not good, plain sugar. We tried to adjust them a bit, but most of the time it was very difficult to get any limes. The service was awful, except for a few people. Sometimes it felt like they were doing you a huge favor by doing anything for you and you get the feeling they really would rather be somewhere else. I think this was mostly the reason I had a bad time. If you think the service in Mexico is bad well think again. It is actually pretty good compared to the carelessness of the Dominicans. I thought I was being picky, but we heard similar things from other people within our hotel and travelers from different hotels.We arrived at around 8pm. Checking in was somewhat easy, but no one pointed us in the right direction of the room. So we wondered around for a bit until it turned out there was a whole other section of the hotel. We finally got a ride to our room, it turns out our whole ceiling is leaking and there is a huge puddle in the middle of the room, the bed spread is somewhat dirty. So we get another room, this one even farther than the last from the beach, pool, food etc. Of course the room has 2 beds instead of one king size. Sorry no other rooms available! The bathroom looks a bit old and the shower head barely works. After we settle in it turns you need a key for the safe, why they can't tell you this when you check in, I don't know. Also the window doesn't lock. They inform us the window will be fixed. And on the second day it still isn't, but that's a whole other story. There is an ice bucket, but getting ice from the bartender is difficult, of course there isn't an ice machine around. I hurt my foot and needed a wheelchair for a day, to get it was very difficult. Money exchange...yes they will gladly take your dollars for Dominican pesos, but to change it back is a challenge. Better expect to spend it all while you're there. They also have a habit of playing very loud music by the pool and beach with a very bad sound system and a sometimes skipping CD. If you like to get out of the resort there isn't much to see. We rented a car and were willing to see anything worth seeing and people just do not want to inform you of anything. We also went on a tour of which we did not get the appropriate info from the person who sold it to us.
