{"text":"Amazing beach, lackluster food and bedding My husband and I just got back from an eight-day stay at Excellence Punta Cana.The Good:Amazing beach. Powder soft sand, palm trees are gorgeous. Plenty of sunchairs and towels to lie on; reserve a bed early with towels if you want a chance of getting one. They also provide a lending library if you want a beach read.The landscaping is superb. Not a leaf is out of place. Excellent gym and spa. Gym is new with a seperate room for classes and a room for all the new machines. High ceilings, no funky sweat smell. Tennis pro (Rolando) is a great teacher for both new and experienced tennis players. The spa is also wonderful, with many services offered (I'd highly recommend the evening massage for two on the beach) in a calm, sophisticated setting.Great horseriding opportunities. I'm an experienced rider, and I cantered on the beach every other morning in the ocean surf. I wish they provided helmets and fed the horses a bit more, but the horses know there way around and the guides are friendly.Great after-dinner music for dancing on the main plaza.Honest employees. My credit cards accidentally fell out of my purse on the beach, and they were returned to me that night by the staff who found them. I was very appreciative!!Roaming waiters attended to you on the beach to keep your drink full.The Bad:After checking in, I wasn't escorted to the room and just given a map, which was a bit of a let down. I would have appreciated a guide to my room and explanation of the room's amenities.If I could make just one recommendation to the hotel, it would be to upgrade the bedding linens. The mattress was flat (no springs, just resting on a sheet of plywood), and the pillows were also flat. If you're used to softer down pillows, get ready for some neck-aches. The blanket was pilling, and the comforter was tired and old looking. Think Super 8 bedding quality. Not good. The toiletries were also very basic. I saw the excellence club offerings, the quality was pretty much the same (we used the money we saved on not going with the upgrade to spend on activities, etc.).The food is also lacking. The only thing the resort does well is pizza, but even that gets old after a while. Yes, I enjoy good dining options where I live in DC, but I felt the resort never provided a single consistently good meal beyond pizza. For example, I tried the shrimp, apple, and avocado appetizer at the French restaurant, and it tasted like nothing. Totally bland. Puff pastry with snails consisted of rock hard pastry and escargot minced beyond recognition. The evening restaurant food isn't inedible, but the results don't live up to their descriptions. The breakfast buffet had lots of options and a good egg station, and the lunch spread was decent.Agressive vendors are found at either end of the property. Questions are always the same: What's your name? Where are you from? First time to DR? I've got a present for you. Come look at my shop. They are very persistent.
