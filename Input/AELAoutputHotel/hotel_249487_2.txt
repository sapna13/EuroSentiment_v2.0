{"text":"The Staff are Exceptional I have stayed at the San Juan Water  Beach Club Hotel on 2 different trips 1 year apart and the exceptional level of friendly, professional service was identical on both visits. I travel a great deal with my job (30-40% of the time) and this is by far the best team of staff I have experienced anywhere. I was recommended this hotel by a local business colleague for my first visit to Puerto Rico. The staff make you feel as though you are the only guest staying at the hotel from the moment you arrive until you are on your way to the airport. The hotel itself is very chic and at night has a blue glow from all of the black lights used in the hallways and guestrooms (that can be turned off if desired). The rooms are not huge but are plenty roomy with an extremely comfortable bed, small desk and internet connection, flat screen TV and the best stocked (and affordable) mini bar ever! I never eat anything from the mini bar because the prices are usually ridiculous but not here - they are slightly more than you would expect to pay at a convenience store and the offerings are much better (I indulged a few times). The airconditioning is so efficient I had to turn it down when going to bed at night.The Water  Beach Club has a gourmet restaurant on the main floor and a rooftop bar. I never made it to the bar (and I never heard any noise from there either) but the food in the restaurant features exceptional fusion cuisine and is available via room service too.The hotel is located at the end of a dead-end court and looks over a white sand beach. It is barely 10 minutes from the airport and has many resturants within walking distance.Both of my stays were for business but I would certainly return for a romantic vacation with my wife since I found this hotel to be a relaxing destination at night after putting in long hours at work.All of this contributes to a great stay but it is the staff that make your stay exceptional and make you want to return. I was always impressed with the staff that addressed me by name as I came and went. The front doorman who negotiated my taxi fare in Spanish with the driver to ensure I was in good hands after leaving the property (without me asking him to do so) and giving me an ice cold bottle of water for my travels. The service is friendly, prompt and professional - what more can you want? It is all of these little things that are not so little that make The San Juan Water  Beach Club my only choice in Puerto Rico.
