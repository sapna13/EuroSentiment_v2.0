{"text":"At these prices - charging for Internet access is a sheer rip-off! A very nice modern hotel located at the southern tip of Manhattan by Battery Park. Comfortable rooms, top quality (Bulgari) toiletries, lots of staff on duty to hold open doors and generally fuss. In fact with their earpieces and cuff microphones, it did feel like the US Secret Service had taken over the hotel - arguably a bit pretentious. Does it really need two young people to hold open the doors and say hello and goodbye. One feels the room prices just reflect the top-heavy level of staffing. Ironically, when it came to getting my bags out of the baggage room on departure, the whole process came apart at the seams and it took close to 7 minutes to retrieve my luggage! That was funny.My room was towards the back so looked over a flat room and in the distance a building site and Apartments in a modern high rise block where no one seems to have curtains. Interesting goldfish-bowl views of modern New Yorkers' breakfast rituals with aproned nannies tending to toddlers. Do they not realise the hotel guests look into their apartments?My biggest beef about this place was the charge for Internet access. At over $430 per night, you would think they would throw in Internet access for free. If a Knights in in Horseheads, NY can do so for $35 per night, then why can't the Ritz Carlton - that is a sheer rip-off.I was attending a business function there and asked the Concierge to get some flowers for one of the participants. We wanted loud \/ brash \/ big \/ showy - what we got was (a) small and pretentious first time around and (b) slightly bigger and pretentious second time around. To add insult to injury, they never even provided me with a bill from the florist which is really inconvenient for when the time comes to claim expenses.I had dinner there one evening. Although I asked for a well done steak, it came out pretty red in the centre. It's not a hard thing to get correct and that was a let down - I had higher expectations. The restaurant on the ground floor has a dark moody evening restaurant ambience, unfortunately for a hotel which I guess caters for mainly business people, the dark tables remain darkened at breakfast too. An apologetic waiter recognised the problem and I heard him say this to other guests on both days. This is not a place to have breakfast if you want to do some reading in comfortable light. A serious design error.Overall, great rooms, great location, looks good, but let down by the details.
