{"text":"Lodging Option for Sox Fans? Over the last 5 years I have travelled to Boston twice a year to attend Red Sox games. I am constantly looking for an affordable, clean hotel that is within a short distance to Fenway Park. Sox fans staying at this hotel will have to either put out approx. $20 for cab fare to the park or walk to the nearest T-Station. There is an onsite shuttle service (Mercedes) but it will cost an extra $5-$10 on top of regular taxi fares. There are two subway options: 1) Green Line - Packard√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Corner which is an approx. 40 minutes walk southeast 2) Red Line - Harvard Square which is an approx. 45 minutes walk northeast. One recommendation is to have taxi drop you off behind the hotel, on Western Ave, to avoid the taxi from driving past the front of the hotel and having to turn a few miles down the road as Soldiers Field Road is divided. There is no complementary breakfast, there is a McDonalds located behind the hotel and a Dunkin Donuts within a 10 minutes walk. Also there is a Shaw's Grocery store in the mall area behind the hotel. The hotel is clean. The beds are a little stiff but the sheets are clean. The bathrooms are bright and clean. There is an onsite Oriental restaurant and lounge with good food. The hotel offers wireless internet. The outdoor pool area is clean and well maintained. The Arsenal Mall and an IHop are a short drive away. This area of Boston (North Brighton) is very clean and should offer a quite vacation spot. I had no fear when walking the streets in the area. This is nice hotel but the cost of taking cabs can run up your expenses if you spending more time near Fenway or Downtown. This would be an idea spot for those spending time in Cambridge or Brighton.
