{"text":"A fabulous time...a fabulous hotel We spent 4 night, 5 days in Paris and could not have been happier with our stay at the Artus Hotel. It is perfectly located in the heart of the Left Bank, which offers guests a true snapshot of life as a Parisian. Anything you could want to see or do is within walking distance or a quick ride on the Metro or RER. We had a Superior Room and it was plenty big. You aren't going to Paris to sit in your hotel room, so it was exactly what we needed. Most importantly the room was VERY clean. The breakfast was a great way to start the day. Fantastic cheeses and breads with an assortment of juices and coffee kicked off our day. Most importantly however is the unbelieveable service you receive from the concierge Sanjay. I travel a lot for work and I am lucky to have stayed in many 5 star hotels and never have I received the level of service that Sanjay provides. He had book our dinner reservations before we arrived (Sensing is the best restaurant I have ever been too) and took care of our transportation to and from the airport. Every morning he helped to get us going in the right direction and offered a locals tips on where to go and what to see. So long as Sanjay is at the Artus Hotel I will never go anywhere else when in Paris!!! The rest of the staff is very good as well...but you just can't clone Sanjay!!!
