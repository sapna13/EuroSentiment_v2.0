{"text":"Great hotel Just came back from two wonderful nights at the Ritz-Carlton Berlin.We arrived at 9 am on a Friday morning and the first pleasant surprise was that we could get our room immediately. We had booked a deluxe room which was very spacious with windows on two sides. The room was impeccable and it is very obvious that a huge amount of money has been put into the construction of this place. Personally, I would have preferred a more modern design instead of the old-style chic but the room, the bed and especially the bathroom remain a true delight. Fantastic bed and fantastic shower. We were quite surprised to find an old-fashioned box of a TV set but we didn't turn it on at all during our stay. I'm not a big fan of the Ritz-Carlton toiletries and would have preferred the Bulgari products.The rooms are really quiet and we didn't hear any noise at all. It was only at breakfast that we realised that the hotel was, in fact, VERY busy.The first morning we had to wait 15 minutes to get a table for breakfast and everything was rather stressful including the service. However, the quality of the food is outstanding.The staff is excellent and they truly seem to care about what they are doing.The only thing we didn't like about the place and which really needs improvement is the gym. If you only use cardio machines you will be OK but if you want to do some weight training you will VERY quickly run out of options. There is basically just one seated row and one chest press machine + some dumbbells. This is simply not acceptable for a new hotel of this standard. Furthermore, the gym is right next to the gym which makes the air too hot and too humid for a good workout. We liked the central location on Potsdamer Platz as it is very convenient to commute both to the western and eastern parts of Berlin. Many attractions are within walking distance.Overall a wonderful hotel and fantastic value for money.
