{"text":"pretty good my girlfriend and i stayed at the sirenis tropical from may 3 to may 10 th,its was our first trip to the carribean and we enjoyed it very much. the resort ground is beautiful,big swiming pool with deep end,two bars in the pool.there is a barbecue on the beach ,they serve fries,hot dogs,hamberers and chicken.The food at the buffet was not excelent but we found something to eat every day.we did not try any a la carte restaurant,but i guess the steak house is good.There is a huge lobby were u can just relax and drink.they have some pretty good drinks,dont forget to try the choco monkey!!!The rooms were ok, we stayed on the tropical side,building o, witch was close to the pool and had a good view of the waves on the beach.I tried snorkling on the resort,it was ok,The beach was beautiful,but the vendors on each side of the beach were anoying.most of the staff are friendly,we tiped a bit but it did not seem to make any difference to them.u have to check out at 12 o clock and for a late check out witch is a 6 o clock cost 50 $ us.we talked to a couple that stayed a the resort and it was there second resort in punta cana and they would definitly return to this one again.The drive from the airport was about an hour long ,the roads were a bite rough,i think this resort is the farthest one from the airport so there is nothing close to it.its was a very good relaxing week.
