{"text":"Great Place to Stay I recently returned from my first time trip to the Dominican Republic (Punta Cana) April 25th- May2nd and must say that I had a great time. The Iberostar Bavaro is a 4.5\/5 Star Hotel and I must say it was beautiful and clean with a well maintained lobby and common areas. Here are my reviews in a nutshell;Check-in: Was very smooth although there was some confusion with our room reservation. It did get resolved eventually. also upon checkin we were greeted by hotel staff and given a cocktail or frosted drink of some sort and then taken through a brief orientation of what to expect during our stay.Rooms: The room was very nice but had an old 26 inch TV. Not a big deal as we were not there for the tv but it would have been nice to have something decent. Also, you should make sure that you request to have your channels in English in the event you decide to watch tv at night. The beds were very small for double beds (very disappointing) probably more suitable for an adult and child. The comfort level was so so, just comfortable enough to get a good nights rest, but don't expect plush or pillowtop. The room also had a musty smell and feel to it so you may want to bring some fabrezed spray and stick ups. The living room area was nice and cozy with the sofa being very comfortable for sitting but not for sleeping (too rough). The bathroom was beautiful... loved the glassed in shower with marble stoned and the fact that there was a separate bathtub from shower. Room also had in room safe which was an added plus. Oh yes, there is an iron and ironing board.Service\/Front Desk: We had a few problems getting help\/service from the front desk staff as relates to getting our extra bed that was needed due to the room confusion upon checkin. Even after several calls to the front desk complaining about our sleeping arrangments, it took 3 days to get it resolved. Afterwards, I was able to enjoy a good nights sleep.Food: The Gourmet Restaurants were the best... I recommend 100%. The Buffet was great although the food was pretty much the same each day with slight variations. Just don't overeat, you are liable to get an upset stomach. There is something for everyone and you will never go hungry.Staff: The staff was excellent and very friendly... always helpful and made you feel right at home. I even made a few friends while there and look forward to seeing them on my next visit. TheEntertainment: The entertainment and nightly shows were great! And the 'Star Friends' Team were very funny and entertaining. Should you stay at this hotel, just remember the names Isabel, J.P. and Super Eli. They were absolutely the best and made my stay worthwhile. Beach and Pool: The Pool was superb along with the activities taking place in the area. The beach was beautiful and a sight to see with white sand and warm turquois water. However I didn't like the water in that it was choppy and had strong, boisterous waves which I think may have been a bit much for the kids and seniors... maybe! Overall it was great!Would I go back.... ABSOLUTELY! I would just make sure thatI'm selective on the months in which I travel.Last thing: There were a few days where it was cloudy and even torrential rain storms so be sure to bring an umbrella. Still warm and humid though.
