{"text":"Clean, comfortable, affordable hotel with a Great location! We stayed two nights here while in Seattle to see a concert at Key Arena. The hotel is very nice and clean, with a quiet, comfortable atmosphere. The room was great, with two beds, a microwave, refrigerator, and small sitting area. Decor was a little nicer than many chain hotels, and the staff was very nice and friendly. The shower had one of those curved shower rods and a light in the ceiling! Made for much nicer showering then many hotels. My only complaint about the room - as with most rooms - is that the bed was too soft.The hotel has secure underground parking, which was great. There is no charge for the parking, another nice feature in a city where parking is expensive and sometimes hard to find. Breakfast buffet was pleasant, but fairly typical. Breakfast is included with the room.One huge plus about this hotel is the excellent location. It's just a couple of minutes walk to Seattle Center, where the Space Needle and Key Arena are, and the staff told us the area is very safe for walking. We walked back from the concert at 11:00 and felt very comfortable. There are a bunch of restaurants in the immediate area, with just about any type of food you could want. Also at Seattle Center is the monorail to downtown, so we never had to hassle with our car the entire time we were in Seattle.We would definitely stay here again!!
