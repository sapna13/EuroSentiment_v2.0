{"text":"A Sad 2 star hotel We stayed at the hotel from Aug 23-27. We checked in at 11:00 pm and after a long day, we were told that our rate would be 23$ more since we had a baby with us. We told them that the policy as stated on bestwestern.com was that a child under 12 was free. But they refused to budge. The next day, we spoke to the manager who told us, it was not for the child but since we were 2 adults, there was a extra charge of 23 Euros. Basically they wanted another 23 euros no matter what. After a lot of arguing, we agreed to pay 13 euros more for the extra breakfast. (although breakfast was included in the rate).In the morning, we also decided to check with the concierge. This being a 4 star hotel (highest rating in France), we assumed there would be one. But, only the front desk guy knows some trains and routes etc. So, no real concierge is there. There is no doorman, restaurant, fitness center in the hotel. I dont know how it got a 4 star. The rooms are so tiny, you will struggle to move around. Getting the 2 bags in was a challenge.When leaving, I entered my opinion in the first page of the new Customer Review book kept in the lobby. When I was waiting for a cab, the manager came and asked me What was the purpose behind those comments?. I told him thats what I felt. He didnt understand why I would do that.....Last I checked, thats a opinion book, not a book only to heap praise.I strongly recommend that one consider other options. This is definitely not worth it.Happy travels. ","annotations":[]}
