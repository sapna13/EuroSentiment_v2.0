{"text":"Heaven on earth We stayed at the hyatt as part of a twin centre holiday which was amazing. First we visited buzzing Hong Kong which was fab but not really a holiday as just so much to see and do, so we were ready to relax when we got to Bali.The hotel is beautiful we had booked a sea view room which was well worth it the view was breathtaking. The gardens in the hotel are also beautiful.Staff pleasant and helpful, we stayed bed and breakfast (breakfast excellent lots of choice) BB is all you need, if you wish to sample the local restaurants and experience some of the culture.My partner loves diving so he went diving which he booked over there with a lady called Camilla at a loal diving school. She was great involved me aswell and I was just a spectator on the boat! who did a litlle snorkelling which was fab!The best trip we did whilst we were there was the Elephant Safari if your going you must do this but becareful make sure you go to the original park as there are two parks, the original one was opened by a man who rescue's elephants from Sumatra and brings elephant keepers with them who really do care for the elephants. This one is a good hour away but you pass all the beautiful rice fields which look like green waterfalls on the way and you see the volcano in the distance too plus you get to see some of the local villages. Apparently somebody has tried to copy this park and opened another one which is not meant to be as good.Jimbaran bay is the best place to go and watch the sunset lots ofseafood restaurants on the beach and you can choose your fish and have it freshly cooked to order. Even worth a try if your not seafood lovers we didn't think we would like it but it was delicious and the setting very romantic! (Red Snapper, Tiger Prawns, Clams, Rice, Salad, Sauces √ä√£¬¢8 in total and enough food really for 4 people and there were only two of us). Jimbaran bay is about 20mins away in a taxi but make sure you book a taxi to pick you up we didn't and ended up getting a lift back with a local man! Luckily he was nice and didn't rip us off but not really recommended!In Sanur there are lots of nice places to eat, Lazar bar for good steaks, Cat  Fiddle was a good irish pub also serves good food, but we never had a bad meal anywhere and itsjust embarassingly cheap. 3 courses for 2 people plus 3 rounds of drinks averaged at about √ä√£¬¢25 - √ä√£¬¢30.You must have a balinese massage whilst your there the hotel spa is excellent.Enjoy!!!
