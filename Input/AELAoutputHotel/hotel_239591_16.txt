{"text":"Please...don't be put off by location! I have just been to BCN for 5 days, from 21st to 26th Aug 2008. When i was researching hotels back in May I used trip advisor and looked at web sites showing the local area. Now, the hotel is in Raval, known as the 'red light' district of Barca. I was hesitant to book the hotel but in the end I am sooo glad i did. Sorry this review is so long but i wanted it to be honest and thorough)THE AREA: Excellent for getting around the city. it is right in the heart of the city. The hotel is on the doorstep of LIceu metro station which will take you around town. Outside on la Rambla is a very easy to use bus system, the number 59 takes you direct to the beach. Very close to bars, resturants, cafes etc...all very handy when you find you are eating out most nights and walking home after a heavy meal. Although the hotel is pretty much on las ramblas it is very easy to take a stroll (5 mins walk) to other areas, such as Placa Reial to eat and there are excellent little boutique shops on C\/ de Ferran (spelling?). When you come out of Liceu station the first thing you will notice is the smell. BCN does smell, especially in the older parts like Barrio Gotic, Cuitat Veilla, Raval, the beach etc. I don't know why this is (drains, Iave been told) but you get used to it and it isn't all that bad. It's worth staying in these areas because you would miss out on so many cultural experiences otherwise. Secondly you notice the prostitutes. Yes, you heard right, but they are not blatant about what they are doing and definitely not 'slutty' or anything. In fact, most of them are so discreet until someone told me what to look for I missed them. They look like they are just hanging around with their friends, so don't worry about it being a problem if you have children and are staying in that area, it really isn't offensive. HOTEL: Fantastic! We stayed in room 326, a superior room, which we booked with breakfast. This was back in may sometime and cost around √ä√£¬¢535. the room was very clean, nicely decorated and spacious, defeinitely big enough for two adults. I would say that perhaps it would not be big enough for a family with young children, particularly more than one child because the furniture is quite large. The room had an IKEA style sofa bed (good for children to sleep on) and a chair. Rooms also had tea making facilities, and cleaners change the cups daily. The cleaners did come rather early, (around 7-8am) but that's typical of all hotels really. The wardrobe is a double, but a small one, but there is plenty of drawer space and a shoe rack. My only qualm is the bathroom. The door is large and when fully open gets in the way of the toilet and so is quite tricky to access. That's all really. the bathroom is very clean, and newly decorated with marble worktops and clean white suits. The staff were very helpful as well, especially as we didn't check until 1am. I no I probably sound like an advert but i was very impressed with the hotel given that it is only a two star. If anyone wants to email me with questions i will be happy to help.
