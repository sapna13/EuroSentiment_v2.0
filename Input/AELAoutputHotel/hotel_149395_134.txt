{"text":"A place to just, relax....well not quite. My boy's and I had the chance to visit the DR this past winter during their Spring Break. After reading some reviews here, and talking to some friends, we decided to visit Paradisus. The hotel is about 30min from the airport and on the southern coast. It is situated in a very lush tropical setting and the grounds are beautiful.We arrived around 6pm and waited over an hour to check into the hotel. While there seemed to be plenty of hotel staff, they were really not focused on taking care of the guests as they arrived.After a lot of confusion we were taken to the Family Conceirge to check in, and they too were a bit confused and unorganized. Eventually, we were given our rooms but the confusion did not stop there. One of the rooms was occupied by another guest, who was suprised to see 3 boys appear at their door at 900p!! We moved into one room, while the Conceirge went to figure out where the other room was. About an hour later they found a room to use for one night in another part of the hotel. It was almost 1030p before this was ever resolved. The next day we had to move to another set of rooms that were adjacent to each other. We had an all inclusive meal plan which was very convenient for all of us. The downside is that you are pretty much locked into eating within set times, and there are no late night places to get a snack or late dinner. The restaraunts are not the resorts strong point, in fact they are all fairly average, the one exception is the one that is on the beach and open for lunch - this one had a pretty good buffet in a nice setting on the beach. The pool is very nice, but you need to claim your spots early in the morning to be assured being close to the pool. The beach is also very nice, good surf, nice wide beaches. This too requires a little advance scouting to claim chaises etc in the early am.If sleeping on the beach\/pool and completely relaxing due to a lack of activities is not your thing. You will need to get off the property. The lobby had quite a few services geared toward scuba diving, snorkling with sharks (more of a booze cruise), atv's etc I used the gym, it was very small for a resort of this size, but if you hit it at the right time you had the place to yourself.For us it was nice to get away and spend time together, but I would not return to Paradisus. The restaurants need to improve, the room decor could use an update\/refreshening and the hotel staff was just a bit to unorganized for my taste.
