{"text":"Cute and convenient We spent two nights before a trip to eastern Puerto Rico and three nights after at this cute little hotel in Condado and had a very nice stay. There's nothing spectacular about the hotel, but it's quite pleasant and much more affordable than other comparable options.The rooms have nice marble floors, large whirlpool tubs, (small) flat screen tvs with cable, internet connections, ceiling fans, high-powered AC units, and the in-room minibars are wine fridges with enough space to add a few items of your own. The hotel also offers a better-than-average breakfast, a very small but cute pool, a rooftop jacuzzi, on-site laundry facilities (one coin-operated washer and dryer, $2 each), several very pleasant sitting areas, both inside and out, and friendly staff. The hotel is within a few blocks of a beach, lots of restaurants, a 24-hour Walgreens, a post office, a bus stop to Old San Juan (about a 10-minute ride), and several bigger hotel\/resort\/casinos, and is about 5 or 6 blocks from the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Puerto Rico.The rooms are small, but not uncomfortably so. The mattresses in the two rooms we stayed in were not uncomfortable at first, but their lack of firm support made them a bit hard on my back after a night or two. The bathtubs are lovely but there's no water pressure at all in the showers.So, if you're planning to explore San Juan, and particularly if you're more interested in exploring Old San Juan and Puerto Rican art, culture, history and cuisine than lying on pristine beaches, this hotel will meet all your needs nicely, conveniently, and affordably. If you want to spend a lot of time luxuriating in your room and in your hotel, this is not where you want to stay--there's no in-house restaurant or bar  hence no room service, and there's no view from your window. The beach that's a two-minute walk from the hotel is ok but it's not great: there's plenty of space for swimming, but it's lined with kind of low-to-mid-range hotels and resorts and abandoned, sometimes dilapidated, buildings. Playa Condado is not too far away, either--maybe a 10- or 15-minute walk west down Ashford Ave. It's nicer but sandwiched between a hotel and a very busy bridge; it also has lots of rocks and seaweed\/sea grass and is very, very small. If beaches are your focus in San Juan, you'll be disappointed; if you'd just like to visit beaches occasionally amidst other activities, this cute, friendly hotel should suit you well.
