{"text":"previous reviewers were spot on! Well, well Trip advisor comes up trumps again! Chose this hotel because the reviews were excellent and that is exactly as we found the experience. It was our wedding anniversary too - 23 years - and we received an up-grade +wine and water, as did the previous reviewers. However, we booked on the hotel's own website and paid 135 euros including breakfast. Our waitress 'Diana' was charming, as was every member of staff we encountered during our four days. This hotel is well managed and represents outstanding value. The weather was awful - but Berlin was fab ! We loved the history, shopping, superb quality food and the very relaxed feel of the German capital and its people. We used the overground train from the airport (Shoenefeld) and walked from Zoo Gardens. Buying a ticket was problematic though - big, big queues at the machines and no one at hand to help, except fellow travellers. Next time buy tickets at airport from a machine or the newsagent (2 euros 10 cents) and don't forget to validate it, or risk a 40 euro fine. We also used the 100 and 200 buses during our stay - buy ticket from driver - no problem. See everywhere from the top and get on and off where you wish (one direction only) for 2.10 euros - a bargain ! Vapiano restaurant (opposite hotel) was good value and serves excellent salads, pizzas and pastas all made freshly for you before your eyes ! Foodhall at KadeWe amazing and much cheaper than Harrods. C  A still in business in Berlin and a landmark for our hotel.I could write more, but the previous reviewers say it all - give Berlin a go - you'll be impressed. Thank you to previous reviewers for taking the time to write your comments and experiences, they have proved very helpful to me. I always check this website before I go anywhere !
