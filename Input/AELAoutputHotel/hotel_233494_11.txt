{"text":"Lovely Palazzo with Caveat We stayed 7 nights at the Palazzo 12\/24 to 12\/31\/07. The description of the hotel that other travelers provided is true. We had the Livia suite, our kids the Guilia suite. The rooms were enormous with 20 footceilings. There was a TV in the bedroom and one in the living room (Sky TV offered English and other language channels) We didn't watch much TV but it was fun to check out Italian game shows and imported American TV with Italian commercials) The rooms looked out on Borgo San Frediano, while not a busy street is like all Florence streets narrow so your view is of the building across the street. Some rooms face a couryard and some face south which has a view. You may want to specify. The housekeeping was good, lots of fluffy huge towels changed twice a day. Bulgari toiletries in 4 oz sizes replenished as needed. Our bathroom was huge, with 2 sinks, toilet and bidet in separate room.The kids bathroom was smaller, but their bedroom was larger. Nice tub and separate small stall shower. Shower pressure wasokay (we like it stronger). On checkin there was bottle of French chamagne in our room and scented soap to choose from.The rooms are not off a hall but a huge salon where tea and coffee andice are replenished several times a day (and sometimes great chocolates are set out.) The elevator is big enough for 3, but is cuteand it being a small hotel, always available. Large bowl of assorted fruit by the elevator, if you need a snack.Breakfast was nice, fresh fruitcups, wonderful crusty rolls, cheeses, hams, croissants, yogurt, fresh squeezed blood orange juice (among others) Capuccino came decorated with hearts made out of cocoa served by gracious staff with white gloves. (so retro) My son developed a liking for the the pancake (a baked huge pancake) and ate it 7 times. It was 5 euro extra. There were also eggs on the menu, but the rest of us were very happy with the continental offered.The hotel staff speak good English. They arranged our airport transfers to Pisa which were 175 euros. That seemed like much but the transfer was in nice Mercedes van with a good driver.There are many outings offered by the hotel for a steep price. We followe the advise of others on the board, booked independently and saved a lot.The staff booked all our restaurant reservations in advance. I gave a list. The location of the hotel is great. Though we were there in the winterthe center of Florence was still crowded beyond belief. (We are from New York City and know crowds) This part of the Oltarno is less crowed, maybe a 10 minute walk from the center but has a neighborhood feel. There are great restaurants just down every street and local people shopping in little groceries, pastry shops where they don't speak English but the caffe is under a euro and you sit l with locals not busloads of tourists. (Okay so we're tourists too) The terrace hasa great view, the billiard room is always yours, there is a gym if you have energy after walking all day....Now the caveat......The beds are firm. No not just firm, rock hard with a few lumps thrownin. The comforter is filled with maybe cotton. It is heavy though warm. At first we didn't mind, we like hard beds. But after several nights we were definitely uncomfortable and grouchy.This was true of beds in both suites. Most hotels pride themselves on their bedding. This was just unacceptable in a place that was billed as 5 star and in all other aspects really is 5 star. Good mattresses, down comforters and down pillows would have put this place over the top. For all we know the linens were Frette but you can't enjoy Frettewhen you feel like a Medici lying on a hard tomb. I wrote a letter to the owner as when we left explaining the problem. Maybe if other travelers do the same, they will get the hint.So overall, a great place for a 2 nights, then better move on. (unlessthe beds have been replaced) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":989,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":985},{"endOffset":1220,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1217},{"endOffset":1231,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1225},{"endOffset":1220,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1217},{"endOffset":1231,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1225},{"endOffset":1306,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1296},{"endOffset":1306,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1296},{"endOffset":1306,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1296},{"endOffset":1306,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1296},{"endOffset":1564,"mention":"croissants","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Croissant"],"startOffset":1554},{"endOffset":1572,"mention":"yogurt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Yogurt"],"startOffset":1566},{"endOffset":1594,"mention":"blood","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Black_pudding"],"startOffset":1589},{"endOffset":1677,"mention":"cocoa","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_liquor","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hot_chocolate","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1672},{"endOffset":1677,"mention":"cocoa","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_liquor","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hot_chocolate","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1672},{"endOffset":1713,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1708},{"endOffset":1778,"mention":"pancake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pancake"],"startOffset":1771},{"endOffset":1800,"mention":"pancake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pancake"],"startOffset":1793},{"endOffset":1800,"mention":"pancake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pancake"],"startOffset":1793},{"endOffset":2093,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2089},{"endOffset":2731,"mention":"pastry","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":2725}]}
