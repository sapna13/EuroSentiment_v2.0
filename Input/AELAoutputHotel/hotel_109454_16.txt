{"text":"Incredible Service! I'm a meeting planner who brought a small committee to Dallas for a working meeting. I chose Hotel Lawrence for its location (within walking distance of the West End) and its reasonable room rates and catering charges.The hotel has character and individuality. Travelers wanting five-star amenities and glitz will be disappointed. The staff, however, is so welcoming and thoughtful that I could never go back to one of the monolithic chains. When I ordered special meals for one attendee with dietary restrictions, the sales staff looked beyond my requests to go out of their way to buy special treats for her afternoon breaks. The deskman noticed that our party was going to be delayed in arriving at a West End restaurant, called the restaurant without our asking him to, and arranged to have our reservation held until we could get there. The restaurant had changed owners immediately prior to our arrival, so full-service breakfasts were temporarily unavailable, but the hotel's breakfast room served an enhanced continental breakfast that included the usual pastries, cereals, and fruits, plus biscuits and gravy, hard-boiled eggs, and Texas-shaped waffles,Cookies and milk are served in the lobby every night at bedtime. The bellmen are helpful and try to anticipate their guests' needs. While the rooms are not furnished in glossy modern styles and tend to be smaller than the typical world-wide chain, Hotel Lawrence makes the frequent traveler feel -- well, maybe not at home, but as though he was stopping over at a friend's house for a day or so. Of special joy to the business traveler, by the way, were the things Hotel Lawrence DOESN'T charge for: local telephone calls and 1-800 calls; wireless Internet access; and a daily liter of bottled water. What a refreshing change from the money-hungry big chains.
