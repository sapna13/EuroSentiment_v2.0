{"text":"Average hotel Stayed there during one of the weekend taking up the offer of weekend break with breakfast. The rooms has been renovated but the toilet wall and floor isn't. The 80s marble was the giveaway. Location wise is good if you want to goto the Esplanade for performances or visit the Suntec exhibition. Else it is some distance to walk to the MRT station. The hotel is attached to the Marina shopping complex which lacks vibrancy as it may be a bit on the higher end. Parked our car there as the hotel shares the parking with the patrons of the complex. We received a vulgar note from the car owner on the left because we park our car within our box but 5 inches away from the edge of our box. This is because of a huge lorry parking on the right of us. One thing to note is the complementary car parking ticket. It is issued once a day and it is valid for one time use only. So plan your trip if you want free parking. Breakfast is average. The spread is sufficient but not overwhelming, as you may expect of a 4 star hotel. The ham, sausages and bacon appears to be of the cheaper quality. They could do better at this.Its true, as mentioned by all the writer here, the singing at the lounge do get to the room. So get a high floor. The staff is courteous, efficient and friendly. I would not stay there again unless I am visitng the Esplande or Suntec exhibition as there are better location to stay. ","annotations":[]}
