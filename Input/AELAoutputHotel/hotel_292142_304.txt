{"text":"Fabulous stay at the Affinia Dumont!! My boyfriend and I have just returned from a week in the fabulous Affinia Dumont! We booked our flights to New York back in August, and then took time to research various hotels using trip advisor's reviews as our guide. Having booked the Affinia Dumont on the backing of previous reviews, we were not disappointed! We arrived at night, and were in awe of the view from our room when the bellboy pulled opened the curtains! Along with the magnificent Chrysler Building and the New York skyline just outside our window, the bell boy informed us that the building in front of us was the HQ of Opus Dei, corner of 34th st and Lexington, as mentioned in the Da Vinci code...nice little touch! We stayed on the 35th floor (room 3504), and every night we slept with the curtains open just to take in the spectacular scenery, (Worth requesting a high room before you go).We had a lovely big room (suite), king size bed... extremely comfortable! There was a kitchenette off room with fridge, microwave etc., and a safe in the closet. No problems with heating and there was always hot water. Daily maid service, always clean.The location is great, quiet residential area, able to get a good night's sleep to recharge for the next day, in comparison to hotels in the busier Time's Square district! There is a supermarket and a drug store conveniently situated just outside the hotel. TIP: The Murray Hill Diner around the block on Lexington Avenue does a great breakfast! and it has a great New York City diner atmosphere too. The staff were courteous, helpful, and friendly, and always greeted us with a smile. On the day we were leaving the bellboy arranged for us to travel to the airport in a private car for a flat rate of $65 including tip and toll charges. He said it would be 'a nice clean comfortable car'. To our surprise it was a white stretch limousine!. I was worried that when we arrived at the airport, the driver may haveasked us for a lot more than $65, but sure enough that's what it cost!The Affinia Dumont is a fabulous hotel in every way, and we would haveno reservations about recommending it to others. It deserves to be in trip advisor's top ten most recommended hotels. We will definitely be returning to the Affinia Dumont on our next visit to NYC!!
