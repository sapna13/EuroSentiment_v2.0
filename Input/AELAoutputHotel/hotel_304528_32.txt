{"text":"fantastic location we have just returned fron 10 days in this hotel in Nusa Dua Bali.the hotel has several larger pools for swimming in which are just fantastic one of them even has a small water slide for the kids to play on. The resturants are very nice, the one beside the pool area is where you have your breakfast each day, our package had ours included and we were provided with an array of food from fresh fruit right thru to a fully cooked breakfast. we had a lot of meals at the beach front resturant which is all but on the beach and the food and service there was great and even well priced for this type of hotel. if you want to eat local, the areas out side the hotel grounds have ample local resturants to choose from. you are not hassled by hawkers at this hotel as the area is controlled and they are only on the beach for a few hours at a time and have a number so you can report them if you are hassled, we found them fun and easy to barter with.the kids club is good with a full range of activities for the kids to do during the day.our room was very nice but one thing dont get a room in the reception lobby area as its very noisey, this is a large hotel and has a lot of people comming and going all the time. we asked to be moved to a side wing away from the lobby and where cheerfully and promptly moved and got a great room facing the pool.would we stay there again, yes for sure as we love the nusa dua location well away from kuta etc but make sure you dont get a room in the lobby area. all tours come and go from this area so getting around is no problem at all ","annotations":[{"endOffset":977,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":973},{"endOffset":977,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":973},{"endOffset":977,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":973}]}
