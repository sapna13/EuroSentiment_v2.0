{"text":"The 1898 - A Fair Assessment... I rely on tripadvisor quite heavily on selecting a hotel to stay in but it is always important to read between the lines of the various comments. The reviews of the 1898 range from the sublime to the underwhelmed and in fairness both are fair descriptions but also true of any other ranked hotel in Barcelona. This is an extremely comfortable hotel which is fantastically well appointed. If staying in summer the ability to get away from it all and sunbathe by a roof-top pool may for many make it worthwhile in itself. There is also a well equipped gymn and OK Spa. We never had breakfast in the hotel (20 euros ahead!) but worth missing for all the excellent alternatives on the doorstep. The rooms are very comfortable and fully equipped (although the plasmas volume is set to such a low maximum volume that you can't hear them even in your own room). The gentleman who said it was a bit soulless in the bar and reception areas is correct and some of the staff (especially the bar man) could definately have done with a happy fix. All that said this is probably still a good choice for a few days stay in a simply breathtaking city. If you book a room make SURE you get a small balcony at least (we asked to be moved) and I imagine not looking over La Ramblas itself. If you are looking for the hotel to Make your Stay then this may disappoint (as probaly will most others). If you are looking for a fine place to explore and enjoy then it has much to recommend it.P.S I am being very nice by not mentioning that they took 25 minutes to bring our bags from our room when our taxi meter was running (i'm not proud I would rather have brought them down ourselves!)
