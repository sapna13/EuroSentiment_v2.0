{"text":"A Great Boutique Hotel Before booking our hotel in San Juan, I read many reviews of the Coral Princess Inn in TripAdvisor.com. Of the several dozen I read, around 95% were very positive and the rest were mostly good. I am glad to report that our experience was also very positive.First the pros: The Coral Princess Inn is very pretty and well maintained. The hotel is small (boutique), but is decorated with many tropical plants (especially on the outside areas) and has several nooks for reading or other semi-private conversations. The appointments are very nice dark wood, reminicent of an English style The pool area is quite attractive as well. My wife loved the morning coffee and continental breakfast area where people would gather each morning. Plus, the dishes were china, not plastic - a very nice touch!Our room was small, but again, nicely appointed and very, very clean. And the tub was a jacuzzi tub, which was unexpected.The hotel is in the Condado area, in sort of a neighborhood area, a bit off the beaten path but only a few blocks from the beach and touristy stuff. We very much appreciated that part. Several restaurants were within a block or so of the hotel as was a Walgreen's (which also had a grocery section!) which was certainly helpful. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and our airconditioner stopped cooling on the 3rd night (not a big deal considering how mild the temps were). I reported the problem that morning as we were leaving for an excursion and the staff had it repaired in a matter of a few hours - very impressive!The only thing I can think of for improvement is that printed bus schedules\/routes be made available for the guests. For some reason, you can't find these anywhere at hotels, Not sure what the story is with that.To be honest, we were not that impressed with San Juan as a destination. The beaches were blah (no one even bothered to have the seaweed cleaned off the beaches), the concept of beach bars seemed to be almost completely lost on the local tourist industry and the food and drink quality was fairly low, yet prices were rather high. I doubt we will go back to San Juan, but we might try other areas of Puerto Rico.Of course, the above negatives have virutally nothing to do with the Coral Princess Inn. They were absolutely the highllight of our trip and my wife and I would highly recommend them to anyone traveling to San Juan.
