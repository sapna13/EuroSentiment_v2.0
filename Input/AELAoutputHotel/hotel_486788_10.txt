{"text":"Would of gone somewhere else My boyfriend and I decided to get away and visit puerto rico. We picked Coral by the Sea bc we are in college and just wanted to save some extra money. However, if we had to make our choice again we would pay the extra money to stay somewhere else. Our first impression of the hotel was that it was very old, the rooms are very small and not very appealing, and the bathrooms are tiny, like a small shoe closet. Once you walk into the hotel you just get the feeling that it isn't the most sanitary place. We stayed for 4 nights and we were out most of the time, which was one reason why we decided to stay there, however we would of muh prefered the Holiday Inn down the street or the Hampton Inn across the street. I would say the location is very good though and the staff is very helpful and friendly as well. We had ice cream at the ice cream\/regular food restaurant connected to it, and it was descent. I did read the reviews before we left on this site and decided to take a chance, but I honestly think anyone who is reading this and deciding whether or not stay, they should pay a little bit more just for a better experience in Puerto Rico.Also about the food, I agree with the other review that the food there really isn't that great and is extremely over priced. I was hoping to taste some delicious mofongos or some other puerto rican specialties, but they were all a let down. Be careful also about going to the islands, like Vieques, we were charged $50 for 2 hamburgers and 2 drinks. They also added their own service charge ($8). Don't fall for the tourist traps either. Some places may seem like they are great online and with reviews, but we kind of thought that some of these people must be writing their own reviews, bc after going to some of the places we found online bc of high reviews, they turned out to be a major let down and way overpriced. Ok hope that helps.
