{"text":"Very nice 10-day stay at Carofftel Gobelins I stayed for 10 days in January at Hotel Carofftel Gobelins.Traveling for business as a single woman, I found this place very much to my liking, and quite reasonably priced. (I paid 79E for a single with a double bed.) It is owner-run, with a small, consistent staff, who were friendly and helpful. Having read in another post that the rooms that face the courtyard have larger bathrooms, I requested one of those when I made reservations. As a result, I had a nice bath with tub  shower. The room itself was simple, but adequate. Most important--the bed was comfortable, the room was warm, and it was extremely clean.They have Wifi throughout the hotel, although it was somewhat spotty in my room. However, I could always get a connection in the dining area, so I would sometimes go downstairs to use my laptop. They had a daily charge for WiFi -- around 2E per day, although it was cheaper for longer stays. Much better than a number of hotels I checked with while selecting a place, who often wanted 10E for an hour of connectivity! Although the Hotel is right on Avenue des Gobelins, which is quite a large street, my room was very quiet. I was surprised every morning to emerge from the Hotel onto the street.Breakfast was adequate  not bad for 7.5E--coffee or tea, plus a buffet of juice, pastries, bread, yogurt, ham  cheese. Since I had to be at meetings most mornings, it was simplest for me to eat at the Hotel before heading out. It's very easy to get around from this Hotel. Metro a block away; several bus routes go right by. About a 15 to 20 minute walk to the Seine, 7 to 10 minute walk to the Place d'Italie.I would happily stay there again.
