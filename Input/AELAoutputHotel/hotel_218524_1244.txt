{"text":"1 2 3 shake it!!! My boyfriend and I stayed at secret excellence for about 5 days. By far the best five days of our lives. We were the youngest couple there which was pretty funny I'm 20 he's 24 but it was so much fun. The food was awsome!! The staff was excelente! Francisco was very nice! he was funny sweet and made us feel very welcome! He gave us some spanish lessons and did a great job! Isabel is part of the entertainment and she did a great job getting everyone involved in all the activities on the beach. The beach was so much fun. we played vollyball, I did aerobics with juan miguel, they call him the Dominican 50 cents! He so sweeet and cute. before we left, he made sure to say good bye to us and wished us a safe trip home. Something so sweet and so simple made me and my boyfriend so happy. Last but not least was Julio cesar he was also on the beach and really made our vacation great. We did stretching with him in the morining ( very realxing ) on the beach, then later we did an egg toss contest we lost :( and then some dancing lessons. These I highly reccomend! Just remeber 123 shake it!! I focus on the staff because They are what truly makes this resort Excellent!! They really make it a point to reach out and be your friend and make you feel comfortable. Everything about the vacation was great. I also recommend to stay there at least 7 days we were upset we had to leave so soon. I will definitley be coming back. ","annotations":[]}
