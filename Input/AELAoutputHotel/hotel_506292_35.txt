{"text":"An Insider's Resort We stayed in the lovely Uma for four days during the October national holidays. We were attracted by the small size of the resort and the private cottages with small pools overlooking the ravine. This is the kind of place In the know travellers and those who have experienced luxury resorts in other places will love. Glitz and over the top decadence is eschewed in favor of privacy, comfort and tasteful design. No ultra-minamalist, Phillipe Stark inspired, glass-rectangular-everything here. Just lovely proportions, lush intimate spaces and peace and quiet. The menu emphasizes good healthy eating with artfully prepared meals heavy on fruits and vegetables. It's a clean, modern menu without any tendancies toward food cliches. It was really nice to have new and interesting juice combinations with every meal. The copmlementary daily yoga class is a nice touch. The location is not the most convenient. The western edges of Ubud and certain art galleries are within walking distance, but the centre and main attrations of Ubud are a bit of a hike. There is a complementary shuttle, but frankly it was a pain working around their schedule, and the last car back is too early at 9:00pm. Taxis are a hassle in Ubud as there really aren't any. Basically everyone with any form of transport is a taxi and all the negotiating foolery that goes with that.Yes it's a bit expensive to stay here, but when compared with the much larger and ridiculously overwrought Four Seasons it punches well above its weight.
