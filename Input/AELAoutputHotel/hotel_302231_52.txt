{"text":"Superb hotel I'm inclined to agree with Ikura's assessment that this place sets the standard for 5* accomodation. It's not perfect, but it sets the bar pretty high.My room, which I think was one of the hotel's most basic (a relative term, obviously), was the same size as a junior suite at a Fairmont or Oberoi - it was very large. Better still was the bathroom, which, unlike the vast majority of hotels, had a window. And what a window: from my bath, I was able to enjoy a sweeping vista across the city, over the marina and out to sea; perfect after a hard day of slogging round town. And all for a price that wouldn't get you 3 stars in most of the world's major cities.Furthermore, the staff are second to none for charm and efficiency.In this context, the few small niggles seem so minor that I'm almost embarassed to list them. But in the interests of completeness I'll do so anyway: for a hotel that prides itself on its art collection, the expanse of unadorned, beige walls in my room was faintly depressing, and made the room appear unfinished; a squashed fly on the wall of my bathroom when I arrived on Monday was still there when I checked out on Friday; and breakfast - a few third rate pastries and a limited selection dull fruit (mostly from tins) - was a pretty poor effort. I am aware that only North Americans and the British really have any idea how to make breakfast, but most international hotels, wherever they are, manage to cater to international tastes.
