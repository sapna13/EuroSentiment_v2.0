{"text":"iTC - CHEAP but not CHEERFUL we last stayed at itc in 2000 and as we remember it was basic though clean and good value for money as it included breakfast. How things have changed!! unfortunately the decor hasn't changed - everything is exactly the same but 6 years older. This hotel is in need of a complete redecoration. Others have commented about the bathrooms; I can only agree the facilities were BASIC and UNCLEAN - the toilet was so small that you had to be seated before closing the door!... the toilet brush was ... well id better not go into too much detail... let's just say it had been well used and little cleaned. The room itself didn't look as though it has seen polish and duster in quite some time.The shower had damp patches on the walls and the effect of the shower on the wooden frames was such that they were in need of repair..NOISE!!! This has to be the noisiest hotel i have ever stayed in - the walls are so thin that you can hear toilets flushing, doors opening and closing, other guests conversations etc....Carpets throughout have seen better days.Breakfast (once included in the room charge) is 7,50 euros. This was okay but we had to ask for everything - it was not the extensive buffet as they advertise -rather disappointing.Hotel staff were friendly and polite - I must say that they were helpful when approached. Bedding always clean as were the towels that were refreshed every day.Also remember that the price quoted does not include breakfast, city tax or credit card charge all of which can add up considerably over the length of stay.All things considered there are much better deals around in amsterdam's other hotels. ITC offers nothing more for the gay traveller other than the cheap gay porn channels that repeat over and over again.Overall.... would we stay here again? A definate NO! ","annotations":[]}
