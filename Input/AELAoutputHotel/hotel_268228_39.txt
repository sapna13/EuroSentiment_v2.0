{"text":"Good location but not worth what you pay We were in Washington and Oregon for a week, and this was the most we paid for a room and the least satisfied we were. To be fair, the location of this hotel is fantastic and the staff was friendly. Unfortunately though, that's where it ends. We were paying close to $300 a night for our room and did not feel like it was worth it at all. Here are my specific complaints:1. Our confirmation said we would have a spectacular view of Elliott Bay. We were able to see the bay, I'll give them that. Spectacular would be overstating it, though. If we stood in one of the corners of the room right up against the window and looked off to the side, we could see the water over top of a couple of parking garages. Spectacular? Not really. This alone would not have been enough to make me complain though since we don't really spend a lot of time in our room.2. The bed was not comfortable AT ALL. I usually like Marriott beds and think they're very comfy. This one was awful. I read another review saying they felt like they were bouncing around all night any time their spouse moved. Yup, I'll agree with that. I don't really have back problems, but by the end of our 3-night stay my back was killing me and I really hadn't slept well because of all the bouncing around. 3. The third morning of my trip, the shower was ice cold. This was the last straw for me. $300 a night for a cold shower? Really??? At this point I filled out a comment card for the manager. I would have called and talked to someone directly but we were in a hurry to get on the road and my husband didn't want me to take the time. I was very specific on the comment card and left all my contact info hoping for something in response, and I have heard absolutely nothing in response to my complaints which makes me cranky. I may still call although I don't know what I would expect to happen at this point. To sum up, the location was really great and for that reason I could give it 2 stars instead of 1. Otherwise I felt like it was a total rip.One more tip: I wouldn't really advise paying a lot of extra money for the concierge level unless you get a good deal and it's not too much more than a regular room. You get free breakfast which is always nice, but it's basically bread stuff (cereal, muffins, etc) and scrambled eggs and bacon. It's the same thing every morning. They have free muchies in the afternoon and you can buy drinks, but the drinks are just as overpriced as they would be in a bar. So it was nice enough and all, but not worth a whole lot of extra money. . \\ ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2287,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":2282},{"endOffset":2310,"mention":"muffins","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Muffin"],"startOffset":2303}]}
