{"text":"Excellent value in Hong Kong I have stayed in Hong Kong many many times on business - on an expense account. When I had to reach into my own pocket I asked business contacts where they stay when they come to Hong Kong with their families and universally they say the Metropark in Causeway Bay. We upgraded to a suite and we strongly recommend such upgrade. The suite is a very good size compared to many higher price hotels that I have stayed in (e.g., Conrad, Island Shangri-La). One great value is the 7\/11 only 15 yards from the Hotel Entrance at which you can buy water\/snacks\/noodles. The internet worked fantastic and the location is great - especially if you are willing to take 10 minutes to learn to use the subway. There was a real bath in the bathroom which my wife liked and the suite had a small second bathroom so that two sinks could be in use at the same time when we were getting ready to go out. Downsides - the airconditioner didn't quite seem to work. Also I had some business in town so asked the front desk for an official exchange rate statement for calculating my expenses and they didn't want to give me one and finally make me feel like I was a jerk for asking for one. Other than that - on your own dime in HK - I strongly recommend this. HK is small and you can taxi everywhere from the Hotel.
