{"text":"2nd Time Round Here- Still just as FANTASTIC!! This is the second time my partner and I returned to the Caribe Princess, and we certainly didn't regret our decision to go back.When we went last year it was amazing, and this year was the same, if not even better!!!On arrival you are greeted with tropical juice and such a warm and friendly attitude from the staff! They seem to bend over backwards to help you in any way, they cannot do enough for you.Again our room was spotless...even better this year as we had a pool view and a view of the sea which was brilliant. The fridge was stocked up EVERY day with PLENTY of water and soft drinks. Our maid did a fantastic job at cleaning our room and ensuring every day, we had clean towels and bedding.The pools again are just faultless. We found that you did not need to fight for a sunbed or even lay your towel out early in the morning. There was plenty available for everyone without being at all cramped.In my opinion the food was fabulous! They had an amazing selection for any food lover. Different kinds of meats, vegetables, desserts and fruits.Throughout the week me and my partner dined at 3 of the all inclusive restaurants in the resort: The chinese, Mexican and Italian, and again they were excellent. At one point during our dining we had the choice of 3 drinks placed in front of us!! water, wine and soft drink! The staff were so kind and friendly and the food served was just like your excellent 3 course Italian restaurant u get in town that you would pay lots of money for!!! The resort itself was faultless again. The gardens are so well kept, beautiful gardens with trees, plants flowers and wildlife running around all over the place- gives you something to look at and admire while you are walking around. Everytime u passed a member of staff they always greeted and smiled at you, no matter what they were doing! They really made u feel like one of the family.We took advantage of the tennis courts and had a great time. They have so much to offer you. The lobby is a fantastic place just to sit and chill out any time of the day or night, with the bar open serving plenty of yummy cocktails!The entertainment was very amusing- they even put on a show of the infamous thriller dance by Micheal Jackson which was really good and showed so much effort!Finally- the best part- the beach. ABSOLUTELY STUNNING...again! Again u did not have 2 fight for any sunbeds as there were plenty available any time of the day. The beach was clean and the waters sparkling blue. The beach hut is really good too if u just fancy a quick hotdog and chips at lunchtime, or a nice sprite to cool u down! Again this is all at your fingertips, you pretty much don't have 2 walk anywhere.On a particular choppy sea day, we borrowed some body boards (which is included) and had a great time surfing the wavesSo as u can see, theres plenty to do in Caribe Club, and I would DEFINATELY recommend it to anyone, and WILL definately be going back in the near future.Caribe club has everything u could need and want.Do not listen to the fussy reviews...its absolutely perfect.
