{"text":"Great experience!! A friend and I stayed here just recently for a week. I was familiar with the Rue Cler area and really liked the quiet residential feel. I chose this hotel based on trip advisor and found that it had also been recommended by Rick Steves. We had booked a standard room on the 5th floor on the street side (all the superior rooms were booked) and it was pretty good size (by european standards) for the two of us. I asked for an upper floor and a view of the eiffel tower and they did not disappoint me. What a fantastic view each evening to see it lit up (or twinkling on the hour) outside your window when you return to your room!!! I ducked my head into a room that was a 'superior' and I would recommend spending the extra $$ for the extra room it provided.Yes, I will admit, this does not look like a new hotel as based on the furnishings. And, yes, I think I saw a bath towel that was frayed a bit. But I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Everyone who worked there was more than friendly at all times. They answered all our questions with a smile. And opened our wine bottle when we realized the cork was REALLY stuck in there!! Who can ask for more? And they recommended a REALLY great restaurant on the next street over La Litote on Rue Bosquet which is a definite MUST for anyone staying in the 7th!The rooms are nicely decorated (bright yellow in our room) and it is really clean (which is a big issue for me). Although halfway through the week we must have had a change in the cleaning woman and we could tell as it wasn't cleaned as well. But still more than sufficient.Breakfast is free if you mention Rick Steves. Hey, I though you get a good deal for what you got---and hey, its free!! If you want more variety for breakfast, yes, Rue Cler is around the corner but I was happy with my croissant and coffee. (you get more than that)The roll down shades are great! Really gives you a great nights sleep. Air conditioner worked great and there is a safe in the room. I would highly recommend this place to anyone and would stay there again in a minute.
