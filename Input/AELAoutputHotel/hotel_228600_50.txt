{"text":"Unfortunate circumstances I was looking forward to staying here as it looked really lovely on the website. It turned out to be a very pretty hotel; clean, good location, spacious bathroom, lovely lobby  buffet. We were disappointed that there was nobody to help with our luggage despite traveling with an elderly person. The elevator was also very, very small. Our unfortunate mishap was that our reservation was cancelled because we did not arrive until 7 :15 pm the evening of our arrival date. Five days before, my credit card was misplaced and the company had to expidite another one over night. Our flight from Portugal was delayed due to weather and so we did not arrive at the Hotel until after 6 pm. Forgeting that the hotel would charge the room at 6 pm the day of arrival, I did not call to notify them of the change in credit card number. They were not able to give us a room despite arriving only 1 hr. later. They did pay our cab and put us in another sister hotel way out by the Barrajas Airport which only had the available room for one night. After calling the MEPalace manager and voicing our frustration again, they found a room for us at the Maria Elena the next day and paid for our cab back, but the inconvienience back and forth with my elderly mother was stressful. Lesson learned...if you have to replace your credit card along the way, don't forget to call the hotels or airlines you have reserved on with the prior number! ","annotations":[]}
