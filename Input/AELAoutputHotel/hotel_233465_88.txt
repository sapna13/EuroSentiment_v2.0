{"text":"Excellent experience We chose the hotel largely on the basis of the positive reviews on Tripadvisor, and we were happy we did.The only con is that our room was smaller than we are used to in the USA. The beds were very comfortable and the A\/C worked great. I would not want to spend much time in that room - really it is only for sleeping, getting dressed, etc. But we were not in Paris to watch CNN.I can't say enough about the staff. I mention Moun in particular, since she was the one who gave us a tremendous welcome to Paris. However, the rest of the staff were equally friendly and most helpful. All the staff spoke English.The room was clean and comfortable. The location was tremendous - allowing us to walk to most places, or hop on a nearby bus line. We did not experience any outside noise in our room. We didn't try the brunch they offer.I have read people bemoaning the lack of a shower curtain. The tub\/shower has a small glass partition covering the front third of the tub. To avoid getting water on the floor, simply stand at the front of the tub, and turn around in such a way that you are facing the glass wall. It also helps if you don't turn the water on full blast. By doing this, we had a good shower in the usual amount of time, and no water on the floor.Bottom line: GREAT staff (best I've ever encountered), great location. great value, and fully adequate room.
