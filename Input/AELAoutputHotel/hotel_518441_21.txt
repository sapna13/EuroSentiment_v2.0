{"text":"Everyone needs the Chedi experience My wife and I recently honeymooned at the Chedi and it was possibly the best experience we have ever shared. It came after months of renovating and wedding organising so we were truly in need of a break and to be honest we probably would have been happy with an un-cluttered room near a pool. What we got however was a truly relaxed and indulgent experience. The Chedi think of everything and do it with style. We had a pool villa for 5 days after being upgraded from a regular villa. The pool villa's are the same size as a small house and provide plenty of room to move as well as the privacy of your own pool - perfect for honeymooners! The staff are super-friendly and will do anything to help you enjoy your stay. The rooms are clean and wonderfully appointed. The grounds are spotless and spacious. The services are magnificent and mostly free. They included everything from yoga classes to free cocktails by the pool to free mini-bar being topped up regularly throughout the day. Your butler will clean your room regularly, sometimes twice a day, bring you fresh fruit and drinks, take care of your laundry for you, organise day trips, drive you into Ubud, bring meals or movies to your villa, basically anything your heart desires. We both had a wonderfully relaxing stay at the Chedi and could not recommend it more. We'll definately be going back and the sooner the better. On a separate note, with the exception of breakfast (which is included) we mostly ate in Ubud and not the Chedi restaurant. This was to experience the local cuisine as well as make some financial savings. Our favourite eating spot was Mangga Madu, a small restaurant in the centre of Ubud. Delicious meals could be bought there for under 10,000 Rp or about AUD$1.20 and the service was very polite. The restaurant across the road which gives diners their own personal cabana in which to eat was also very impressive. The only restaurant that really disappointed was Mosaic. I've read reviews which claim that Mosaic is a culinary must do when in Bali. We would have to disagree. The food is good but not amazing. The service is also similar to every other eatery in Ubud. The menu however is degustation only, with or without wine and will set you back 500,000 Rp each for about 7 small courses, many of which included jelly and foam. The wine list has a good international selection but bottle prices average about 500,000 Rp also. Do yourself a favour and get a local driver to take you to Jimbaran for a seafood feast.
