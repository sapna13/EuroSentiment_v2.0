{"text":"Great Stay Just returned from a great stay at Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach. We went to relax and that's what we did. I read many of reviews before booking this hotel and I'm glad that I did. When booking....(all hotels in Waikiki ) be sure to ask about construction. There is a lot and many hotels will not let you know unless you ask. The Outrigger was in the perfect spot and no construction. We rented the deluxe beach package every morning at 8:00am at the beach rental cabana. This costs $40.00 and includes two lounge chairs and an umbrella from 8:00 to 5:00pm. You can come and go all day. We were right on the ocean in the front row and it was well worth the money for the reserved space and location. We ate at Dukes, Chuck's Steakhouse, and the Hula Grill. Dukes bar was fun and the food was good. Chuck's was fairly average for the price. Hula Grill was incredible. It has great island decor and a limited menu but terrific food. Be sure to order the crab won tons and the shrimp scampi...they are excellent. There is also a small hidden deli to the far back left of the pool. It is down the walk and near the laundry. Great sandwiches for $5.00-$6.00. We found this and grabbed lunch at the hidden deli and ate on the beach. The food was great and we saved money so we could go for a nice dinner. We really loved the Outrigger. Excellent service and great location. I highly recommend this hotel!!!
