{"text":"Loved Barcelona and the Barcelo Raval We stayed at this wonderful hotel in mid-November for 4 nights. It is a modern, stylish hotel. The rooms are interesting and functional. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, the linen and towels were the best we have ever experienced, the shower was great and it had free wi-fi access. The gadgets were fun; LCD TV, funky lighting and curtains that opened at the press of a button. On the couple of occasions we ate in the Hotel, the food was outstanding. It was innovative, fresh, tasty and stylishly presented. The cocktails were very nice too. The roof terrace had wonderful 360 degree views of the city. The distinctive round design and metal cladding on the building meant that the hotel was a bit of landmark and could be seen from many of the tourist sites around the city.We found the staff friendly and helpful. The nearby La Reina del Raval restaurant was also excellent. Turn right up the Rambla Del Raval from the main hotel entrance and it is less than a block away. The bad reviews of the hotel seemed to mainly centre on the shower and the location. I can understand if someone was uncomfortable being naked with their roommate, the shower could be a bit revealing. But, that is certainly only a problem for a minority of people. The shower itself was excellent, as were the toiletries. Some of the surrounding areas had obviously not yet been regenerated yet and I can see why some reviewers might comment on the some of the people on the streets between the hotel and Las Ramblas, but we walked all around the area during the day and night and never felt uncomfortable. It was certainly no worse than any of the areas close to a working port in any of the other major cities we have visited. The cost of the mini-bar items and water was no worse than any other hotel I have stayed in. The advantage of being in a residential area meant that there were many little supermarkets nearby that sold water etc at cheap prices. So you were not a prisoner of the mini-bar. We loved the hotel and Barcelona in general.
