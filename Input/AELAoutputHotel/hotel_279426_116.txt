{"text":"Design oriented boutique We spent 5 nights at the Adagio. We booked an executive corner room. This was touted as having wondeful city views - it didn't! We had a room on the 12th floor at the rear of the building. One side faced a large flat roof and a few apartment blocks. The other actually faced the neighbouring empty building. When this is occupied your neighbours are going to be pretty close and personal! Other than that you should know that this is very much a design led boutique hotel. It's form over function in every respect (and if you like practical over fancy then this place may drive you nuts). The bathroom has lovely Aveda products to use, but the shower is a dud. No settings and not great water pressure. There is no where to have breakfast in the hotel, but there are several options within walking distance. They provide free coffee and tea in the lobby, but not in the evenings (which is just when I fancied a cuppa). Location is OK I guess. It's close to Union Square and near large hotels like the Hilton and Parc55. However, anyone who knows the city will know that these are very close to Tenderloin. This is the city's roughest and most unsavoury area. Adagio is only a block away from all this, so make sure you head towards Union Square everytime you leave the hotel. (Also as an aside, I would say that anyone with kids should to avoid this hotel. There's really nothing there for them.) I have visited the city numerous times and have stayed in quite a few of the hotels. I can't really say that I recommend this hotel to anyone other than young hipster types. Older guests and families just don't quite fit in with the mood of this place.
