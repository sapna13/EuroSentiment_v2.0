{"text":"Okay resort but horrible drinks We stayed at the IFA resort from Feb 9 thru 16th. First of all we were not supposed to stay there. We had booked through the Occidental First club and were supposed to stay at the Sunscape, formerly the Allegro. When arriving at the airport we were met by our Occidental rep telling us that we couldn't stay at the Sunscape, they had overbooked their rooms by 150 people and they no longer had a first club. They recently bought the Allegro. We were extremely disappointed and will be working with my vacation club manager. We paid money for our first club membeship and did not receive any of the amenities we paid for. We also brought 8 people with us on vacation to experience our club. Not the best move for Occidental. They should of moved us to the Grand Flamenco and put us in the Royal Club. the First Club through Allegro\/Occidental vacation clubs are usually incredible and make your stay a 5 star stay. We were not at all happy about this change but were told unless we wanted to go back to the US, we had no choice. They also told us this resort was a 4 star resort. What makes it a 4 star must be the beach, because this was the best part of our stay. The beach is incredible, no complaints there.When we arrived our rooms were ready but they put us in the oldest part of the hotel, about a 10 minute walk just to the main lobby, about a 17 min walk to the beach. The first room was okay, it was clean but not a 4 star room. There are also roosters that wake you up starting at 5:00 am outside your room and do not stop. They need to get rid of the morning wake up calls. We ended up upgrading our room for an additional $15.00 per person per night. The other room was much closer to the main pool, beach, etc and was nicer. They do not provide wash cloths at this resort, only hand towels, very odd. You are only provided one key for your room. When you arrive to your room, your key opens the door and you have to put it into a slot in your room to turn on your lights and air conditioning unit. When you leave, you pull your key out thus shutting off the lights and air... odd. Nothing special about these rooms, they are clean, mostly white, but no pictures on the wall, we didn't have a cushion in our chair, a small fridge but with only water. We did encounter a large cockroach one evening, about 2 inches long, this was on a trip to the bathroom, they seem to come out in the dark, yikes!! We tipped the maid every day and I left her gifts every day. We did get a room full of flowers and towels made into hearts on Valentines day which was very nice. The food was good, plenty of choices at the buffet and the specialty restaurants were all very good. The drinks were horrible!! Again we are used to 5 star accommodations and top shelf alcohol but have stayed other places and have had good drinks. The mixers were sickly sweet. We stuck to beer. The wine wasn't great either. The front desk staff was not very accommodating but you need to be patient and nice. Yelling is not going to get you anyplace. The entertainment staff was great and they work so hard. Most of the shows in the evening were very good. We are used to different accommodations so I probably would not go back there again. There is a restaurant a short walk from the beach called the Jellyfish. You should make reservations. It was delicious. A lot of people in our party did get sick, so I'm not sure if this was due to the restaurant or the food at the resort. Once of our guests took Cipro which seemed to straighten out everything, so you might want to take that with you when you go.
