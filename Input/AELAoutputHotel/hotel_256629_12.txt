{"text":"The hype is justified 4 sure This really is a special place. The hype is justified and all the previous good reviews are bang on. From reception to leaving my bags on exit the service was impeccable and nothing was too much for the staff on hand. I opted for a premier standard room (the second most basic on their list) and it was very impressive. Large, well appointed, high ceilings, luxurious bathroom. The place was more like an executive room you get in other hotels. There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a large hallway entrance, a massive king size bed with options to choose different pillow fabrics (decadent city, man!), an iPod radio\/alarm docking station, advanced climate control, thick sumptuous bathrobes, a well stocked and reasonably priced minibar, a large desk and sofa chair. The bathroom is well lit with a large bath and separate shower cubicle. Enough said √à√\u2020\u2022?you ain√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ gonna do any better for your buck in such a central location because it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ also perfectly positioned in the CBD. Whilst I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ use the restaurant or bar they looked equally impressive and relaxing. I will come back to this place without a doubt. Prices do seem to vary greatly not only throughout the year but throughout the week. I got a great deal for my Sunday night stay but if it had been a Thursday night I would have paid double. A great place to stay for a few nights after you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe touched down before heading to cheaper digs. Unless you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe got loads of dosh to stay here for a week or two in which case I hate you. Enjoy.
