{"text":"Home from Home We have recently returned from a short break to New York where we stayed at the Affinia 50 Hotel - part of the Affinia grup of hotels of which there a few in New York.We chose the Affinia 50 for it's location in Midtown just a few blocks away from the Rockerfeller Centre and within walking distance of hte southern end of Central Park.Our room, two queens size beds as there were three of us was on the 17th floor with views down on to 3rd Avenue. THe room was clean, tidy and all that you need for a short stay in New York as you only really need a place to sleep\/recover from the hectic days.The staff were very friendly and most helpful and you have a pillow menu to choose from - we chose a buckwheat pillow and hypo-allergenic on but there are 6 to choose from.You can take breakfast in the 2nd floor lounge area but we chose to go to the local diner - 4 doors down the road - well worth a visit. On certain nights there is a guest welcome meeting - wine and cheese plus a chat which we managed to make on one occassion - again worth popping in if you have the time.We didn't use the on site gym but we did have a quick look in and it had everything you might need - if you have the time\/inclination.We couldn't fault the hotel and New york was certainly a lot quieter over the weekend - once Monday came along things got a lot busier.A must is a trip up to the top of the Rockerfeller Centre - if it's a clear day you can see for miles and the views are spectacular. We chose to go up on our first day and it really gives you a better idea of the scale of Manhattan Island and the distances to the sites.You can catch the subway one block over on Lexington - take a trip to the Staten Island Ferry - about 15\/20 minutes on the subway - by cab it could take up to an hour!!Make an early start and come back to the hotel late afternoon ready for a shower before hitting the light of Broadway for an evening show.Martin, Sally and Laura WardWokinghamUK ","annotations":[]}
