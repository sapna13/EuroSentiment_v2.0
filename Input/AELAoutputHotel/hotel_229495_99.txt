{"text":"renovated rooms lovely but make sure yours has heat We stayed at the Marriot on March 20-23 with our two young adults and our past exchange student from Spain. The location is great for families with teenagers or young adults as it is a very safe but active place for them to be. They went out at night without us and we felt very secure about it.  The hotel renovations are still going on as reported and for us the first day started noise at 8:30 the next at 7 am. We had booked two executive rooms that were on two separate floors 3 and 7th because the executive floor is not finished however both were renovated rooms which are lovely. Only problem our second room with our kids did not have heat. Totally renovated with all the thermostats but no vent. At 1 am when our kids called down they at first said just turn on the thermostat then after complaints sent someone up who noticed no vent. They then sent a portable heater. At 330 euro's a night this was kind of overpriced for not having heat when it was only a high of 39 during the day. We were very happy though with the friendliness of the staff and really our only problem was the heat. In the excecutive lounge which is located temporarily next to the meeting rooms they do take down breakfast at 10am so if you are on vacation with young people you have to be prompt.I think once all the renovations are complete it will be an excellent hotel to stay at.
