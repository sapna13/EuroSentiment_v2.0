{"text":"Expected more... My husband and I, along with another couple, went to this resort with open minds. Although the staff worked very hard at keeping the place clean, which they did quite well, there were a few things that really got on our nerves.The hotel is in cahoots with the timeshare people and they are everywhere on this resort!!! We had one guy who posted himself outside of our 'condo complex' every morning and never stopped bothering you. The A La Carte dining wasn't any better than the buffet, if anything maybe worse. Seating in the evening for visiting was very limited; there are very few tables for guests to sit around with each other and visit. Toilets, outside of our room, were constantly plugged and difficult to flush. However, there was a cleaning lady in the washroom all the time...probably to try and unclog the toilets.The pool is very well laid out and the beach was absolutely beautiful, you can walk for miles. Activities are limited in this country, though. We rented a car one day and drove around the countryside to get our own real experience. With 4 of us in there, we saved some money and travelled in comfort. Macao beach was beautiful with huge waves and practically deserted. Be forewarned though, if you are going to drive anywhere the roads are terrible and the drivers even worse (more so than Mexico). If you want a holiday with a great beach and just want to lay around then go to Punta Cana, but don't expect top of the line at this resort.
