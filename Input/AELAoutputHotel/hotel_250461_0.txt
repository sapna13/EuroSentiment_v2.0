{"text":"Great Christmas Stay! We've had an excellent stay at the NH-HOTEL FRIEDRICHSTRASSE in Berlin, for 10 days during Christmas 08! Actually, we've just returned today! The personnel was very polite and helpful, the room very clean and taken care of everyday by the staff (fresh towels and bed linen, fresh coffee cups, etc). It had a convenient size, medium to large (for the european standards) with a small built-in kitchen that made things very easy for having a coffee whenever you wanted to. Usually in the morning before leaving our room, as we did not wanted to pay for breakfast or in the evening when returning to the hotel very tired. Very well decorated room with a nice aura. The building is new, with huge glass windows. Very modern. The location is GORGEOUS, next to everything! The best place to stay in eastern Berlin. We couldn't have done a better choice in that. Located literally one step away from the Friedrichstrasse S-Bahn train station. Our room was on the 6th floor, facing Friedrichstrasse, so we had no noise at all. Many times we were leaving the window open as we had a smoking room, but still nothing annoyed us terribly, neither the noise from the trains nor the street noises. Do choose it for many reasons. I would have written a huge list here with the advantages if I could! I will definitely book there again in my next visit to Berlin. I would like to thank the personnel for their excellent assistance! Wish we could return quickly! We had a great Christmas time in gorgeously different Berlin! Have a great new year!
