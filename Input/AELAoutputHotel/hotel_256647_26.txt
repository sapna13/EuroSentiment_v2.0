{"text":"a very pleasant stopover at the Stamford Plaza Booked a superior room special package from the website well in advance as a stopover in Sydney after returning from a 6 weeks trip to Europe, prior to returning to our home on the Gold Coast the next day.It was an opportunity to catch up with one of our daughters and her husband, who live in Sydney, and tell them about our wonderful trip.We were upgraded to a deluxe room on the top floors which was very spacious and well presented. It looks like this one had been renovated.Well, we were more interested in conversation than the room, however we did notice some unusual noise coming from a nearby room for a short while.We had a great nights sleep in a very comfortable bed, but unfortunately we were woken at 6am by the same noise we had heard the night before. Never mind, we looked out the window and watched the air traffic at Sydney airport with all sorts of jets taking off and landing. Its a wonderful view from this vantage point, so close to the airport, but without the noise.The shower was absolute bliss and a welcome back to Australia, following our most recent stay in an apartment in Rome with pathetic water pressure.Breakfast was a typical Aussie fare and we particularly enjoyed having some real bacon with the fillet attached, not like europe where you only get the scrappy tail bit!We scanned the breakfast room to try to identify if there were any honeymooners in the room, but agreed that perhaps it was too much to expect that they would surface for breakfast.We had read the several ordinary reviews of this hotel on TA before we booked and realised that the best chance of a comfortable room was to book a renovated Superior room. To be upgraded to a Deluxe room was a bonus. An airport hotel was a convenient option for us and we are glad that we chose the Stamford Plaza.By the way, every interaction with staff was very friendly, courteous and polite, just what you expect.This is the first time that we have stayed in an airport hotel and we were surprisingly more than happy with the experience. The unhappy reviewers on this site must be a stressfull and grumpy old lot! ","annotations":[]}
