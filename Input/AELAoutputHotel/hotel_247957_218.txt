{"text":"Very nice hotel! I stayed at the this hotel from February 17-24th with three of my friends. We are four females aged 20 and had a great experience. The airport was quick, and we found our bus easily. The ride to the hotel from the airport was about 30 minutes, not bad. We were checked in quickly and even though we requested two rooms side by side we were given 2 rooms in seperate buildings, but the rooms were nice so we didn't ask to be moved (the buildings were close together). The rooms were basic, but not dirty or old looking (buildings 12 and 13). High ceilings, nice king beds and decent cable.The food wasn't the best, i have been to Dominicain twice before and have had better food, but it was edible. Lots of different food, but you can always find food that will suit you (fries, tacos, pizza, pasta). Awesome pizza, its open until six in the morning. Good drinks, lots of variety. Beautiful beaches! Nice pools with a swim up bar. Clean. The grounds are gorgeous and constantly being cleaned. The language barrier wasn't too big of a problem, most of the workers could speak at least enough english to understand what you are trying to say, and you can understand them. The club Mangu is fun,however lots of locals, and expensive drinks but as long as you have drinks before you go you don't really even need to buy any there. Its free to get in and it has two levels, techno and hiphop ish. Anyways, overall the trip was really fun. The hotel was good for the price, lots of food and drinks. The beach is by far the best part. GORGEOUS. Not a cloud in the sky the entire trip (except late at night, a bit of rain). Enjoy!
