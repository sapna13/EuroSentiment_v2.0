{"text":"Excellent Experience at the St. James I stayed at the Sofitel St. James for a four night business trip starting on October 19, 2008. I booked two luxury non-smoking king rooms for my stay, one for myself and another for my client. I was booked into room 602 for my entire stay and was very impressed with the quality of furnishings, fixtures and the lay-out. Bed was very comfortable, as was the room overall.From the start, everything went perfect with one misstep along the way. Staff was excellent and contrary to other comments, I found the staff to be professional and very conscious and caring of our needs without being overbearing. In other words, I did not see staff until they were needed and then they seemed to appear from nowhere to assist and then disappear almost as quickly so as not to be in your face constantly. Housekeeping was simply amazing in this hotel. I never...ever...saw cart, linens or a housekeeper anyplace at anytime however the hotel was constantly spotless. I went to the lobby to meet with some business associates and realized that I had forgotten something in my room. When I returned to my room to retrieve it, my room was cleaned and spotless. This was all done in 15 minutes time and I never saw a housekeeper anywhere along the way. Room service trays and tables disappeared within minutes of being deposited in the hall, again almost magically. The hotel is in THE perfect location and is impressive from our first entry into the lobby. Hi quality and very comfortable but not overbearing or over done.We did not use the restaurant or other in-house services as we were trying something different for every meal out of the hotel. The one misstep and the reason I dropped one star on my rating was that the hotel put my client into a smoking room which should not have happened. While I intended to make a change in rooms with the front desk for my client, my client actually insisted that I not do that as he did not want to unpack and make a move etc. I have no doubt that the hotel would have made the change without a second thought other than to ensure that I was kept happy. Even with that error, my client told other business associates that he had found a new hotel for all future visits to London.I have stayed in several London hotels including, Radisson Edwardian Hampshire, London Hilton Park Lane, Conrad Chelsea Harbor (now Wyndham), Rubins at the Palace, Hilton Heathrow, Hilton Hyde Park and One Aldwych; the Sofitel was the best experience of them all. My room size was excellent, location and view was excellent, quality of the room and bathroom were excellent as was the hotel in general.Unless something really goes down hill on my next visit in four months, this is my new hotel for London visits.
