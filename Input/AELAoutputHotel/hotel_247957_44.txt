{"text":"Amazing Vacation!! Ignore the bad reviews. My boyfriend and I went to the Occidental Grand Punta Cana the week of September 21-28. The only downfall about this vacation was that it rained for almost 4 days! But that didn't stop us from having a great time. I have to say that, check-in for us was a breeze! it took about maximun 10 minutes. We arrived at our room the Tv was not functional neither was the air conditioning, but that problem was fixed in a matter of 10 minutes! The food was great. The buffet was average, but you always manage to find something you like. All the a la carte restaurants were good except the italian restaurant, being italian myself the food was edible. The only problem was that for some reason they serve you the 2 main dishes at the same time!!??? I had a plate of pasta and my salmon all at the same time! really not fun and by the tim ei was fone with my pasta dish my salmon was cold! pretty weird. The good thing about this resort is that you have a pizzeria and a taco place open 24 hours, its great! Communication with the staff was not difficult at all for us considering my boyfriend does speak spanish, I have to say we were indeed treated differently, which made it all the better for us. One thing we do recommend is doing excursions, especially the Outback Safari we had an awesome time and the staff really know how to make you have fun! The horseback riding on the beach was fantastic, so was the speed boat excursion. I definately recommend doing those.Reading the previous reviews we did not have a problem with people coming up to us for timeshares, we did see them but for some reason did not approach us which was good. Overall, I do recommend this hotel to everyone, please ignore all the bad reviews cause for some reason its only snobby american people that give bad reviews, the canadians don't seem to have a problem! Its a 3rd world country what do u expect??? Chillax you're on vacation!! Enjoy it!
