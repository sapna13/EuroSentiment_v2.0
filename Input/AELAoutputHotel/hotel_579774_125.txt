{"text":"too many smokers The package was purchased from Apple Vacations. The trip from Philadelphia to Punta Cana was great. The USA3000 airline was very good. The transfer from the airport to the hotel was just o.k. The hotel is beautiful BUT if you are a non-smoker you will not be happy. This resort is a smoker's paradise. There is no place to get away from the smokers. The smokers smoked in the pool, in the water at the beach, on the lounge chairs by the pool, while eating in the restaurants, in the stores, everywhere except in our hotel room. The food in the restaurants was good. Most of the food was not healthy so you had to look over the large assortment to find what was not fried or in heavy sauces. The service in the restaurants was always excellent.The shows were just o.k.The activities around the pool were just pathetic. The stretching and pool aerobics were lead by people not trained in either class. The pool-guys were totally without manners. We had young children with us as well as many other guests and were offended by one guy who strutted about stating, I'm from Africa, they call me big banana, eh, eh, eh, I love you baby........Most of the pool guys were just too sexually explicit to be employed in a family resort. The Bingo guy was as ass. He tried to show off his attempt to speak French, English, and German. Someone should tell him to get more practice because he was only embarrassing himself. Another thing I found wrong with this resort was that they used recycled sewer water for irrigation (for the sprinkler system). It had a horrible smell and I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ believe it is allowed. Also, all of your belongings, including your suitcases, will have a musty smell once you return home. After multiple washings, the smell will go away.The return to the airport was just horrible. They made us leave our rooms at 7am for a 12:30 flight that didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ take off till 2:00pm. A confused layover in Baltimore (to go through customs) added so much time that we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get back to Philadelphia until 10:30pm. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think USA3000 is treated highly in the airline industry. Overall, I think Club Med is a million times better than Iberostar for activities, entertainment and food. Iberostar was only better for room size, and service. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2154,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2150}]}
