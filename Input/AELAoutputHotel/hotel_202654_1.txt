{"text":"Loved the Sauna, power shower, steam room, wellness area, location We visited this hotel over Xmas 2008 while on vacation to Berlin. Overall, excellent value for money. After a day of sightseeing outside in very cold weather Berlin, it was a pleasure to come back to the hotel and relax downstairs in the wellness area. The rock sauna was in full operation (even over Xmas!), as was the steam room  showers. The recliners were great to curl up with a book in between the heat experiences. Fitness gym, Key lockers  towels all included. All the above were included in the cost of hotel; the solarium was a bit extra (6 euros i think), which we ran out of time ot visit. They had massages, treatments etc also available for additional cost. The sauna was huge, but steam room smaller. The pool which resembles a jacuzzi is actually a cold water plunge pool!!We had swimsuits on in the sauna, but the locals (germans) who were staying at the hotel were all 'au naturel'!!! The rooms were a good size, very comfy pillows, excellent power shower (missing it now that i'm back at home!), lockable safe, and cozy warm room temperature. The bathroom fixtures  fittings were basic (not fancy), but were definitely adequate for how little this hotel + flight cost. There was a fixed unit on the wall for shower gel\/shampoo which you had to squeeze a bit hard, but manageable. Towels were thick, but not super-long\/large. However, definitely adequate. It's not a 5 star hotel, so you shouldn't expect 5 star luxury\/decadence, but it was definitely excellent value for money for a 4 star hotel. I give it 4 stars because of the wellness area downstairs. Without it, it would be a 3.5 star hotel.Another bonus was that it's right outside the underground tube station so very convenient. It was very easy to get here on the public transportation (bus) directly from the airport. I would recommend purchasing a red Berlin Welcome Card, which entitles you to unlimited travel for 72 hrs, including to\/from airport  discounts off museums etc. Excellent value for money vs. taxi, which takes just as long to go from airport to hotel.Breakfast was very expensive (14 euros per person) with minimal vegetarian selection. Instead, i would highly recommend having brunch or dinner at one of the many veggie restaurants in berlin (eg Samadhi restaurant, or Good Time restaurant). See my reviews on www.happycow.net.There were no veggie items on their restaurant menu for dinner, however, directly across the road in Hotel Henriette, there's a restaurant called Shezan which did, and was convenient when tired \/ strapped for time.The reception staff were very helpful in locating items on a map, making dinner + concert reservations. Check out the hotel's website which is very helpful. Overall, definitely made the right decision to stay here while visiting berlin. Highly recommended!
