{"text":"Customer Service sucks!!! We showed up late on a Friday night with reservations for the next 3 days. We were there to attend our High School reunion. We have been on a plane all day traveleing all the way from California. It is 1 a.m. in the morning and the reservationist tells us there is a problem and sent us and about 15 other people to a hotel down the street to stay for the night. Another couple arrived when we did and the wife was so upset she started crying. They compt us for the night but the other hotel was not very nice. Their excuse was that they were full. We didn't even get to bed until 4 a.m. The manager at the other hotel was very gracious, yet could not believe all of the people that the hotel was sending down to her. She told us what could possibley have happened. There was a Salsa convention at the hotel that same weekend and they probably gave up our rooms so that they could make a lot of money on these people visitng their hotel. One of the girls did not have a car and we had to give her a lift to the hotel. The next day she came back to the hotel at 9:00 and got her room. We took our time and arrived back at the Resort at 1:00 p.m. They gave us a room with 2 double beds. This was not acceptable. We reserved a room with a king or queen bed. We ended up waiting 2 and 1\/2 hours for our room. At 4:30 we got our room (normal check in is at 4) and the reunion started at 7. We wasted a whole day of vacation that we could have been visiting with our reunion friends or going to the beach. We stayed for 3 more nights on our vacation and all went well after that. Many at the reunion had the same experience as us. We had them compt us for the valet service, which is not mentioned on the website . Watch out, if you are driving a car the charge is 22 dollars a day. That in itself saved us about 100 dollars. We have never been treated like they anywhere that we have traveled!!!
