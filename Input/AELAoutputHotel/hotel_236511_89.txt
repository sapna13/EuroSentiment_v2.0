{"text":"Great Base for Mother\/Daughter Trip Hotel Monge was a great place to spend our first two nights in France. It was a perfect combination of price, comfort, safety, cleanliness and friendliness. Both my mother (age 63) and I agree we would stay here again with pleasure. We booked our room about one month in advance via email, and the hotel was sold our during our stay (late May). My mother and I requested a room with two beds, and were assigned a room on the fourth floor, overlooking the ampitheatre. The twin beds are apparently pushed together at times to form a larger bed, but worked as separate beds just as well. We didn't mind the spiraling staircase at all; it's absolutely typical of Paris. We enjoyed open windows the first night, but turned on the A\/C the second night--and it worked beautifully. Madame was pleasant, but bless her heart she is overworked! She was happy to oblige (and correct!) my French, and was equally warm with my mother in English. The breakfast downstairs seemed a wee bit expensive, and so we sought our breakfasts elsewhere. Early rising was a bit of a nuisance, since the night concierge sleeps behind the desk on a cot (and you don't want to disturb him), and the front doors are shuttered. Non-hotel details: While a cab from the airport to the Hotel Monge might cost you $100, the RER\/Metro option only cost us about $15 each--and it was a fun adventure--particularly for my mother. We only had one rolling mid-sized suitcase each, and that helped. We are generally fit, and had no problem walking from the hotel to the Notre Dame and beyond. (We actually walked to the Arc de Triomphe, which is a great way to work off jet lag.) Be sure to splurge on a beer in the Jardin du Luxembourg, and let your eyes feast on everything around you!
