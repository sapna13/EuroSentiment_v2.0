{"text":"Great Hotel......................................... Eventually We stayed at the Villa Real for New Year this year We stayed for 5 nights having stayed here a couple of years ago. I have a rule that says you should be very wary of returning to a hotel that you loved on a previous trip however I could not resist the Villa Real. When we arrived we were shown to our room and it was exactly as we remembered it beautiful wooden floors and the sitting area down one step from the bedroom in fact I think it might have been the exact room we stayed in last time. We kicked off our shoes opened our complimentary bottle of wine and started to relax and then it happened................................the bang bang bang of the workmen in the room above. After some 30 minutes I telephoned the reception to complain and the man on the desk could not have been less interested. We need to refurnish our rooms√à√\u2020\u2022?he informed me. However after some instance and a complaint to the manger we were moved to a lovely two storey suit on the 4th Floor. After that and despite what many other reviewers have said we experienced no further noise disturbance. The Hotel is located very near the Prado and opposite Parliament. We found it convenient walking around the old town. With plenty of restaurants and tapas bars near by. It was very close to SOL where we spent New Years Eve. We received a bottle of wine and a bunch of grapes (a Spanish New Years tradition) on NYE and all in all we had a great stay. The bar at the hotel is really nice and they pour the largest Gin and tonic I have ever seen.
