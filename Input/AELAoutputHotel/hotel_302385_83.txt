{"text":"Memorable 40th! For Chinese New Year we decided to go to Bali and celebrate my husband's birthday. We were a family of 4 with 2 teenagers 14  17. The hotel is beautiful. Our rooms were on the Palace Club side but we did not opt for the palace club upgrade. I recommend the lower level with your own stone patio walking right out to the gardens of the hotel. The pools were so nice and never felt noisy or crowded. Like I said, we were there for CNY, but never had a problem with resturants, spa or beach loungers. The staff is wonderful and food quite tasty. I booked the pool bale for just the 2 of us for a birthday celebration. It was so romantic and fantastic, including champagne! They closed the pool for our meal and we were surrounded by candles and flowers. It was definitely a highlight of our trip. The beach is not so great, we are beach lovers, with sea grasses you have to walk through to get to clearer waters. But in them we found sea urchins, star fish and all sorts of critters. We did the Uluwatu temple, but i would not go at sunset. We went around 5ish and noticed great crowds coming around 6. It would have been impossible to take the pictures we did with a crowd. We did a local dinner one night at Sharkeys that was very fun and great food you pick out of the aquarium and is cooked for you. You are sitting in plastic chairs on the sand so no heels, but like I said, very local with vendors coming around selling wares to all the tourists eating. I would absolutely go back and stay at this hotel.
