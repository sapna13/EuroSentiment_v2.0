{"text":"Great for Business  I have stayed here for business quite often over the past few years (and a few times for pleasure) and finally had to write a review. This place has definitely made some great improvements. While the service has always been excellent, the facilities are now up to par for an Intercontinental. As others have noted, the hotel has gone through some major renovations and is now a top-notch resort.Again, the service here has always been excellent. I feel like I'm walking into Cheers every time I step through the front door (OK, I stay here very often). There are too many names to mention but Lorna Mendez has always taken good care of me! This is a great hotel for business travelers as it is very close to the airport (it is not that loud) and has every amenity a business traveler could want, including a nice business center and fitness center.I have also taken my family here a few times for pleasure and was never disappointed. The last time I took my wife here a few months ago and we had a great time - so great that she wants to come back for her big XXth birthday. I told her she could go anywhere (within reason) but she wanted to come back here. The grounds are fabulous and it is right on a beautiful beach. Yes, food and drink may be a bit pricey but you are at a very nice resort and the food is excellent. If you are on a tight budget there is always Motel 6. I would rather splurge on a single stay here than a couple of stays at a budget motel.There are plenty of reasonable dining options within a short walk or ride. Nearby is Lupis, Mi Casita, Metropol, Outback and a Chili√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ is opening soon. Old San Juan is loaded with fabulous restaurants (Aguaviva √à√\u2020\u2022?best ceviche!, Parrot Club, Dragonfly, Tamarind, Tantra) as well as shops, historical sights, etc. There are also some great restaurants between the hotel and Old San Juan. Some of my favorites are Ropa Vieja, Pamela√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ (tables on the beach!), Ajili Mojili, Che√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, Atlantica, Steak  Co. and Casa Dante to name a few. Also you must try Soleil Beach Club in Pinones, an open-air place right on the water with fabulously fresh seafood.An overall great hotel for business and pleasure and great city!
