{"text":"Hawaii 5-0 at the Marriott A group (10 women celebrating some turning 50) of us stayed at the Marriott Waikiki from 5\/20-5\/26. After reading the reviews I was concerned about the property, but after staying there I would stay again. My sister and I were on the 22nd floor of the P Tower. Friends were in the K tower and their rooms appeared to be bigger than ours, but for the amount of time we were in the room, space was not an issue. Bathroom (toilet\/shower) area was small, but worked for us. A pocket door separated this area from the sink\/vanity area. Room was clean and there were plenty of towels. (I am very picky about that). Our view was a little disappointing, we were in 2265 (ocean view), and while we had a view of the ocean, there was a building right in the middle of our view. Location was great, we were close to Diamond Head and the Zoo and the beach was right across the street. We rented beach chairs (2) and an umbrella for $10 per hour\/$40 per day. We only rented for an hour since we were not really into lying out on the beach. This hotel is not a bad walk to the International Market and not to bad a haul to the high end stores area (Tiffany). One of the best parts of my trip was the daily breakfast buffet at the hotel (I know I have issues), the food was great (cinnamon rolls were to die for). Service was just okay, had to hunt down our server on several occasions to get silverware\/water, but the food more than made up for it. Tried the Sushi place, not an expert on Sushi but the California roll was good and reasonable ($3.25). Pool area was nice, we never had a problem finding a lounger and it appeared to be open all the time. ABC stores are plentiful around the island and there are two in this hotel. If looking for a beach mat, the ABC store near the valet was cheaper than the one near the beach (.99 compared to $1.69). Activities I would recommend. (This was our first time in Hawaii): E NOA Circle Island Tour (Tour #3) - Tour was great; it included Pearl Harbor and all the other major points of interest. Just know that the lunch stop is a company owned lunch truck and several people were not happy they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get a choice. Maitai- Catamaran Sail- This was the highlight of the trip. We took the sunset sail on Friday (drinks are included). Friday the local boaters race to Diamond Head, so you are out there with all the other boats. Great!!! Also sailed near a school of dolphins, wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ able to get any good shots of them surfacing with my camera in camera mode, but someone recommended taking it in video mode. It was too late for me but may help someone else. Overall- I enjoyed my stay at the Marriott, but IF I go back (9 √à√¥√ú hour flight), I would try to stay at the Halekulani (which was beautiful).
