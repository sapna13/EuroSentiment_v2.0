{"text":"Great vacation for the whole family! We recently spent 5 days at the Westin Rio Mar with our 3 young children. Everyone had a fantastic time - the resort is beautiful, the staff was wonderful and the weather was perfect. I was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews, but all of our expectations were met or exceeded! We would definitely return to this resort for our next vacation.Some specific points:1) The staff throughout the hotel was wonderful, helpful and friendly. Frances and Shelly, the pool activity coordinators were super - my kids loved the hair braiding, iguana feeding, sand castle building and bingo. 2) Food is expensive at the resort restaurants - Davids Cookies is good for breakfast (bagels, muffins, coffee). We rented a car and checked out the local restaurants for dinner (Don Pepe's, La Parilla, Lolittas and Metropol were all very good). There are grocery stores within 10 minutes of the resort. Walmart is 15 minutes away. 3) Driving is very scary, especially during peak times, lots of traffic, motorcycles spliiting lanes, drivers not stopping at intersections, etc. Be very careful!!4) The beach at the resort is beautiful - aqua blue water, soft brown sand, lots of sand dollars and shells. The waves are great for bodysurfing, but the undertow is strong (be careful with small children - there is no lifeguard at the beach)5) Pools are clean, well maintained and the kids enjoyed the waterslide at the activity pool. Food and drink service is available at both pools (drinks are expensive). We had no issues with overcrowding at the pool although toward the end of our week, more people were coming into the resort (for Presidents weekend). All in all it was a great week!
