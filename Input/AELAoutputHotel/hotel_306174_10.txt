{"text":"Seedy I was desperate. Sing seems hard to get a hotel in even in off periods. This one was taken as my flight date approached and all my well researched options had no vacancies.For the money easily the worst value.However others here had worse than me here.My experience - roof was partially caved in over the bath in the bathroom from rot. There was a similar cave in just inside the apartments front door - I wonder if someone above let their bath overflow in times past.A stained bath with a hand shower that would not sit in its rest so had to be held.A bizarre alcove with 2 chairs in it facing a TV on the opposite wall. 70s style wood panelling.The bed was OK. The AC worked. Creaking boards above us but thankfully no noises of children, or sex except ours.I was asked if I would be interested in young girls by a large smiling Indian woman in a capacious sari outside the 7\/11 near the hotel. Apparently this area is renowned for it.The breakfast was busy, cold and uninspiring. No fresh milk even in a first world country. Cold hot foods - beans, chicken cocktail size sausages, eggs, tomatoes. Cereal. Singapore fried noodles. Thats about it. Watermelon diced witha bit of rock melon in a large bowl is the fruit option.Message - dont go here unless your only other option is the street. If you are going for the Orchard Rd location, consider a hotel a bit out of the way and less popular- eg Little India - the rail system MRT is fabulous and dirt cheap so really the location of your hotel is unimpotant as long as its near an MRT stop.Overall, I didnt care as I was seeing my gf for the first time in nearly 2 months. However, its neither romantic or salubrious. Hit and miss as per other readers. Dont let the foyer deceive you. Thats the best bit.I note its no longer on expedia.
