{"text":"The worst hotel I ever stayed in We stayed at hotel V this week-end and it was a truly terrifying experience!First, when we got to Amsterdam quite early on Saturday, it took us almost 40 minutes to get to the suburb where the hotel is located and actually find the property. Walking to the hotel, we were shaken by the rows of century-old council houses, done up in bad taste, only to find out that our 4 star Design Hotel, was one of them. When we got there, we were told to come back later as check-in time was 2:00 PM and we couldn't stay in the area, because everything was so lacklustre, lugubrious, and felt unsafe. Then when we returned in the afternoon, we had to bring our bags up the 2 floors through a cramped and shappy staircase. The room, when we finally got to it, gave us shivers. The 1970s decor, the open shower, the cold and the noise from non-existant insulation. As a grand finale, the view from the (shared) balcony was ironically pittyful rather than pituresque. Simply traumatising landscapes!Finally, to top it all, we were literally thrown out of the room at 11AM by room service, after a tasteless breakfast, and the lady at the reception when we checked out (probably a senior manager) was despicable: a disgrace, in one word.In a nutshell, there is nothing to make up for any of the numerous drawbacks of this hotel. It's a sacrilege to recommend this hotel as a Design Hotel, in Amsterdam, close to everything.I am terribly dissapointed by this (costly) experience. ","annotations":[]}
