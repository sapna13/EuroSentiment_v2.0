{"text":"Its okay if you know what you are getting This hotel is BASIC, its like a 40 story motel 6 except they include nicer soap\/shampoo and it has a bigger lobby. That said, it is in Waikiki so if you pay $100 its not bad (or less than $60 like me). I must say I got a great deal on this hotel with a package through a big Hawaii travel agency (intials; P.H.) but if I would have paid anywhere near the rack rate I would have felt burned.First this place is not near the beach, so expect a 5-10min walk to get there. Parking is $$ but I did manage to find free street parking my entire stay within a couple blocks.Rooms have a safe (charge), coffee (free first day only), newer mini-fridge in my room, iron\/board, newer wall A\/C and free wifi in the lobby. That is where the ammenaties stop. No blow-dryer.The room was VERY clean, carpet and bed where relatively new (but very economic). Furniture was very tired, 80s laminate with some chips\/water stains and the 19 TV was older with poor reception. Bathroom was also very clean, new grout and no mold at all.Other reviews are right in that the rooms are very small and the elevators are slow, stopping at many floors each time and often 1 or 2 of the 3 that may go to your floors are broken.At the price I paid, this place may have gotten 4 stars for overall value if it were not for the elevator being slow\/broken and the water preasure was very poor. Also the pool is small, like 20' by 20' at most.Also Vit's steakhouse on the ground floor didn't seem bad, the $3.98 sunrise breakfast did the job for 3 mornings in a row seeing as egg n' things down the street seems to outgrown its own reputation and priced itself out.
