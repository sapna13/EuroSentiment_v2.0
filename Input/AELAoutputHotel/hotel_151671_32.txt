{"text":"Book NOW! WE LOVED IT! First trip in PR, but not our last! We loved our stay at Ponce Hilton. Stayed 6 nights in Exec. Tower (didn't pay ahead given unknowns, so paid $200 w\/ taxes included). During our stay never had a negative experience. Staff was well attentive and helpful. Resort was impeccably maintained, rooms were clean, spacious and tastefully decorated. We had ocean front w\/ large balcony, and bistro set, refrigerator in room. Hospitality suite priviledges were WELL WORTH THE EXPENSE! Always well stocked -- 6a-10a continental brkfst foods (only thing missing was meat and eggs, which then moves beyond continental), fruit and cheese during the day, and 5p - 7p hot hors deurves, cheese tray and beverages (juices, sodas, waters and alcoholic included from 5p - 10p! Beer, wine, champagne, hard liquors, mixers ...). Even had desserts and evening liquors from 7p-10p. Saved us a GREAT deal on meals and was ultra convenient. Also had 2 computers and printer for easy internet access. Chose not to bring our laptop, so this was most helpful.When we did dine out, we chose to do so at local places wherever we toured that day. Resort food looked fine, but we can get that at home, so we try to experience local cuisine. Activities on the resort were good for our family (13 yr. old daughter); bikes and bike trails, mini-golf, volleyball, basketball, ping pong, baseball -- all equipment included at no cost and checked out at fitness club. Fitness club was well equipped and clean. Saturday evening they had a 1 hour latin dance demonstration with incredible performers near the buffet area for all to enjoy. Casino is small, but open all hours, and inexpensive table limits -- $1 minumum roulette table -- try finding that in Vegas or Biloxi! They even came around with grilled cheese and ham sandwiches in addition to drinks. On-site club, but my husband's not a dancer, so didn't take advantage of this.As mentioned, no real swimming beach here, but just 30 minute drive from several beautiful ones. 2 pools w\/ hot tubs, plus access to golf  country club facilities. Pool got crowded on weekends, so we took hotel shuttle to country club side, and it was much less crowded. Kayaks available for $10 -- unlimited time, with cool little islands to aim for and explore. Snorkeling is decent from the country club side, but better in other areas.We had a car, so we made our excursions and returned to Ponce Hilton at night. Absent changing hotels several times, you'll need to do that wherever you stay given the size and distance between rain forest, beaches and Old San Juan area. Best beach area was Rincon if swimming beaches is what you are after, but several less commercialized ones are within 30 minute drive from Ponce.Diving was great -- we used Paradise Diving in Parguera (45 min. drive from Ponce Hilton). $80 incl. tax for 2 tank dive and snacks. Water is rough, so if you're sea sick prone, take pills ahead of time. Total trip time was about 4.5 hours. (Compare with Hawaii at $170+ for 3 hr trip). We stayed in Condado Beach area 1 night at Comfort Inn to make touring that area easier. Loved Old San Juan, but hated Condado. Recommend Condado area for those 18-26 yrs who essentially go for the partying, and don't consider themselves beach connoseurs. Incredibly crowded driving, and exits are not well marked. Road construction and heavy traffic adds to confusion.Having vacationed in Hawaii often, we continually compared PR with HI. I now prefer PR. From east coast, travel time is far less; crowds are far smaller, and you feel less like a number (other than in Condado\/Old San Juan -- where you definitely get the Waikiki welcome to our island, give me your money, and get out of the way so I can deal with the next person treatment). PR is much less expensive than HI, for essentially the same vacation (obvious differences in asian v. latin cultures). Many other side trips our 7 day stay didn't permit time. You must have a car to really enjoy the place, unless you just want a 3 day resort get-away. For that I would recommend Rincon if you want ocean swimming; Ponce Hilton if pool and walking beach is fine for you. WHOLEHEARTEDLY RECOMMEND VISITING PUERTO RICO. PEOPLE ARE WONDERFUL, PRICES ARE REASONABLE, AND SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
