{"text":"Good Value I stayed here with 2 girlfriends in 1 room. Everything was perfect except for the bathroom.They put us in a room with a very VERY small shower? tub? it was kind of half of each.... no shower curtain, a tiny tub that's shaped so that you can sit on the other half.It was the first time I'd seen anything in that shape so I can't explain it....Basically, we couldn't take a shower without taking twice the time we usually do because we would get the entire place wet.All of us are Japanese, as in, quite tiny, so it was rather possible for us to take showers (and we're used to sitting in tubs), but I cannot imagine anyone larger than 5ft, 100lbs taking a bath in there.So, my basic advice is to ask for a room with a large bathroom.I'm sure they would of changed us into another room if we said so, but it was just for 1 night.Otherwise, the place was perfect. So perfect, I even have a guilt trip writing about the bathroom.Friendly staff, fluent in English, CLEAN rooms, and GREAT breakfast buffet. My girlfriends and I are meat eaters, so we were so happy to see the salami on the table! and the patio is just gorgeous. Constant hot coffee in the pot being changed frequently by a very nice lady with a great smile.Close to city center but quiet. The place is really affordable too - cost performance was great. Just ask for a large bathroom and you should be fine!
