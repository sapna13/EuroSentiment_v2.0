{"text":"The Absolute BEST!! What a fantastic week! My husband and I were enjoying a much deserved break in Dominican and I'm so glad we chose Excellence. This was by far the best all inclusive resort we've ever been to. I'm truly surprised by some of the negative reviews, it feels like we were at two different resorts. After yes, a rather long bus ride, we arrived. Immediately we were greeted by friendly faces, drinks and treats. We were checked in within ten minutes. The room was perfect, it's all you need. A nice big jacuzzi tub, shower, king size bed, closet space, coffee maker, and bar...which was stocked daily sometimes twice...and when they found out my husband liked scotch, they put a whole bottle in our room for him. The service across the board was fantastic. I got to know a few of the staff, and they really did everything they could to make you feel welcome and comfortable. We never had any problems the whole week, but partly because they were always one step ahead of us. It was interesting to find out that the switch in management from Secrets to Excellence resulted in some big improvements. We spent a few days with two couples that had been there for three weeks, and they said the improvements were quite substantial...especially with the food. The management team were everywhere, looking at the food, talking to the guests. Everyday we were asked how everything was...that's a first for me. Now...I'm a picky eater. I usually struggle at all inclusives...not here, I had a great dinner every night. There is a lot of selection, and a few meals were outstanding...by any standard. The pool is amazing, the ocean was heaven...oh and by sure to check out the lunches on the beach. Every day was different and delicious. What can I say...it was heaven. I was so blown away by the service and quality that I'm writing a letter to the resort to thank them. It's a resort for couples, a laid back romantic atmosphere, no line-ups, no waits, no loud speaker booming at the pool all day long, but still getting you involved. Overall - great service, friendly staff. They make every guest feel like you're on your honeymoon.
