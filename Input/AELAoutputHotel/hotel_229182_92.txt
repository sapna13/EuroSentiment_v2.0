{"text":"definitely not 5 stars This hotel has the perfect location, right in dam square. Check in was efficient and fast. We were given a room in the royal wing, which was supposedly the new part of the hotel (an adjacent building). We had to cross through a clean well lit covered alleyway to get to our room. The security card readers had a lot of trouble reading the key cards to get throught the alleyway. You have to swipe it at least 5 times. Saw other hotel patrons do this. Rooms were average, but my bathroom was NICE. It was bigger than my bedroom in NYC. Clean. Nice toiletries. The faucets were really cheap. I burned my finger (with a blister) trying to turn off the water. The hot water knob heats up dangerously hot. You must use a hand towel to turn it off. The bed was really lumpy and old. The first night I had back pain from sleeping on it so I made my husband switch sides. They did not have an iron or ironing board. They have an electronically sensed refrigerator in the room. When we arrived in our room, we noticed that a bottle was missing from our refrigerator. The next day it was replaced. I'm hoping that they didn't charge me for whatever the prior visitor used. Internet cost 25 euros per day. We went to a local internet cafe and paid 2 euros for 1 hour, valid for 48 hours. Breakfast was served in the Wintergarden. Very nice selection but often ran out of pastries, hot milk, and hot cocoa. They did offer champagne with the breakfast but it tasted like vinegar with bubbles. This hotel is located 1 block from the beginning of the red light district. There was a lot of noise from people partying at night. Trams were located in dam square, a several feet away. I would recommend this place because of the location but only if you can get a good price.
