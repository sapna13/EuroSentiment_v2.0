{"text":"Radisson Love Field - ONLY as a last resort! I book through Priceline and Hotwire, and I just cringe when I get this hotel. The staff is certainly friendly and helpful - they do try. But, their efforts just can't overcome what is otherwise a dilapidated structure that just needs to be torn down. (This used to be the Sheraton Brookhollow.) They recently completed a major renovation, and the first floor (AVOID AT ALL COSTS!) still reeks of paint or some such thing with very strong fumes. Despite the renovation, they kept those stupid doors between rooms that I don't think anyone ever uses (although this place does host large groups). The doors are NOWHERE near sound-proof, and if you have a neigbor, you will be privvy to their TV program selections, conversations, and whether or not they have a snoring problem. The combined shower\/tub\/toilet area is little bigger than a closet. And if you have a lower level room overlooking the pool - be sure to ask them to shut off the piped-in music to the pool area. It's now 1 AM, and I asked them to shut it off an hour ago, and it's still on, despite the fact it's WAY too cold for anyone to be out there. I will say, the private patios with chairs overlooking the pool are a very nice touch. Also, skip the hotel's breakfast buffet. Even with the $2 off voucher you find in your room, my breakfast buffet (and a rather limited buffet it is) came to $13. You can do FAR better at a Denny's. If there's a trade show in town, and this is all you can get, it'll work. But there's just no places to go and eat around this hotel, and it is on the fringes of what I consider to be a very marginal (read: risky) area replete with adult book stores, and sleazy bars.
