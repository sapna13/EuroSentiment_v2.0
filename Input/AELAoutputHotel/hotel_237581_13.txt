{"text":"Family Friendly  We (an American family of four with an 11 and 13 year old) just returned from 3 nights at the Jupiter Hotel in Amsterdam and it was just what we were looking for! A simple, clean, safe, family friendly hotelA quad room with a private bathA great breakfast to start our days offA great location, central to our sight-seeingAnd a fair price..... we paid 149 Euros per nightI just read through all the other reviews and I would say most are spot on.... Here are a few comments in response to some of the negatives written in other reviews from our perspective.CLEANLINESS - My biggest concern is always cleanliness - and this hotel was quite clean. Yes, there were a couple of small rips in the corner of sheets or pillowcases - but no big deal. The beds were comfortable with good pillows and duvets and the bedding and towels were fresh and clean smelling. Our bathroom did look to have some mold on the walls above the shower, but when I rubbed those areas, it was clear they were old stains and nothing came off. I also took a peak into the common bathrooms in the hall - they were spotless. In my opinion, the overall sense was definitely one of cleanliness and orderliness at the Jupiter. SIZE OF ROOMS - Similar to many small, independent 2* European hotels.The bathroom was quite small - shower, sink and toilet all in a row in 3' wide by 8' long closet. When you opened the door to the bathroom, the sink was straight ahead with shower and toilet on either sides. Two people could not be in the bath at the same time. Even with four, we managed.The rooms are on the smaller size, but certainly not terrible. We had an average sized quad room - with a double bed and two twin beds that came down out of wall cabinets. When all four beds were down it was a bit tricky, but survivable. Our room looked out over the back courtyard. There was no noise what so ever and we slept soundly. Finally, yes the stairs were pretty steep - but very typical of row homes in Amsterdam. Luckily, this hotel does supposedly have a lift. We didn't use it, so I can't comment further on it. OWNERS\/STAFF - The owners\/receptionists were a bit aloof -- but they certainly were never rude. And when asked specific questions for help, they were quite helpful. Having worked professionally with many Dutch people, this is consistent with the demeanor of many Dutch and should not be taken personally. Once you get to know them, they are wonderful, friendly, genuine people - just a bit aloof at first.BREAKFAST - This European Breakfast was one of the best I've had in my many travels around Europe in 2* hotels. Coffee, tea, milk, apple juice, orange juice, boiled eggs, three kinds of meats\/cold cuts, cheese, cucumbers and tomato slices, several types of breads, jams, butter, cheese spreads, chocolate spreads, four kinds of cold cereals, fruit cocktail type fruit and whole apples. It was all you could eat. I'm not sure how one can complain - there was lots of protein, two sources of fruits, plus two fruit juices, a nice selection of breads and cereals for grains and a full beverage selection. Breakfast was from 7:30 to 9:30am, unfortunately, and as with our family, everyone in the hotel seems to wait until 9am to go to breakfast - so it was a bit jammed in the room of 5 tables of 4 (20 people) for a 12 room hotel....But, it was never a huge inconvenience, guests made do. And on our last day we just went down at 8:30 and missed the whole rush all together!LOCATION - Perfect! Central to many sights and\/or to the trams\/busses to further sights and yet on a very nice quiet street away from the noise. The neighborhood felt very safe and we were never fearful walking after dark with our children to go out for ice cream near the Leidsplein. PRICE - One of the cheapest quads with a private bath that I found (other than hostels) at 149 Euros per night. Most were closer to 200 Euros. And I am always appreciative when there are no hidden taxes, service charges, fees, etc. upon arrival - which there were not. One tip - they only take Euros - no credit cards. FYI - They have their own website, so we were able to book directly with the hotel  they were very quick to respond. All in all - a great place for the price, just be a bit realistic and adaptable..... we would definitely stay again!
