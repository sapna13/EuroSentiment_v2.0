{"text":"50TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS JULY 13TH 2008Bernadette and John, EnglandJust returned from The Majestic, where we stayed for 5 nights to celebrate our 50th birthdays. My husband had notified the hotel in adavance about our birthday celebrations and they assured him that they would leave flowers or champagne in the room....that was not done. When we arrived we got no real welcome from the front desk staff...no explanation about where things were situated etc or asked if we needed help with anything.We had a superior room which had a balcony and was adequate..the bathroom was not cleaned very thoroughly....the food at breakfast was very good but the room and the service were very disappointing....again we were met with surly, rushed male staff. The pool is tiny, be prepared for that, and very busy at the weekends...the staff up there at the bar are however very pleasant. My husband had a sore shoulder whilst we were there and required some massage treatment, which was excellent, but the sauna, which was also recommended as being helpful by the spa staff ,was broken intermittently. Check out time is at 12 but as our flight was not until 10 30 at night we asked if there were facilities to shower before we left and were told to use the poolside shower by a very arrogant gentleman on the front desk. We finally complained to the lady at Guest Relations ( very pleasant and concerned) and she managed to get us the use of a standard ( very small) room for our last day..she also refunded the cost of 1 night 's bed and breakfast for the poor service we had received.The hotel has a great location but the staff, mostly men, seem really miserable and arrogant and most of the rooms ( public areas as well) are small and have no natural light.
