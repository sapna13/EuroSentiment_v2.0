{"text":"If you think it will be a stress free wedding-guess again If you are planning on having your wedding at this hotel be fore warned. I heard good things about the hotel that is why I chose to have my wedding at this hotel. Little did I know that they were not equipped to manage group bookings. My guest were all over the place and some could not eat the same restaurants with me. The resort itself is nice but the wedding department is another story. DO NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING UNTILL THE CEREMONY AND RECEPTION ARE DONE. The wedding coordinator messed up my whole reception. I was embarassed infront of all my guests..which was quite a bit for a destination wedding. I made all the arragments in advance...hired translators...communicated with them on arrival and still they messed up. All I wanted was vegetarian dishes and no pork. How hard is that. But these were not given to me. Everything had meat and prok in it. My guests had to wait two hours before we were served my reception dinner. It is an all inclusive resort, I could have eat for free, but I paid to have a special menu for my reception. Then I had 1 hour to get through the cake, dance with my husband, throw my flowers, hear speeches and celebrate. Oh did I mention the failed sound system and they forgot to bring my wedding CD to play music. When I went to complain they lied and igorned me. I had to spend my last two days at the resort hunting down the wedding co-ordinator. what a way to spend my first days as a married couple. OH, and they do not send your marriage certificate in 3 months like they say. It takes longer and they do not call or e-mail you to inform you of this. I am still waiting for mine. So if you choose to go and get married, please take all this into consideration, and be fore warned.Good Luck ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1143,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1139}]}
