{"text":"Very comfortable hotel with great service I stayed at the Westin Tokyo for 1 week in March 2007. I was there for business and this hotel was chosen for me due to the proximity to the office.I had a very good experience at this hotel. Upon check-in, I was told that I had been given a very special room on the ladies floor. Apparently this is a new idea at the Westin and obviously just for women. All services including porter, room service, maid service, etc. are performed by women and no men are allowed on the floor. I was somewhat skeptical, but when I got to my room, I was very pleasantly surprised. Towards the end of the week, I moved to a regular room on a different floor so I can make an accurate comparison. My room on the ladies floor had the same furnishings and layout as a regular room but the extras included Bulgari bath products (wonderful smell!), a yoga mat and instructional DVD in the room, ionic hairdryer, female-specific toiletries like bath oil beads and salts, hair bands and clips, loofah, etc.Overall, both my rooms were very large by Tokyo standards, the Westin Heavenly bed can't be beat and the service is wonderful, very consistent with Tokyo in general.On a previous trip to Tokyo, I stayed at the New Otani in Akasaka and the only thing I liked more about that hotel was the location. The Westin Tokyo is in Ebisu which I personally didn't find too lively although there is some shopping and good restaurants and the Metro and JR lines are close by to take you to more happening parts of the city.My only complaint with the hotel is that the on-site restaurants are ridiculously priced. I chose to purchase the Executive package with my room which included 50% off internet charge, happy hour and appetizers and breakfast included on the Executive floor. On my last day I woke up too late to take advantage of my free breakfast and paid the regular price in the cafe downstairs. I think it was more than US$30 for 2 eggs, 2 sausage and 2 small pastries. Tea and juice were of couse extra as well. Its really too pricey for what you get.
