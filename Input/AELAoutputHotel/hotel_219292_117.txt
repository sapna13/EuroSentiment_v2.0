{"text":"Beautiful Lobby We stayed here for a week. If you decide to go there make sure you visit Kimono Bean coffee shop right in the lobby. The coffee is out of this world, totally blows Star bucks away! The rooms where smaller than I expected but acceptable. The house keeping well you can tell they skimped on doing actual cleaning, though the rooms are clean, no roaches or anything like that. The bell hops are excellent. One even got us a limo for $7, needless to say it was the best $7 we spent! =) There is a bus stop right at the front of the hotel which was very convient and the tour buses pick ups are right across the street. Conveince stores are right across the street as well making little purchases like drinks and snacks a quick trip. Can easily access all the stores all about a block or so away. Look for ROBIN who works at the front desk, he is the MAN! Always helpful and friendly, very knowledgeable. The others, meh, they always acted like they where too busy. The pool was cold! I know 90 degree weather everyday and it's cold! But a very nice pool, not too big and never overly crowded, towels where provided and the area is very relaxing and clean. There is no room service or restaurants but they do have a massage room filled w\/ massage chairs w\/ a large screen TV and a Xbox if you just wanted to relax and hang out. All FREE! So is the internet access!! They also have a computer for guests to use, get there early though because it was always in use. All and all it was a decent place to stay. Not the best I've ever stayed at but Robin and the bell hops made it worth while. Oh and make sure you close the sliders, it affects the air conditioner which ours where on the fritz but they fixed it. =) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":107,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":101},{"endOffset":143,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":137},{"endOffset":143,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":137},{"endOffset":143,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":137}]}
