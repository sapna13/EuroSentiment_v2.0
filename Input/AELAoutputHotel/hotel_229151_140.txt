{"text":"Estherea Lives Up to its Fine Reputation We had elevated expectations about the Estherea, given the positive reviews, and we are happy to report that this small hotel is indeed a great find. Our room was very comfortable, recently renovated and decorated with superb taste and a sense of style. The beds were deep and comfy; the chairs and other furniture luxurious, in an old world way. It had a large bath with a double sink, which I did not expect. The public areas on the ground floor are especially inviting, for a coffee and a sweet treat, or a drink in the evening. These rooms have fabulous wood paneling, particularly in the stunning library. Everything was very well maintained and in perfect working order.The unexpected bonus about the Estherea is that it is in a great location, on the innermost canal known as Singel. The back of the hotel looks over Spuistraat, which has an abundance of the city's best restaurants, cafes and bookstores. We had all of our dinners (four nights) at restaurants that were within a block of the hotel - Haseje Claes, Kantjil and Tigre, and the Luden. All very different and all highly recommended. The Greek deli next door and the bakery down the alley on Spuistraat are also outstanding. You can tell we did our fair share of eating while in Amsterdam.From the Estherea, we could walk 15 minutes and be at the Rijksmuseum, the van Gogh, or the Concertgebouw. Or, one can take the street trolley, which is also just a block from the hotel. And, for the sheer pleasure of it, just wandering around the neighborhood, seeing the magnificent buildings on those delightful canals, peeking into stores and brasseries, bakeries and boutiques, taking in what makes Amsterdam so special, is the best reason to stay at the Estherea.
