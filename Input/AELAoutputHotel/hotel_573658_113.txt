{"text":"Definitely not for me... I don't like to be negative, but this place was not at all was I was expecting. Spending at least 1 week per month in hotels, I try to find apartment-style hotel, where I can sometimes enjoy cooking my own meals. Which is what brought me to this hotel, which advertise to be great for extended stay.My first mistake was to not have understood there was no oven\/stove, only a microwave. Okay that was my fault. So I filled up the mini-fridge with a bunch of TV dinners, soups, and the necessary for making sandwiches and salads.I arrived, to find only a very limited supply of everything : 2 teaspoons, 2 forks, 2 glasses, 2 plates, etc. Same thing in the bathroom : 2 towels of each size, that is it. Good thing I was traveling alone this time. Nothing to wipe the counter, or to clean the inside of the microwave with. A cloth is an extra, part of a package (explained below) A tiny trash can (2 cans of soup and it is full!) is next to the unit, first thing you see when entering the room (didn't know where else to put it!) So I've enjoyed the smell of my garbage everyday during my stay. You do have a dishwasher, washer  dryer, but just like the cloth, using it (i.e. soap and fabric softner sheets) will cost you an extra of 3.99$ and has to be ordered. The price is low, I agree... but considerate this room cost me almost 300.00$ per night, I would think this small detail would be included.I've been to several hotels which offer this type of rooms (apartment like), and never was confronted with this : You either offer a hotel-like room, or you offer an apartment-like one! What is the point of having an apartment where everything that differs it from a regular hotel room is an extra???Twice I called Housekeeping (sorry, Environmental Services) to ask for towel and soap. Both time, I had to leave messages on the answering machine and took over one hour to get a response.Staff at the bar were very comfortable with me, throwing me the matches I've politely asked and calling me Sweety (!!??) Glass of wine was given in a rushly manner and without a single smile. The room itself was spacious, clean, the pictures on the website are representative.So my stay was not satisfactory at all. In my own modest opinion, this is a big hotel room which has a microwave, sink and an empty mini-fridge, with a quality of service which doesn't match the price asked.
