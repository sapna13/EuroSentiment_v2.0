{"text":"ok for a short trip I returned from my trip to PR about a week ago. Overall the hotel was not bad. The hotel room was nice, but our bathroom was disgusting. The was something on the shower curtain that we thought could be 1 of 2 things. And the coffee pot was in the bathroom??? They gave us a free upgrade and the view was nice except the people in the next building could see right in and the curtains were VERY sheer. Beware that if you go through Rriceline or any other travel site, there ARE hidden charges. We had to pay around 12.00 extra a day in hotel fees and 15.00 a day just to park there! The price of the food was very high, but excellent. To eat at Sirena at the hotel, with tip it was 120.00, Salsa was about 50.00 and for breakfast at Bananas, about 20.00. By the way, you never get free refills. You get 3 sodas, you pay for 3 sodas (at 3.00 each!) Eat a Old San Juan 10 min away, you can get amazing food for half the price. Everyone was friendly however service is VERY slow, but the whole island is that way. A very nice gentleman at the hotel booked us a catamaran trip by Castillos Tours to Icacos island and it was well worth the 89.00 a person. We stayed 4 nights and that was enough. Anything longer than that, you can stay at a nicer hotel just down the way on the same beach. By the way, it is dead there during the week, but the hotel was buzzing on Friday night. Recommend going during the week. Hope this was helpful!
