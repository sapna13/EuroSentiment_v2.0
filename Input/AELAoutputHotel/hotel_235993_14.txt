{"text":"Once again with Alessandra Once again we stayed at the Hotel Alessandra in Florence, I think this is the fifth time now, but who's counting. We first stayed over ten years ago when we knew nothing about it except the location, - it was probably our second or third choice. We got a delightful family room with our two sons (now grown up) and realized that we had stumbled across a gem - for its friendliness (not just Alessandra and her son Andrea, but all their staff), its location (a two-minute stroll to the Ponte Vecchio), its atmosphere (modernized interiors but still a genuine renaissance building), and its comfort. There are a variety of rooms, each one is unique. Almost all of them are spacious for a European hotel and the bathrooms are well-fitted and spotless. The only drawback is the twenty or so steps before the lift, slightly daunting with very heavy luggage.Yes, Florence is getting a bit crowded, especially in summer, but it is still one of the world's greatest cities. Walk to San Miniato and take in the view, go to the Uffizi an hour before closing to avoid the queues, (if an hour's not enough go again). Santa Maria Novella contains almost an entire history of renaissance fresco painting (though for Giotto you should go to San Croce), ask for a free tour. Tired of history? There is still all that shopping and eating and drinking. Exhausted? It's nice to be staying at a comfortable hotel right in the center.
