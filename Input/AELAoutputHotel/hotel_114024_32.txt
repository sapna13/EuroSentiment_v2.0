{"text":"A Beautiful , old lady ... with dripping mascara I wanted to like staying here - I really did! But, in the end, it wasnot at all as charming as I thought it would be.Check-in was lovely as we were upgraded without having to ask for it.However, the suite we received was not quite what I imagined: 2end floor, old hotel, ocean front- sounds good, yeah?! Well ... it was and it wasn't. View-wise, it was lovely; as far as furniture and interior, it looked like a used dorm room. I realize the room turn-over in Hawaii is tremendous, especially at popular hotels, but surely a single night's fee would replace an entire sofa and\/or a chair or two! Sparse, well-worn and without a designer's eye is how Iwould best describe it. The Bedroom area was better however, but carpeting, generally - throughout the hotel, needs a face-lift. I've read here that they are closing soon for a 7 month make-over. This should help - and lucky you who come after.: )The Seafood Buffet (Fri. only) was a surprisingly great value. The staff were friendly (but WHO isn't in Hawaii?!) and efficient. Recommended; even if you aren't staying there, though you need a reservation.The pool\/ beach staff were all wonderful and the location is excellent for anything you want to do in Oahu. If, like me, you REALLY MUST stay here once, I'd probably ask for a better room and pay more were I to do it again. I really think it is a matter of Sheraton\/Starwood not having enough money (nor wanting to spend it) to take good care of this grand old lady, and make it the first class place it is rumored to be. I realize it is an old hotel and an icon and that maintenance costs must be enormous, but I would say to Starwood, don't buy it if you can't afford to keep it up. Sadly, in Canada, the Fairmont group seems to be in the same straights with the old CP hotel group including such icons as the Banff Springs Hotel - now a 3 to 3.5 star experience in a 5 star hotel, supposedly - except in the most excellent rooms. I'm glad I had a chance to stay here, but would go to the Halekalani, easily, next time, which cost about the same and was up to expectations. :(As well, be careful of the 'welcoming' message from Starwood Hotels' located, conveniently, in the main lobby'. They want to sign you up for a 90 minute presentation on a time-share purchase plan on Kauaii they are building. They offer 'presents', but don't bother unless youare really interested in said purchase - enjoy Hawaii instead! BewareMainlanders bearing gifts ... ; )!
