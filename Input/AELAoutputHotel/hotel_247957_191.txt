{"text":"Batteries Fully Restored Who is writing the lukewarm reviews of the Occidental Grand in Punta Cana??? My girlfriend and I just returned from our stay there earlier this week, and all I can say is, wow! I must confess that after reading a few reviews of the Occidental on this site prior to travelling, I was feeling a bit leery and trepidacious about about the wisdom of choosing this particular resort...but I'm deliriously happy to say my fears were completely unjustified.The resort is stunningly beautiful; everything was clean and extremely well maintained. The staff were for the most part extremely friendly and helpful, (when I return, and I will return, I will, however, make more of an effort to learn more Spanish...although you can get by speaking English, I think we missed out in meaningful exchanges with alot of the Dominican locals) the food was wonderful (although the cooks have a tendancy to drench everything in sauces). The beach was wonderful, the pools were immaculately clean and the room was spacious, cool and (hate to sound like a broken record, but...) clean. Be warned, however...unless you are in the Royal Club...there is no free internet access on the resort. The lobby offers access using resort computers, however they charge $7.00 per half hour, $12.00 per hour or $25.00 for one day of access. There is another option, however. Across the street from the entrance to the resort, there is an internet cafe (there were two, but one of them has since closed) that charges $2.00 for a half hour...sorry, don't remember what it was by the hour. The only problem I found with using this site was you have to pass by a number of tourist trap stores with shop owners who can be very in your face. I think most tourists would not take issue with this, as although the shopowners are aggressive, they are also very charismatic and friendly, however I personally found it all a bit much. Before we went to Punta Cana, there was a bit of a scare about Malaria and although we did not see any mosquitos around the resort, we did discover a few in our room. When we reported this to the concierge, they seemed quite shocked. Later that evening, we witnessed a large truck driving behind the buildings spraying very nasty looking stuff into the air...a bit disconcerting if we had been out on our balcony.The entertainment was amazing and the Occidental Fun Club performers were practicing and entertaining constantly...very hard working and great fun.The disco, the Mangu, is touted to be the best in Punta Cana and is open to locals as well as tourists. I had heard alot of not too pleasant things about it; women being groped and harrassed by Domincan men, and it being a favourite spot for the local prostitutes (some fellow tourists confirmed this information). We did actually venture in, however it was rather early and we didn't stick around, so I can't really give a first-hand account...I was rather freaked out by the sign at the entrance declaring that you couldn't come in with your guns...guns???? hey, I'm from the east coast of Canada and am not used to that sort of thing. :)In closing, if you are looking for a great place to relax, soak up the rays, eat really well, and be pampered...the Occidental Grand is the place for you. Although I may have mentioned a few things that may sound negative, believe me...the good things overwhelmingly outweighed the bad.
