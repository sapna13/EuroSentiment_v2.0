{"text":"Second time unlucky Had a great holiday in 2006 so went back this year, a big mistakeWe were given a room with somebody already in the room and then another room where virtually nothing worked for eg. air conditioning would not switch off, no hair dryer, fridge broken, water coming through toilet roof, no wardrope lights, no glasses in room, no batteries in tv remote control, toilet running all the time etc.I offered to give reception a list of the room 11\/110 problems so they could fix them for the next guests but they were not interested.Next day we were upgraded to premium class block 23.For three days we had sometimes luke warm water or no hot water.Again they offered to change us if the water problem was not sorted out by evening, it was and we were happy, but only for two days and then cold again.When we went to reception to complain it went straight over the recepionists head and we asked for the manager, he was very apologetic and said to come back at 15h00 for a room change.Again we packed our suitcases and went back at 15h00 only to find reception knew nothing about our room change and told us to come back at 16h00After sitting in a hot lobby for an hour we went back to reception again only to find a new receptionist knew nothing about our room change.We eventualy got a room change and the last few days of our holiday was fine.The main pool which is featured in the brochures was closed for the duration of our stay.The hotel said they had informed the travel companies, also there was a smell of paint and varnish every where you went accompanied by building noise.This hotel has major problems with their maintaniince and reception staff not knowing what the left hand is doing from the right hand.
