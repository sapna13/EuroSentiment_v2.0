{"text":"Non Smoking, Not Completely True This was the most expensive hotel we stayed in our Netherlands and Belgium trip but then again most of the hotels in amsterdam were very expensive on those dates. We paid 140 euros per night without breakfast and I really wasnt that happy about the place. No refrigerator in the bedroom, bedroom was small, walls were too thin, you can hear everything, above, beside and around you and the worse thing is that I smelled smoking in the other room. When I asked the front desk he said that they have smoke alarms and it would sound if someone smoked in their rooms. We stayed in room 312 and our french neighbors were huffing and puffing through the wee hours of the morning. We hate smokers and that really pissed us big time. As a warning, if you have kids, dont leave them with the remote because there is a porn channel. That might be good for adults :) The room is modern with contemporary hip design. It reminds me of the paramount hotel in NY with its all white simplistic clean line look. Now for the good, Jessica who helped us on our arrival was fabulous, she provides great service and gave a wonderful restaurant recommendation, MUDERS which means mother. This place is not your fancy place but your local comfort food place, oh so yummy. You need reservations to get in and you need to be careful when you look for this place because there are no big signs. we walked past this place 5x, can you believe that? They have free internet connection in the lobby. If they truly get strict with the smoking and if the rates is less than 100 euros, I will recommend this place and even come back ","annotations":[{"endOffset":974,"mention":"paramount hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Paramount_Hotel"],"startOffset":959},{"endOffset":999,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":994},{"endOffset":1256,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":1249},{"endOffset":1256,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":1249},{"endOffset":1256,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":1249}]}
