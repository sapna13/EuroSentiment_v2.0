{"text":"Great location, bring bomb shelter. After being greeted by a surely attendant we worked our way up to the room. We were pleased to find it in the back of the hotel (we had asked for a quiet room as opposed to street facing). After a few moments it became clear this wasnt the best idea. Just out back construction was going on that was rather loud and unpleasant. It would turn out this would be the least of our problems. When I asked the front desk for a room change (this was 11am) they swore up and down they were fully booked and could not accommodate such a request. (Despite the fact I saw no less than 5 other rooms check in over the course of the day)The entire time the front desk folks were surely and unhelpful. There was but a single woman there who took the time to actually look at me, as well as make efforts to resolve the situation. Indeed she was a pleasure to interact with, her coworkers could learn a lot by watching her interactions.On the plus side the hotel room was quite spacious, the beds rock hard (which we prefer versus soft!), and a blissfully strong shower. The interior hallways of the hotel are very well finished, walls\/floors covered in marble. As it turns out this visually appealing remodel would be this hotels critical fault. Whenever a guest leaves a room, the door slam shut, reverberating and echoing off the walls with such intensity one would swear the hotel was under seige and a mortor round just penetrated the hallway. This is how we awoke every morning between 6 and 7am (apparently there was a conference in town that week). Luckily the conference attendees were in bed early and stayed put, otherwise this warfare would've continued randomly during the night!if you like to wake peacefully in the morning, or dont want to endure flashbacks to war time memories, you may wish to stay someplace else.
