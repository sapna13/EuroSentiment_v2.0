{"text":"If you are going with your baby read this So after much homework and reading all of your reviews we choose to stay at the Bahia Principe. Did we love it? no not really, but it also wasn't all that bad either. Check in was great! we were diamond so we did not have to wait at the front desk to check in which was a bonus. We travelled with our 14 month old daughter and requested a crib. I e-mailed the resort 3 weeks before our holiday to put in my request and the best they did was a pack n play. This is a 5* resort,so that was annoying. After 3 days and about 10 different people we finally got a crib!!!! The rooms are nice, the property is gorgeous without a doubt. The food, well for a 5* again sorry but you can do better than that. I have stayed at 4* hotels that offered a better variety. If you are staying for a week then you'll be fine anything more thenthat....good luck to you. My daughter did not eat anything. She did not like the food whatsoever. I would strongly advise bringing enough food for at least1 meal a day if travelling with a baby. Most of the staff are really friendly and great, others are not. Somehit on me right in front of my husband which was just crazy. We ate at the japanese resaurant which was great. Cafe de Paris, also great and the mexican which was our favorite. The restaurants are actually good, it is the buffet that is just okay. I have travelled the world so my expectations were high, I wouldnever suggest that this is not a great place to go to it just isn't a 5* hotel. Because we travelled with a baby we did not get a chance to see the shows. Make sure you re-apply your sunscreen often especially for your children, and bring bug spray. Have fun!!!!! oh and the drink are ONLY good at the lobby bar. Cheers ","annotations":[]}
