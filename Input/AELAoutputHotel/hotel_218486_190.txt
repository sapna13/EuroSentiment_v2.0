{"text":"Mixed feelings We have stayed in the north before so we did have another hotel to compare with.At first thoughts of the hotel were excellent the reception and grounds are beautiful and after a small mix up with the two rooms we had booked we were reallocated rooms next to one another and they were both excellent and clean throughout our stay. The grounds are very big and it took us some time to work out where to go to find everything.As said in previous reviews there are 5 restaurants plus the buffet. We found the Japanese to be excellent, and made two visits to it plus the Mexican and Italian, we were a bit disappointed with the Spanish but perhaps we ordered the wrong things. We didn't go to the Brasilian. Unfortunately my husband and myself were disappointed with the buffet although our kids ate there every night. The food didn't seem hot and my husband was ill twice so you immediately wonder if it is something wrong with the food especially as it was luke warm.The hotel has 3 pools although we only used the one nearest the beach and the main one which has a pool bar. We enjoyed using it until the weekend when a huge influx of locals came to the hotel. A lot of people spent all day at the pool bar getting very drunk and again we started to wonder if this contributed to my husband getting ill. There didn't seem to be any control over what happened in this pool, ie some people eating pizza on side in pool.The beach is lovely and not crowded. You are guaranteed a sun bed but if you want one with a parasol you need to get up early. Our kids made loads of friends there who were lovely and thoroughly enjoyed themselves.We were a bit slow in finding the nightly entertainment as it is in a separate theatre but what we did see was very good. We went on one excursion the monster truck safari and I would thoroughly recommend it. It is excellent and well worth the money. Bring some gifts for the children in the villages, pens, small toys, clothes, shoes will all be very welcome and it is lovely to see their faces.This is a beautiful hotel and in fairness my husband was the only oneto be really ill so it may have just been the heat. The service however is not good overall which is a shame. Especiallyin the buffet restaurant where she could wait for ages for the staff to relay your table or offer you what you would like to drink which was frustrating. We did tip but it is hard to get a regular waitor\/waitress as it depends where you sit.We probably would not go back to this hotel unless we could be guaranteed the buffet and service improved.
