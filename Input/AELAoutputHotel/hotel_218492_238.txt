{"text":"Great vacation We were in Grand Oasis Punta Cana from 19th Dec. 2007 to 26th Dec. 2007. We had a great time and my daughter who is 16 years old wants to go to the same place again.We liked our room (# 3130); it was next to the beach and the pool. Everything was very close by and in couple of days we feel safe to send my daughter to the room alone even. Hotel and surroundings were clean all the time.We really enjoyed all restaurants and food specially seafood including lobsters on Christmas even. We eat Lobsters lot but never had delicious Lobsters like that. My kids freely went to the beach restaurant and picked what they wanted during the day. Non-alcoholic drinks were very good. I never forget the Christmas Eve dinner at Windows.We enjoyed all activities: Table-tennis and Tennis (they have rackets), bike rides (with no helmets.. my son was not comfortable with it, but he did it) in the morning (thanks for the guide... sorry I forgot his name) especially with my 8 years old son. My kids and husband spend lot of time near the Pool table and thanks to Carmen for her kind smile and support all the time. It was an open and safe place for kids even.Except one day always our room was clean. Did not see any bug. Air-conditioner  iron worked fine. It was an ordinary hotel room but I liked the size. We took the Safari through Sunwing and it was a day long trip. I wish it was shorter than that. They could take us to a place for horse riding closer to the place we went. We saw the same thing on the way and it will be nice to organize this trip couple of hours less than now. They took us to a souvenir shop but prices were very high. I bought a mermaid wood statue from one of the vendors in the resort for US $ 60, but this shop said similar one is US $ 450 (finally he came down to US $ 200). All the fancy jewellery and cigars also were very expensive there. Sunwing should take us to a reasonable store for shopping. Be careful for buying things from this store.I learned to bargain during my holidays and got couple of good deals. If they say US $ 30 then ask it for US $ 5. I bought lot from Miguel and he bought things from the city even for my request.We tipped couple people but they were not expecting from us. I gave couple of Canadian pens and notes pads too. Everyone was nice, very polite and always smiling. Some could not speak English but we did not have any problem.I loved the coffee they make at the Beach Bar. I asked them to use a bigger cup and enjoyed every late night.We did Para Sailing, Kayak, Catamaran (thanks for the guy who trained my husband) and enjoyed all. We did not find hard time to find chairs in the beach because my husband or I went to the beach around 8 am and reserved them for the family (like others do).We enjoyed dance and water aerobics lessons at the pool during noon.Animation team always worked hard with kids and adults to make them happy. On 25th Dec. Santa arrived by motor boat and gave gifts to every kid.We had couple of disappointments too. - We want to get more US $ (they advised us not to use our Credit Cards) but there was no Bank Machine. Front Desk also did not have enough cash. They asked us to get a taxi and go to a bank. But my husband walked to another resort and got it done.- Somehow my husband lost his wrist-watch. I complained it to the front desk and they noted it. That was it. I do not think they do anything to find something you lost. There is no Lost and Found place or no inquiry with the staff (especially maids).- Most of Night Shows were great for adults and kids. But, there was one show not good for kids. These shows should suitable for the whole family because we have to go there with our kids at night.I would like to recommend this resort to anyone who likes food, relaxation and other extra activities during a vacation.
