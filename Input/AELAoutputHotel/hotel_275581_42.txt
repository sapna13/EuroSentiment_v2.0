{"text":"Gone downhill in the last 2 years We first stayed at the City Inn two years ago and had such a great time that we didn't look at any other hotel the next time we came back to London.Although the front of house staff are amazingly helpful, standards at the hotel have started to slide. We checked in at 4pm and that took over ten minutes for them to find us a room, even though we booked over a month earlier. We were on the Autumn package that offered us free champagne on arrival. That was actually only valid between 6pm and 8pm that evening - no use when we had theatre tickets booked and needed to leave the hotel well in advance of that time.On Sunday morning we waited over 15 minutes for breakfast. The hotel was very busy and they had thoughtfully opened up the private dining room on the first floor and put a buffet breakfast on there to contain the overspill. Unfortunately the staff upstairs were not talking to the staff downstairs and it took them far too long to find a table for the two of us, even though downstairs had plenty of space. We both ordered the full English breakfast which arrived promptly. I had to send mine back because everything on the plate was cold. The replacement again arrived quickly and was on a warm plate, but now some of the things had been burnt in order to warm them up. The breakfast on Monday was much better, although it took 20 minutes to arrive, possibly because we avoided the bacon and egg option.There were other little things that you would not expect to find - no bath towels in the bathroom, Wi-fi in the room didn't always work and the computer was also temperamental. The staff sorted out the problems quickly and efficiently, but they shouldn't be happening in the first place. ","annotations":[]}
