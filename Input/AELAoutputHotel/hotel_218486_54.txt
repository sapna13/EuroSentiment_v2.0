{"text":"Terrible Vacation We vacationed, and I use this term loosely, at the Barcelo Dominican beach Aug 8th thru Aug 14th. Our party consisted of myself, husband and two 14 yr old sons.We booked the vacation through Apple tours and got a pretty good deal, around $700 per person. We had vacationed with apple in the past but normally stayed at 5 apple resorts. This one is rated as a 4 apple. I thought this would be okay because we had stayed at Barcelo resorts in Mexico and were always happy. This was the exception.Upon arrival we were told that we would have to wait approx. 3 hours for our rooms to be ready Not a real problem. the main problems were in the fact that the staff spoke no English and were rude most of the time. We had problems with our door lock that took 5 hours to fix and about 10 trips to the front desk, which was a long walk. By night we were all extremely tired and grouchy. The staff did not care and seeemed annoyed with us.The second day started with a trip to the beach, again quite a long walk. The beach had lots of palms and shade was not a problem. There was a lot of seaweed and boat atraffic. There was a little shanty town vendor area right next to our side of the beach and we were constantly being harassed by vendors. The hotel lets them come right up on the beach. We were stalked from day one. They were terrible, it made trips to the beach unenjoyable.The pool that was closest to our room was a nice big pool, not overly crowded with lost of umbrellas, but the water was hot, really hot, The food was fine, lots of selection, no problems.Our room had a bat and a lizard in it one night. Put towels at the crack at the bottom of your door as i found that they were small enough to crawl under.If you have not already booked a vacation with this resort, I highly recommend against it. If you have, I would brush up on spanish, and get yourself in good physical condition before the trip because the complex is huge.
