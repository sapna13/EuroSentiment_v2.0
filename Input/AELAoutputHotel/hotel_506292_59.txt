{"text":"Surpassed expectations The Uma Ubud is a boutique resort in a class of its own. Whereas many of the very nice hotels in Ubud are expensive (US$400+), at the Uma you get tremendous value for money for the approx US$200+ you pay per night. The Villas were done in a very elegant and understated manner and with only 29 rooms, there wasn't a sense of the resort being overwhelmed by tourists. In fact, there was a very peaceful air to the place with its gardens and greenery evoking a mood more befitting a more mature property.While attention to detail was certainly first class, the standout aspect about the hotel was the service. This was our 6th trip to Bali and having stayed at many properties - some of which with very good service - we have to say that the Uma Ubud trumped them all. From check in, to room introductions, to wait staff, to activities staff, the Uma Ubud's people excelled in their service and in their commitment to making each guest feel at home.The Uma Ubud was also very well located, being along beginning of the road into Ubud. Most of the other top end hotels tend to be on the ridge above the Ayung River whereas the Uma Ubud's locations enabled us to walk into town in ten minutes. The Neka Art Museum was also right next door, and the Mosaic restaurant is just a five minute walk down the road. Another plus for the Uma Ubud is that you are able to use the one of a kind spa at its sister property, the Como Shambala Resort at Begawan Giri. The hotels will provide complimentary car services to each other. The outdoor spa closer to the river at the Como Shambala is worth the several hundred step trek down (and up) from the resort for that sense of being away from it all.Overall, a first class hotel with tremendous value for money. I would certainly stay here on any return trip. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":109,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":105}]}
