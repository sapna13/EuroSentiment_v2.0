{"text":"5 STAR HOTEL 3 STAR STAFF Stayed here 5th-9th April to celebrate my 40th birthday.A very speedy checkin, as we were whisked off straight up to club lounge. A warm welcome in club ,but noticed almost every guest after us were greeted with a chilled glass of champagne and we weren't!! Ok we just assumed a slight oversight on their behalf and maybe they didn't have time before our arrival. Anyway ,room was what we booked, 2 doubles on club floor with a view of the beach and the city. But considering we were in Barcelona for a birthday celebration there were no extras in the room, such as a cake, or some chocolates or a bottle of champagne to add a little special extra touch. But we had booked a romance package which included a butler and breakfast the following morning but unfortunately concierge on club level FORGOT to arrange it for us!!!! O.k then, another oversight!!!! Next, my daughter was told she couldn't take her cookies to the room as all food was to be eaten inside the club lounge. Which was fine and we explained to her that if these were the rules then fair enough, until, less than 5 minutes later another guest simply waltzed out of the lounge holding a glass of wine and a slice of cake,while watched by a member of staff who simply smiled at her. At this point we were beginning to get the feeling that this was not a very child friendly hotel, and different rules applied to different people.And we have stayed at 3 other Ritz hotels, all club level and never experienced anything like this strange attitude to younger guests at all. Obviously, we did complain to management who did apologize but they didn't make up for the forgotten romance package, we didn't even get a complimentary chocolate, never mind a bottle of champagne. My overall opinion of Hotel Arts is that it is a beautiful hotel, in a nice location although slightly noisy because of the hotel's position(part beach, part city). Food is nice but not much choice on club level, drinks a plenty though. But staff, who need to work experience in the USA to learn how to meet the levels of service that Ritz Carlton guests truly expect and deserve alongside their children, who possibly are their guests of the future.One final comment which we found EXTREMELY IRRITATING was regarding the lovely flat screen plasma in the club lounge which only played dvd's ALL day. But to add to this misery it played only CHARLIE CHAPLIN dvd's ALL DAY. Please change this Hotel Arts if you read this review , to a watchable T.V before it drives all your guests insane or sends them to sleep.ZzZzZzZz ","annotations":[{"endOffset":147,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":143},{"endOffset":178,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":174},{"endOffset":178,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":174},{"endOffset":440,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":436},{"endOffset":598,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":594},{"endOffset":598,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":594},{"endOffset":618,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":608},{"endOffset":812,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":808},{"endOffset":812,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":808},{"endOffset":812,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":808},{"endOffset":939,"mention":"cookies","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cookie"],"startOffset":932},{"endOffset":995,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":991},{"endOffset":1205,"mention":"slice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sliced_bread"],"startOffset":1200},{"endOffset":1213,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1209},{"endOffset":1472,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1468},{"endOffset":1472,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1468},{"endOffset":1472,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1468},{"endOffset":1725,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1716},{"endOffset":1725,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1716},{"endOffset":1725,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1716},{"endOffset":1836,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1832},{"endOffset":1966,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1962},{"endOffset":1966,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1962}]}
