{"text":"Punta Canwe have service? To start off, our family of 6 took this vacation as a business benefit which we receive, once a year, a five star resort vacation. This one, by far, has been the biggest letdown. When we arrived we were excited but once we walked into our rooms we were a little bit unsure of the quality of the hotel. Despite that the hotel is only 3 years old it appears to be more like 30 (no exaggeration). Of the three rooms that we each had two had problems. The first room did not have the bathrobes or slippers which were promised, and the toilet seat would not stay up (very difficult for the men). The plugs were barely functional in the sinks and bathtubs, there were stains, the ceiling and tiles were cracked and covered in grit. The second room needed improvement. For starters, having a working light in the shower, a working telephone, and not to mention the missing alarm clock (not that the ones in the other rooms worked), would have been nice. Moving on to the service. The tidiness of the room seemed to dwindle after the first day. First everything was done excellent. But then they stopped bringing clean towels and restocking the minifridge. Then it was the cans and garbage being left behind. Finally the bed was skipped over completely. Fortunently we had one towel for the two of us to dry off with.The food quality was good, but not five star quality. Ordering a drink could sometimes be a task and even when you placed your order you weren't really sure what you were getting. We had several great waiters that we tried to find every night, but the remainder left us unsatisfied and disappointed. We were excited about in room internet (even though we had to pay) but after waiting for two hours after paying for it and no one showed up to fix the problems that we called about several times we gave up. From our experience figure out a way around problems, don't bother asking for help (they don't seem interested in your needs).The Casino was fun, and of course we had two guests who love to gamble, but I am not sure if 25 slots and 4 tables is a casino (especially when the change the table rules to even more favor the house). All in all, we absolutely loved the pool (one of the best) and the ocean. You can't beat the beautiful white sand, and warm expansive beach line. Our only suggestion is if you're looking for a five star service and quality get that at different resort; Majestic Colonial is more like 4 star quality with 3 star service.
