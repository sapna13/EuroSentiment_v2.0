{"text":"The Best Time Ever I went to Gran Bahia Dec 13-20 2008. I had a great time the resort was a 5 Star for sure!!! It was beautiful the staff were all so nice and it was pretty easy to understand because a lot spoke english and the ones that didnt made it easy to comminicate.The swim up bar was great and the drinks were amazing.the resort was massive and i wish the maps were easier to understand but after a day or 2 you found out where you were.The buffet was ok wasnt amazing but the a la carte dinners where really good, Japanese was by far the best.The Marianarium excursion was so much fun its a once in a life time trip the staff on the excursion were all great and very helpful.my suggestion was keep american money its easier to understand and they seem to give you a better deal. At the vendors maybe 20 minutes up the beach you have to haggle big time, you know they get it for cheap so dont spend a lot of money when you know they try overcharge you. Bring shampoos and other bathrtoom needs to the vendors they need it and they will give you a really good deal and even free rum!!! Canadian pins and hats are widely expected!!!!!!!!! they love it! And if you tip you staff you will be treated so much better.This resort is good for both family or adult trips, i would recommend it to anyone!!!
