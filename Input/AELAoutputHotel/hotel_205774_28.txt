{"text":"Not quite what we expected, but decent. The rooms at Hotel Kursaal Ausonia were not quite what we expected, but they weren't horrible. The quad room is really one bedroom with a smaller separate sitting room. The second bed is actually a couch with a twin mattress pushed up next to it in the sitting room. I don't think it would be comfortable for 4 adults, unless you are on a really really tight budget and a couple of you don't mind being squashed together. Our relatives had a superior double room which they liked. The decor in the rooms I saw was really outdated, so don't necessarily expect a lot. The hotel is on a busy street with tiny sidewalks. It was somewhat of a challenge to maneuver around the street with luggage, but doable. To get to the hotel, just follow the directions on their website. We took the train to the Santa Maria Novella station and went out the entrance where platform 16 is located. You'll want to walk straight out from this exit. Keep going straight until you can't go straight any longer (You should come to a stoplight with buildings on the other side of the street). Cross the street at the stoplight and go right. You should walk past a McDonald's. Keep going up until you reach the first stoplight. This should be Via Nazionale. Take a left. The hotel is down a good ways, on the right-hand side. You should see the sign for the hotel. Overall, we enjoyed staying for a couple of nights at Hotel Kursaal Ausonia. The hotel is really convenient (within walking distance) to all of the attractions and the train station, and we were able to get a free upgrade by booking directly with the hotel. Make sure you check the specials on their website.
