{"text":"Americans from NJ Well, we returned Friday night from our enjoyable trip at the Palace. It was very nice and the weather was wonderful. The grounds are very nice and yes, the resort is quite large. If you take the tram around you will get your bearings and you will be fine. We were a party of eight and we did walk and it was okay. You have the option of the tram or the casino car (golf cart like cars). The theme restaurants are located throughout the resorts. The Palace has the Italian (across the street from lobby). Punta Cana has Dominican (by the beach). The Bavaro has Mexican, Japanese\/Chinese\/Thai and Spanish (next to the lobby). Across the street is the Sports Bar. The Bavaro also has the Seafood\/Steakhouse located by the ocean. I thought that the Mexican and Japanese were the best. They all have very little choices on the menu and offer very unique options. The seasonings are very different from what we are used too. The buffets have many choices. We made it through the week fine (just remember if you want a change go to the Sports Bar for pizza and ice-cream). It is not the same pizza they have at the lunch and dinner buffets. Just remember they are cooking for thousands of people at each meal!The bars are located all over the resorts. Hemmingway√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ (Bavaro section) by far has the best alcohol in terms of quality and choices. I felt that the bartenders were very generous with the amount of alcohol that went into the drinks. The bars at the beach are very limited. Some of the bars had bands or entertainment at night.The rooms were very clean. We did have problems with the lock on our door and our safe alarm. The safe alarm was resolved pretty quickly because of a very nice maid and my son communicating in Spanish. When we called the front desk we were told to wait a number of times. My sister's room had a problem with the air conditioner and it took three days to resolve the problem. They eventually moved her to another room. I questioned if they really couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ understand the language or they choose not to. Our group of eight consisted of two American families; each family having two teenagers. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think the resort caters to teenagers at all with the exception of the sports complex. They didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have teen hours at the disco. The only way they could go is at 11:30 with an adult. The resort had very few children or teens at all. And when we did see them they did not speak English. Most of the guests were Spanish or German. Language was definitely a challenge. Our group made the best of it and did our best to speak Spanish. Most of the staff was very appreciative of our efforts (others were not). We also always tipped to show our gratitude. I was appalled at the way some of the guests treated the workers. People were demanding, screaming out orders and just plain rude!To sum it up we stayed at a nice resort with good food that got repetitive at times. We learned a lot about the Dominican culture and people. We really brushed up on our Spanish and met some very interesting and hard working Dominicans (some nice some not so nice). We enjoyed the beautiful pool (until the pool swim-up bar burned down) and the absolutely SPECTACULAR views of the ocean. Not bad for a week away! All in all I do think it was a good value for your dollar. Would we go back? Maybe in 5 years or so (they are really building up the area). If we return, it will be a resort that enjoys Americans more!
