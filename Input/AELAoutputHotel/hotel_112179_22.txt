{"text":"Enjoyed our second stay here We stayed March 15-18 and this was our second vist here. I like the hotel and love Ritz Carltons - we try to stay at them wherever they are, unless there is a property that interests us more. I like the location, which is central, and love the proximity to shopping and restaurants. My husband attended a cardiac conference and the hotel handled that meeting well he thought -- it was not a large meeting. I do wish the pool was larger, and that there was more than one person on duty to help with towels and get drinks. Also there aren't enough chairs -- that becomes a problem when you've got a full house and folks looking to spend some time outside - we had gorgeous weather and while my husband golfed I took the opportunity to relax in the sun after a full morning of emptying his wallet.The fitness room is small and I found the treadmills full each morning, but was so glad to be able to run outside as there are plenty of safe routes. I especially loved that jasmine was blooming everywhere and that heavenly scent was worth running outside in that gorgeous dry morning air. Love the lobby bar and the live jazz duo was wonderful! I'd have stayed there all night if we didn't have dinner reservations!We will likely attend this conference\/meeting again in the future, and I'll look forward to returning to this property. Staff was very friendly and the rooms were lovely and very clean. ","annotations":[]}
