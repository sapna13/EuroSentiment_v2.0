{"text":"Fabulous Stay at the Swiss This hotel is as incredibly good as the majority of reviewers have already stated and is why I decided to stay at the swisshotel.It has funky youthfull decor, a super comfy bed,great view of the Ku'dam, great food and great service and is the fantastic treat that I was after. 5 star luxury and the price is so much more reasonable than that. I stayed for the first 2 nights of a 7 night stay and it was by far the best 2 nights. I couldn't afford to stay there for the entire week but if I could I wouldn't have moved from this brilliant hotel. Even the excellent Marriott which I got at a bargain price from priceline did not come close to this gem!Previous comments about quality of service are spot on and unfortunately something did go wrong in that the door came off its hinges as room service served me my food! But they put me in the executive lounge whilst they fixed it which they did in10 mins and were so apologetic and let me stay in the lounge as long as I liked. Admittedly the fact the door managed to come off its hinges is concerning and very out of character with the feel of the place but the way they dealt with it was exemplary. Who knows what they may have offered if I had made a fuss but they were too nice and I was happy to accept it as a freak accident.I highly recommend this fabulous hotel and can't wait to go back to brilliant Berlin and stay at the super Swisshotel for as long as I can afford!
