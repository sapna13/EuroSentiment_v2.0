{"text":"Better than expected. So basically the Hotel is situated right across from the main strip of Kuta beach, this is one of few Hotels that have this sort of location. At the time I thought this would be a big bonus however, I found Kuta beach to be awful, not cause it was busy (I love Waikiki beach), but because its full of people asking you to buy stuff and its really not a great beach anyway. Seminyak much better. However the view at the pool is spectacular, can't be beat.I saw alot of reviews on here expressing disappointment in the breakfast. Not sure what people are expecting, but basically its got everything you would want and its all good quality. Fruit, breads and sweet breads, cereal, bacon, eggs, omelets, sausages, beans and a wide selection of Asian dishes. I thought it was pretty good. Not the best I've had but you certainly wouldn't complain about it.Rooms are average. Look a little cheap and basic but its modern, clean and functional. I didn't see a problem with air quality in the room and the air conditioner worked well. T.V had 55 channels but was a little outdated. My main problem with the Hotel would be the service. I asked several times for the safe in my room to be fixed. When I left after 15 days it was still not operational. Some of the front desk staff were very unhelpful. I was told there was no internet available in room despite the stand on my desk advertising the fact WIFI is in room. When I finally got someone to acknowledge that WIFI is available in room it cost about 13 dollars Australian a day to use or 8 dollars for an hour. A rip off in my opinion.The pool service was good but sometimes inconsistent. There were times when I couldn't get a beer for half an hour as nobody seemed to be around. Overall its a good hotel but not without its problems. If you want a nice quiet hotel in a good location I would defiantly consider this hotel. Feels very safe and secure but service does lack a bit.
