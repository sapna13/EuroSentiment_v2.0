{"text":"The Hard Sell Hotel Stayed for 5 nights in July 2008. Good points:1) spacious room which was well maintained and cleaned well each day. Great views from 25th floor (although 44th floor afforded much better obviously!) Very quiet (apart from occasional late night corridor noise (no double doors and door to room very ill fitting with big gap at the bottom of the door));2) location is great as is very central and enabled walking to many placesBad points:1) breakfast charges were extortionate ($30 per head per adult!). Meant having the inconvenience of having to go out and get breakfast each day as simply not prepared to encourage such rip offs anywhere esp when paying for 4. To add insult to injury, one day as we were on our way out, the sales desk man by the elevators stated that he was excited and proud about the breakfast on offer in an attempt to persuade us to stay (clearly few do!). It is very simple Hilton Hotels: sell the breakfasts at a reasonable rate and people will buy them. Hardly rocket science;2) Rooms advertised with internet access - it does not exist. You have to go to the conference centre and pay extra. Not so great on a business trip.3) Too many sales pitches in the lobby - each day we were bombarded with something as we went to and fro including the chance to return to the hotel within 12 months for $149 per night. Having paid $429 per night this was somewhat irritating... but the offer turned out to be a timeshare sales pitch and we would have to have committed to go to a sales event to secure the rate offered. Hey ho! Luckily we are not that gullible...AND...next time we are in NYC, we'll be staying elsewhere away from the desperation of the Hilton group. ","annotations":[]}
