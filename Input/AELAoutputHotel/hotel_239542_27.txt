{"text":"A pleasant stay at the Cram We booked this hotel having been to Barcelona before so knew that the location was good and a great place from which to explore all areas of the city. I read numerous reviews on this website and others so was of course a little concerned at comments about small rooms the a glass bathroom door! However we were pleasantly surpirsed on arrival. The room was adequately sized and well laid out which gave the impression of more space. It's very modern and has that 'new' feeling although some parts of the bathroom has already started to look a little worn (chipped glass around the bottom of the sliding shower door) although the great overhead shower more than compensates for this! The glass bathroom door was not an issue as it was at the far end of the room, most of it is frosted and you just have to respect your partners privacy! The hotel does lie on the junction of 2 major streets so comments regarding the street noise while the bedroom window\/door is open are correct, however this is not an issue if the window is closed and the air conditioning works very well.The interior of the hotel is nicely designed, very modern, dark and sultry and the exterior is very elegant. The bar area lacked atmosphere but maybe due to being slightly out of season. The bar seems mainly used for people visiting the michelin starred Restarant Gaig which is inside the hotel. We called on the staff a couple of times to sort issues in our room (problem with sink) and they came quickly and sorted this out. They were friendly and always said hello when passing reception. The pool and roof terrace were closed during our stary probably because they were doing work to it before high season.All in all, I would certainly use this hotel again and would recommend it. Placa Catalunya is just 10 minutes walk away to the south and the elegant areas of Gracia are on your doorstep. ","annotations":[]}
