{"text":"Dirty, Smelly, Rundown If your corporate travel person checks out hotels for you and the holiday Inn costs less than the Holiday Inn Express, there is probably a really good reason for it.This property is old and has not been maintained. My colleague checked out after finding old coffee grinds in her room's coffee maker and got her white socks filthy walking across the carpet. We had a drink in the bar and nothing will ever persuade me that the liquor is not watered down. The carpeting was old and stained as was the bedspread. The mattress reached the end of its useful life sometime in the Cliton administration and the biggest insult was the card by the bed boasting of the pillow selection. They should have been categorized not by firmness buy by degree of discomfort ranging from awful to unbelieveble.To give the hotel credit, I was not bothered by airplane noise but this was only because the window was bolted closed so that the only air available was form the very stale air conditioner. Did I mention the place was smelly? The corridor stunk of old cigarette smoke that had festered in the carpet for years and they are still challenged to remove room service trays in less than 48 hours.We used a meeting room and were charged way more than our original quote then, when one of us went and bought a bagel to bring back to our meeting, the waitress in the restaurant got extremely belligerent when she took a knife from the table.Do not stay here. Instruct your corporate travel organizer to avoid it at all costs.
