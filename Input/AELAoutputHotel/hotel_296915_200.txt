{"text":"Loved it! We stayed at the Pulitzer in mid-December for one night on a EUR120 rate booked through the hotel's website.The hotel is nicely decorated, with well-designed rooms. Our room, on the street side of the hotel, was very quiet.. Be aware though, if you book a rate that is for a twin OR double room, your double will be two single beds pushed together, rather than a proper queen\/king.The staff are very friendly - even the maids - and generally spoke English well. Front desk staff provided good restaurant recommendations with accompanying advice (e.g. don't eat paella at night - you won't sleep well).The location can't be beaten, right off Las Ramblas, but still in a relatively calm street.Only one thing really caused me concern. When we checked out, we asked a staff member to call us a taxi to the airport. He did this very efficiently, which was great. When the taxi turned up, the driver took our bags, put them in the trunk, and then went to talk to the staff member who had called him. This seemed a bit strange, since the driver already knew we were going to the airport. It looked to us as though the driver gave the staff member money, although it was done discretely.When we got to the airport, about EUR8 of extra charges were added to the meter (the charge normally used for tolls, etc). Not speaking Spanish well, I didn't want to argue, but something weird was going on. In total, the rate was about EUR10 more than going that other direction. I can't help but wonder if the driver pays that staff member to call him, and then passes the cost onto the guests.
