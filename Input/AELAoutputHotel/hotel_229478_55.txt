{"text":"Great location, but bad view This is my first trip to Amsterdam and I am glad that I decided to spent the extra money to stay in the central area. It would of been about half price if I stayed near the airport. The location is great, it was only a 5 minute walk from central station. It is right on a main road so it was really easy to find. I said bad view because i had a room on the inside ring instead of having a room that faced the street. The room is quite basic, for the price and star rating I would of expected a much nicer room. The room was clean, I had a real comfortable queen size bed, and the size of it was sufficient. Even with all the light on and curtain open the room would remain quite dark, it felt like I was in the basement even though I stayed on the 2nd floor. This was after all a vacation so time was only spent sleeping while I was in the room. The location was excelent! It was only a 5 min walk to the Tram(trolly system) and 5 min to the Red Light district where a lot of good resturant, coffee shops, and bars are at on top of all the red light activities. While this is definitely a great location at first I definitly found several other locations through out the city that was eqally as good. The area around the Crown Plaza has a different crowd of people here. The crowd mostly consist of crowds that frequent the coffee shops, and being so close to the red light district it defitnitly attracted more of a male crowd. It wasn't until I left the area to Leisaplein, I think that's how you spell it, but it was a area in Amsterdam that had more shops than coffee shops, thus more Females. Those European girls are just gorgeous. Me and my friends hung out in this area for a good day. It wasn't too far to all the museums either, so for all those that are visiting Amerdam this is not a bad area to stay in. Back to Crown Plaza, I guess for the location the price is okay. It would be like staying in mid-town in Manhatten which rooms are pretty basic unless you fork out double the amount. It just didn't feel like a 4-5 star hotel, was my biggest complaint. It's definitly a City to come back to but now that I know the city a whole lot better I don't think I will stay here again. I think there are definitly better deals around the city and with the great transit system that they have it doesn't matter where you stay really.
