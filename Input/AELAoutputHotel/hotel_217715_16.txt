{"text":"Amazing Value--they get it! An amazing value, convenient to all Dallas has to offer. Two caveats--I got this room for $41 on Priceline, and was housed in an eight floor room; some have complained about the rooms in the lower building, and I did not see these accommodations. The hotel is very convenient to the highway without being noisy, and parking is plentiful and free. Lobby makes a great first impression--clearly newly renovated, it nearly sparkles. Front desk agent was perky and quite helpful--when I asked her for a king bedded room high up, she found one for me and added This is the kind of room pilots get--I assumed they get a lot of airline crews here, and there is a pecking order among these employees, pilots at the top of the list. Elevators were quick, and room, while not huge, was pleasantly sized and clearly fresh from a renovation. Beds are great, with Sleep Number mattresses and crisp, clean snowy white linens and fluffy duvets--all hotel rooms at every star level should take a cue from these. Bathroom was small but worked well--new granite topped vanity is inside the hotel room, while the toilet and bath\/shower are inside the bathroom; curved shower rod--again all hotels take note--expands feeling of space in shower. Pressure adequate but not great. Wake up calls were on the dot punctual, albeit automated.Nice room for the money, but better still was the absence of nickel and diming that so many other hotels subject guests to--parking was free and guests have a choice of covered or openair. Wireless internet was free and available throughout the hotel--good, quick wifi too--and if you didn't bring your laptop, there is a small business center that is free with two computers and a printer (note to hotel--keep this in good repair; mouse was flaky)--great for printing airline boarding passes. Fitness center is free, and while the room was recently renovated, the equipment--three bikes, a treadmill, a stair machine, and some weights--could use an update. Was told that will happen in a few months (note to hotel--make it happen sooner than later, as for this workout fan, it was the single biggest disappointment) Bottled water was free in room and free in the fitness center. Just these things alone in some hotels would have cost $41, even if the room were free. . .Hotel location perfect--with Las Colinas and the Cedar Springs crossroads both just 10 minutes drive--Highland Park Village is about the same distance, and downtown isn't much further. Love Field for SWA fliers is right around the corner, and the hotel provides a free shuttle; DFW is about 20 minutes away.At $41, this hotel was an exceptional value, and kudos to the hotel's management for a nice experience in this category. If this hotel is an apt reflection of Radisson today, I'd gladly try more of this chain's properties. And certainly, I'd stay here again in Dallas. . .
