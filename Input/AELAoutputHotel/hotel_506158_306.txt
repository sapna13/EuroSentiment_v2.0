{"text":"Great Hotel in best location A 5 minute walk from the airport bus stop leads you to this new hotel at the top end of The Ramblas - right opposite Le Meridien. On entering by the revolving door you notice the beautifully stylish sofas and chairs in herringbone and stiped fabrics. The decor may be classed as 'historic' on the nn website but its not at all old fashioned or chintzy. The reception staff are friendly and helpful and carried out little tasks such as charging a run down mobile phone.The main lobbly is also brilliantly stylish with loads of seating, artwork, model ships in cases etc. Rooms are something else and everything is high quality. The floors are solid mahoghany and green marble in the bathroom, matt laquered wardrobes and doors, double twin bed with a selection of four different types of pillows, bathrobes and slippers and a wide selection of quality toiletries, even totthbrushes, paste, shavers, and shaving cream.Coffees and teas were provided but if you want hot water and milk you have to ring room service. You do get a silver flask full of hot water with silver jug of milk within about 5 minutes.We did not take breakfast in the hotel as $18 is quite expensive if you eat small breakfasts but all around are great cafes where you can get a perfectly adequate one for under $5. Farrgi is a good bet for this. Alternatively try one of the half slices of paw paw, dragon fruit or mango wrapped with spoon from thye market just down the street.The bar, like many hotel bars was quiet and two whiskies came to $14 - not excessive bearing in mind the quantity you get in Spanish establishments.This hotel seems to be the same price with every booking agency so not worth shopping around.
