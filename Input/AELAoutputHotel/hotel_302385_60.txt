{"text":"Excellent Service We spent 10 nights at this hotel to celebrate our Silver Wedding. We had booked a Palace Club room but on arrival were upgraded to a suite. The room was excellent, with a double sized balcony overlooking the gardens, sitting area, very comfortable bed, 2 TVs, bathroom and additional separate toilet. It is definitely worth paying the extra for a Palace Club room. The breakfast is very good, buffet style but with eggs, pancakes etc cooked to order. Afternoon tea consists of sandwiches, cream scones,cakes and pastries. Evening cocktails are also included along with a selection of nibbles. Free internet access plus non alcoholic drinks anytime. The staff in the Palace Club lounge are wonderful - very friendly and helpful. They were able to advise on local restaurants, outside the hotel and made reservations for us.The Spa is lovely, treatments very relaxing. We found the pool area here much quieter than the main pool and sunbeds were always available. Glass bottom boats and snorkelling are available from the beach, which was white sand and very clean.The food in the hotel is good, and not unreasonably priced compared to Uk. The Ramayana dance and buffet evening is good value and in a spectacular setting. Certainly better than the Barong show included in some excursions. Themed buffet dinners are available most nights or the pizza restaurant is good for a cheaper, more casual dinner. There are other restaurants in the nearby village and also in Jimbaran which provide transport to and from the hotel. The Pavillion is fairly new and food and service were excellent and cheap, especially local dishes. The Bali Collection is also within walking distance of the hotel ,although free transport is provided there too. There is a supermarket, local craft market and a variety of restaurants as well as the usual designer type outlets.We booked an island tour with the hotel Tours desk which was in a private car just for the two of us with a driver and guide. It was an excellent tour, very informative and good value. You can get cheaper prices outside the hotel but these often do not include the entrance fees or a guide and the driver will try to take you to places where they get commission. We did find that some tourist attractions had lots of traders and some were quite persistent. Watch out for the porters at the airport. They are quite pushy and take you straight to the money changer to get cash for their tip!Altogether a very relaxing holiday, excellent accommodation, good food and superb service. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would go back tomorrow!
