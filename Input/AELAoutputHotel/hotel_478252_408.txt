{"text":"Fantastic resort and wonderful people My wife, baby son and I have just returned from a week at the Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana - booked with First Choice. Overall the trip was truly excellent.The room was large and well located (about 2 mins walk from main buffet restaurant and 2 mins from one of the pools). THe resort is huge but don't let that deter you, the staff are extremely friendly - especially with the children.The beach can get crowded but not overly so and the west side of the beach has calmer water than the east.The food was excellent - especially the bufett. THe hotel went all out on Xmas eve to include ice sciptures and a real live nativity scene complete with donkey+goats.With a young baby I would stay away form the a la carte restaurants excpet for the Brazillian Beach BBQ restaurant which is more suited to children (open air and noisier)..There was never a time when we couldn't get food or drinks and the staff were really lovely and very friendly.The pueblo shopping square owned by the hotel was pretty good and stall number 11 did us some great deals (run by a chap from Haiti).Overall I would not hesitate in returning to this resort. It provided excellent value for money and did not disappoint us at all.Book the catamarans early - they're popular and make sure you don't miss the Brazillian Beach BBQ restaurant - this was the highlight of our stay.Also bear in mind that in the Carribean life is slower than in London and you'll enjoy it.Thouroughly recommended.... do tip the staff, there is a big gap between locals and tourists and they appreciate it given the hours some of them work (7am - 11pm).
