{"text":"Absolutely brilliant-miss it already My friend and i decided we needed to get away for a week, and got a fantastic deal on this hotel. Unfortunately after reading some very disappointing reviews were not looking forward to the holiday as much as we should have. But honestly i dont know what these people were talking about. The flight was good, and check in to the hotel was very very quick and easy. The first night we weren't out too late due to body clock adjustment, but food within the Colonial restaurant seemed to be good. We were up very early the next morning and reserved a table in the caribbean restaurant situated on the beach for that night, were the food yet again was good. Then for the entertainment, which we thought was amazing. Being two young single girls we did get a lot of attention from all the staff, especially the animacion team, which we personally had no problems with as we were there for fun and a laugh!!! We ate in all of the restaurants, and had no problems with anything. The drinks flowed constantly, and we even made it to the nightclub Pacha, with the animacion team. Imagine the club in Dirty Dancing!!!!While there we went on the Caribbean festival tour which included swimming with sharks and stingray, a trip i would advise to anyone, it was superb.The only downside was that we had 3 days of solid rain, which we should have expected going at hurricane season, but again can't fault the animacion team as they found things for all the guests to take part in.Overall we had a great time and can't wait to go back next year.
