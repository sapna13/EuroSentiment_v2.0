{"text":"Great place to stay The Caribe Hilton is classy and EXTREMELY clean. I didn't even see a single bug in my room the whole stay. We loved the reception we received upon arrival. And in our room, there was a slight problem with the toilet that they took care of immediately once I called about it. The beds were very comfortable  the room had a nice amount of dressers, desk space  closet space. The restaurants are so expensive! The breakfast buffet was $24 per person, with no lower price for kids - and dinner buffet was $30 per person. Ridiculous! We quickly learned to favor the Starbucks for our breakfasts  snacks, and the staff there was the friendliest. Some of the hotel staff were a little snobby, like a few of the valet parking people - esp. over the phone. I hadn't planned to use the valet parking (an extra $5 per day on top of the $15 per day to park) - but otherwise I would have had to schlep across the street to a parking garage with construction all around. I felt maybe a bit of resentment of the guests from some of the staff, and I thought I was a pretty great tipper....It was a little boring at night - we were only there Monday-Friday, and apparently there is no entertainment until the weekend. Basically, you are faced with added costs every way you turn - but otherwise, it's a great, comfortable, beautiful hotel, with several different eating options, nice pools, nice beach area,  some other nice amenities.
