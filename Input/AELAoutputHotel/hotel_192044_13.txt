{"text":"London Break Hotel Just got back from a 2 day pleasure\/buisness stay at this hotel. Firstly the hotel is very close to London Bridge Bus\/Train\/Underground Station , so transport is not an issue. The hotel was easy to find and is a pleasant building. A travel agent had booked the room for me and the price √ä√£¬¢189 per night did not include breakfast. My travelling colleagues had booked directly with the hotel and paid √ä√£¬¢70 less and breakfast was included. I though this was going to be an issue but the helpful manager agreed to include breakfast on both mornings. Breakfast was buffet and was reasonably good not the best I've had but not the worst either. We had chosen this hotel from these reviews and one that said it was close to the O2 Arena it is two stops away on the underground and was very easy to get to. The Thames Path is nearby and you can walk towards HMS Belfast , Tower Bridge , Tower of London quite easily from this hotel. We ate at O2 and in a different part of London , but we did have a drink that at the Borough Bar , which is part of the hotel but the bar nearest the Underground 'All Bar One' and this was a good bar. We also had a drink at Bunch of Grapes , which is behind the hotel and near Guys Hospital. The rooms in the hotel were fine by London Standards and a good size TV and space. The bathrooms were also fine, Tip take the plug out of the sink to make the water run away quicker. Didn't really meet the staff other than a brief check in and at breakfast. The manager was very helpful with the breakfast issue and checkout. This hotel is clean and modern and probably second to the City Inn at Westminster, where I have stayed at before. This is London and like all hotels a base for any visit. I would recommend this hotel especially for O2 and access to transport. ","annotations":[]}
