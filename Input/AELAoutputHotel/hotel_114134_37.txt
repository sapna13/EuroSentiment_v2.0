{"text":"Our Return After Over a Decade My wife and I decided to book a micro-vacation in Boston, her college city and a town we visit a few times a year. Being a Starwood Preferred Guest member, I always turn to the Westin first (There'll be a W in town soon!), but their rates were a bit more than I wanted to pay, even to earn some more SPG points, so I decided to look around a bit. About an hour later, I had it narrowed down to The Lenox and The Eliot, and, having stayed at the Lenox a few times in the past (at least twelve or thirteen years ago), passed on the Eliot, maybe for next time. We are both thrilled with my decision - For less than I would have paid at the Copley Plaza for a tiny, interior, queen-bedded room, we got a HUGE corner high-floor king! We had a double window overlooking Boylston St, and another on Exeter, with glimpses of the top of Trinity Church possible. The room had a walk-in closet, a pretty large bath (I'd say 6' by 11' or so?), a sleeper sofa positioned conveniently to the flat-screen TV, and a decorative fireplace. Both during the day and at turndown, our complimentary bottles of water were replenished in the otherwise-empty mini-fridge (Yay! No mini-bar to try to soak us dry!). I've read all the previous views extolling the service, but sort of figured, Well, c'mon, how good could it be, right?. Guess what folks? All those reviewers raving about the service were dead on! As we are nornally, we were very low-maintenance guests, so I can't point to any above  beyond experiences, but the overall attitidue of the staff was warm and genuinely appreciative. It's annoying to be spending all kinds of money at a hotel and getting about the same kind of serivce you'd expect at McDonald's - You will NOT find that attitude at The Lenox! The doorman got us a bellman and took care of handing off our car to the valet in about five seconds when we pulled up, while welcoming us and explaining the cost (Yes, he told us upfront - How novel!); Every time we'd walk toward the elevator, a bellman or other employee nearby would rush to push the call button; Each time we'd walk by either the concierge desk or reception, any employee not occupied with another guest would make eye contact and greet us with a smile and a good (morning, evening, etc). We just felt totally appreciated and welcomed all weekend. We didn't dine at either Azure or the pub, but had a couple rounds Sunday night at City Bar, which seems to be quite the scene. The waitress was quick and friendly, the sountrack was really cool,. and the crowd was diverse (Ages from low 20's to 50-ish), so it was a neat place to chill.  We would absolutely consider The Lenox the next time we're in Boston, as long as the price is in line with (or even a bit more than) other comparable properties in this very expensive hotel town.
