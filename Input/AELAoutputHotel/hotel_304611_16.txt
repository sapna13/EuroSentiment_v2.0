{"text":"Enjoyable stay Booked 2 nights via their website for Premier (room only) and we were upgraded to the Royal Club floor - presumably bigger room, with buffet breakfast for 2 thrown in. Receptionist was very efficient, friendly and informative. Prompted us for our flight details for departure and recommended that we book a taxi for our early morning pick-up. Checkout was a breeze.Room decor is contemporary but I think the hallway to the rooms is getting a little tired. Have to bear in mind that this is a refurbished building. Bed was comfortable and blockout curtains a Godsend. Walls are a bit thin - I could hear people walking\/talking in the hallway outside. Flatscreen tv, free wi-fi.Complimentary drinks in the mini bar is a nice touch but don't get too excited as it isn't stocked to the brim - 2 beers, 2 cans of softdrink, juice and water, restocked everyday. In-house restaurant, Carousel, is reknown for their sumptious high tea buffets on the weekends so do try. We did not get a chance to but it comes highly recommended from our local but the breakfast buffet had a nice spread.Great location. On the corner of Scotts and Orchard so you have the shopping and MRT station at your doorstep. Isetan shopping centre is next door with a grocery store if you need anything else. Heaps of fastfood restaurants nearby - some even 24 hours.Concierge was helpful in booking an early morning taxi for our departure.Rate a little expensive but it is hard to find a cheaper hotel without compromising location and rating.Would stay again if the rates don't creep up.
