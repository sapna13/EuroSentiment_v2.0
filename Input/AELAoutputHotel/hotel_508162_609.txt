{"text":"Clappe, Clappe This was our 1st visit to Dom Rep. Stayed at Dreams from 12\/15 to 12\/22. It was wonderful. Service: The service was great.Everyone at the resort was freindly and greeted you always with a Hola and a smile. They truly wanted to make sure your stay was truly the best. The rooms were clean , in the evenings when we returned the beds were turned down and soft music was playing. Pool: was enormous and it was easy to find a peaceful area because of the size and design.Plenty of floats to go around for those who just wanted to relax and enjoy the sun. Food: We found to be very good. Lots of variety and many restuarants to choose from. No we did not get sick.Entertainment: I want to say a special thank you to Juan , he made our vacation the most enjoyable. He greeted us every moring with a hug and a smile and would seek us out for his activities for the day. He made a great impression and we still say clappe, clappe. The show were always fun and the dancing was incredible. We only miss one because we were watching Monday Night Football on the beach. But we enjoyed all of them . Others from the entertainment team which also made our stay fun was Julio, 50 Cent,  Usher we did not get to know them until the last few days of our stay.My favorite bartender was Pedro at the Manatees Bar , he made my Bithday awesome. We went out on two day trips , the Outback Safari was one. Danny Boy was our tour guide. He was awesome too. All in all, a beautiful resort, beautiful people, beautiful country, we had a fantastic time and would recommend to anyone. We both left saying that we would come back without a doubt.Thank you to the staff at Dreans for making our vacation most memorable.Dan  LindaWest Chicago, IL ","annotations":[{"endOffset":498,"mention":"floats","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ice_cream_soda"],"startOffset":492},{"endOffset":498,"mention":"floats","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ice_cream_soda"],"startOffset":492},{"endOffset":498,"mention":"floats","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ice_cream_soda"],"startOffset":492},{"endOffset":498,"mention":"floats","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ice_cream_soda"],"startOffset":492}]}
