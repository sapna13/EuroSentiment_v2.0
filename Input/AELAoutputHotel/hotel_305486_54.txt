{"text":"Poor service, quality for the price I stayed at the Golden Landmark on my latest visa run to Singapore. There was a convention or something in Singapore on that date, so my usual hotels were booked up. I booked through the hotel directly, and paid USD 200 for an Executive Room.I arrived tired after a delayed flight. Check-in was relatively quick. Then I asked the front desk if they could provide me with an envelope and keep my visa renewal package (passport, pictures, form, etc) for the agent to pick up early in the morning. The clerk sighed heavily and asked if I could just do it tomorrow. I was very taken aback; there were no other customers waiting to check in and several clerks just standing around. I've done this five times at other hotels, even later at night, and not one front desk clerk has ever made me feel to be a burden on their time. The room was OK. It was clearly an old, tired room that was spruced up with new fixtures. The renovation is ageing quickly; for example, the handle on the faucet was broken off. For comparison, the executive floor rooms are basically equal to or even worse than the regular Holiday Inn rooms. I did not see the regular Golden Landmark rooms.There is a breakfast offered in the Executive Lounge, located on the Executive floor (the breakfast is OK, but my room was right next to this dining area and the smell of frying woke me up at 6:30!) The Executive Lounge apparently also has soft drinks available all day, and cocktails in the evening, but I arrived too late to check this out. There is also an express checkout desk in the lounge, but when I went to check out there, no one was manning it. When I finally did check out downstairs,they tried the old scam of charging my bill in USD. If you don't know about this, google dynamic currency conversion. I asked them to rerun the charge in Singapore Dollars, and they did comply. I would not recommend the Golden Landmark Hotel. I found it unsatisfactory for an overnight stay, and can't imagine dealing with them for a longer stay.
