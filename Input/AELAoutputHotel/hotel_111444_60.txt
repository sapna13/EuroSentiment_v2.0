{"text":"Great hotel, superb location We arrived after a good flight from London at about 2.30 in the afternoon, unfortunately our room was not ready, and would not be ready till about 4, 1 hour after it should have been. Not a great start but we were in an upbeat mood, so we went for a wander to get our bearings and pick up some brochures on the freedom trail etc. Arrived back at 4pm to be told it was 10 mins away from being ready. Staff were very apologetic and gave us frree drinks vouchers for the Oak Room and that they would come and get us once room was free. This they did and we were in our room at 4.15 ish.Room was better than we expected ( a fairmont room) a good size, clean and had that aged look without being old ( if you know what i mean!) The lobbey was very elegant, the dog (katie copley i think) pulled on the heart strings of my wife, and the service throughout our stay of 4 nights was top class. For a large hotel it still manages to be personel which is a credit to them. Location is superb. We walked everywhere and the start of the Freedom Trail is a lovely 10 min walk away at Boston Common. We had a meal in the Oak Room one evening and apart from being a lovely setting in the style of British Army Officers Hall, the meal and service was outstanding. Pasquelle our waiter was obvoiusly an experienced chap and it showed. Not a cheap meal , with wine and tip $300 but well worth it in our opinion. Would certainly stay at this hotel again. Loved Boston.
