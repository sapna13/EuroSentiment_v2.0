{"text":"Luck of the Draw This is an absolutely beautiful property, with stunning views and an impressive array of amenities. We had a wonderful time. I would attribute this to the fact that we weren't paying for anything (this was a corporate award trip) and that our group had an on-site meeting planner who dealt with any potential pitfalls and kept us blissfully ingnorant. While our room was not yet renovated, it did have a spectacular view of the Caribean and was comfortably close to everything we needed, including the spa. It was clean enough, though not pristine, not 5 star but perfectly acceptable. The hotel was supposed to be at 100% capacity, which concerned me upon check in - but the resort is so huge, you really don't feel like you're in a crowd at any time. The only thing we waited for was the funicular to get to the ferry. This wasn't ever any more than 5 minutes - no problem. The spa is wonderful, not the BEST, but good and clean with wonderful attendants. Food is good, again, not 5 star but resort quality with one notable exception. . . Strip House is at least as good as most fine steak houses in NY or Chicago and the prices are similar (very high) but worth a trip upstairs. The decor is stunning. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. NOW, the warnings: a couple in our group did experience bed bugs and the type of nonchalant service described by other reviewers. They were shuffled from one disgusting, dirty room to another for two days and missed a couple of night's sleep. Another member of our party had jewelery stolen from a locked in-room safe. Not cool at all. Still others confided that their rooms were dirty, buggy, moldy, had holes in the walls or ceilings or were loud at night. Personally, I really enjoyed the natural sound of the tiny frogs and exotic birds at night.Overall, I think it's really the luck of the draw at the el con. We got lucky and are very thankful. Others, had a very unfortunate experience. In addition, the prices for food and services here are positively criminal. We enjoyed a six pack of Coors Light on the beach at Palomino Island for $36 plus tip. Breakfast buffet for two with taxes and tip (no alcohol) was $63. Lunch (hot dog and quesadilla with two beers) was over $70. A private cabanna at the pool is $214 per day, 50 minute massage $150 plus taxes and tip. On my own dime, I'll choose another lovely resort in the caribbean. This place really seems to have captured the market on corporate award trips and is priced accordingly.
