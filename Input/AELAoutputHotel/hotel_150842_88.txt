{"text":"Not quite what it was We just came back from a 4 night stay at the Iberostar Dominicana. We have been there 2 other times, and used it as the standard for all our other trips to the D.R. (9 in total). The resort is one of the most beautiful in the D.R.: beautiful grounds, peacocks strolling the lawns, magnificent beach, great staff, great entertainment (especially on the Punta Cana side).Our only complaint is that the quality of the food has deteriorated from what it was 5 years ago. The resort used to have 3 (I believe) Cordon Bleu chefs, but their presence was nowhere to be found; they have probably been wooed away to other resorts.. The buffet now does not touch the quality of other 4 and 4+ star resorts in the D.R. The beach restaurants offer the same thing everyday: hamburgers, hot dogs, poorly seasoned rice and beans, overcooked fish. There is an outside grill at the beach offering various grilled foods each day, but you have to fight for it. The buffet is not much better. The Mexican Restaurant used to be fantastic, not now; when we were there most guests got up and left before desert. Mind you, the breakfasts are very good.It would be of great help to guests who have a late departure if the resort could accommodate the late departures with late check-outs; having to check out of your room at 12 noon for a 6 PM bus leaves you stranded except for 2 small changing rooms at the front of the lobby (which some staff use as their washroom). The star rating is not 4+ anymore, compared to what it was.
