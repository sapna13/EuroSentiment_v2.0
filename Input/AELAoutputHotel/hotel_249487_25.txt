{"text":"OMG~its fantastic!!!!!! Just returned from a girls weekend at the San Juan Water and Beach Club 8\/8\/08-8\/12\/08. We had the best experience ever!!! The hotel itself is very chic and modern. Think Miami SoBe art deco. The size makes it more intimate since it is not a big chain hotel. Everyone there knew you by name and used it regularly along with English. The service exceeded that of many 5 star hotels I have stayed in. Any questions I had they had an answer for. I had read a lot of reviews about how the nightlife there affected the rest of the hotel. I did not have this experience to the contrary. We did choose this hotel based on the fact that we would not have to leave to go party being it was a girls weekend, but things worked out otherwise. Unfortunately, the nightlife never seemed to be at the level we anticipated so we would venture a short walk down to El San Juan's Brava. This worked out well and really did not cause any inconvenience. So the notion that this hotel is not suitable for relaxation seekers or families is rubbish. We did notice that there were mostly couples there and from the people we talked to they also enjoyed their experience as well. Rooms- decent size, rm 401 with king size bed. Kind of awkward for us girls to share, but what do you expect when you book through Priceline? Check-in was simple, but there was no availability to check in early since hotel was booked. This kinda stinks when you get there at 11am and have to wait until 4pm to get unsettled. But it goes with the territory. Nice blue lighting in the room makes for some amazing pictures. Looks like the room is a giant tanning bed! Not good for makeup application, though! No dresser, just used the entire wall bench under the window. Bathroom and cleanliness adequate with nice toiletries.Pool- rooftop and very tiny! But being from FL where everyone has a pool, we were there for the beach! Which, by the way, is in no comparison to FL beaches!Food- let's face it, we weren't there to eat! We ate at the hotel very little, but was told the sushi bar was great several times. We did have breakfast at Tangerine which was quite good and reasonable. Was told dinner there was excellent but never got around to it. Service and coffee was great!!!Beach- just a few steps away and sooo gorgeous. Courteous staff even setup your umbrellas and chairs with pads for you!!! How fabulous is that? Great scenery, and I'm not talking about the beach!!!! Watch out for that sun, too!!!Location-perfect! Liked being at the end of the street which created less traffic. Short walk along beach will get you anywhere you want to go. Easy drive to El Yunque or Old San Juan.Staff- This is why I want to come back every year! They made our vacay!!! The personalized information and the attentiveness made our trip so memorable. A special thanks to William, Eddie, Verna, Pablo and Nataniel. They were outstanding! They don't come any nicer!!!! I can't wait to go back! Because of the Water Club, we are seriously considering a semi-annual trip back to PR just to have this kind of fun again!!!
