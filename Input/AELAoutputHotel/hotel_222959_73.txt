{"text":"Impressive by New York Hotel Standards The Ritz-Carlton Battery Park New York offers a contemporary hotel experience, with comforts not so frequently found in most other New York City hotels.Over the years, I have had the opportunity to experience several Manhattan hotels, yet I continue to return to the Ritz-Carlton Battery Park for several reasons. I find that most NYC hotels, even those in the four and five star categories, often lack space. For $300-400 per night, my preference is to at least have a room that is comfortable and spacious. The Ritz-Carlton Battery Park offers spacious accommodations (comparable to those found at other RC properties) but at respectable prices by NYC standards. Although some may argue that the location is somewhat distant I would much prefer comfort and service with a decent price. Other properties with comparable amenities and room sizes (ie . Four Seasons New York, Mandarin-Oriental, Ritz-Carlton Central Park) often charge in excess of $700 per night for comparable accommodations.Battery Park is located at the lowest point in Manhattan, just adjacent to Wall Street and the Statue of Liberty. Although distant from Mid-Town, it's convenient to SoHo, Meatpacking District, Financial District, Chinatown, Chelsea etc. If you're visiting NYC as a tourist, I don't find this property all that inconvenient, as the aforementioned neighborhoods are all at your disposal. Yes, Time Square and Central Park are a cab ride away, but who wants to spend most of their time there anyway?Rooms are consistent with most other Ritz-Carlton properties, particularly those of the more contemporary minded. Bathrooms are some of the most spacious in all of Manhattan, featuring separate glass enclosed showers and individual soaking tubs. The beds are also extremely comfortable, with feathertop beds and high end linens.If you're able to book a room on the club level, I would highly recommend this decision. For an additional $100-150 per night, the Club Level offers you and your guest√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ five daily food presentations from breakfast to evening dessert. Alcoholic beverages are also included (they offer top shelf liquor)For those traveling to NYC on the weekend, this hotel probably offers the best value in the city. Weekend rates begin at $295\/night.
