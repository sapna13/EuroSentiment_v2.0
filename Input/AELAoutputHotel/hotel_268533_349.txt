{"text":"Great Hotel, Great location We just spent 4 days in San Francisco and very much enjoyed our stay at the Argonaut Hotel. Rooms were quiet, beds were comfortable, and service was outstanding ! Be sure to catch at least 1 wine tasting which starts every evening at 5 PM to 6 PM. This is a nice little extra that the Argonaut Hotel has to offer.LOCATION :This location is just 2 to 3 blocks away from Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 shops  eats, and Tour pickups  information. It is about 7 to 8 blocks away from Chinatown  North Beach. It is an easy stroll or you can catch the # 30 bus that runs frequently ($1.50 fare). There is also cable car service that starts just by the corner of the hotel and runs towards the downtown area ($5 fare). While this hotel is very nice, I would stay closer to North Beach area next time as you could be in between North Beach, Chinatown  Fisherman's Wharf. Regarding bus service, you should buy a passport ticket which gives unlimited rides for 3 days ($18) or 7 days ($24). This muni passport is also good for cable cars. A good deal if you plan on running around quite a bit.ACTIVITIES :We had booked the night tour to Alcatraz which only runs Thursday through Monday. This is a great tour and the evening run adds to the mood of the experience. There were long line-ups to buy tickets so I would suggest to buy tickets online ahead of time like we did. There is a gift store on the island that is fairly cheap. Picture taking is allowed.We also booked the cable car 2 1\/2 hour tour which made about 3 to 4 stops for pictures and souvenirs. The most important thing to remember is to DRESS WARM. 1 of the stops is right at Fort Point which is at the Golden Gate Bridge and this stop was extremely windy and fairly cold. We ended up buying sweatshirts at this stop which were fairly expensive but badly needed.We also took a bay cruise which was quite good for picture taking. The Red  White ferries run multiple times daily between 10 - 4 PM.One day, we took a Caltrain from downtown San Francisco to San Jose to see the Winchester Mystery House. The Caltrain takes about 90 minutes except the Express Baby Bullet which takes about 50 minutes. Fares are cheap at $13.50 return fare. The Winchester Mystery House is quite fun if you are interested in this type of thing. The mansion tour runs a little over 1 hour. Very informative and picture taking is allowed. We found it to be a little too quick for our liking but still enjoyed it very much. We also took the Behind The Scenes Tour which was just OK.FOOD :We were only in San Fran for 3 1\/2 days so we didn't get to try too many places. Buena Vista Cafe (across from hotel) is excellent for breakfasts and an Irish Coffee at night. They are said to have invented the drink and they do a great job at it. We also recommend Joanie's Happy Days Diner, Mel's Diner,  Mona Lisa ( at North Beach area ).
