{"text":"Don't Take Any Valuables With You Our stay at the hotel started out good. My husband was attending a medical seminar and I came along to go shopping at the Galleria Mall. When we checked in we were given two vouchers for the breakfast buffet but we were staying two days. We were told only my husband would receive the vouchers because it was being paid for by the sponsor of the seminar. Later that evening we found an evelope under our door which contained two more vouchers for myself. A pleasant surprise. However, our stay went downhill the next day when upon returning from the Galleria for a break and to freshen up, I couldn't find an almost new powder compact I had left in the room. Later in the evening when I did a more extensive search I also discovered a pair of gold earrings were missing. I had hid them as best I could at the bottom of a bag since there are no safes in the room. After filing a report with management we were called a few days later and told only the maid and the person who checks the room after the maid leaves (who had left dirty towels hanging on the bathroom door) were in the room and they knew nothing about the missing items. The hotel is only responsible for items over $100 in value so we could file a report with the police department if we chose. Needless to say, we won't be staying at this hotel ever again.
