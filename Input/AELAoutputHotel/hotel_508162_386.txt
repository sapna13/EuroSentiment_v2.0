{"text":"Sweet Dreams My husband and I are just back from a very relaxing 7 night stay at Dreams (April 19 - April 26). This was our second trip to Punta Cana but our first stay at Dreams and we did prefer this resort to where we previously stayed. Knowing that we were looking for a relaxing getaway, we did book a preferred club junior suite and we were quite happy with our choice. The suite was quite spacious with a king size bed, seperate living area, double vanity, walk in closet, and a large balcony with a huge jacuzzi. The preferred club lounge was quite accomodating with a private bar, internet access, and a nice library of current dvds to take back to our room, and the staff was always eager to take care of any needs we might have. The grounds were absolutely gorgeous and meticulously maintained (it's simply amazing to watch a man climb the plam trees barefoot with a machete to chop down the coconuts so they don't fall on the guests!). It's a little stroll through paradise from the front lobby to the beach as you pass by the beautiful foliage and encounter the flamingos on the side walk and the parrots in the trees. The pool is fantastic, with plenty of area for being active or just simply relaxing and we never had trouble finding a chair or a float in the pool on which to lounge. The beach was also fantastic and one of the perks of booking a preferred club room was having a private area on the beach where they provided beach towels, bottled water and they even had magazines and sunscreen for our use. It seemed like there was always a gentle breeze just when we needed it and our walks on the beach were fantastic - no crowds of people to run into. The food we experienced was average with the exception of the french restaurant, Bordeaux, which we found to be superb. I must note at this point that we did not experience many of the a la carte restaurants as I did become ill during our stay and was encouraged to keep to a very bland diet for the duration of my stay. I do not blame my illness on the quality or safety of the food as my husband and I ate the same things and he was just fine. I can however add to my review that the care I received from the doctor at the resort was outstanding! It's always a scary to be sick when you are away from home, but she provided excellent care and followed up to make sure that I was feeling better, which I was within a day or so. My husband and I have stayed at several all-inclusive resorts and our stay at Dreams was very enjoyable. I would not have any difficulty recommending this resort to others, though we will probaly prefer in the future to choose an adults only resort as we go for as much relaxation as possible. And ... please keep in mind that a vacation is what you make of it, choose to pack a positive attitude and leave the stress at home and you'll have a fabulous time (including the crazy ride to and from the airport)! Now, go have some fun in the sun!
