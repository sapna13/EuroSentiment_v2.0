{"text":"Had a great time My girlfriend and I arrived at the Grand Flamenco on May 7th 2008 at returned May 14th 2008. We had a great time. We stayed in building 13 and our rooms were super clean. The shower was a little old looking and sometimes the water pressure was bad. If everyone is taking a shower at the same time it will affect someone. The rooms were decorated nice and if you left a tip each morning for the maid you would see a difference. We thought the food was good. The buffets had what you needed. The a la cartes were ok. U only had 2 to choose from each night.I do have to say that the beach and the water was beautiful. The weather was excellent and we thought the service was pretty good. I noticed people complained a lot about the workers not speaking english very good. English isnt their first language so what do you expect. You dont see them being rude to us because we cant speak spanish.I will say however that the night time entertainment isnt so great.They also have a disco on the resort however the drinks are not free. They cost 7 dollars a drink which we thought was ridiculous and the reason why we never went there at night.Im not sure what everyone else paid but if you paid under 1000 dollars to stay there for a week all inclusive than it is worth it.We went through my sister's time share and it cost us 666 dollars that was including the flight.We definately would go back there and may do so Nov 1st ","annotations":[]}
