{"text":"Beautiful and Friendly Nikko Bali! We stayed in the Nikko Bali for six nights in April. We were a part of a group of five Americans that stayed in three rooms. All of us had an Ocean View room. The room was very nicely decorated, comfortable, clean, with a balcony view of the pools, beach, and ocean. I found the hotel to be just as beautiful as the photographs on it's website! We had a choice of hotels with the package deal from Singapore Airlines and I chose this hotel after reviewing each hotel's website and reading reviews of each. Everyone in my group was thrilled with my choice of hotel!The staff of the Nikko Bali is very friendly and service oriented. They all knew our names by the second day and greeted us by name each time they saw us. They went out of their way to help us or to answer our questions. We were invited to a manager's reception the third night at the hotel and really enjoyed meeting other guests at the hotel.Security at the hotel is one of the best the security expert in our group has seen both in the US and abroad. Others have noted the security in their reviews so I will not recount the details.We loved the breakfast that came with our room rate. It had such a variety of food. We were able to eat a late lunch each day. The service at breakfast was speedy and efficient no matter how many people entered the room at one time. It was a wonderful start to each day.We ate at three of the special night dinners - beach seafood barbeque, salsa night, and the dinner theater with traditional dance. The food was good and served buffet style. The hotel is some distance from stores and other restaurants. I hired a driver for each of our days so this was not a problem for us.Would we go back to the Nikko Bali again? Without a doubt! We loved this hotel!! ","annotations":[]}
