{"text":"Stylish but... We arrived at the Hotel De Las Letras in a torrential downpour and weren't impressed by the surly receptionist and extraordinary lack of help in finding a parking space for our car. i read somewhere that the hotel had an arrangement with a garage, but this proved not to be the case and we ended up spending over 100 euros to park the car for 4 days! Not good. The room was a Plus room (#613, in fact, on the 6th floor) and proved an excellent choice with a nice, large terrace with hot tub and actually well positioned to get the sun. The air-con was horrendously noisy so it was fortunate that it wasn't needed. The room also had a separate changing area which we liked a lot. Decor was stylish. The hi-fi in the room was a bit old fashioned with a cassette player and the TV had no DVD (movies were 'pay as you go'). The bar on the ground floor was busy ( smoky) most of the time and drinks were expensive (25 euros for two, admittedly generous, vodka  tonics). The restaurant (DL's) seemed good at producing bar snacks but the main courses we had weren't impressive. Breakfast catered for all tastes but was expensive at 15 euros. The gym in the basement proved to be a small room shared with spa staff with no air con and just a treadmill and bike. I used it twice but on the 3rd day was told I couldn't use it as they had a 'party of 10' in the spa and the gym equipment made too much noise. On the 4th day, I couldn't face sweating buckets in the 25 degree + heat of the room. The hotel advertises wi-fi but the connection to the outside world seemed to have dropped to a snail's pace so I had to pay extra (17 euros\/day) to use an adjacent swisscom wi-fi connection. Overall, a stylish, modern hotel that we enjoyed staying in but felt some attention to detail wouldn't go amiss.
