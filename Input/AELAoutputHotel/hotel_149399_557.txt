{"text":"Great Family Resort Stayed a Royal Service Nov 4 to 11, 2006My wife, 2.5 yr old daughter, and I stayed at the Royal Suites Nov 4 to 11. Overall we were very statisfied with the resort and the service. The resort met our expectations for a family vacation.I read all the reviews posted here prior to our trip and found that much of the negative that others have described are likely overblown issues. Yes the resort is big - if you did not know that before arriving you probably did not do your research. Yes it is hot and sunny - if you don't want sun and heat stay north. This is one of the few resorts with a care program for toddlers - this was a key factor in our decision to select this Melia resort. My daughter spent about an hour and a half per day playing insde the very clean and air conditioned play room. The room is staffed by one to two staff depending on the number of kids. Any kid that goes to daycare will have no problem adapting. After signing-in our daughter each morning she would tell us that she would see us later. My wife and I used this time to walk the beach and swim in the ocean.For those who want to workout while on vacation - the resort has a very good gym for a resort - it's air conditioned, the cordio machines work, there is an ample supply of free weights and machines. I used the facility while my daughter and wife were napping - I pretty much had the place to myself. The gym is located within the Tropical Spa.Many people have commented about the train service. It is handy when you have a toddler and lots of stuff to take to the pool and the beach. We did not wait more than ten minutes for a train and usually less. I usually walked from the RS side to the gym cutting accross the resort - it took about 5 minutes.Overvall the food was good. We ate breakfast at the Gabi restaurant on the RS side everyday - typical breakfast stuff - something for everyone. Most lunches were at the Grill on the Tropical side. Mostly the same everyday. We had two dinner at the Gabi on the RS side. We had the choice between the buffet and a themed a la carte. The other dinners were at the Italian (not great), Mexican (good) , Japanese (excellent), Chinese (good), and Med (excellent) a la carte restaurants. The RS makes yur reservations so you don't need to get in line to make a reservation in the morning.We would also recommend the RS service. TWe stayed in Villa 52 on the RS side. Its the closest Villa to the beach and very close to the RS Pool and Gabi restaurant. he extra perks are well worth the money. We had no service problems - all staff were helpful. We had no language issues. We were able to get our check-out extended to 4:00 to accomdate our late 6:30 resort departure. We probalby could have had it extended later but I did not want to push our luck. After 4:00 we waited in the VIP lounge where you have free access to the net, drinks and appetizers, tV, newspaper and air conditioning. We would defintely recommend this resort for families. There lots of space for kids to roam. They have well organized activities for older kids. Can't comment on the night time entertainment bacause we did not see it.I am happy to answer any questions you may have about the reosrt and our recent experience.Rob - rvclay@rogers.com ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2187,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":2180},{"endOffset":2187,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":2180}]}
