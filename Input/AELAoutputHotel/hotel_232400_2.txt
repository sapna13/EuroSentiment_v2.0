{"text":"Much more than meets the eye ! From the start I have to say I have known The Gerstekorrel (In de Gerstekorrel as it used to be) since 1966 and have been STAYING as a regular since 1972.My own 2 yr.absence recently has only been due to an intractible domestic situation,NOT to any loss of faith at all..indeed..the very OPPOSITE !YES..a very tourist\/family type it IS.However,the CLEANLINESS,COMFORT ans sheer OBLIGING FRIENDLINESS and HELPFULNESS of the staff quite set it apart;and,the location..as slap-dap central as you could ever want it to be ( 1.minute from the Dam Square says-it-all).We'll gloss-over the fact that the RLD (Walletjes..or whatever) is just 3.minutes the other way !!!!! Moreover,the lingustic professionalism of the staff,especially at reception is almost university level,with their considerable personal Warmth enhancing their commitment that no request is ever too small,for them to go out of their way to help you !This and the other points DO,without question,offset the touristyand a little noisy situation -only to be reasonably expected for a location such as that in a city of the size and vibrancy of Amsterdam.Finally,one last and HUGELY HONOURABLE and GREATLY RESPECTED point about this hotel.Just after it opened at the beginning of WW 11,after Holland was invaded,not surprisingly, the hotel was occupied by The Wehrmacht.from time to time (and,I believe,more than that even),the then owners,at a HUGE risk to themselves,sheltered people of the Jewish faith -in the cellar; right under the noses of the German military -upstairs !!It has been an honour to write this report..and GOD BLESS to all !Cheers,Mr.Stereo ","annotations":[]}
