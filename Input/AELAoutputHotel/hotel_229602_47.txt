{"text":"Live like a Parisian! We stayed here for 4 days in May 2008 for our first trip to Paris. At first glance the hotel felt small and maybe a tad worn around the edges, but within a few days the nice location and great staff had won me over completely and I would gladly stay here again. The hotel was quiet, comfortable, and clean. Our room looked over the small courtyard and we never heard any traffic or noise. The small frig in the room was great for storing our purchases from the Rue Cler market street (that is just as cute as the pictures show) and from the fresh bread bakery next door. It was nice to stay in a small hotel with local flavor that didn't feel like a chain hotel. The neighborhood is safe and clean. Metro is located 1 block away and Rue Cler is on the corner. The Eiffel tower is also a short walk away. Free internet terminals in the lobby.The staff was also very helpful. They helped us locate a lost piece of luggage, gave us maps and directions, recommended restaurants, and were able to book a last minute shuttle to the airport.The hotel was great to come home to after a long day of sightseeing. In fact, we spent one rainy day just hanging out in the neighborhood because it was too perfect to leave. You will quickly get into the habit of going to the bakery for bread in the morning, buying fresh fruit on Rue Cler, and greeting the locals as you head back to your hotel or sit at one of the many cafe's in the neighborhood.Some people may find the neighborhood too quiet, or may expect more amenities from a hotel, but for us it turned out to be just right and far away from the tourist crowds, which is just what we wanted.
