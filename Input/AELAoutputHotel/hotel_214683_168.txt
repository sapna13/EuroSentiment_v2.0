{"text":"TERRIFIC TROPICAL HONEYMOON We stayed at the Wakiki Beach Mariott for 10 days, on May 23rd-June1st in 2004 for a wonderful Honeymoon. We booked our stay Over the phone directly with the Mariott, there was a little confusion about which tower we would be in at first as they Would not and Could not guarantee a certain one over the phone until we arrived. We were nervous about that because it being our honeymoon, we wanted it to be oceanfront directly! When we arrived, we spoke with a nice man at the desk who was more than happy to make it happen for us though! with an increase in price from 269.00, it ended up being approx. 302.00 a night. It was by far the best vacation we've ever taken and was just wonderful. It was a very peaceful and relaxing stay! Our room was directly facing the ocean in the main beach tower and we could see a magnificent view of the ocean. We had a huge balcony and enjoyed looking at the surfers and clear water daily. The room was beautifully decorated with NEW tropical linens and soft down bedding. We had a very nice sized room, bigger than the standard ones in other towers. It was very wide and had a good sized bathroom. There was plenty of furniture for all of our things and the maids furnished us with more than enough service and towels. This hotel is breathtaking with the atrium, shops and restaurants. The concierge was more than helpful with helping us decide which excursions and trips to take. We went to the beach daily which was kinda crowded, but well worth it. The ocean is clear and has a huge wall that seperates the fish and waves. so that you may float on a float and be wet while sunbathing. ---This was my favorite thing! Only BE--CAREFUL, My float got sucked into one of the crackes in the wall, while I was sunbathing and I went under and got suked by the waves hitting numerous rocks! and lost my float. that was scary but luckily a local grabbed me from the rock pier and saved me. I had panicked because the waves here are horrendous, and I really could have drowned while hubby was on the beach asleep. We had a good laugh about it later and I couldnt have thanked that local enough!!!! Im sure I looked like an idiot. but at least I can worn others not to get too close to that thing! Needless to say I didnt fall asleep anymore on the float, I def. paid more attention.The nightlife is fun, The Locals ARE GREAT! however, some tourists --from other countries werent as nice as the locals and us in the US. I found that to be a downer. it is VERY crowded on the streets when walking on the sidewalks and they never moved, the would BUMP into you,them walking 6 wide, and not even blink or be sorry!I LOVED COCONUT WILLIES! its not in the hotel but its several blocks down inside the marketplace! They are awesome! I LOVED the HOTEL Italian Rest. It was Magnificant! We ate there quite a bit and LOVED every dinner! We would definately stay here again! It couldnt have been any better!
