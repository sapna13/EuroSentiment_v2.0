{"text":"Work in progress I had visited with my spouse and 19 month old kid.Lobby decor - Wonderful. Commute from the main road to the resort - a little long. The road goes thorugh the golf club area, and ends in to the Gran Melia resort. Nice view and setup, but long distance from main road.Internal commute from the main lobby to the individual resort rooms - they have travel carts that take you back and forth between your rooms and the main parking\/ lobby area, but wihout the carts and if you have to carry stuff to your rooms, it can be a pain.Restaurants- Internal 2\/3 restaurants - A little expensive, but the food\/ decor is ok.There is a inhouse casino, but I never went inside.Room - We did not have the ocean view room, but it was nice and quiet. Much bigger than the regular hotel room at a Days inn or likes. Bed was real comfy, and the room cleaning service was regular for the all 5 days that we stayed in the resort.Room service for food- Ok. No microwave in the room offered or available. There is a small refrigerator to keep maybe 5-6 beer bottles max. I personally thought the room service was a little expensive. 2X2 egg omelettes + tea = $45Beach - The resort has beach access to the coco beach, but corals and rocks are in abundance, so cannot go in the beach. So the beach access is pretty much only for the view. There is one area with net to play volleball. I think the Marriott next door seems a better option, and that does have a beach access with a beach that you can actually go into. Nice pool area, actually one of the best pools that I have in terms of size, layout etc. No hot water area or heated pool, so the water can feel much colder.Kid area- there is a kiddie pool and a playing area for kids, with slide, swing and toyhouse. There is also a parrot in the main lobby, my 19 month old loved this exotic bird :)They do have an AVIS rental office, so you can pretty much get picked from the airport and then rent your car from the AVIS office in the resort itself.People in the resort - Very friendly and warm. Tourist desk - they have tours to the El Yunque forest and other tours. They do have 2-3 people for tour desk information. The desk opens at 8am.Reception was nice - They did let us checkout late, even though the rooms were getting booked heavily because of the Puerto Rico open going on.Overall - A Nice resort, but like someone mentioned - it is still a work in progress.
