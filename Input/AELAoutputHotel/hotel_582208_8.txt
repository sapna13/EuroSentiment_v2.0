{"text":"All Lies!! All Lies!! Don't believe any review on this site about the LKF that states that they had spend a quiet night in this hotel!The provide foam ear plugs at the bed side together with the milk and cookies!!!!I booked my trip for a nice shopping weekend on the hotel internet site. A suite the size of a regular 4-season Hong Kong room and for the prize of the same, almost 5.000 HK$! Unfortunately I did read about the reviews on tripadvisor after the 48-hour cancellation and amendment hotel deadline.So I called the hotel up directly and asked the nice lady on the phone about the noise issue I read about. She said, that it can be a little bit noisy, but that the suite I booked on the 26th floor, so the noise should not be a problem! Lie number 1!When asked if I could still change my mind and cancel the booking, she said yes, but the penalty of one night charge will be applied (I had called 42 hours prior to the 2 pm check in time).She promised to see to it that the room I would get would not face the night life area and busy streets! Lie number 2!I arrived at 2 pm and my room was not ready yet. They did not know when the room would be available as the cleaning staff still had to clean it. So they send me out for lunch or shopping. I returned at 3:30 pm and was escorted to my room with the assurance of the staff that my luggage will be brought up. Lie number 3! I had to go down to the lobby again myself after a45 minute wait to collect the luggage myself.And as lie number 2 indicated, the suite they provided for me faced both Hollywood Road and Lang Quai Fong, the busiest night life areas in town.When I asked them whether the room was a non smoking room as requested they asked back: Do you want me to send up an ash tray for you? No I said I booked a non smoking room. Their answer: Oh all rooms in this hotel are non-smoking rooms. Does this count as a lie? Providing ash trays for non smoking rooms? Lie number 4!I am still at the room, it is 3 am in the morning, I cannot sleep due to the noise. I am not looking forward to the discussion tomorrow with the manager and probably more lies being presented.Stay away!
