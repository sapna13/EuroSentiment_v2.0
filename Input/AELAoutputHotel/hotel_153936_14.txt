{"text":"Elegant Hotel in Great Area of Mexico City! Wow. This is a very nice hotel in a great area of Mexico City. Service was outstanding, staff friendly, rooms nice, and offered an overall great experience.I was hesitant to stay here with all of the bad reviews, but was pleasantly surprised by what I found. A couple of thoughts...1. The food and drink and other prices inside the hotel are high, as resort high. I did not eat there but chose instead to eat at one of the many, many restaurants within a block or two of the hotel. Good food and very inexpensive if you will take a walk.2. The water was in fact $9 a bottle, but across the street at magazine stands and, additionally, 2 blocks away at the Farmacia they sold huge bottles for only 80 cents. Worth the short walk.3. The area is fantastic! Gardens are in all directions and all deserve exploring. Several museums are nearby. A walk through the park directly behind the hotel offers a fascinating view of street vendors, most cooking and selling meals and many vending wares. Neat sites in the area.4. The exercise room was in top shape, with a full time attendant or 2 and spotlessly clean with new equipment. I used the treadmill while enjoying a great view of the outdoor parkland.5. Ask the concierge about area sites. They are quick to offer a map and good directions for wherever you want to go.6. Our rooms were nice and updated. The room amenities were acceptable.7. The hotel seemed to have a lot of activity and hustle and bustle when we were there. Lots of businessmen from around the world.8. Yes, there is a daily service fee of about $15. This is a new addon that many hotels slip in, but here you did get 24 hour access to the large business center with brand new Dell computers and high speed internet. This fee did not kill the deal for me as it apparently did others.Overall, this is a very nice hotel with courteous staff in a great area of Mexico City. I hope to come back with my kids.CharlesSan Antonio ","annotations":[{"endOffset":68,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":64},{"endOffset":1870,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1866}]}
