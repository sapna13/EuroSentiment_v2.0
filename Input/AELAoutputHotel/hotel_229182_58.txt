{"text":"Important Info before Staying Here Okay there are always tips and hints and tricks with every hotel which you don't find out until you're staying there. Here are some lessons learned:1) Make sure you reserve a Guaranteed Rate room. This not only means you are guaranteed the rate, but it also guarantee's the room. If you do not select this TYPE of room you may show up and be told the hotel is full and you have no room. Be aware of this. I unfortunatley had to watch an incredibly patient businessman calmly argue for a room and get denied because he was unaware of this little twist. He had booked 3 months in advance. So get the right type of room. Its usually $10 to $15 more. Not much. 2) They have two buildings now. One is the main building you walk in with the beautiful lobby. The other is a building you walk to by going outside in the back alley (very safe). Rooms in the main hotel are carpeted and quiet. Very nice. Rooms in the other building are hardwood floor and also very nice, but potential for more noise depending on your neighbors above. 3) They have a notice up as of Christmas 2007 that they are planning to replace all TV's with widescreen flat panels soon.4) My little old african american cleaning lady had the face of an angel, and a smile that would melt your heart, and I immediately took to her. Until I got to Prague a week later and realized my $100 brand new leather shoes were not packed in my suitcase where I had left them. I will not make any accusations, but lets just say the hotel has not contacted me to inform me that I left them behind. Also my $150 in-ear headphones are missing. Use the safe, or put a lock on your suitcase. And no, it doesn't matter that she was african american, except in the sense that she reminded me of the kindest old lady I once knew, who also was. 5) Room service was a disappointment The first meal I had was spaghetti and they didn't bother to include anything they were supposed to. I ended up paying $18 Euros (thats $26 us dollars) for a very small plate of spaghetti. No bread. No salad. Nothing. And $5 Euros more for something to drink (Thats $6.00). A tiny old fashioned coke bottle that was empty in 3 gulps. I was disappointed with this. Crazy expensive and poor food service. The next day I ordered the same spaghetti (I was starving and working in the room), and the same exact meal showed up with side salad, and a basket of bread and butter and cheese. I guess the night person didn't care. Good to note. Make sure you get everything you're supposed to get. Room service people were super nice and always very friendly and patient and very respectful, not even making eye contact with you or anything in the room while you rummage for money. 6) Soap in the bathroom is tiny. Like the size of a match book tiny. And thin. Like matchbook thin. Like 1 shower and its gone. And they give you two. So bring soap, or ask for more when you arrive. And its orange colored, and smelling. 7) Room was nice. I will never get why they can't buy Queensized mattresses, but you will be stuck with two twins, if you think you're getting a King. Enjoy the crack in the middle. The pillows were PHENOMENAL!!!!!!!! I am a bed afficianado and i slept like never before. Absolutely awesome, weird, lumpy square pillows that were complete heaven. But the room overall was very classy, nice lighting, beautiful cherrywood closets and glass mirrored sections with lighting to enhance. They give you two fluffy white cotton robes and slippers to use if you want. Water in the shower is either scorching hot, or cold. Expect to spend about 15 mins trying to push it, just a tad, oh crap, too far, back a tad... ugh .. cold gain... okay ... just... nudge it ..... AH burning hot .... ok this time two hands so it doesnt bump too far.... GOT IT !!!! Nice hotel. Id stay there over the Hostels.
