{"text":"Best location on Waikiki!!! We spent the second week of our honeymoon at the Outrigger Waikiki. Check in was easy, we arrived a little early, so they took our baggage and we stopped at Dukes for lunch. We had a partial ocean view room on the Cheesecake factory side of the hotel. We did hear the exhaust fan when we were on our deck, but it wasn't annoying. The sunsets were very nice from our balcony. Beds were comfy, bathroom very nice, room was made up prompty each day. The room had free ethernet with cables in the desk and free long distance within the US. The elevators did take awhile at times, but overall, didn't hold us up much.We got coffees at the Seattle Coffee company in the lower lobby, if you get the Big Kahuna package, you can use your 5 dollar vouchers there and essentially get a light breakfast for free each day. We had lunch at Dukes twice, which was reasonable and very good, you could also order for a smaller menu poolside. There was a small deli (Pai) near the pool which was extremely well priced and the sandwiches were a perfect light lunch. Drinks were great at Dukes and the Hawaiian beers were excellent, especially Kona Big Wave. We mixed it up between the beach and the pool. Definitely hit the beach early and rent lounge chairs and an umbrella. Never had a problem getting seats by the pool. It is not a quiet beach\/pool experience, so don't expect it. It was a mixed group of people, friends traveling, honeymooners, and families. Bar service at the pool was excellent...and yes, bring your ID, but once the girls get to know you, you don't need it. Outrigger Waikiki is definitely in the hub of Waikiki, it is walking distance to great shopping and great restaurants. We mostly relaxed, since we had an action packed week before in Maui, but we thought Pearl Harbor and Diamond Head were well worth it. We also checked out the Magic of Polynesia across the street, fun, but not essential, and a little costly. The revolving restaurant across the street was a fun stop for a nightcap. All in all the Outrigger Waikiki was a great choice. We'd definitely come back!
