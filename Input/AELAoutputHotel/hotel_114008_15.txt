{"text":"Kahala Resort...Paradise on Earth We recently returned fom a trip to Hawaii, including a stay at the Kahala Resort in Honolulu. Since this was a special anniversary trip, we did a lot of research, and wow...did we make a GREAT choice!I will write about the beautiful resort, but I wanted to start with the Kahala's most important asset, their staff. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty. This is a staff that cannot do enough for you. Everyone is so friendly and happy, and it is a genuine kind of warmth that they share with you. They greet you by name, remember your preferences, and always seem to go a step above and beyond what you would expect. I truly cannot say enough about each and every employee that we were in contact with along the way. They are the best!As for the property, it is set along a beautiful stretch of beach, about 10-15 minutes drive time outside of Waikiki, but it feels like worlds away. The rooms are immaculate, the bathrooms are big and luxurious, and I never had a better night's sleep than on that wonderful mattress! We were even greeted with a chilled bottle of champagne.The food was excellent, and I am still missing those wonderful crepe pancakes from the breakfast buffet. We treated ourselves to a warm Pohaku stone massage, and since it was the first for both of us, I can't make comparisons, but I can't imagine feeling anymore relaxed or pampered than we were made to feel.I had my hair done in the salon for our vow renewal ceremony, and once again felt like my picture belonged on the wall of celebrities outside, because of the way I was treated.The view from our balcony was breathtaking, and we were always entertained by the 2-3 weddings on the beach daily, or the staff of the dolphin lagoon, and their eagerness to share any information you inquired about.Our only disappointment was that it went by too fast. We will surely return, and would not even consider staying anywhere else.
