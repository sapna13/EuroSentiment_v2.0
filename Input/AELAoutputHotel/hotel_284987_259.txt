{"text":"Paradisus tries but it's not a 5 star. My boyfriend and I recently stayed at Paradisus for 4 nights. After reading many negative reviews I was hesitant but the lure of an all inclusive sealed our stay here. Thanks to the advice of some savvy travelers, the suggestion of upgrading to royal service was heeded. I firmly believe if you can afford it, upgrade. The service was notably better as far as gaining dinner reservations easily with other advantages such as a private butler. Ourbutler provided us with special services such as a cheese plate with wine before dinner and they even set up a romantic jacuzzi evening for us. It seemed to be ask and you shall receive.Fortunately we never found service to be an issue. If you travel a great deal, you know- tip when appropriate-yes it is an all inclusive and no you shouldn't have to give extra but if it makes life easier to part with a few singles here and there, why not? Youwill be amazed how much better attitudes become. Royal service also provides a separate, adult pool that is only for royal service guests. It is a smaller pool but definitely more quiet and allows personalized attention. A word of advice, try to get poolside before 10:00 to insure your own cabana for the day. As other travelers stated, the beach is nothing to be in awe of and swimming there is not ideal. But it still makes for a nice stroll and to dip your toes in. They do have paddle boats and catamarans to enjoy.The 5 star element here is undoubtedly the grounds. Paradisus is a breathtaking place to behold and the attention to its decor is amazing. If only they placed remotely close attention to their food. There is nothing 5 star about it. I have been told that all inclusives almost never have gourmet food. Everyone was right.The food here is fine if you do not expect stellar chef delicacies. We ate at every restaurant except Toscano. Romantico was more upscale and other travelers said it was the best pick.My boyfriend had a delicious lamb entree but my seafood entree was inedible and I had to return it to the kitchen only to be told it would take another hour AGAIN to bring me something. I left hungry and couldn't believe the mis management with that one. I would have opted for room service when we got back but the room service menu is extremely limited.The casino is definitely larger than a closet as another trip advisor member stated. It's actually a decent size and staffed with friendly employees.The spa is also nice although small. We had a couples massage which was delightful although quite expensive even for 80 minutes.I began the trip to Paradisus filled with trepidation due to so many negative reviews but the stay here was lovely, with not a bed bug in sight, thank god!I think perhaps if Paradisus lowers it's star rating, expectations will not be so high. Based on my personal experience as well as that of my boyfriend, I can tell you that if you do stay here, you can expect a wonderfully, relaxing time. It was a little taste of heaven for us. How could it not be when you are lounging poolside and the most energy asked of you is to lift your head up to ask for another drink? Just remember, heaven doesn't come cheap!
