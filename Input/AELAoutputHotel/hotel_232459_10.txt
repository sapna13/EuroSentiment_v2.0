{"text":"Great hotel, lovely staff My boyfriend and I stayed in the Piet Hein in February 2008 for a long weekend. We loved the Piet Hein - the room was gorgeous. It was big, the bed was huge and very comfortable, we had a great flat screen TV. The bathroom was great, and everything was spotlessly clean. The breakfast was lovely, plenty of variety, great quality. The reception staff were very nice - they provided us with a map when we checked in, and marked the hotel location on it as well as some directions for us to get to various locations we might want to see. We later asked for restaurant recommendations, and we ended up in a fantastic place - I'm afraid I can't remember what it was called, but it was an excellent choice. They also helped us with the metro. The barman was also great, very friendly and chatty. There was free internet access in the lobby area.On our last night, we were a little worse for wear (too much dutch beer!) and I had a terrible hangover the next morning. I called down to the reception and they let us check out a couple of hours late at no extra cost - which was very helpful. All in all, I loved the hotel, the staff were brilliant and I would absolutely stay there again if I went back to Amsterdam. As with most places, they really do love it if you make the effor to speak a bit of their language, even though everyone speaks English extremely well. Ask how to say please and thank you in Dutch - they were very patient with me when I kept repeating it back to check I had it right, and kept getting it wrong anyway. :) ","annotations":[]}
