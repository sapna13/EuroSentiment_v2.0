{"text":"Liked it and would stay there again any time The location of this hotel is excellent. You can walk to almost anything in Condado and you can catch a bus to Old San Juan about a block away. They have limited parking, for an extra charge, but it's worth it. You can find street spaces but you'll have to be lucky.The beds were very comfortable, the room modern and clean. The bathroom was small, but who cares? Do you sleep there? No. The wireless internet worked great and was fast. If you complain about the comfort of this room, you are just too damn fussy. Either that, or you're looking for a resort, which this is NOT.Only downside for me, the breakfast was lame. Not horrible, but sort of packaged-- institutional pastries, juice from machine, cruddy coffee. If you are a breakfast pig like me and you want a hot breakfast you'll have to go out, but that's no problem. There are lots of places close. Starbucks is nearby too. (big surprise there, huh?)Shopping and casinos are RIGHT there, you are literally in the middle of it all, down a quiet side street.The front desk was perfectly nice and friendly to us. I guess anyone could have a bad day, but they were nice to us. We paid about $110, and I'd say it was worth it. For $150 I'd say it's not worth it. I would absolutely stay there again.BTW, the Comfort Inn right next door looked like a dump by comparison, I'd take the HI-Express anyday.
