{"text":"OK but probably better choices out there We booked a junior suite for 5 nights through priceline. We were bringing our 5-month-old daughter, so that's why we got the junior suite.The service started out great - they brought a pack-n-play up with freshly laundered sheets for our daughter, they emptied the minibar so we could use it for bottles. The hotel room is not gorgeous but it's better than acceptable. It's supposed to look muted and sophisticated but it's looking a little worn down.But then we had some problems. The room was overwhelmingly hot and it took them over a day to fix it. With an infant, that wasn't fun. Our cordless phone in the room didn't work at all. The front desk was sometimes unfriendly (eg, stared at me while I was struggling to open the enormous heavy front door with the stroller in tow instead of helping).The worst was room service. The menu is very limited and way overpriced. A tiny steak with some fries was $26. My husband's was way overcooked, and mine was only 2\/3 the size of my husband's (and his was tiny). They never brought an extra receipt up so we constantly had to ask for them. A meal of two bowls of oatmeal was $20, seriously. Even though they have a full service restaurant, they would not allow us to order anything except for the very limited number of items from the room service menu. I even asked if we could go down and pick the food up from Cortez (the hotel's restaurant) and I was told no. This issue won't affect most people like it did us. Because we had an infant, we couldn't just run out and grab something to eat. I found the limited menu, extremely high prices, and poor food quality to be a real downer. It definitely negatively affected our experience and we wouldn't come back.
