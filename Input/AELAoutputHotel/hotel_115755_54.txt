{"text":"Completely renovated, stylish, and clean! After a very bad experience with another hotel in the Seattle area, we called around to various hotels and found Hotel Deca. Their rates were very competitive with other hotels in Seattle, and they were conveniently located just outside of the downtown area. One of the key factors was that Hotel Deca offerred free parking for our selected room type. Otherwise, parking in the downtown area would have added to the daily rate of other hotels.When we checked in, we found that the recently renovated hotel was very stylishly decorated and clean. The staff at the front desk was very professional and helpful. Free WiFi Internet access is availablethroughout the hotel, and I was able to get a good signal from my room. Bed linens, towels, carpet, and bathroom all were clean. Even the shampoo and soap had a pleasing uniqueness to them. The hotel room featured a large (approx 32) LCD TV with DVD player. The alarm clock was an iHome that had an iPod dock, which was a nice feature. The continental breakfast in the lounge was convenient for us to grab somethinig quick to eat in the morning. Though you are in the middle of a college town, it is a very quick drive to downtown Seattle (6-8 minutes) depending on traffic. There are the usual college type restaurants in the neighborhood and a rather good vegeterian restaurant called Aruya a block away. If you want to experience unique Seattle restaurants, then you'll probably want to venture downtown to Flying Fish or Wild Ginger. There are a couple comedy clubs in the hotel neighborhood if you are looking for some nighttime entertainment. We visited the Giggles comedy club, which was fairly priced at $12 with a one drink minimum (but we were also given complimentary passes to come back and see another show on another date). Overall, I would probably look here first if I were visiting Seattle again. The price is fair and the accommodations are great.
