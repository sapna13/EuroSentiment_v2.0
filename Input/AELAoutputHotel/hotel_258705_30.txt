{"text":"This is the place to stay in Boston Well, after reading such great reviews of this Hotel, I decided to book it for my weekend away to celebrate my anniversary.We booked a junior suite, which is a large room with a separate living room and bedroom. It had two televisions, a huge desk and comfortable chairs with an ottoman. The rooms are separated by curtains. It was nicely decorated, had great comfortable beds and super linens. They put a down comforter in between two high thread count sheets-what a great night's sleep. It wasn't too busy in November but the rooms were really soundproofed. When you walked into your room, you had your own little foyer with a closet. The bathroom shower was great with a shelf, immediate warm water and a separate toilet roomService was great. The location was as well. Some have said it is less than desirable due to it's location, but the Kenmore T stop is right outside the door of the hotel. Also it is close to Fenway, Newberry Street and the Back Bay area is very safe. You have to ride the T to get to the start of the Freedom trail, but I prefer not to stay in such a touristy area myself. It is well worth it to upgrade to a suite, by the way. For about $20 we had more space, and the extra curtains kept it really quiet and dark for sleeping. My husband had to wake me up one morning because I just kept on sleeping. It is classy, has restaurants on site, is near convenient stores, and we walked to the movies from there (that's our kind of nightlife fun).The only negative didn't have much to do witht the hotel-The T is a little confusing, sometimes you have to be careful not to take the wrong train on the same line, pay attention to the final destination on the outside of the car. Plus it can be crowded on the weekends. Overall, a great city and a great hotel. I would definitely stay here again.
