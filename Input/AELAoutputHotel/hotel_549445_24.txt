{"text":"Will Come Back Yes, the shower is as small as others have written. But I found Hotel 140 to be a hip, refreshing change from other hotels. What's right about Hotel 140? The location is certainly ideal, but there's plenty more to appreciate. The hotel's staff--from those at the front desk to those who prepare your room--are kind and friendly, as if they enjoy their job and appreciate your business. Probably because the rooms either have only a single or double bed, the hotel was void of children, so there were no little feet running up and down the hallways or little ones crying out, giving me the feeling that I wasn't in a hotel. It was so quiet that I couldn't hear the heavy construction going on across the street. Kudos to the manufacturer of the hotel's (large) windows. Breakfast is served at a cafe on the first floor that is open to the public. The free breakfast for hotel guests consists of one hot drink (and the coffee is delicious), one cold drink (from a selection that includes expensive bottled fruit juices) and one pastry from an array of pastries that looked like the handiwork of a high-end bakery. If that isn't hearty enough for you, one can buy very inexpensively eggs and such from the cafe, whose employees, like Hotel 140's, could not have been more considerate and welcoming. So what's wrong with Hotel 140? Frankly, the small shower didn't bother me, but I did wish the room had had more wall hooks to accommodate clothes on hangers. The closet in our mid-priced room was an estimated 30 inches tall, too short to handle dresses, skirts, even my husband's shirts. We had packed many of our clothes on hangers and found ourselves struggling to find enough space to hang them on the short bar of wall hooks that was mounted next to the bathroom door. Small complaint indeed.
