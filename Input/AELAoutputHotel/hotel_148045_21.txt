{"text":"Loving and Returing to the El Conquistador in Puerto Rico My trip came to an end on August 31, 2008. I must say my daughter, sister and I were sorry to leave the El Conquistador Spa and Resort in Farjado Puerto Rico. Before I left for my trip, I read several reviews on this website and after reading them, I was rethinking if I had made the right decision for our vacation spot, but that thought was quickly put to rest.We arrived on Tuesday August 26, 2008. We took the shuttle provided by the hotel and arrived quickly at our destination. Upon arriving we were greeted by friendly and informative staff, but there was one person in particular who was extremely nice and it was truly a pleasure doing business with him, Mr. Rogelio Santos is truly a professional. We were checked in, with no problems and shown to our room, given a small tour and left to enjoy paradise. My room was an ocean view located near the marina, its also very close to the water park, if you have kids that's where you want to be.  Our first dining experience at the hotel was at Cafe Bell Vista. Once again I had read the reviews of how expensive food was and was a little apprehensive, but was I pleasantly surprised at our meal and the price and wonderful service. Everything was freshly prepared and served by our wonderful server Sally. Of course you are going to pay a little more, but that is to be expected but it wasn't outrageous and for the quality and quantity it was well worth it. We also ate at Cafe Caribe. Once again the food was delicious and freshly prepared. I thoroughly enjoyed the arroz con pollo. I also suggest the Ballyhoo, my sister had the steak with rice and beans, she couldn't stop talking about it. Drinks at the hotel are good and roughly the same price as I pay in any restaurant in New York. I chose to avoid the more expensive restaurants upstairs because their prices seemed over the top for what they were offering.We enjoyed several days at the beach and didn't venture out of the hotel because everything was there. The food at the beach was very good. I suggest the grilled chicken sandwich. ( Don't drop any food because the roosters will be right there to eat it. LOL.) The beach also offers horse back riding, which is cheaper than what the hotel offers. If you want to go on tours, they can be a little pricey. Private tours are available outside the hotel. Information for that was given by other guests who were staying there. ( I still have the number if anyone is interested.) If you have a little time on your hands don't hesitate to visit the casino. I would suggest a little more entertainment in the night club downstairs, or maybe even a beach party for the guests that would be nice. I think guests would enjoy a little diversion. LOL.My only complaints are as follows: My daughter has a sensitive stomach, so I had to keep ginger ale on stock. I paid $1.79 for a 10 oz botte. They don't provide anything larger. I spent roughly $20 on soda. I would suggest having larger sizes. The bugs will eat you alive, bring bug spray and anti-itch cream. Dining is outside in some restaurants, the bugs will get you. Since we were there around Labor Day weekend and there was a conference, I noticed that elevators and the funicular were broken during the weekend. It was quickly prepared, but I can only attribute this towards the large groups that began to arrive. It was an inconvenience, but the staff did everything to make sure the inconvenience was minimum.I went there for rest and relaxation and that is what I received. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are very modern and a pleasure to be sleep in. The cleaning staff was always there to provide whatever I needed as well as all the staff. I can't wait to go back.
