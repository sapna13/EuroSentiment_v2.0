{"text":"Good Deal for the Money We stayed at the Berlin Mark Hotel in July and the hotel is a good deal for the money. The rooms are average size for a European Hotel but the single beds were extremely small. The mattresses and comforter were comfortable but the one pillow provided for each bed was paper thin. The room did have air conditioning which kept the room adequately cooled however the exterior temperatures were cool also so I'm not sure how it would do in extreme heat. The bathrooms are very small and the shower did not drain on our first day. After speaking with the front desk the following morning, the problem was solved. Regardless, water did run through the sliding stand-up shower screen so you will need to make sure the bath mat is down to sop up the water.There are excellent restaurants and the Hard Rock Cafe in close proximity to the hotel. Shopping is located all over Kudamm so take a right out of the hotel and you will run right into it.There are two U-Bahn stations within 2 blocks but one main train line is down until the end of the year. This created a big inconvenience as this was the line we most commonly used.Overall, the front desk staff was helpful and polite. The breakfast buffet was very good and the housekeeping service was timely and clean. Internet service was included in my room rate but it is very expensive (50E per week) if you have to pay for it. The connection was a bit slow but adequate.You really can't beat the price. The rooms are extremely ordinary but a great value.
