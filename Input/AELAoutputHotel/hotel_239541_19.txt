{"text":"Nice place, minor problems The Hosteria Grau is at the intersection of two narrow streets off La Ramblas. Although most seem to consider this a great location, I disagree. This neighborhood is lively at night and may be great for college students and youngsters out to party all night √à√\u2020\u2022?but its not remotely lively in the manner most traveling to Europe on vacation would want. If you are a young student on a budget who enjoys dirty streets with a ton of graffiti, bars, and local drunks then you will like the location. If, however, your idea of lively-at-night is not honking motorcycles and drunks outside your window all night you will prefer another area of the old town to this. Additionally I fail to see even one redeeming factor in La Ramblas, a truly unattractive street √à√\u2020\u2022?a haven for pickpockets, prostitutes and loud tourists. It may be historically interesting to the city, but in its current state, packed with fast food places and tourists, it was quite a disappointment.The Hosteria Grau itself is adequate and the staff is very nice. The hotel is kept locked and they buzz you in, so it seems pretty secure. We were in the top level apartment and there was only two of us, so the place was really huge and at quite a reasonable rate for Barcelona. We had numerous beds to select from, as well as couches. There isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ much in the way of dishes √à√\u2020\u2022? some form of electric tea maker we did not use and a very small refrigerator. Its not the type of apartment you can stay in for a week and cook, but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a comfortable place to stay at night. The beds are somewhat of a disaster, but no more so than almost anywhere else in Spain at this price level √à√\u2020\u2022?mattresses that sink with your body weight √à√\u2020\u2022?no support at all. At least the sheets and linens seemed clean- although the comforters were stained. I certainly didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think much of the general housekeeping √à√\u2020\u2022?the floors were really not cleaned daily, but were clean enough not to cause great worry. The bathroom is quite old fashioned but adequate, although you can hear many of the other rooms through the tiny central shaft its window opens to.The shower is so tiny one can barely fit in it, but it is kept clean. The door to the shower did not work. The worst part, however, was that you have absolutely no control over the water temperature in this shower. The water will magically alternate between a range of temperatures, seemingly at random, but its shocking because you cannot possibly move out of the way √à√\u2020\u2022?there is no space! So you will burn, and you will freeze. There was free internet access in the tiny lobby and staff was always very helpful with suggestions and guidance. There is no air conditioning in the rooms, but in April this was not relevant. So, altogether, despite the problems, I would say that for the price this place is actually an OK Barcelona bargain and I imagine ideal for many a traveler.
