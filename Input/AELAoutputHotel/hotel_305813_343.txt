{"text":"My new favorite hotel in Hong Kong!!! Let me start off by saying I have been going to HK for almost 20 years. I have stayed at the Regent (Now the intercontinental), the Harbour Plaza(s), as well as the Sheraton, Nikko, Shangri La, and a few others.This hotel is located in Mong Kok which is 3 stops from Tsim Sha Tsui (waterfront area) on the MTR (Subway).Side note - The best way to get around HK is using the MTR. It's clean, safe, and super effecient. Takes a little getting used too but the transit authority has made it so user friendly that you wont want to move around HK any other way.I have always been partial to the Harbour Plaza because it was Regent Quality  Service at Sheraton prices. Please see my last review on the Harbour Plaza and why I went in search of a new hotel and I am so glad I did.If your a first time visitor to HK I do NOT reccomend you stay here only because I firmly belive there is nothing more spectacular then a Harbour View room in Hong Kong. There is nothing more spectacular then waking up and seeing the busting Victoria Harbour.That said this hotel is perfect for every stay after your first. The service is second to non in all of HK. From the second you arrive to till you leave the staff is there to please.For the first two nights I stayed in a standard room. The room is fine. The only knock is the bed is very firm but not Chinese firm so its livable.The first night I ordered room service. I wasnt that hungry so i ordered an appitizer. The app was HUGE. I couldnt even finish it.The next 3 nights I stayed in an executive suite and I have to tell you that it was one of the best suites I ever stayed in. Nice living room with a full kitchen, (who knew they even existed in HK?!?!?). Awesome shower and bathroom plus fantastic flat screen plazmas in every room (2 in the suites).Wireless internet was a great plus! The added value of breakfast, snacks, and drinks on the exec level club is well worth it. Every morning I had breakfast (made to order eggs!!) on the exec level, followed by afternoon snacks, and night caps. The view from the exec lounge is awesome. Since this is one of the taller hotels in HK you really get a cool birds eye view of the Mong Kok. Not interested in Hotel food, take the enclosed walk way to the Langham Place shopping center (off the lobby) and when you enter the mall you will see at least 10 resturants too choose from plus Starbuck and little gourmet shops. The mall is nice to walk around, plus you can get to the MTR without every having to go outside!!.The hotel is almost 4 years old, but the staff acts like its brand new and try so hard to make sure your stay is as comfortable as possible. I really enjoyed my stay here and looked forward to coming back to my room each day\/night. A great example of the service is during my first two nights I stayed in a standard room on the 8 floor, my next 3 nights I was on the 38th floor. The response time to my requests were identical.Oh I almost forgot!! Each room is equipped with the S.M.A.R.T. Phone. In most hotels you have to dial a certain extension to reach a certain department such as room service or bell hop. At the Langham Place, all you do is press 0 (zero) and the person that answers takes care of everything for you from room service, housekeeping, bell hop, resevations, anything. Its having the concierge at your beck and call with the push of one button. You dont realize how awesome that is until you have it.Great hotel, great location, great food, great service...great great great great!!I will not stay anywhere else in HK!!!!
