{"text":"Great choice for Berlin We spent three nights at the Radisson, and were pleasantly surprised at every turn. The room is modern, and well thought out. Almost everything you would need is here--comfortable beds, flat screen TV, high speed Internet access, in room safe, hair dryer, iron\/ironing board, Nespresso coffee maker, plenty of outlets, etc. The only thing we didn't have was a clock (suggestion to hotel). I want to re-do our bathroom at home, now that I've seen the one in our hotel room. Heated floors, large mirror, magnifying makeup mirror, separate toilet area with a creative swinging door to divide up the two spaces. We had a business class room that overlooked the Spree river, and the Dom Berliner cathedral was so close that I couldn't fit the entire thing into the frame of my camera when I went to take a photo of it. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. Our breakfast each morning (included in our room rate) was plentiful and there was a wide selection of items, including someone who would make an omelet for you to your specifications. The hotel is located on a major street, but traffic noise at night was not a problem. We could walk about 1\/2 block to pick up the #100 bus which stops at most of the major tourist sites. We visited at this time of year with the intention of going to the Christmas markets. There were two large markets located within a very short walking distance of the hotel. We could also walk to the TV tower. All in all, this hotel was a hit. No disappointments.
