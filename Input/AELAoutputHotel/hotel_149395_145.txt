{"text":"Beautiful but not perfect My husband and 2 children ages 8 and 9 stayed here last April over Spring Break. First off I have to say that I have been to several resorts in the Carribean and this one is the most beautiful. The grounds are gorgeous and impeccably kept. The pools are beautiful and the beach unbeatable. The rooms were small but they were kept very clean every single day and we spent very little time in the room. The restaurants were mostly good but nothing truly outstanding. The first night we went to the Seafood restaurant and it was very good, then on the last night we went again and the lobster was just awful (undercooked and chewy) I noticed several diners did not eat their lobster that night. The dress code was annoying for the men. Really anything goes for the women except a bathing suit, but most of the restaurants did require pants for the men. This is bad when it's 80 degrees humid and open air dining. No real stomach problems just my son had a slight bout of diarrhea.The swim up bar was fun but I was dissappointed that they did not have any good mixers. They use a tang type drink for orange juice, a watered down punch in place of cranberry and no grapefruit juice. I thought this was very strange. The service was very good and the bartenders were also very nice to the kids making them virgin mudslides, pina coladas or whatever, and they never treated the kids as annoyances.The kids club (is not), basically a run down place with some old board games. They did have some organized water volleyball which my son loved but that was really it for the kids. However the pool was great for the kids. They have a blow up rock climbing wall which my kids spent hours on. One thing I will say about the pool was that I do think the water gets dirty with drinks spilling and oil build up. My son and I had ear problems almost the entire time we were there, being plugged and painful (and we never have before from swimming). I would recommend flushing ears every night with hydrogen peroxide to keep ahead of this.We went on a snorkeling excursion and they piled a very unsafe amount of people into a boat and headed out to sea in very choppy water and then dropped us at a corral reef. Nothing great to look at here, it does not come close to snorkeling in Aruba or Cancun, I do not recommend this trip.The weather was sunny every day and oppressively humid. Bathing suits do not dry here and drink as much water as you can. The people were so friendly but the language barrier is very difficult to overcome. We had a lot of trouble communicating. We just found out what we needed to know from other vacationers. By the way the other vacationers were awesome and we made a lot of friends while we there.All in all a beautiful place but very expensive.
