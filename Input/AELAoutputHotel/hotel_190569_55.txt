{"text":"Four fabulous nights in Madrid We spent four fabulous nights in the Westin, a Starwood hotel, after arriving in Madrid from the US. It is located on Paseo del Prado in the museum district in front of the Neptune fountain. The Prado and Thiessen museum are within a block  the Reina Sofia a few blocks away. It is walking distance to all the sights we wanted to visit. The plaza mayor is about a 20 minute walk.We reserved a Premium Deluxe Non-smoking Room with a City View. Our room had two oversized double beds that we pushed together into a virtual King. The 5th floor room had two large windows that looked down and opened onto the fountain. The comfort of the bed (called a heavenly bed) even rivaled the view. The bathroom and closet space was also excellent. It was a fabulous room. When we checked in they were going to give us a a queen bed (they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have Kings) without a great view but we pressed the attendant for a better room and we are glad we did. The service was excellent and the concierges were always helpful and friendly. My only complaint is that they charged a substantial extra free for Internet access. Most of the hotels we stayed in did the same thing. It is a bit annoying given the price point of the hotels and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° strongly recommend the management consider changing that policy. We were able to get a relatively good price using a AAA discount but it was still an expensive hotel (300euros). To us it was worth it.
