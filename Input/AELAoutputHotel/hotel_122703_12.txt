{"text":"Will always stay here before I fly from DFW I found this hotel when looking for a hotel that offered park and fly from DFW. I chose it becase it was as close as I could get (same terminal) and it was ranked high on trip advisor. I was very happy. Check in was quick. The bell boy that took us to our room showed us where everything was and explained the mini bar to my daughter, telling her it will charge , no you money even if you oped it and look at it, which was cute. The room was clean, beds were comfy, pillows plentiful, and NO outside noise. We ate at the restaurant downstairs. We had snack items (chicken wings and sliders), a salad, kids meal, and 4 or 5 drinks and it was around $100 with the tip. Pool was rooftop and clean. Did not use the gym but I did check it out and it was nice. Locker rooms were great. Received wake up call on time and check out was simple. Received free coffee coupons which were great since flight was at 6 am. The stay at the hotel was a great way to start off a vacation. I was laying out at the pool watching my daughter, thinking.. anytime we fly from DFW, we should come a day early and stay here to make it easier, when...my husband says.. we should walays do this when we fly out from here. So it will be!
