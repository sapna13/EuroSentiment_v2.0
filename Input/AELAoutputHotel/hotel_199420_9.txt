{"text":"A reasonable hotel in good location I stayed as a solo traveler for my three night trip to Berlin. Overall I found the hotel to be adequate for my needs and well located.The Plaza is in the Charlotenberg district of Berlin, part of the old Western area of the city. It is a modern hotel on around 4 floors with a small bar area  restaurant on the ground floor. My room was small looking out of the front of the hotel on to a small side street just of the Ku'Damn, the main shopping district of the city. The size was a bit of an issue, even as a lone occupant and at nights there was quite a lot of street noise, worsened by the fact that you really need your window open to make up for the lack of air conditioning. The location is good, if you intend to shop and for the nearby Tiregarten, less so if you are intending to tour the museums. Most of the sights lie east of the Charloneberg area which is served by a good train network. The hotel is around 5 minutes walk from the closest S Bahn station (overground) and 10 minutes from the closest U Bahn station (underground). There is a good choice of local restaurants of almost any variety  cost and there is a supermarket on the street. Facilities in the hotel are reasonable. Staff are very friendly and helpful and are also able to converse in English if required. The bar is small but reasonably priced. I did not eat in the hotel at nigh but breakfast offered a good choice and service was excellent. I particularly enjoyed the large pot of coffee, served in a thermos, which kept it hot to each table. A couple of minor grumbles,. There was only one pillow in my room and likewise towels just one smallish bath towel and one hand towel was left in the bathroom. All told the Plaza offers good value for money - it is a good hotel, run very efficiently but not really exceptional.
