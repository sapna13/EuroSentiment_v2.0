{"text":"Great Experience From An Average Hotel Our party of 10 had a great time at this average hotel during Presidents week in Feb of 2007. While the accommodations are not luxurious by any means -- well-worn furniture, limited restaurant choices\/menu, and spotty front-desk service -- we loved the super friendly staff, expansive (but shallow) pool, and beach front location. This was our first trip to Rincon but it won't be our last.All-in-all, Rincon by the Seas seemed to be above average for the area and was perfect for our group. The teenagers used the free wireless internet in the lobby and free wired internet in the rooms (bring your own Cat 5 jumper), our little guys had fun in the pool, playground and chasing the geckos, and everyone enjoyed the beach and breathtaking sunsets. We had a beach cabana, which was a regular room that opened onto the pool level. We paid a little extra, but really enjoyed being able to come and go into the pool level directly from our room (the patio door has a card reader lock)We found Rincon to be a wonderful area where visitors can see some of the old, traditional Puerto Rican lifestyle with some of the touristy items like good restaurants and bars, parasailing, and world-class beaches. Please note, however, that the emphasis in Rincon is surfing the big waves, not floating in calm waters. Swimming beaches few and far between and the water was more murky green than turquoise.Lastly, while another review lamented the guests as New York, middle class, overweight, and families with kids we found these NY City firemen to be wonderful people who we were proud to share time with.
