{"text":"Not a bad place for the price! We got in on Saturday and found we had to park in the garage across the street, while they validated, it still cost us almost $20 a day to park! The elevator wasn't working but they said they had called someone and they should have it fixed by in a couple of hours so we carried our luggage up to the second floor. They offered to keep it behind the desk until the elevator got fixed, but we didn't mind. They did get the elevator fixed like they said they would. Our hotel room was tastefully furnished, a little on the small size but the bathroom was huge. In San Francisco the buildings are all right next to each other and this was no exception we looked at a brick wall. It has radiator heat which worked well as it was chilly while we were here. The staff was very nice and personable and while we needed extra pillows we did have to call twice on them, but we did get them. The maid cleaned our room well and the place did not have a musty smell. It is located a couple of blocks from China town and a couple of blocks to Union Square which are not a problem to walk to. 2 doors down is live nude male dancing for males, but we didn't hear or see anything and we walked past it at different hours of the day. We did have a little toilet back up that my husband had to get the plunger but after that it was okay. The shower water pressure is great and they provide shampoo and shower gel incase you forget. They do sell soda and water here at the desk, but no ice. In the morning they provide donuts, muffins and black coffee. All in all the place was very quiet, we didn't hear anyone. We would stay here again!!
