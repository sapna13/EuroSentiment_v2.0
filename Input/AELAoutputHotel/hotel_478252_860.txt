{"text":"Great Time... but Resort Too Big! My husband and I and his two sons 16  18 just returned on Tuesday from a week at the Gran Bahia Principe Bavaro. We had a wonderful time as it was the first time the kids had been on trip of this kind. My husband and I are frequent travelers and wanted to share the all inclusive vacation experience with them. After much research, reading many great reviews and our previous experience at the Bahia Principe Akumal in the Mayan Riveria a couple of years ago, we decided upon this resort and anxiously awaited our departure date. While on the bus to the resort staff attached our hotel ID bracelets and gave us our room keys. We were in the Club Diamond section (block 31) and our room was located in very close proximity to the Club Diamond pool and restaurant. We were very happy that we upgraded to the Club Diamond section, as we enjoyed the extras that it provided. We were entited to 4 a la carte dinners but when we were booking the times on the first day we were offered an extra meal at the Dominican restaurant. This was a very nice touch and proved to be one of the better meals of the trip. We very much enjoy the a la carte dining when we are on vacation and having a quiet relaxing meal. I felt that the meals and food were OK, but they were nothing really special. Everything was very mass produced and we quite often felt rushed from one course to another. Also, we were limited to the number of dishes that could be ordered. ie appetizer or soup but not both. I am one who likes to try lots of different dishes when I am on vacation and value the availablity. This is the first time that I have ever felt limited at an all inclusive resort. That being said, our favourite meal was at the Steakhouse. The steaks were fabulous, cooked to perfection and melted in you mouth. We also very much enjoyed having breakfast and lunch at the Club Diamond restaurant. as the main buffet and main pool snack bar were always very busy.The beach and the weather were both phenomenal. We walked the beach a couple of mornings in each direction it is wonderful white sand and the water is so warm. The week that we were there it was sunny and warm the entire week with the exception of one afternoon where it showered for a couple of hours.Our rooms were on the third floor of our building and were large and spacious. The marble bathroom was gorgeous and we always had hot water for a shower. The only thing that we found disappointing was the maid service. Our room was never cleaned before 3pm and most often it wasn't done until 5pm. This was inconvienent for us as we very much enjoy getting and early start to the day and returning to our room later in the afternoon to get out of the sun and relax before dinner.Overall, the resort is an amazing property. The lobby and lobby bar are beautiful. The best drinks are at the lobby bar! Much attention has been paid to detail throughout the resort. The grounds are so extensive and all very well kept, but the resort is massive. It is a lot of walking to get from any one area to another. The shuttle buses were always a welcome site, especially at the end of the day! Also with the size comes the number of rooms. With in the three resorts that comprize the complex there are approx 1500 rooms and they are still building more. It really felt as though you were in a small town. My husband and I really learned on this trip that we prefer the smaller resorts and their more personalized attention to detail.All in all, we had a wonderful time at this resort but are sad to say that we would not return, prefering to try another resort, perhaps the Excellence or Paradisus when we return to Punta Cana.
