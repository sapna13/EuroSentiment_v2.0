{"text":"good hotel if you get a deal Rack rates for this hotel are $250-350. At that price I might have been a little disappointed. But we got our room as part of a package deal for about $100\/ night. At that price, it is a great hotel. The rooms are well decorated--quirky but stylish. Our room was a basic king room. It was a little small, but not terrible. We were facing the courtyard (really just a typical urban building air shaft but significantly perked up with a nice mural of a country scene). This kept down traffic noise, but we were surprised by relatively loud noise in the courtyard every morning. They have quality toilettries (Aveda) and offer lots of things for free (hair dryer, robes, toothpaste, fan, other little things you might forget or not be able to pack). The sheets and bed were very comfortable. Towels were average, pretty soft, but not luxurious. It had the usual over-priced mini-bar. They would have done better to provide a bottle of water and neat local snack for free upon arrival, to fit with the quirky we're different and better Kimpton hotel chain brand image. They have a free nightly wine reception in the lobby with a local Washington red and white and thin crust pizzas. This was a nice touch. If you like to socialize with other guests, this is a great opportunity to do so. But if you prefer to hang off to the side with your friends, that was fine too. The concierge runs the wine tasting and is very helpful with ideas on restaraunts and things to do. The service was fine. No compliants. But no amazing kudos either. Check in and out were smooth. The valet service was usually pretty prompt, but they did forget to get our car once and we sat around for a while before we realized they were not getting it (note that valet is about $35\/day with taxes, not including gratuity. This may be higher than some other hotels, but it was very convenient). We were a little disappointed that we got no upgrade or special treatment since we were on our honeymoon, but maybe that's all one can expect when they come on a budget package! Housekeeping was certaintly adequate. The place was spotless when we arrived. Daily cleaning was thorough. I would have expected turndown service at a place this nice, but we did not get it. I would also recommend they implement in-room coffee makers. There are coffee shops on virtually every corner in Seattle, and free coffee service (via small paper thimbles in the lobby), but in room coffee makers are so convenient. The location is excellent. You can easily walk to the waterfront\/ pike place market area. We walked to the space needle and to restaurants at the south-end of Green Lake without feeling like we had hiked too far. There are many great restaurants and classy bars within a few blocks. Also great shopping within a few blocks. It has super easy access to I-5. I recommend the associated restaraunt (Tulio) for breakfast. We had two interesting Italian themed egg dishes. We had dinner there once too. it was good, but there are loads of good restaurants within walking distance. Overall, a good but not great hotel. If you can get a deal, go for it. Paying rack, there may be better options out there.
