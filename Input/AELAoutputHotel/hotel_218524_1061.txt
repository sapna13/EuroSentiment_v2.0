{"text":"excellente wow we just returned last night and we had such a great experience that i wanted to get this review in right away, we stayed at the resort from june 5th until the 12th, and were married on the beach june 7th. i will try to break down our stay. we had read about the ride from the airport and yes it was long and our bus was small and had 8 people, the driver did not say one word to us the whole way to the resort and the roads were a little curvy and i didnt feel so well during the drive but the view along the way was worth it. once we arrived we recieved cool towels and champagne. we were taken to the excellence club for a private check in (the excellence club was worth every penny) you have a private club house where you can go for drinks, snacks, internet service and a beautiful balcony which my husband loved to sit and sip on his stolys and grapefruit juice. once checked in we were taken to our room which was a ex club honeymoon suite and it was beautiful. if i could say only one thing i wasnt happy with at first was the view. we thought we would be looking at the ocean and technically you are but through the pool and some trees. i guess that is how all the builidings are on this end we were in #14 but our room number was 15005. i got over that very quickly after seeing everything else in the room. the maid we had was so nice everyday we left her a small gift and some money with a note at no time did we feel we had to tip anyone but we felt for everything that was done and the way everyone was so friendly and worked so hard we wanted to show our appreciation  the pool was just awesome we floated around there for hours, we only ventured to the ocean once for a walk. as for the meals my husband loved everything, myself i was nervous to try somethings and kept to my comfort zone. our favorites were the french and itailan resturants. we were married there on june 7th and wendy our wedding coordinator was great. i felt so relaxed and even had my hair done at the spa. they did a wonderful job i was so happy. i was comfortable at night but my husband was eaten alive alot so after the first night he would only were pants once it got dark. they had an eveing show each night it reminded me of being on a cruise ship i loved the dancers and enjoyed each night. our favorite bar and bartender was JUNIOR at the martini bar. he would see us coming and have our drinks ready and was so friendly and accomidating with any need we had.  i do have to mention the vendors as i do not blame the resort at all but the vendors who come to the resort at night hike prices so much. we had fortunately been off site to see some items before seeing the onsite vendors and i am glad we did. ex: one inside vendor told us $52 us dollars for an item we had purchased for $5 us dollars at the offsite vendor. when we told him this he then told us we could give him $10. so my only advice is to go to the offsite vendors we went to 2 out of the 8 huts. we did do to nancys which everyone mentions on this site and got a great deal buy you must stick to your guns and we went to hut 8 ( i think) we did buy some great things but you have to be willing to shop around also. if you have any questions for my please feel free to email me i have so much to say and i dont want to go on more than i have the staff at the resort was so nice always saying Hola and when asked how you were always said Excellente the excellence club took such good care of us and made us feel special everytime we walked in. we will definetly go there again ","annotations":[{"endOffset":633,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":629},{"endOffset":677,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":673},{"endOffset":677,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":673},{"endOffset":724,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":720},{"endOffset":944,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":940},{"endOffset":1813,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":1806},{"endOffset":3444,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":3440}]}
