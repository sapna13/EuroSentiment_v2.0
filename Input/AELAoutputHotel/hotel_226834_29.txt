{"text":"Great Hotel for the price I stayed here twice during the month of August. The first time I stayed the experience was really great and much better than expected.The second stay was great except for check in. We had requested a specific room (same room as the time before since we loved the size of the room and noticed it was larger than most of the other rooms) and were promised it, but when it came time to check in the room wasn't available even though we had just called the night before checking in and had been told it was still confirmed for that room.The woman at the front desk was very rude during this whole ordeal and not very helpful at all. They had us inspect 2 rooms and were told we would have to settle since nothing that we were pleased with would be available. Finally another woman came in and was much more courteous and was able to accommodate us.They are apparently doing remodeling of some of the rooms and be warned, each room is very different!! Our first room was very large and had a great bathroom! It also had a full length mirror. Our second room was a decent size at best and the bathroom was okay, but the water pressure was terrible and also had very bad water temperature control. There wasn't a full length mirror and the sink was located outside of the bathroom. The sink wasn't terrible since it had counter space the first didn't have but just a difference I noticed. The corner rooms that have an actual view are much larger than the rooms located in the middle rooms that look out onto a wall.Overall though, both of the rooms were very clean and well kept. The location was great since we were only a couple of blocks from Union square and for the price it was worth it. Also the breakfast muffins were very good! They disappeared quickly though and if you didn't make it down before 9 am they were all gone!They did have complimentary wireless internet in the lobby of the hotel and a computer for guest use also.Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again. The price for the location and service can't be beat!
