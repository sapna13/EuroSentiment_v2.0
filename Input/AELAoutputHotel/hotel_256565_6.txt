{"text":"Excellent Hotel When I was reviewing around for hotels in Sydney city, I found that they were all not very cheap (probably as Sydney is the most popular city in Australia). I called a few hotels in Sydney and the cheapest I found for a triple share room was another hotel that was going for $AUD180 a night. I decided to go with Hyde Park Inn which was $AUD192.50 a night for triple share as the location and quality seemed better from the reviews that I read.The great thing about Sydney is the airport is not too far away from the city, so it didn't cost that much for a cab to\/from the hotel. The hotel is centrally located in the CBD and when we arrived, they upgraded us from the triple share room to the family studio for no extra charge! (The front desk staff looked at the 3 of us with all our luggage and decided we deserved a bigger room! How lovely).The family studio was awesome, a balcony overlooking the lovely green Hyde Park, a fully equipped kitchenette with stove, microwave, and cooking utensils and comfy bathroom. We had a nice big TV, plenty of space, and 3 beds; a double and two singles. We also had a big sofa which was probably a bed made to look like a sofa, so it could've been a bed comfortably. So a family of five could've fit nicely with no problems.There was a 7-Eleven just outside the hotel (you don't even need to cross a street) so we bought eggs and cooked ourselves breakfast in the morning. Also they give you a free breakfast but they actually stock it in your room so you don't need to go down to their restaurant to dine! They provided milk, juice, bread slices, cereal and your basic tea and coffee all in the comfort of your own room! Some relatives came to visit us in our room and we ordered pizza in and had plenty of space to fit everyone in. We even had a little dining table in our room. Location was excellent, right in the middle of the city and facing the lovely park. We walked everywhere we needed to get to, there are public payphones and bus stops just in front of the hotel, and lots of places to eat. Staff weren't the most friendly but honestly we loved Sydney and our room too much to notice! Their internet service seemed a bit expensive when we asked about their in-room rates, so they recommended their cheaper option which was to go to their business centre and use the internet there (if I'm not mistaken it was about $AUD5 per session at the business centre). Connection speed was great, you can use one of their computers in the business centre or plug your own laptop in. They also had a printer if you needed to use one. Obviously we were so happy to receive the upgrade, but it still was the most expensive hotel we stayed at throughout our trip (Our trip lasted 17 days, we stayed at 3 locations in Queensland and one in Melbourne, all at an average of AUD$165 a night). Nevertheless, it WAS the nicest hotel we stayed at throughout our trip. I don't suppose accommodation in Sydney is very cheap anyway so it really was worth the money, but I can't help but think that 5-star hotels in Malaysia are so much cheaper than Australia.
