{"text":"Feel at home in the Nadia Hotel I just returned from a wonderful trip to Amsterdam, many of my fondest memories include the Nadia Hotel. Our decision to book at theNadia had much to do with the competitive rates, but mostly the glowing reviews. The Nadia Hotel lived up to every wonderful thing we have read. The staff is warm, friendly and accomodating. The owner, Osam is special in his own right. He makes you feel as though you are the only guest and your happiness and comfort is his priority. He adds personal touches similar to what you would experience in a bed and breakfast. My favorite memory of Osam is being invited to the kitchenas he made me a pot of coffee 2 hours before breakfast even began. We had many fantastic conversations with Osam that again, are as memorable as Amsterdam itself.The past reviews have mentioned the stairs, yes there is a bit of a climb which before arrival, we worried about, however, the anticipation far exceeded the reality. We saw guests young, old and even disabled climb the stairs to reception - use your judgement based on your own physical capabilities.There was a specific review mentioning room 316, that it was small, dirty, with an odor. I had the PLEASURE of staying in room 316. It was cozy, bright, clean and perfect as far as Im concerned. Im confused to even read such a review. Why would anyone care if the rooms are small in a city like Amsterdam? The only quality time spent in the hotel, was not the room, it was dining in the lovely breakfast room or at reception having wonderful chats with the staff and Osam.I look forward to returning to my new second home at the Nadia Hotel.If you decide to book a reservation, I can say with certainty that you made a wise decision.
