{"text":"Extremely Dissatisfied This was my first trip to Puerto Rico and it was great except for the hotel. The Diamond Palace Hotel and Casino was absolutely by far the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in. I guess the $89 a night that I paid was probably the reason that it was horrible. I guess that saying is true when they say You get what you pay for. First of all upon check-in the hotel staff failed to inform me of a certain amount of money they charge to your card as a hold in case of anything like damage to the room, charges applied etc. I booked thru hotels.com and in the confirmation I received didnt say anything of the sort either. However the amount supposedly that they are supposed to hold is about $200 at the most but apparently the incompetent staff member charged my debit card for $550 in error. This really put a damper on my spending while on vacation because I didn't know that this was deducted till one day that I took money out of the ATM and noticed I was overdraft on my account. While I did get this squared away with the hotel, I was not satisfied in the manner that this was handled. No apology was given to me as I so deserved nor any type of consideration of my inconvenience was showed even by the manager. She just shrugged me off like I was taking too much of her precious time. They didnt even cover any of my overdraft fees incurred by this incompetent error. I truly do not recommend this hotel to anyone.
