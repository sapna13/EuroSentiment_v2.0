{"text":"Great Hotel I am writing this review late but I wanted to put my positive review up here so this lovely hotel gets the credit it deserves. We also booked our stay at the chancellor based on the reviews in trip advisor and I must say it lived up to all expectations. I contacted Wes Tyler via e-mail during the holiday weeks to make a reservation. He was very helpful and made the process quite easy. In addition, he was kind enough to extend a special the hotel was running for an additional day, making this stay a tremendous value. In terms of the hotel itself, our room was beautifully decorated and quite comfortable. I do not look for large hotel rooms when I travel because I am not traveling to San Francisco to stay in a hotel room the entire time; I am there to see the city. That being said the rooms are clean and the hotel is well maintained. In addition, the location of this hotel is perfect. It is easily accessible to public transportation leading all over the city and to the airport. The hotel staff is very nice and there are some very nice touches that they include. The hotel provides an umbrella for your use, it was in our closet. Since it rained almost every day we were in the city this was greatly appreciated. They have fresh coffee and cookies (really good cookies!) all day and offered apples and muffins in the morning. They have two computers in the lobby that guest can utilize. My husband inquired about a firm pillow and was given a list of several different types of pillows that he could choose from. When we returned from our outing his pillows were in the room. Finally, the rubber ducky in the bathroom is a cute touch.We enjoyed our stay and we were impressed by all this hotel had to offer for such a great rate. We would certainly stay here again.
