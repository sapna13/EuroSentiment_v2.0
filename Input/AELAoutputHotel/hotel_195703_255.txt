{"text":"Very comfortable, well located, clean hotel We booked this hotel for our recent stay in Florence based on reviews and mentions in various travel guides. It is in a very central location, within walking distance of every must-see site in the core city of Florence. The proprietors were indeed welcoming and very helpful with arrangements at museums and restaurants. A laptop computer is available for guests for e-mail messaging.The rooms are located on the second floor, eliminating any street traffic congestion. Our room was rather dark as the exterior shutters did not open. During our stay, construction was ongoing in the next courtyard but they did not begin until 8 a.m. and we were not in the room during the day. Space in the room was tight, but there was a slice of an entry room between the bedroom and the bathroom that was equipped with writing desk. We stored our luggage and other items in that space, freeing up more in the bed area. The marble tiled bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom area and was equipped with a bath  shower combo and a separate shower as well as toilet, sink, bidet and towel warmer rack. The bathroom was sparkling clean. Breakfast is included and the breakfast table and hours are presided over by either the proprietress or the breakfast major-domo who managed the flow of food with an eagle eye.We were only two but during our stay we encountered families and larger groups that the hotel and staff seemed to accomodate very easily. This is a comfortable, safe and clean place, very convenient at a reasonable price.
