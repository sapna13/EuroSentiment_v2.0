{"text":"Great Honeymoon! My wife and I had a great time on our honeymoon at Dreams Punta Cana. Our trip was from 9\/28\/08 √à√\u2020\u2022?10\/5\/08. Check in was very fast and immediately taken to our room, which was room 1108. It was a swim out Master Suite in Building 1. The grounds looked great! Everything was very clean and we would constantly see people cleaning. The trip from the airport was very rough! But it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother us because we were expecting it. Your on Vacation just have fun with it!! You first need to realize that you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e traveling to a Third World Country. If you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like the idea of that then you need to book your trip somewhere else! It really helped that we read a little bit about the Dominican Republic before we went. As far as the food goes, we ate and drank whatever we wanted all week long and our stomachs never turned. Most Dominicans only cook in fruit and oil. They don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ use many spices. So a lot of the food will be a little plain tasting. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat much seafood except for some Mahi Mahi in the Japanese Restaurant, so I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know if that would have made us sick or not. Our favorite place to eat was Himitsu. You can either sit down and have Chinese or tell them you want Japanese. That√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ where they will cook in front of you. We ate at the World Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ everyday for breakfast and lunch and that is where the food was a little more plain. But not to bad! We liked all of the other restaurants. The only place we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat was the Seaside grill, but it looked pretty good. The bars were great! We never had to wait for drinks at all. Our room was across from the Pool Bar and we loved it. They were never shy on the alcohol at all. They will give you as much as you want. We do however like to tip according to service. The service was great, so we tipped quite a bit. Just a couple of bucks here and there will do. When we tipped they would remember us and help us the rest of the week. Our drinks rarely went dry! All of the staff would try their best to take care of us!We did see a big spider. Could have been a Tarantula but we weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ sure. It was huge! The workers killed it after we took a few pictures of it! You have to remember you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e in the tropics!!! No sense in dwelling on a spider!! We were very worried about going to the resort after reading the reviews, but we had an amazing time and can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ wait to go back soon!! My mom and her friends are going to Dreams Punta Cana in November and they have been very worried also. But we told them to go, and we know they will have a great time. The Entertainment team was great and put on great shows every night. We went to almost all of them.We did walk out of the gate of the resort, took a right and walked about 10 minutes to a plaza and went shopping. No one ever bothered us. They just wanted us to buy stuff from them. We knocked the prices down about $100 - $150 dollars in every store. But got some nice stuff! If you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to go out of the resort, they did let some vendors set up tables 2 nights out of the week we were there.Your trip is what you make of it. Again, remember where you are going. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a Third World Country!! But the Resort is Awesome and very clean. After going there we now think a lot of the reviews are a bit ridiculous. You are in the Caribbean!!! If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e looking for something wrong you will find it no matter what the circumstances are. We hope you have a Great Trip!! We can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ wait to go back to Dreams!! (Hopefully Next Year).
