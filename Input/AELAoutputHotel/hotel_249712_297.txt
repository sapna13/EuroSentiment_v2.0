{"text":"An honest level-headed review I have stayed in many hotels in New York and around the world. As I see it hotels can be divided into three groups: (1) hotels where you feel like you get what you pay for, (2) hotels where you feel like you had a truly special experience, and (3) hotels where you feel like you have been robbed. Now just because you spend $400 a night and a bowl of name-brand cereal costs $10 does not mean you are being robbed. A good hotel will give you the service, presentation and comfort that $400 a night and a $10 bowl of cereal warrants (e.g. some of the hotels run by St. Regis, Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton). Other hotels, like your average Holiday Inn or Best Western, give you what you pay for (a wholly average experience). The Westin at Times Square sadly fits into the third category - a hotel that is simply not worth the money you pay and will leave you feeling like you are the victim of extortion. If you do choose to stay here make sure you stay in a room ending in the number 9 - these are the best rooms and surprisingly a middle category of room type - a deluxe. Whatever you do - do not stay in a junior suite - they are small (the pictures on the website are completely misleading) and they are fairly unattractive. Why is this hotel average? The service simply does not live up to its price category. To be fair to the hotel, they try, but the hotel is simply too large to make anyone feel as if they have had a personalized experience - and at more than $500 a night (you will pay an average of about $60-$100 extra in taxes and charges above your room rate) it is simply not worth it. There are no chocolates on your bed, fresh fruit in a basket or free bottles of champagne. There is maid service once a day and they do not do anything like fold your clothes or turn down the bed at night. The room service offers four star restaurant prices with a corner deli quality of food product - the closest you an come to getting anything truly satisfying is ordering a $6 cup of Starbucks coffee. What becomes blatantly obvious at a hotel like the Westin Times Square is that the hotel is willing to trade profit for customer satisfaction - unfortunately because the hotel is on one of the busiest (and unattractive) intersections in New York it is not likely that the hotel will learn its lesson anytime soon - and what lesson is that? - that the hotel business is a service industry and nothing in a service industry is more important than a loyal customer. This hotel could not care less whether you come back - maybe that's because they know you won't. All that being said, if you are a business person who will be staying at a hotel on corporate dollar and you will be spending your days outside of the hotel and you need a central location and for the most part you want to be left alone - book a room here ending in the number 9 on a high floor and you will be happy - I promise.Yours truly,World Traveler ","annotations":[{"endOffset":509,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":502},{"endOffset":617,"mention":"Four Seasons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Four_Seasons_Restaurant"],"startOffset":605},{"endOffset":1651,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1641},{"endOffset":2032,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2026}]}
