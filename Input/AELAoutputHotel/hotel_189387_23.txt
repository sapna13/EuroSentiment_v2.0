{"text":"Mosquito bites everywhere!!! We liked this hotel very much despite a few problems. Front desk staff friendly and helpful. Their business center had 2 computers with free internet access, and there is a 3rd one in the lobby area. There are lots of cozy nooks so if you're looking for a quiet area to be alone and read, talk with a mate, or for an area to play with small kids, this hotel is great for that too. The buffet breakfast was awesome! Location also very good, as previous posts have mentioned. Ten to fifteen minute walk to the Dam, 5 minutes to Ann Frank House (get tickets online or you'll wait FOREVER TO GET IN!!!). We had canal view rooms, and it was spectacular to see boats going by all the time. I have 3 complaints- the air conditioning was substandard, we awoke with dozens of bug bites because we had the window opened during the night one one of our nights, and even when it was closed, they must've still been in our room, and still awoke with dozens of bites the next morning. Thirdly, the bed is too small for two people. The comforter is so thick, it took the place of another person when you put it aside. Asked for a thinner blanket and they responded without issue. The cookies they leave in the room are quite nice, as is the turn town evening service with chocolates. Front desk recommended Long Pura for indonesain rice table meal and it was fantastic. Just around the corner from the hotel on Rosengracht. I can also recommed Amigos, an argentine steak house that was excellent and reasonably priced., also on Rosengracht. Skip the Tulip Museum just up the street from the hotel- waste of time.
