{"text":"Everything was good! I stayed at one of the suites which facing the pool. Nice view from the room. When I checked in, a lady called Aki at the reception was very polite and handle my requests very well. My suite was cleaned and comes with the welcome fruits and a box of chocolate! Bravo to the management for the little thought!I went to the spa in the afternoon and couldn't locate the spa meant for hotel guests, not the spa for massage or beauty salon. An Indian public area cleaner approached me and shown me the way to the hotel spa. This is what we call SERVICE! I have been staying in many luxury hotels and this is my first experience in this property. The treatment that I received from this Indian gentleman definitely will make me want to return to this hotel in the future.The negative side of this hotel is the club lounge. Staffs were not friendly and practised double standards. When I arrived at the 22nd flloor where their club lounge located, I couldn't locate it. When I got out from the lift, it is their reception area. No greetings or no approach from the staffs there to offer assistance until I approach them. When I went in to the lounge, a chinese lady came and approached us to offer drinks. I do enjoyed the evening snacks served and the view from the lounge. No one cleared the plates when we have finished our snacks. Therefore, I just put it aside on my table. There were only 4 tables occupied at that time and four staffs were on duty. Then, my friend from UK came and joined me for evening cocktails. The same lady came and asked for drinks order. She then only cleared all empty plates. I just felt it is discriminating Asians. Anyway, the service rendered by your public area gentleman recovered the unpleasant experience.Hope the management will look at their club lounge staff's attitude and I shall be back and try the club facilities again.
