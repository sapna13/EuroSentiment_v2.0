{"text":"Try the mamajuana! its fantastic! My girlfriend and I just returned from the warmth of Punta Cana, We stayed at the LTI resort and Beach club in Punta Cana. I will get right to the point, the rooms are definately nothing to write home about, there were parts of the ceiling missing, cracks in the tile shower, the TV rarely worked and it you attempted to fix it you received a shock. Somehow a lizzard became a roommate of ours, it didnt cause problems but Ive never had one in my room before. Another thing I found odd is that they come to fumigate your room during your stay at least once, although you may be tempted to tell them to wait, I was surprised at the dead bugs I found in the room before the maid had a chance to clean them up after fumigation. That part aside the resort itself is very nice, very lush with big beautiful trees, shrubs etc. all throughout the ground, The pool is great, the beach is awesome, there are plenty of chairs but if you want one under a hut get up early, they are the first to go. The food end was average, although we never did try the a-la-carte' resturants which are included, the buffett offers something for everyones taste 3 times a day. Drinks are awesome, there is a wide variety and the beer is very good. One thing I would say was a draw back for sure would be the folks from the Ceyna Beach club, which shares the main resort grounds with the LTI. They set up at the only entrance to the Buffet dining area and are quite pushy to entice you to visit the resort. Basically similar to timeshare things at other resorts but these guys harp you 3 times a day, every day. I had one guy literally chase after me one day because the night before I made the mistake of saying maybe tomorrow. Tell them NO and keep walking, they should get the point after a couple days.If you are looking for a place with other Canadians presesnt there, this may not be the one for you. Lots, and lots of German people, many other Europeans. A little different when you are used to mexico.Overall, the 4 star rating this hotel has would be accurate in my opinion. We had a wonderfull time and for the price we paid, we got more than our moneys worth.*Try the mamajuana, its fantastic* ","annotations":[{"endOffset":141,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":137},{"endOffset":1347,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1343}]}
