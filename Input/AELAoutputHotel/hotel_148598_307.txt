{"text":"Westin Rio Mar - Average at Best My husband and I recently returned from a 1 week stay at Westin Rio Mar. My husband had a 4 day conference and we stayed on for 3 vacation days. Because it was for a conference, we didn't have a choice in staying there. Based on reviews here, the location and the amenities offered, I honestly would not have selected this resort and after a 1 week stay, I would not recommend this resort to others.First things first, many people have stated and people still seem to be surprised so I will repeat it, the resort is a 30 minute drive from San Juan and it can take up to 1 hour if there is traffic. If you don't rent a car, you will be stuck at the resort and subject to poor service and average, overpriced food. The positives:- I found the concierge helpful, particularly with off-site restaurant recommendations, the common areas of the resort are nice and I enjoyed the quiet pool. The gym has decent equipment and the preplaced towel and water bottle at each machine is a nice touch. Staff in the gym and spa were helpful and attentive. I had a swedish massage and thought it was great. While I wasn't particularly impressed with the beach, others in our group did enjoy it. It was particularly windy while we were there and the red flags, indicating rough\/dangerous water, were up most of the time. The negatives- maybe I haven't noticed this at other resorts- but the $39\/day resort service fee seemed a bit steep, particularly when you still have to pay for golf, tennis, spa treatments and excursions as well as the $30 room tax . We did not have a problem getting reservations the 2 times we ate dinner at Palio's and Aqualuna. We thought the food was average and the pricing was okay at these restaurants. Service was slow and not particulary attentive. Service was particulary bad\/slow\/inattentive and I did have a problem with food quality, selection and pricing at Marbella and Club Coqui. Marbella's is the restaurant that serves breakfast and the staff really push the buffet, which I found to be average. The a la carte menu has a decent selection of standard breakfast items- but seriously, $6.00 for a small bowl of oatmeal?? $4.00 for 1 Dannon yogurt?? $5.50 for a bowl of Cornflakes?? We had to repeatedly ask for drinks It was not unusual to wait at least an hour for our food to be served after we had ordered at Coqui or by the pool. I was willing to overlook the negatives listed above, until the real negative emerged. The one that still grosses me out and was the absolute deal breaker for me is that there are in fact bed bugs. I had read about this in advance, but did not believe until several people in our group had to be moved to other rooms and the hotel began to exterminate. Unfortunately, on the last morning of our trip, my husband and I both woke up covered in bites. I've never had this happenTwo years ago, I stayed at the Wyndham El Conquistador, which is about 20 minutes further on Rt.3. It was it's drawbacks- it's huge, requires a funicular to get to different areas of the resort and the beach is a ferry ride away, but I wouldrecommend the El Conquistador over the Westin for sure.
