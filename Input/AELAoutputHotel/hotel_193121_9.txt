{"text":"Not a five star hotel I really don't know who writes these reviews. I have been to many hotels around the world and this is certainly not a five star hotel!First of all when we entered the hotel, the floor was squeaking, first time for me in the hotel experience. When we entered our room I gave the man who accompanied us a big tip and told him to empty the mini-bar which he promised to do but didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ, in fact I never saw him again during our stay.The room was very small for the price we paid which was 550$ a night! and seeing that this hotel is very small by itself I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know how it got a five start rating! Maybe a five star in the small hotel category.The curtains and the bed covering all smelled nasty like they never been washed before and when I tried to take a shower, the shower head fell on me!! And then when I tried to turn the sink faucet one of its parts dropped in my hand!To add to my surprise, the bed was very small!! A queen size which was only about 4 feet wide which barley was enough for me and my wife, we each had 2 feet to sleep in! you cannot turn in this bed unless you want to find yourself on the floor and you wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want that seeing that there are some ants on it!!One plus thing to say about the hotel is that the staff was very friendly, but wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ you expect that from a five star hotel anyway? Actually I am used to very friendly staff in 3 star hotels in other parts of the world.Overall, it is a good location to stay in, very safe and quite with lots of shopping areas and Kensington park just across the street, if you have enough money, it is better go for the bigger rooms.One last thing, we stayed in room 401, please avoide it!
