{"text":"Nice hotel! We booked this hotel having pored over the many reviews of many hotels on Trip Advisor. We weren't disappointed. Room was huge, with two king size beds, a kitchen (with fridgefreezer, cooker, microwave  coffee machine), a nice bathroom, tv, sofa and everything we needed for a comfortable stay. All the staff were pleasant and helpful. The clubroom was nice and breakfast in there every morning was fair value at $14.95 (though watch out for the added taxes on this and everything else in the city). On 50th St it is in a perfect location, about 15 minutes to Central Park, Times Square, the Rockefeller Center, Grand Central Station and the shopping delights of 5th Avenue. In the immediate vicinity are plenty of bars, restaurants, take-aways, delis etc. We had a couple of minor gripes: 1) We had to wait 1 hour 15 minutes for our room to be ready when we arrived. After a an early start, an 8 hour flight and a then 75 minute journey from the airport it was a bit of a pain. However, and credit where credit is due, we were upgraded to a junior suite to compensate without asking. 2) Noise. We were at the rear on the 10th floor and the aircon fans were going 24\/7 below us which gave constant noise in the room. To be fair after the first night (and tiredness set in after all the walking) we didn't notice it as much. Overall, a good hotel, which I would recommend to anyone.
