{"text":"Don't be fooled by the website....Excellence is average at best I have read many positive reviews about Excellence PC, but I believe it was average at best, especially if you are into luxury travel. The ride to\/from the airport is definitely rough due to potholes, but not a problem as long as you don't get carsick easily or have a bad back. I highly recommend taking a taxi ($60) to get there MUCH quicker.Definitely bring insect repellent if biting bugs find you even remotely appetizing and use it religiously. Those buggers are everywhere, even in the beds.The service was just average. Yes, the staff is very friendly when you interact with them, but we had lots of trouble getting anyone up to the room to address problems that we had (no a\/c, clogged toilet, bugs in the bathroom, etc.) The staff is definitely on island time. If they tell you they'll be there in 20 minutes, it will be more like 45 or perhaps not at all. The rooms are okay, but not nearly as nice as they appear on the web site. Lots of those little bugs all were around my bathroom no matter how much the staff cleaned.It may be worth it for you to upgrade to the Excellence Club package. It was kind of nice to have a dedicated concierge and private pool and beach (assuming other guests respect the signs, since the staff is not there to check).Generally, we found the nightly entertainment to be lame. The shows were mostly corny lipsynching of American pop songs. The beaches were beautiful--Groomed daily and it was fun and generally safe to go waist deep and enjoy the waves. If you like to SCUBA, be prepared for a 1.5 hour trip the the west side of the island which has much calmer waters.Coming from someone who has been to several all-inclusives, the food here was just average. Really, there was just nothing special about it. Agave was the best place we went to. The drinks were fantastic at all of the bars. There is very little opportunity to go outside the resort to learn about dominican culture. We did the bike tour and found it very boring (passed nothing but more resorts.) We really enjoyed the tennis lessons, ping pong, and spa treatments.Lastly, my husband got very sick and was up all night with vomit and diarreah and spent 1.5 days in the Punta Cana Central hospital. It turned out to be a parasite which we believe he got from the portobello mushrooms at Chez Isabelle. We when got back to the hotel, we realized that he got a hernia from vomiting so much and will likely need surgery in the U.S. I do not think this is neccessarily a problem with the hotel, but just a general risk that you run when going to any country with lower health standards. However, it may comfort you to know that the medical staff at the hotel and the hospital were professional and attentive, and they took our U.S. insurance.Bottom line, if you are into high end travel, with top notch cuisine and really attentive service, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive all inclusive and are not considered delicious by biting insects, then it's worth a shot.
