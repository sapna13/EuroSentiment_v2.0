{"text":"Hauty, dreary Baglioni This hotel is a typical example of dark and somber city-center Florence. The lobby reception area is very dark and dreary. Our bedroom room was spacious, clean and aside from the few dimly lit wall sconces, there was not a single piece of art in the room. The king sized bed linens were crisp and clean though rather stiff, The bed was hard as a rock and definitely in need of a mattress replacement. The conjoined twin mattresses displayed body depressions from years and years of use. The best piece of furniture within the room was a beautiful, giant cherry wood armoire which contained ample space and a valuables' safe. The bathroom was large and well lit containing a toilet, bidet and very large tube shower combination. The towels were large, soft and fluffy. Modest toiletries were also supplied. Huge, interior wooden shutters over lovely stained glass windows which were also enclosed with outside shutters so completely block out sunlight that you could sleep till noon if you chose. The tall ceilings display wooden rafters. Interactive, digital television also offers internet and movies for purchase. The formal breakfast room located on the fifth floor provides a fabulous view of the city. It is attended with much fanfare by several formally dressed waiters who seat you, change table linens, bus tables and serve the coffee or tea. Sadly, the daily breakfast is mostly pre-packaged, bland and disappointing considering the amount of formal table settings and pompous waiters who spend the majority of their time animatedly chatting amongst themselves. In general, the hotel staff is haughty and minimally attentive to all their patrons who are predominately international tourists.
