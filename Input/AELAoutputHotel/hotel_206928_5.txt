{"text":"Great area, but you can do better We stayed at the Citadines apartment hotel in Barcelona in February 2008. I booked this hotel at the last minute as the apartment I rented with VBRO had a fire and was not available. Booking was easy and we rented an apartment for 1-4 persons, at 225.00 euros per day for a 5 night stay. This is more than an regular apartment would cost, but I was booking at the last minute and wanted the ease of a hotel with apartment convenience. The apartment is laid out nicely, with step-out large balcony with large sliding glass door. The bedroom is good size and has a sliding door to the living room\/kitchen\/dinning area. So when the bedroom area is open it gives you a spacious feeling. The bathroom is spacious but shows stains around the faucets. In fact the room is very worn, cigarette burns on the rug, tired out looking furniture, we could not connect our IPOD to the older TV, so we could not view US movies that we brought. The hotel has free internet in the business center. This hotel is located right on the Ramblas 122, and in the middle of everything. Since it was February I figured that it wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be too frantic and noisy on the Ramblas at that time of the year. The Ramblas was busy, but you are in the middle of everything, across from a grocery store and down a few steps from the famous market Sant Joseph market. The Bari Gotic is diretly behind the hotel so we could walk to all the sites, and we were able to walk to the Placa Reial and the restaurant La Fonda late and we did not have to wait in the long line to get a table. Taxis stopped right in front of the hotel, and the Placa de Catalunya is a 10 minute walk, where you can find the Bus Turistic, buses to the airport and the metro. The major problem was the noise from the small square park-like area behind the hotel; this is also a street that is one of the entrances to the Gothic area. There were 2 caf√ã√\u2022√ñ√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ that stayed open late and the noise drifted up as well as the cigarette smoke to our room. But the absolute worse was the hippie type homeless people and their barking dogs that hung out in the park all night long. There were a few mentally ill homeless people who would scream randomly at night. Because the buildings were tall the noise traveled up to our 6th floor apartment. The air-conditioning was not on yet, but the room was stuffy so we were opening and closing the window all night long. We almost checked out early, but the convenience of the location and the fact that I had already booked this as my 2nd choice we just stayed. We live in a urban city area so our tolerance for city noise is very high. Plus side: We could walk out see some sites, come back rest, have a bathroom break and go back out again, that is a plus when you are doing all the tourist things. Having the kitchen was very nice for us, as we shopped at the market and could eat snacks and a meal in our apartment. But for the price I can not recommend this apartment-hotel. If you are looking for a hotel you can definitely do better. If you are looking for an apartment you can find better on line and cheaper on line. ","annotations":[]}
