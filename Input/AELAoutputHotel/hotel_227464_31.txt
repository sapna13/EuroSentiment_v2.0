{"text":"Fantastic Hotel in central Barcelona My family and I have just returned from a two night stay at the Hotel Regina in Barcelona at the end of our holiday in Spain. We had requested a family room (two girls aged 10 and 5) which they were able to provide on the first floor. Our room was very clean and modern with dressing gowns\/slippers for all of the family which the kids loved. The room was very modern and very cool thanks to the great air con. The room was also tidied during our stay and the beds made up (properly) and the bathroom cleaned. We had quite a big bathroom and a separate shower with constant hot water. The hotel was very quiet and no street noise even though we were at the front of the hotel.On the first night we received complimentary champagne and chocs which was a fabulous start to our stay.We got the bus from Barcelona airport (very cheap at 4 euros per person) right to Catalunya square. The girl at the hotel told us to look out for FNCB which was at the corner of the street where the hotel was situated so it was easy to spot. The location of the hotel was great and was handy to pop back to for a rest during the day if needed! The hotel had 3 computers with free internet access which was great. The staff at reception, bar area and the restaurant were extremely helpful with every request we had. We had breakfast there which was very fresh and with plenty of choices to suit everyone.This was our first trip to Barcelona and we really enjoyed it and we will definitely return and stay at Hotel Regina again!!
