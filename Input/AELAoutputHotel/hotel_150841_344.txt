{"text":"Unforgettable I'll try to keep this short......Security: Awesome. They are alway there, but not in your face way. We were eight lucky ladies living life...and even our late..late..late night walks on the beach they were present.Money: Bring a lot of ones ($50..was not enough) They are hard working and even though this is all inclusive, we felt they went out of their way to keep up happy. We left some small gifts for our housekeeper (perfume, soaps, jewerly) and a tip...she was very happy and went out of her way to keep us in order.Casino: Us ladies do like to play cards...so we hit the casino for some slots and blackjack. It's small...but we had fun. If you are looking for vegas dealers...or sometimes even a small..you are not going to find it here. We just selected the tables where everyone was having fun and meet some fun people....unforgettable.Excursions: We all went on the Outback Safari and booked it with TNT (Poppy). It was great to see how they really live....it was very humbling. I brought along some crayons, paper, Winnie-the-pooh bandaids lollipops..ect and left them at the school (which was one of the stops) So if you think you want to do this and you have extra room...load up...it was great to see the smiles and know that you helped. Also, you should know, that giving gifts to the children on the streets is illegal. They don't want the children to become beggars and if they are getting gifts on the street, they won't go to school.Food: The gourmet restaurant was TOP. Book early. We didn't have a Bad meal, but you need to remember that our American stomaches can't handle the food in the same way...bring Pepto tabs or Amodium AD...just in case...half of us had to use them. We were not really sick...just some mild problems...didn't interfere with us having a good time.Okay...that's it from usPamela ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1075,"mention":"lollipops","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Lollipop"],"startOffset":1066},{"endOffset":1075,"mention":"lollipops","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Lollipop"],"startOffset":1066},{"endOffset":1075,"mention":"lollipops","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Lollipop"],"startOffset":1066}]}
