{"text":"Awesome Vacation When we booked our vacation in late October our travel agent told us the hotel was fairly new, what she obviously did not realize is that it had'nt opened yet. When we arrived on the 10th of December it had only been opened for 3 weeks. Wow.... the reception area was amazing we were greeted with a nice drink and cool cloths. Donald had us checked into our room quite quickly. When we walked into our room we were amazed at the size and how spacious it was. The Bellman told us that we would be the first to touch anything in this room. Of course with anything new there are going to be some growing pains (at this point we expected some blunders to happen). With the few incidentals that happened to us it certainly did not affect the quality of our vacation. I will probably never be at a resort again that is this new. My Husband and I took our 2 children 13 and 10 they had the time of their lives. They could eat anytime they wanted and the slushy drinks were endless. My daughters most memorable moment was being able to eat and drink whenever she wanted, and my sons was being able to play pool. I have read many of the reviews and the funniest is the one that said you would have to have eskimo blood in order to swim in the pool, LOL. We are from Alberta Canada and we found the pool quite nice to swim in once you got in ... FYI none of us are eskimos LOL. The beach was awesome and the waves were fun to play in. We went to all but one of the restaurants (French Gourmet, our son was to young to eat there age restriction of 12 years old) . The 1st restaurant we went to was See to Sea and we were greeted by Nelson and Lisby, we told Nelson our names and he never forgot who we were greeting us by name everyday (hey Nelson I hope your Daughter liked the Air Mattress!) . The second Restaurant was the buffet everyday we went in there we were greeted with an amazing smile and spanish lessons from Elizabeth (Elizabeth you inspired me to take Spanish Lessons) we grew quite close to Elizabeth. Ronnie was an amazing waiter and of course we cant forget our little friend Neaudy - the buffet was our favorite place to go daily not only did it have a variety of foods but it had the most amazing staff. The Italian restaurant was good the staff were nice the wine (awful) I ordered a bottle off the wine menu, worth the $22 to drink a nice glass of wine and we were able to take it outside to watch the entertainment. if you like good Red Wine this is what you may have to do to. The japanesse restaurant not only had great food but also the cook was entertaining and funny (thank you for the laughs) . The steak restaurant wasnt to our fancy I beleive only our tastes (we live in Beef Country). The animation team at the resort were amazing they were there playing ping pong, board games, volly ball etc during the day, and were there to dance with you at night (Say Hi to Yan and Panoma, they are great dance teachers) One tip I have for you if you smell sewage in your room close all your sink and tub drains (we think they didnt install pea traps in the drains) once we put the stoppers in the smell went away. If you are not able to shake off the fact that all towels may not arrive everyday with the face cloths, the rooms do not get put together early in the morning, or that a light switch may fall off the wall, I would suggest another resort. If you want to eat well prepared food with lots of variety and experience amazing staff that interact with their guests than the Majestic Elegance is the resort for you.
