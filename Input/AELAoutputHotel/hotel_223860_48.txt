{"text":"Would return again! Phoenix, Az is one of the best places in the USA I have been to for relaxation, site seeing and adventure. I found the hotel location ideal and the staff extremely friendly and ready to assist, with genuine concerns. The reception desk staff was very friendly and quick, the room service was timely, valet parking staff was quick and pleasant and queries on my bill was handled professionally and without hassle.The Spa is just about the best thing at this hotel. It is a must visit for all. I had the ultimate package and my four different therapists were all great (Ask for Daniel from Sweden to do your massage). Lunch at the spa bistro was healthy but tasty (a very good combo) - do try the crab timbale and organic roasted chicken. I do not complain about prices for in-room dining or at the restaurants at hotels, because we all know they are more than usual, so there is no need to complain. There are several options around if someone does not want to eat there. My only comment is although the service at the Meritage Steakhouse (at the golf club) was good, the food wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ the best (it was good but certainly not in the region of the cost) try instead Capital Grille - Scottsdale or Ruth's Chris Steak House - Phoenix. I would certainly go back again and I am considering a timeshare here. Do check the usual internet sites for good package deals and\/or call the hotel directly. My only complaint was that houskeeping did not replace all the items used e.g. shower cap, cotton etc. however, that was not a big issue for me.
