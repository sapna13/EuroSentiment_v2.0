{"text":"Go for the Bed, Stay for the Service We selected this Marriott's for our first trip to Dallas based upon your Tripadvisor .com feedback. A main reason that we stay at any hotel is to sleep (more or less), so the mattress and pillows etc are our top priority. Lousy sleep, lousy start to the next day. The new (we assume) Revive bedding that Marriott features in some\/all of these rooms is absolutely outstanding!! Soft but supportive, really comfortable. Select the extra feather pillows option too. Pillow talk aside, the room floorplan (Executive Suite) was very well designed; spacious and efficient. We used the AAA discount, which allowed us a suite deal. We requested a high floor in our reservation and got it. Only suggestion would be to specify the southwest side of the building to minimize or eliminate freeway noise. On the 10th floor it wasn't an issue, but down low could get noisy due to the concrete freeways in Dallas. Zero noise from adjoining rooms. HVAC kept the room pleasant, quietly. Service was outstanding, with everyone greeting us pleasantly, excellent restaurant\/bar service, and efficient housekeeping. They served a full menu in the bar after the restaurant closed, which was perfect for us due to our long days away from the hotel. The food was consistently good (great cheeseburgers). The elektronica music playing in the lobby\/restaurant was irritating, so we left a comment about that in one of the survey cards. Plenty of parking, small sundries store. They charge for broadband, which seems wrong these days, but we needed a secure connection, which rules out the local Starbucks. Overall, this hotel worked hard to make our stay pleasant and to assure our consideration should we be back in that part of Texas.
