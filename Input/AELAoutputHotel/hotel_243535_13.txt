{"text":"Friendly staff, room tried to be nice but had flaws Hotel Fusion is located in the heart of San Francisco's downtown tourist area, a couple of blocks from the cable car turnaround. We had no trouble parking (they have two passenger zones), checking in, or getting help with our luggage from the hotel staff. We booked a king bed room. The room was spacious, clean, and recently updated. There was a snack basket and stocked refrigerator in the room. Most hotels gouge you on in-room snacks but the prices here were reasonable for an urban hotel√à√\u2020\u2022?2 for a soda, for example.There were some problems with the room layout. The strangest problem was with the free wired Internet. (There is no wireless in the rooms, although we were told there was wireless in the lobby.) The Ethernet plug was next to the bed, and the desk was across the room. The front desk provided a long Ethernet cable but it still wasn't long enough to reach the desk. The only phone was also next to the bed. The bathroom was very small with a glass-enclosed shower that leaked terribly. There was almost no room to store toiletries in the bathroom.The chairs were not very comfortable.The bed was on a platform and it was very hard√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√§t basically felt like a futon bed. Not surprising for an urban hotel, the room was extremely noisy, especially with the window open. I could hear the cable cars going by half a block away, with their bells ringing, and lots of traffic noise, pedestrian noise, and police\/fire sirens. I thought this was kind of fun, but your mileage may vary.The free continental breakfast wasn't very exciting but there was a coffee stand half a block away where you could get a breakfast sandwich and espresso drinks. There were many restaurants nearby.We opted for valet parking. The hotel staff let us know that it takes about 20 minutes for the valet parking service to respond to a request to pick up or drop off a car. I would not stay in the same room again at this hotel, because of the tiny leaky bathroom and layout problems, but I liked the location and the staff, so I might consider staying in a different room.
