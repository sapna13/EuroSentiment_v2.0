{"text":"Great Vacation, But....... We stayed at the Sirenis Cocotal Beach Resort and Spa for two weeks (January 23, 2007 to February 6, 2007). I checked Trip Advisor several times for write ups on this resort. I had noticed that several comments were made to the quality of the food, so we weren't expecting 5 star. Needless to say, there was not much variety, always the same. Also, we picked up an intestinal bug the 2nd week we were there. It has taken several weeks to recover from this. We were very careful about what we ate and also didn't drink any drinks with coconut milk etc. Also, the system to book for the al e carte restaurants was horrible. You have to stand in line to book for a restaurant that probably doesn't have any openings for that evening. You can only book one reservation per day. There has to be a better system. When we did get to go the the restuarants, we noticed that there was a lot of tables empty. Also one evening when we were at the Chinese restaurant one couple walked by and our server gave them a high five and told them that they don't need reservations at that restaurant. That disturbed me, because we had to stand in line for half an hour to get the reservation.All in all the staff was 5 star, always cleaning, polite and making sure that our table was cleared, water\/wine glasses always filled etc.The beach was wonderful, we had two weeks of sunshine and spent most days on the beach.We had requested a beach front room and of course we did not get it. What we did get was a room that was the farthest from the beach as you could get. The ceiling in the bathroom was falling in and there was no shower curtain, so when you had a shower there was water everywhere. We requested to change our room and this was a headache, but persistance pays and we finally got our room changed. This seemed to be a bone of contention with several people that we talked to.We went on two excursions: one to Saona Island. With this you go on a catamaran to the Island come back by a speed boat. Great fun. We also went to Catelina Island, also by catamaran, went snorkling, then to went to a ranch for lunch and horseback riding. This was the cleanest place I have ever seen. The owner also pays a man at the Island to make sure the bathrooms are clean. Very impressed. We would definetly recommend this outing.We purchased a phone card from our travel rep., he advised that there would not be a connection charge from our room, there would only be a charge if you used the hotel phones in the lobby. One day I was trying to call home and we could not even get a line out of the room. It ended up that they had disconnected our line as they thought we had checked out. After getting our line connected again, we could not get through to Canada. I tried several times (probably 20) and no luck. We called to the hotel switchboard and asked about lines etc. Anyway on check out day we were charged $2.50 for each call. $50.00 U.S. I was not happy, you could see that the call only lasted 2 seconds and we explained that we could not get a connnection. There would be no way that I would have tried so many times if I knew that I was being charged.Don't get me wrong, all in all it was a good vacation, but I would not go back to the Sirenis but would go back to Punta Cana ","annotations":[{"endOffset":970,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":963},{"endOffset":970,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":963},{"endOffset":970,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":963},{"endOffset":2119,"mention":"ranch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ranch_dressing"],"startOffset":2114}]}
