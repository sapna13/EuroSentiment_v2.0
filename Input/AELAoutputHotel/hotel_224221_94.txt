{"text":"Quirky, charming and excellent service We spent one week here in early April - my first trip to NY (second trip for bf). Our very delayed flight from South Carolina meant we arrived very late, to be greeted on the sidewalk by charming bellhop who whisked away our bags. The reception desk staff were delightful - welcoming, jokey and still professional. They offered us a glass of wine, but when we reached our room we discovered a whole bottle of prosecco. Was that ever welcome! We then went to seek food, and got a load of recommendations for fast-fooderies within a block or so, and ate well. Our stay continued in this vein.The breakfasts were ample and delicious (but no pancakes or waffles - a bit of a disappointment). The pastries and toasted bagels were excellent (we loved the concord grape jelly), and the vast range of drink-as-much-as-you-like teas, coffees and hot and cold drinks generally was very welcome. Especially since one could return during the day, to the same room (the library\/breakfast room\/wine-zone), and top up on cakes and coffee (or whatever one fancied).Each evening at 5-ish for a couple of hours was a free wine (including more prosecco) and cheese\/nibbles feast. We took good advantage. We also took the opportunity to borrow books to read during our stay, and also borrowed a movie (on DVD) one night (that night we also got the hotel to order us in a take-away - the ultimate luxury in many ways).The hotel is really well-placed for all the mid-town sites, and a couple of minutes stroll from Grand Central (excellent oyster bar). Our whole trip to the US was 3 weeks, so after a few days in NY we used the laundry service to get some clean clothes, and this was excellent - very beautifully presented clothes were returned to us, and the cost was not excessive.I would definitely try to stay here again if returning to NY. Our bedroom was pretty small, but everything fitted, and the beds were extremely comfy. The free slippers are still going (a couple of months on), and the bathroom was well-designed. We heard no noise from other rooms. There was a little street noise (if I remember rightly, we faced onto 41st and there was construction going on opposite) but not enough to be annoying.
