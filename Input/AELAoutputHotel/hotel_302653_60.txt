{"text":"Honeymoon in Paradise We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights before heading across the island and it was magnificent! We booked a royal service suite which was a bit pricier than a regular room, but gave us access to a private lounge (with free cocktails), private pool, and a private beach area. However, the regular facilities were fantastic as well. It was ideal for anyone that wants quality time with someone special. That being said, remember that Nusa Dua itself is very secluded and totally separated from the normal daily activity of Bali. If you want to be around the buzz, then you'd be better off staying in Kuta or Seminyak. Nusa Dua is meant for traveler isolation.The service was prompt and friendly. People were available for anything that you might need. The morning buffet is extensive and quite good, but somewhat pricey. Try to get it included in the price of your stay because you won't have any other options for food in the morning, unless you want to drive into another town. Some of the reviewers had remarked about a slight odor in the rooms. I noted this before I booked and did experience this while at the hotel, but that is not the whole story. First, the odor is very slight. It is caused by condensation in the air conditioning units. Second, nearly all hotels with aircon that are near the equator will have this same problem. Overall, this was one of the most pleasant stays I've had in all my travels. ","annotations":[]}
