{"text":"Good enough Readers may wish to know that I am a diamond card holder with the Hilton group (which gives me upgrades). Furthermore my wife and I are fairly well travelled and neither of us will see 50 years old again.This hotel is more of a businessperson's resting place than a traveller's. The bedrooms are small and any more than 1 suitcase becomes a problem in terms of hanging space and space in the room for case storage. The bathroom is , for me, bizarre : built of frosted glass it affords no privacy or discretion, but the shower cubicle is great. Sound insulation to the outside of the bedroom is not brilliant , and you will hear doors slam.The hotel is well located in one of the main city centre roads and is close to most things. The outstanding Victoria shopping centre is immediately opposite, Darling Harbour is a 10 minute walk and Circular Quay,the Botanical Gardens and the Opera house about a 20 minute walk. The hotel has a really good, large gym and spa with regular classes for men and women, including a dedicated spinning room. The breakfast room is good with a reasonably good variety of food. Zeta's bar is a magnet for the young , and Saturday night is quite simply a parade of beautiful girls in refined clothing waiting to pay AUS 40 just to get in.The Executive Club room is ok, but gets very crowded at happy hour time and the food variety is boring.The general service level is high (but not in a Hong Kong way) and the Concierge desk is well managed.Would I stay there again? Difficult to beat the location, but I would want more bedoom space and a discreet loo !!
