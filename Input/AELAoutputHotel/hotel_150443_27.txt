{"text":"Good Hotel with TONS OF HIDDEN Fees Just returned for a short trip to Puerto Rico. Its a nice hotel with a very good location. There is a tiny beach which is in front of the lagoon. I booked my stay through the hotel website which said a $50 REsort credit. I have contacted Customer Service which by the way is Super Slow to respond. Not seen the Credit yet. Also, there are a lot of Hidden Charges. There is a Casino on the 2nd floor of the hotel which is really small and frankly would Just Qualify for a casino. There are two swimming pools in the two towers; I took the Lagoon view which was not really worth it. If you want to stay here, take the Ocean View which is the most expensive; otherwise its not worth staying here. BEWARE: The hotel charges a lot of Hidden Fees; besides the Taxes there are some Hotel Charges which they charge you for the Internet; which did not work; there is a Business Center where you can use the Internet. The Fine Print says that you have access to the Business Center; some fees may apply. Basically this means that you can sit in the Business Center but have to pay for everything that you do there. Its about $10 or so for first 5 mins of Internet (Did I mention that they already charge you for the Internet in the Hotel Charges Section- which does not work?) The overall hotel charges come to about 31% of the actual room rate. I think this was a little outrageous. Also, Room Service is horrible. I called for a meal; they never even bothered to show up for 1 hr and 20 mins; after which we basically left the room. The good things about this place is: Pool; Tiny Beach, location of the place. You pay for everything else including parking $22\/day, Internet. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":93,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":89}]}
