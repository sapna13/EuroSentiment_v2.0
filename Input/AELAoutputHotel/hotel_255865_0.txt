{"text":"Not the best and not a boutique hotel Stayed at the Capitol Hotel as my last stop in Australia, loved Sydney but not this hotel. It is a basic three star and the fact that it is owned by Rydges is quite surprising. Definetly not a boutique hotel unless this is the ambition. Certainly the work and transformation had not started during my stay in July.First impression was not good the reception area has a sterile youth hostel feel about it. The girl on reception was okay but no Aussie welcome. During my stay I would say some staff here where polite and friendly while others had little motivation in their job. Stayed in room 514, which was compact and comfortbale but nothing special. Bathroom very small and quite tacky.Location wise no complaints, caught the train from the airport to Central Station which is about a 10 - 15 minute journey then its just a short walk to the hotel. Capitol Square is right next to the theatre of the same name with a small shopping centre, Starbucks and Irish pub in the same block. Directly next to China Town some of which isn't that picturesque, but Darling Harbour which is brilliant is only a 15 minute walk away.Circular Quay is easy to reach either by taking the train, or a ferry from Darling Harbour which is certainly the most fun way or a good walk down George Street.Never had breakfast in the hotel instead whent along to Darling Harbour and had great meals sitting in the sunshine in one of the numerous outdoor cafes.Next time in Sydney probably will stay in Darling Harbour.
