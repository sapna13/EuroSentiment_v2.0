{"text":"Ok Hotel - People were Nice Property Location: Centrally located - 15 minute walk from train station, Duomo and Central Market. There are no elevators in the hotel and there is also a long flight of stairs before you get to the reception. So if you have a lot of luggage or heavy luggage you should take this into account.The room we had was not very large but the AC worked and we were there in October but the weather was summer-like and the AC was very necessary. As well, there were mosquitoes so we could not sleep with the windows open (plus the noise some nights gets quite loud - we had earplugs with the windows closed and could still hear). **We were told that Florence is mosquito-y in general and that it is not a problem necessarily with this hotel.There is no Internet access for guest use - but there are internet cafes nearby (5 minutes walk). You will need your passport to gain internet access in Italy (anti-terrorism laws).The bath room was small, toiletries given was very basic. The bathroom can emit and odor so remember to shut the door when u leave the hotel - and that seemed to help a lot.All in all, the hotel is very basic (from the breakfast, rooms, bathrooms etc.), but the central location and helpful front desk people were great. I think this hotel is especially perfect for those of the mindset that the hotel is just a place to sleep in - you are not looking for luxury just the basic comforts and helpful front desk personnel.
