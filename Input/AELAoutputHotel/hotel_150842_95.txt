{"text":"Can I go back yet!? Check-in: Very smooth. We were greeted with big smiles and a warm welcome from the front desk staff along with a fruit drink sent over from the Lobby Bar. Nice touch.Room: Large, clean, comfortable. I am more than a little bit of a germophobe and I felt the rooms were very well kept. We were never short on beverages from the mini bar. Hotel: Amazingly beautiful grounds, pool and beach. Everything was kept positively immaculate. There were always staff members out and about to maintain a beautiful and relaxing environment. Lots of different areas to sit, relax and have a drink.Food: We ate mostly at the buffet because my husband loved it so much. We did eat at the Mexican restaurant and the Rock Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ √à√\u2020\u2022?both were of the same quality as what you would find at the buffet, just different selections. There was a huge variety and although as a norm I dislike buffet restaurants however I did find plenty to eat and never went hungry. I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ say to choose this resort for its gourmet dining, but in my opinion I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ look for an all inclusive resort for fine dining regardless. I did however notice that there were perhaps not a lot of options for those who choose to follow a vegetarian diet although it certainly could be done. My favorite thing to eat was the build your own nachos at the beach grill. Yum! Overall, the food was good and there was plenty of it, but it would not be the kind of meal I would seek out. My husband would disagree with my comments here as he could NOT get ENOUGH of the buffet. Drinks: Available in abundance and lots of tasty concoctions to choose from in both alcoholic and virgin selections. The mixed drinks were cool, but never really ice cold. Still delicious either way! Try the Coco Loco (can be made with or without rum) and the Banana Mama. The beer (either Presidente or Bohemia Especial) was also very good and was cold. Tipping\/Staff: The staff were absolutely amazing. They work so hard for so little but always with a smile on their face, or while singing and dancing. Their hard work made us WANT to tip, although you never felt pressured to do so. Beach: Gorgeous, gorgeous, GORGEOUS! Lots of chairs although the shady ones tend to fill up fast. Beach volleyball and soccer nets are also available and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a nice stretch for walking. Tours: We did the mini speedboats (little 2seater boats and you get to be the driver) and snorkeling excursion √à√\u2020\u2022?it was awesome. The guides were terrific and the boats and snorkeling were a ton of fun. We also did a day trip to Santo Domingo (the capital city of the Dominican Republic). This was my FAVORITE day. FULL of history, architecture, culture, a beautiful walking tour and it included lunch. It was a long day as we had to leave the resort at 6am for our 4 hour drive and were not back at the resort until around 10pm but it was just EXCELLENT.Overall: Fantastic holiday! I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like to go to the same place twice but would definitely consider going here again. Absolutely awesome. If I had to complain about anything it would be only that I did find it was a little bit noisy at night (but that is mostly other inconsiderate tourists) and the rooms were a little bit dim and could have improved on the lighting a bit. My biggest complaint? Is that I am not still there!!!!
