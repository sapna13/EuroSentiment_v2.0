{"text":"OK - friendly but not efficient We booked to stay one night as a birthday treat for my partner. There were various personal reasons why we chose the Milestone and our expectations were high. The service was friendly, though not always efficient. We had a Junior suite which overlooked the park at the front of the hotel which was a lovely outlook, and whilst not quiet wasn't as noisy as many complain of - this is central London! Our room wasn't ready on arrival so we did have to wait in the pleasant lounge. The room was fun, with an interesting theme and well decorated and clean. The bathroom was out of a different era though (it turns out they have revamped many of the rooms but not the bathrooms - it shows!). We used the spa and it was good. I had ordered a romantic turndown (rose petals on the bed, champagne etc.) but they did it very early (6pm!) rather than while we were at dinner (which would seem more sensible) and I had to chase for the champagne. We dinned at the hotel, as it looked like it might be good - it wasn't. We went for the taster menu with the accompanying wine menu. The sommelier was excellent and the wines proposed perfect. The food was at best indifferent and would even struggle to get 1\/10 in the Good Food Guide. The only saving grace were the puddings. It transpired the kitchen staff were all new - except for the pastry chef. Breakfast was worse, with poached eggs so solid they could have been used as weapons.The bill - there were a number of errors so do check! Freindly, good atmosphere, good rooms, poor bathrooms, not very efficient and, for the moment, food poor value.
