{"text":"hotel administration is horrible We took our extended family there for seven nights Christmas week. We checked into our 5 rooms and we had executive lounge privileges. One of the rooms was not the ocean front room they promised, but they said it could be changed the next day so we had no problem. When we changed the room the next day they insisted on taking away all five rooms executive lounge privileges even though we had paid for them. They claimed that we had only requested those privileges and that they hadn't been granted, even though the previous day they had seen that we had those privileges when we checked in. our travel agent called them and they hung up on her! It was unfortunate, to say the least.The day we left we had to be at the airport at 3 so we asked if we could keep one room until 2 pm and put all our luggage there and shower there. They refused. When they picked up our luggage from our rooms at noon they said they had no where to store the luggage until we left at 2 and we had to stay with our luggage!! I gave the bellhop $20 and then he found a place to keep the luggage. I know it was a busy time but the completely unprofessional and disrespectful way they treated us led me to give this hotel the thumbs down. As far as other issues, the beach is nice, but the surf very rough and kids do get swept in every year and die. The pool is ok. The rest of the staff was good. The Italian restaurant (Tuscany) was disappointing. The concierge staff was accomodating. Some of our rooms were unusually small, but others were fine. Oceanfront rooms have good views. However, overall you should stay away from this place until they change their management ","annotations":[]}
