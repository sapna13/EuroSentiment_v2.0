{"text":"It's Really As Good As All of the Reviews Say It Is! My wife and I visited Venice from May 8-12 and we spent two nights at the Hotel Antiche Figure before boarding our cruise ship. We read these reviews before booking the room and trust me (a complete stranger) staying there was one of the BEST decisions that we ever made. The hotel is on the northern portion of the grand canal adjacent to the Scalzi bridge. We hadn't been to Venice before, so we didn't know what this location meant. It's within a very short walk from the bus stop from the airport (Piazza le Roma) and across from both the train station and a vaporetto stop. This means that you can actually take the bus from the airport (~3 Euros\/person), be dropped off at Piazza le Roma, and reasonably walk to the hotel with a small suitcase. (In full disclosure you still have to cross two bridges, though).We're young and found no problem making the walk. We can't imagine having to lug our suitcases around to the hotels further down the canal. Our room was on the top floor (deluxe blue decor, check out the website) overlooking the canal. It was really beautiful and they have an elevator which made the trip up easy. The room was very nice. Nice furniture, well lit, spotless, and it appeared newly renovated (not sure if it was, or if it has just been well taken care of). It was larger than the hotels we stayed at elsewhere in Europe. The bathroom was top notch, large, beautiful with marble and Murano glass fixtures It also had two sinks.Everyone at the front desk was friendly and helped us navigate through this beautiful city. They spoke excellent English (we started to feel guilty because we don't speak Italian) and took great care to make sure that we were happy with our stay. I wish we could have stayed longer, but alas the boat had to set sail. That brings up another point. While the cruise ship port is relatively close, it is too far to trek on foot. You can either take a water taxi (they are literally parked directly in front of the building, or you can walk to Piazza le Roma and take a bus provided by the port authority (our bus was free). Less than 5 minutes drive to the cruise terminal.Breakfast consisted of breakfast meats, cheeses, coffees, and breads. It was very good.We made use of the free computer in the lobby with internet access. I think that there is wifi access in the rooms (but don't quote me on that). We were pressed for space so we didn't pack a computer. We will definitely be staying here again when we return to Venice. The cleanliness, size of the room, the view, the location, breakfast and staff made it special. If you choose to stay here you'll be happy with your decision!
