{"text":"A Private Refuge With Setllar Service We spent 3 wonderful days at the Hotel Bel-Air and can't say enough about the location, setting, and service. The location is hidden on 12 acres in Bel-Air and surrounded by lush tropical gardens that are expertly maintained. It really feels more like being in your own private villa in Hawaii than a hotel in LA. From the swans to the secret herb garden to the beautiful pool to all the hidden courtyards, it is a site without peer. Then there is the service; warm, personal, and clearly driven to exceed your expectations. The staff were always helpful without being servile - coming across as dedicated professionals who enjoyed their ability to deliver outstanding customer service. There was only one minor flaw in the service; the woman at the concierge desk had a slightly arrogant attitude - like one of those boutique sales people who become confused and start to think they own all the merchandise they are selling - but given that we only needed airport transportation and to mail a letter, it hardly impacted our stay.The room (153) was welcoming and personal, with carefully chosen furniture and art. We had a fruit plate, a box of exquisite chocolates, and a small cake waiting for us in the room when we arrived, as well as a note from the GM, which was a very nice touch. This is not meant to be a sleek modern antiseptic hotel room, so there is no swimming pool-sized tub carved from a single piece of obsidian, or curtains that open with a wink of your eye (although those are things that I do enjoy in that type of hotel) - this is a refuge designed to make you feel at ease. Everything from the lamps to the well polished wood floors to the beautiful curtains looks as though it had been individually chosen to make you feel as at-home as possible (and at-home in a mid-20th century mansion in Bel-Air to boot!). We had a beautiful patio surrounded by trees and tropical flowers, with 2 chaise lounges, a full dinning table and chairs where we had breakfast each morning, and a fountain.Probably one of the most pleasant surprises was that the Hotel does not nickel and dime you at all - everything from the bottles of water at your bedside to the WiFi access to the fruit, water and sunscreen at the pool is complimentary. I think most travelers today have become accustomed to being (over) charged for all of these items, plus a resort charge, so it was amazingly refreshing to not have to worry about these things at all.So, in closing, I would like to extend a very heartfelt thanks to all of the staff at the Hotel Bel-Air for making our stay so wonderful, and to say that we will definitely be back.The Hotel Bel-Air is now our home whenever we are in LA.
