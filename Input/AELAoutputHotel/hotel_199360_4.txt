{"text":"Ok hotel, definitely not a 4 star hotel... great location! I went to Berlin for a job seminar and the whole group was staying at this hotel... I know the Crowne Plaza chain hotels and they tend to be quite nice and luxurious hotels, but this hotel was dissapointing... First, i tried to contact the property in advance to ask for a room to have an early check-in and they never replied... at the end i got the room early as requested, but a smelly smokers room... the hotel need some improves fast! it looks old and dated.. surely it was a luxurious hotel circa 1985, but now looks scruffy and outdated... my room, as previously stated, was smelly because it was a smokers room... the bed was ok, although the bed sheet and covers were really small and i could barely cover... i had to take an extra blanket the second night... the bathroom was really really a disappointment... ok, it was functional, but it looked like a motel bathroom more than a corporate luxury hotel... they did not provide for free internet on the rooms, with was another big dissapointment... however, the service in general in the hotel was really really good... they were quite warm, polite and accomodating... the location is great since the hotel is around the corner from this big shopping street in Berlin, so its quite easy to buy medicines, clothes, food, etc... in general, considering the price, i would not stay here since there are plenty of other choices that give you more value for your money... the experience in general was good... but i expected a lot more from a Crowne Plaza Hotel...
