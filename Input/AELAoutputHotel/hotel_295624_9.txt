{"text":"Enjoyed this budget hotel. Good value in Florence. We stayed here 4 days in early June. I rate the Andrea excellent, but that should be taken in context: this is a budget hotel. If you are used to expensive hotels, look elsewhere, but if you want to get good value for your money in Florence - and that's not easy - read on.The location is NOT 200 meters from the train station as they say. We wrestled with our wheeled luggage along the crowded streets because we believed that figure; it was more like 700 or 800 meters. It was walkable since there are no hills, but I'd now recommend taking a taxi from the train station. Florence is a walkable city, so if you are in good shape and can take the heat during summer, you can walk to most main attractions. City buses (oddly designed with few seats) go everywhere, but be careful which direction you travel. From the bus stops near the hotel, you could easily end up in the suburbs. Consider Florence's special bus passes for 24 hrs, 3 days, etc.The hotel is on a nice little park away from traffic noises. By the way, the park has a great little fruit stand at the opposite corner for late night watermelon or beer! On the upper of the two floors of the hotel (3rd and 4th floors from the street), we did not hear any noise except the maid cleaning.The room was starkly furnished, but clean and cool - good air conditioning. (In summer, A.C. is the most important feature of any hotel in Florence. ) The beds and pillows were comfortable. There was a small fridge under the tiny TV.The staff was very friendly and helped us make reservations without hesitation. The continental breakfast was sparse, but good coffee and good service with a smile. You can pay for internet service in the lobby for a reasonable amount...check their rate for your entire stay. The hotel is secure and I didn't sense any problem with the neighborhood, safety-wise. We enjoyed dinner at a local restaurant, Jimmys, but the meal we had a Guelfo was not pleasant because it was too hot in that non-air conditioned restaurant.Be aware that the hotel's rooms vary greatly in size. Not all rooms look like what they show on websites, and not all rooms have a good view. The strangest thing about our room was the bathroom, long and super narrow with a shower that did not have any walls, just curtains between the sink and bidet. This created puddles on the bathroom floor and made it very slippery to walk. We wrote it off to local color. When that's the worse thing you can say about a budget hotel, it's an excellent' place to stay.
