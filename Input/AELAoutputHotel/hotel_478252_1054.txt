{"text":"Just wonderful! I am Portuguese and I stayed in GBP Bavaro since 25\/6 to 03\/7.I went on my honeymoon and it was outstanding. Everything was just how you can dream or imagine it.Trip:From Lisbon to Punta we spend about 8 hours of flight. A normal trip without any stress.We arrived at the airport about 23:00. Be prepared of 99% of humidity. Forget the jackets or pants. That place it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ so hot!!!The transfer to the hotel was fast, about 20min by bus. No complains about the bus driver. How it was late, the check-in was made in the bus. When we left the bus we already knew witch room was ours.Room:Very nice, clean and big enough. King size bed. Air-conditioned worked in perfection. The bathroom was also very nice. Everyday we had flowers on the bed and bathroom. We only tipped the maid twice with 5 and 3 USD. We hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ocean or pool view, but had a nice view of green gardens.Gardens:Only 2 words...Just Beautiful!!Workers:Learn to say this: Buenos Diaz. If you say this you get everything. They love someone from outside talking their language. All them are very nice, and they work very hard to keep this has one of the best hotels in PC. We never tipped the bartenders and they still were very pleasant to us, always with a smile. Try Mama Juana...its PODEROSO (powerful local drink).Food:Imagine that you go to a marriage every day, during a week. At the beginning everything its good and fantastic. At the end you cant see and kind of food. You have food 24 hours a day at this hotel. The buffet has many choices, and it was for us, the best one.We tried 4 a la carte restaurants:Jap: good, but nothing special.Grill: Very nice, relaxing, good meat.Piscis: Best one. At the beach, relaxing sea sound, sunset. Great grilled fish and meat.Italian: Very good also.Pool:Very clean, big, with many animation. The bars at the pool are magnificent.Beach:The water is worm, no waves, and light blue. The sand is with and the only vegetation its palms. We always got up about 10:00, and we always found chairs at the beach and pool with no stress.If you want to do some included activity here, book it early, because you will have to wait 1 or 2 days.Excursions, we went to:Saona - 75eur (1 day): 3 hours of bus, 3 hours on a big boat with music and drinks. Waiting for you was a beach just like the one that you have at the Hotel. At the return you have 40min on a high-speed boat, a bus stop to buy some souvenirs and another 3 hours bus. Doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ worth the money.Swim with Dolphins 60eur (half day): 10min of bus to Manati Park. We saw a parrot show, horse show, crocodile and at least...the dolphins. This was till now, one of the moments more special in my life. Me and my wife loved it. You get in a pool with 3 dolphins. They make 4 or 5 exercises with you, including a kiss and a hug. Just...no words!Animation:At the pools and beach you have music and activities all day. Overall:We choose this hotel just because what we had read about here in tripadvisor. We read about many hotels, and this one, hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ many bad reviews...so we choose it, and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ glad we did it.7 magnificent days! GBP it is absolutely a spectacular spot to spend your holidays if you want: relax, do absolutely nothing, enjoy with your family, eat and drink quite well. This is a family or honeymoon hotel, singles will not feel ok here...I think. Hope this review helps you to decide.Feel ok to make me any questions to brsilva@netvisao.pt PS - sorry my English :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":879,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":875}]}
