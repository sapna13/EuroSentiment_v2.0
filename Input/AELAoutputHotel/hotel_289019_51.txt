{"text":"Old World Traditional Ritz-Calrton Elegance in Contemporary Berlin The Ritz-Carlton Berlin exudes old world traditional elegance, more than I have seen in any of their other properties.From the moment you arrive, you are greeted by friendly doormen, and an abundance of chandeliers. The lobby is reminiscent of something you might see in Versailles, as another reviewer noted. Although I am a young traveler, I remain open to a variety of taste levels, including those that are more traditional in style. That being said however, the Ritz-Carlton Berlin has taken opulence to another level, which I often felt imposing throughout my stay.Firstly, let it be said, that service, comfort and quality were all exceptional, and delivered in true Ritz-Carlton fashion. I felt however, that the design of the hotel was more conducive to hosting dignitaries, than it was a place to relax. I tend to enjoy a hotel, which caters to a variety of purposes, as I feel most newer Ritz-Carlton's do. The service at this property is fantastic, and typical of most Ritz-Carlton's. Despite the language barrier, communication is excellent, and the staff was superb.The location of this hotel was quite central, and adjacent to the modern Sony Center. Just blocks away from the hotel are Berlin's most historic attractions, as well as the city's famous shopping street.The rooms were well appointed, but again opulent and quite gaudy. Rich woods, gold colors and frills were all used in the decor, to make the rooms appeal more to the liking of a king, than a Ritz-Carlton guest. We enjoyed a club-level deluxe room, which was spacious and allowed us access to the Club lounge. The lounge features were nice, but not as generous as others I have seen. There were three food presentations each day, including breakfast, lunch and a combined evening hourderves and dessert. I felt that many of the items were repeated each day. As with the rest of the hotel, we felt quite intimidated by the Club environment. Given our younger age (mid twenties) we were often given the look in the lounge.The Ritz-Carlton Berlin is a great hotel, but may only appeal to a limited audience. Given the opportunity to visit Berlin once again, I might decide on another hotel. Rarely have I had this opinion on a Ritz-Carlton property, and I've stayed in several worldwide.If you desire opulence and grandeur, this very well could be your hotel of choice, as it still upholds all the traditions of a Ritz-Carlton.
