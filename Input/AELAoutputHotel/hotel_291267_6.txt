{"text":"If you want sleep - Don't Stay Here! There is a club on the first floor of this hotel that goes until 4 AM - and if you're staying on the third floor - Good Luck trying to sleep! All night long you can hear the continual thump-thump of the music downstairs. The front desk said they couldn't even check to see if they could move us until 1 AM (so call back, then) and since we had a 6AM flight, moving in the middle of the night was not an option (or staying up till 1AM to call). The club parking took all of the guest parking, and the noise of the freeway could be heard in the room during the day. There was police activity downstairs at the club, and we did not feel safe in the parking lot (since we had to park in the rear near the garbage). The air conditioning was either off or on full blast (and noisy). They need to invest in digital thermostats! Breakfast was a very poor selection. The internet was painfully slow. The room was dusty and the bedside lamps were WAY too bright for night reading. The bathroom fan sounded like a small jet-engine. When we first arrived, we were early so they said to come back at 1:00. We came back at 1:00 and then they said come back later. So we decided to try the spa on the 2nd floor. DON'T GO THERE unless you're into torture! We got manicures  pedicures and she actually drew blood a few times, plus we're fairly certain there was no sterilization between customers. We were actually sore the next day and the throbbing pain in our toes also made sleeping difficult. Oh, and the sleep timer did not work on the tv. I will NOT be returning to this hotel and I'd strongly discourage anyone else from staying there.
