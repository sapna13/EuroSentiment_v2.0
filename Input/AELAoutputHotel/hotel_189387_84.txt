{"text":"Fantastic spot but check your reservation carefully I have a client in Amsterdam and regularly stay at this hotel - maybe at least twice a month, so I thought I should add a review.This is a lovely hotel which I would recommend, but there are a few things worth knowing.It is situated in the centre of Amsterdam (great position), between two canals and has been created by banding together a series of canal-side houses. It's an extraordinary thing architecturally, and recommended for that alone, but it does make the hotel confusing to navigate. I know it well now, but I regularly encounter guests standing lost in the corridor!The rooms are nicely appointed and reasonably well cared for, but a downside of the heritage of the hotel is that even some of the most expensive rooms can receive alot of noise, either from the road outside (if you are at the front, because you are three feet from the road!) or from above, because the sound proofing from above is poor....net result - go late to bed and rise early, and let someone else have the noise!!If you plan carefully and book in advance, you can get yourself into one of the many rooms hid in corners of 'the warren' that aren't so impacted upon by others. These are real finds.Finally, just a warning about the reception's attention to detail. I always book a non-smoking room, and the hotel regularly tell me I have done precisely the opposite. I have double and triple checked my reservation in the past, and still had a row with them. And last week, someone left some tickets for me at reception, which they swore they didn't have....but they did!Finally, the restaurant is good, but way more in demand than it deserves to be. Don't eat in the restaurant unless you just want to be lazy. Go out and find some of the excellent restaurants in Amsterdam. ","annotations":[]}
