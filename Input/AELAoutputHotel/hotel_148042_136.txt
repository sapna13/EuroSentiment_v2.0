{"text":"Hurricane Stayover - What a Wonderful Surprise!! We flew out of Dulles on Sunday 9\/2 knowing our flight to Aruba was going to be cancelled due to the Hurricane. We tried to book a night at the Marriott, but they were full. Thank goodness, because it allowed us to try the Ritz. We arrived at 1:00 on the 2nd and were immediately greeted. Bags wisked away while we went to check-in. We did not expect our room to be ready (a garden view - the least expensive) because of the time of our arrival. What was surprising is that they apologized the room was not ready and gave us a free lunch food voucher at the Ocean Bar and Grill. We went to the wrong restaurant and were not directed where to go - but WALKED directly to the restaurant where they immediately seated us at the location of our choice by the beach. We were told to order as much food as we wanted - it was free except for alcohol. We split a shrimp cocktail and a dessert + we each ordered a main course. I had the Grouper Sandwich and my hubby had a cobb salary with lobster. Our total lunch bill was $89 and it was FREE!!! The food and service were wonderful and we would have happily paid the cost of the lunch, but it was very nice that it was free.They called me on my cell phone when the room was ready. We were upgrated to a ocean  pool view with balcony. Room nicely appointed - very comfortable bed and pillows!Since this was a one night stay over due to our cancelled flight, we did not experience much of PR. One thing I did notice that was scary and comforting all at the same time - the number of police on the beach on horse back and ATV's. I wanted to walk the beach in the morning and asked at the front desk if it was safe. I was assured it was. As soon as I hit the beach I noticed an officer on ATV staying close enough away, but at the same time, watching to ensure I remained safe. He rode ahead of me and checked tree's and other wood structures to ensure no issues. I really enjoyed the walk knowing he was close by. It is a shame a tourist cannot walk the beach safely without police, but at the same time - I was very glad he was there. Typical in Ritz style - they remember your name and address you by it. They bring around nice cold snacks at the pool and beach. Someone was always available to help and assist. The service was by far more than we expected at this PR location.I can't close without commenting on our dinning experience at Mares. Exceptional dinner  service. We didn't order alcohol - and our total food bill was $78 - worth every penny!! In fact, we thought it was low compared to mediocre meals we've had at other locations. Hubby had lobster tails and I had the grouper with mango salsa. Off the charts! From the moment we arrived to the time we left - this was a wonderful experience. For the price, in PR, you will find no other resort with this type of service and property. A comment on the Marriott - we went to the Marriott to check it out. It was definitely more crowded and loud. We didn't feel the property was up to the caliber of the Ritz; however, it was a nice property. We enjoyed the visit, but were very glad to get back to the Ritz. I wouldn't chose to vacation in PR, but since we travel through PR for other carribean islands - I would definitely book a night before and after our vacation at the Ritz. In fact, we pondered rescheduling our flight Friday to stay at the Ritz another night. My recommendation would be to spend 2 -3 nights at the Ritz to experience PR and to include this as a stop over on the way to or from another carribean island. One comment about the plane noise. This hotel is very near the airport. You do hear the planes taking off and landing. This noise is the only negative comment I can give to this Ritz.
