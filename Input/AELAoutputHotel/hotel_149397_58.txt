{"text":"Wonderful vacation I stayed at this resort from July 15, 2008 through July 22, 2008. I had an amazing time at the resort. I would not visit if you are not an open-minded person. Punta Cana is a vacation spot mostly visited by Eurpoeans and Spanish people. English is not spoken vary often, but you can get by. Everyone was very friendly, and the beach was one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. It was very hot, but there was a pleasant breeze, so you could easily stay on the beach all day. The rooms were nice, I had no major problems with bugs. One afternoon, I left my wet beach cover-up on the terrace in a ball, when I opened it up, a cockroach did fall out. But that was not in my room, and my own fault for not airing my clothes out properly. The Japenese steakhouse was great, all the other restaurants were so-so. Don't expect gourmet food. But then again, I went on vacation for the beach, drinks and just to relax. I had stomach problems the first day, but that is not uncommon - traveler's diaherra happens anywhere you go. Its the combination of food, sun, drinking. basically you are changing up your every day routine and your body has to adjust. Dont blame the resort! The grounds are spectacular, they do a very nice job of keeping everything clean. I honestly dont know what people could complain about. Relax and have a good time, you are not in the States anymore. Dont expect the Ritz, this is a 3rd world country!I did the monster truck safari which I highly recommend. You see common DR houses, and really get to see true Dominicans. Life in the DR is not like it is in the resort.Even though the staff doesn not speak much English, they do their best. Remember you are a visitor in a Spanish speaking country, try learning some Spanish before you go!! Also the nightly shows and music were entertaing - not the best, but I was open-minded and enjoyed the effort the staff put into entertaining their guests.
