{"text":"very uneven Our family stayed there for a wedding from Friday Nov 14 to Monday Nov 17. During that time they were completely booked with our group and a convention of physical fitness people.Checking in took awhile but eventually got done. We got an upgraded room I guess because we arrived later (at 7 PM).The elevators were very busy due to the volume. It did take quite awhile to get one at peak times. One of them squeaked and groaned when opening and closing but never felt unsafe.Our room was OK (bay side view) on 16th floor. The room has apparently been redone? (Hard to tell). Poorly painted bathroom and chipping paint on windows. Bed was comfortable. The room seemed clean. Old 25 tube TV with movie channel we used for checking weather mostly. The door to our room did not close by itself automatically. You had to pull it shut. I did not mind this, but on two occasions, I returned to our room and found that housekeeping had not pulled it shut. We were lucky to have nothing missing!We had no car, so we were pretty much confined to eating there. We had dinner in their main restaurant on the main floor facing the ocean. We thought at first that we were lucky as our group of 11 was seated immediately and the place was nearly empty. They really had no clue as to how to operate this place. Our dinners were 1. very slow to get 2. cold 3. arrived at different times (up to an hour different!!!) 4 both under and overcooked 5 overpriced - ex: JW Scotch $11. Also the restaurant was VERY cold - bring a sweater or coat. It took the manager to be able to split our check among 3 payers, and he did this by assigning us 3 servers - one per group.Breakfast was a different story. It was served in the coffee shop. Although $19 plus tax and 18% tip is $25 the meal was excellent if you take advantage of all that this buffet offers - unlimited and delicious fresh-squeezed OJ, unlim. coffee, unlim. buffet including made to order omelets and waffles.Parking as mentioned is $22 valet service only plus tip. This is more than you would pay to rent most cars in Florida.The lobby area has been redone and is beautiful. The beach is very nice. The pool looked OK to me although I did not use it.The wedding dinner food and service was very well done. They seem to know what they are doing for this.Overall for the price we paid ($190 \/night), I think that it is a bit over priced. There is a resort fee added to the room charge that is hard to swallow. Not sure why this is not just part of the room price since you can not decline it.
