{"text":"Wonderful Club Level The hotel itself is nicely decorated, spacious, and clean.Upon check-in, they overlooked our Priority Club status and did not upgrade our room. Perhaps I could have made them more aware as I just joined. So speak up.The wonderful club concierge Gisela later appologized for this, it was not her oversight, and offered a double room upgrade the next visit. The junior club suite was nice and large, modern and not at all a small European closet style room. I loved the room. I had a city view and would have preferred the river view I could see in the club lounge.The best part of the stay was the Club Level. I booked on AAA at a better value. Anyway, the club lounge on the 21st floor has plenty of food all day, full breakfast, small lunch and then something new for dinner. You could just have your meals there if you chose to. Complimentary drinks and alcohol until about 10:30pm, and then they lock the booze and put away the hot food, but the other stuff is there.The club lounge view is pretty and the best part is the most wonderful woman you might ever meet, Sabariah. She is one of the club lounge attendants and one of the most kind, sophisticated and efficient people you will ever meet. I looked forward to the days she was working. She is truly the highlight of the Intercontinental Frankfurt and the city of Frankfurt in my opinion. I would promote her to the front of the house as she has the best people skills of anyone I have ever met while travelling. I would go back to Frankfurt just to see her. If I do have to go back to Frankfurt, I will see if she is still there, if not I will stay closer to shopping and what nightlife Frankfurt does have.The bartenders and waitresses at the Mainhatten Bar in the lobby are really nice, especially Julia. The staff and manager always had a quick smile and the live piano is nice too.The bar closes every night at 2 a.m. the sign says, except when it is slow and they decide to close earlier. Room service will deliver after hous to the bar area or go out a few blocks to a red light area bar if need be. The red light district is very close, however, it is more sad than scary.Leon's restaurant...food is good for a hotel...however, the waiters thought it would be funny to stamp on the bill service gratuity not included. So, I tipped 10 euros on a 40 euro bill. Later I learned that gratuity is included in all bills. The waiter was rude and upset that we did not order a nice steak as he kept offering. He wore a wooden bead bracelet with a cross, what a thing to do. So, he suckered me. When I asked the hotel concierge about whether or not tip was included they assured me it was. When I then told me it was their own restaurant of Leon's, they tried to backpedal and then asked if I had a copy of that bill and, sure it is wrong of Leon's to do, but if the service was really good, it wasn't and on and on. They handled it poorly and I was deliberately mislead. When I tried to call about it the hotel operator would not connect me to the restaurant at 3:15pm because they closed at 3pm and did not open until 5pm.A few bad apples did not spoil the visit.I was with someone on business and spent the most time at the hotel. Business people alone would like this place, however, if you are like me and the one going along for the trip, choose a hotel closer to the shopping area, where you don't have to walk down deserted yet seemingly safe streets to get to the Zeil. I passed the Steigenberger in that area.All in all, a nice place to stay for business, get club level and the added cost is negated with the included meals and beverages. Without the Club level I don't know what I would have done all day and night. It was a nice place to visit and enjoy the food and the view. If you are lucky, you will meet Sabariah!
