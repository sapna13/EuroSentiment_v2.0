{"text":"The worse experience-FL The hotel is beautiful and most of the staff is very nice. I'm talking servers and maids. Front desk and Management are very unpolite and rude.I fell on the premises and sprank the ligaments of my right hand. My husband had to go and get some ice because nobody from the hotel wanted to provide any help. Also, we had to call a taxi beacuse they did not want to take me to the emergency room even though that was the recommendation made by their doctor.Then came the spider. While sleeping in the bed a spider got in my ear and cause several problems including preventing me from flying back home. By this time I was ready to cut my vacation and come back home.The food was OK but nothing special and the restaurants have no AC. It's hard to eat sweating and kicking mosquitoes. All of us got sick. My 2 friends were so sick they had to stay in their rooms for 48 hours.While visiting the enfermery to treat my ear I found out that more than 36 people were as sick (that was only from 2 groups, I don't know how many others were)as we were but the hotel never warned us so we could take precautions. On the contrary they were trying to hide it so they didn't have to take responsability.I contacted the travel agency that (TravelMart) sold us the trip and have not hear back from them. So please, consider not using them if going to the Caribbean. It's been 3 months since the trip and I'm still unabel to used my right hand. It has cost me a lot of money and agravation and all I want is a refund for what we paid. CeciliaGainesville, FL ","annotations":[]}
