{"text":"Great boutique hotel, quiet location As a regular visitor to London I've had the misfortune to stay at the Tower Hotel and the Radisson West End - both depressingly dated. However I had the fortune to stumble upon the Apex hotel and have now stayed here several times in the last year or so.It's located in the east of the city, close to Fenchurch Street Station but on a beautiful and quiet square. No through traffic and no noisy pubs, clubs or clientele. Close also to the Tower of London and Tower Hill station.Its relatively small, and new. The rooms that I've stayed in have been very modern with a small lounge area with a desk, tv, and dvd player. Large beds, a second tv and plenty of wardrobe space. Bathrooms are clean, modern and a good size - all have had a bath as well as a shower. There are the usual nice touches - 2 bottles of water each night, bed and room prepared each evening, towels, slippers and dressing gowns left out. I ordered room service twice and both times it was excellent. Breakfast was fine, if a little pricey - then again this is London.There is usually a gym (very small) but this has been out of order for a couple of months as its being refurbished - and hopefully made bigger. They do give you complimentary membership of the local Virgin Gym though, which was close by and excellent. The staff appear to be mostly eastern european, whcih can cause a wee problem from time to time - my scottish accent wasn't always understood ! However they were, without exception fantastic - friendly and helpful. The only downside is the price. √ä√£¬¢255 a night, then vat of √ä√£¬¢45 on top, made it an expensive stay for 2 nights. However, it is London, it's a great location and an excellent hotel. Worth paying the extra.
