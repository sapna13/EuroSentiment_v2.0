{"text":"Good value, good location, nice hospitality Given the number of reviews for this hotel, it looks like most of its visitors are big TripAdvisor fans.We enjoyed the hotel, but I think its overall TripAdvisor rating is a little misleading.We paid 80 GBP for a one night weekend stay in late September.LOCATIONThe hotel is located within walking distance of the Victoria station and Pimlico subway stops. This makes it convenient for anyone who is flying into any London airport, since they all seem to have bus or train connections to Victoria. The hotel is a 10 minute walk to Victoria station down a single road. It is in a nice area of town with Victorian architecture. There are many hotels next to Luna  Simone that occupy similar looking Victorian buildings.SERVICEThe front desk staff was very friendly and efficient. Let me just say that I'm the type of traveler who is a little uncomfortable with service that is too personal. I didn't see the owners during my visit so I can't comment on all the positive comments about their service. I'm the type of traveler who is perfectly fine with competent, friendly staff, so the service level as described in other reviews wouldn't be that important to me.Note there is no elevator in the building, so visitors with a lot of luggage should be ready for some exercise.ROOMSOur room was a nice, clean, three-star quality room. It was average size for European standards. Our room had twin beds that were of average comfort. Extra pillows were available in the room. A fairly small TV was mounted high on the wall.There was no A\/C in the room. This wasn't a problem given that our room was high enough to get a nice breeze. However, having the window open made traffic noise a bit of an issue. There isn't double-glazing on the windows (nice in a way, since it keeps the Victorian feel), so you can hear a little noise even with the window closed. You might want to request a room without a street view if you aren't a heavy sleeper.The bathroom was clean and nice. The shower was a bit small.INTERNETI believe Wifi is available on the lower floors of the hotel. But if you don't want to bring your own computer, there is a handy PC station in a private room on the first floor. It has free high-speed internet access. I think it was available from 7 am until 11 pm.BREAKFASTWe did not eat the breakfast that has been raved about here. Given that it lasts only until 8:30 am, it might be a little inconvenient for people who want to enjoy the London nightlife the night prior. Breakfast is located in a quaint room in the basement.SUMMARYWe felt the hotel was a pretty good value at 80 GBP. It does feel like a personal, local hotel (it is family-owned), so travelers who like that feeling should enjoy Luna  Simone. Its rooms are basic and its amenities are simple; its high overall rating is due to the service level of its owners and the good comparable value for a hotel in its location. We probably would not stay here again as we felt there was nothing remarkable about the hotel (again, remarkable service isn't that important to us), but the decent price and central location made it a good choice for us.
