{"text":"Very nice hotel My flight comes in a bit early around 8AM and the quick cab ride to the Pan Pacific got me into the hotel lobby around 9AM.As it was early, I was notified by the front desk that my room was not ready and promptly invited me to the lobby lounge\/bar for a complimentary drink while the hotel setting up my room. One cup of cappuccino later and I was invited to check out my room.The room was a good size room with a large King bed. I have a nice view to the Marina and can see the Merlion from my window. The bed was comfortable and clean. Probably one of the best hotel room that I have seen so far aside from the Singapore Grand Hyatt.The walk-in bathroom is a large size with separate shower and bathtub. The room is stocked with standard amenities of shampoo, conditioner and lotion. A complimentary shoeshine service is also available as part of the room. There are live band music every night from 7PM-11PM in the lobby and since the Pan Pacific is an atrium-type hotel, if you like to sleep early and have issues with sounds, you might want a high-floor room. There are bird-chirping sound in the atrium in the morning but I think they are just sounds playing from loudspeaker than real live birds.Turned-down service is done everyday around 6PM. The service is attentive with an accent on security. There are always several security guards manning the entrance from outside to the connecting entrance from the shopping complex nearby.The location is a bit off from Orchard road but it has good way to get on the freeway to the airport.
