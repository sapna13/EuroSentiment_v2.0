{"text":"OK....just OK We were supposed to be headed to Cancun (Riu Cancun) on Aug 20, but with Hurricane Dean on the way and a very small window of possible travel dates, we rebooked at the last minute at Riu Palace Macao. Let me say at the outset that the vacation allowed me to accomplish what I wanted to achieve - a week away from a very stress-filled work environment and the opportunity for my family to spend a week together before our oldest left for college. That being said, while we loved the absolutely gorgeous beach and grounds, we were not totally pleased with the property.We had booked the lowest priced rooms (garden view), and after a real dog and pony show, were given complimentary upgrades. While we really did appreciate this, after a day of travel, it would have been nicer just to have been given the pool-view rooms at the outset, instead of being paraded to several rooms and being asked how much we would be willing to pay for the deluxe rooms. At any rate, the upgrades WERE appreciated.The rooms, while a bit dated in decor, were nonetheless very nice and spacious - no complaints whatsoever (well...except the door on the minibar in our sons' room falling off due to rust!!).Here are the positives of our stay:1 - beach - absolutely gorgeous - as nice as any we have been to. The water was absolutely crystal clear and debris free.2 - Staff. I cannot say enough about the staff - everybody from the front desk personnel to the pool attendants. All of them seem to get it - tourism is their only industry and we were unfailingly and enthusiastically polite and helpful. My wife and I have stayed at very high end all-inclusives (Royal Hideaway, Secrets Capri) and have not been treated any nicer. The animacion staff (entertainment staff) worked like crazy - seemingly 24 hrs a day - to keep things interesting!Unfortunately, for us, the negatives outweighed the positives:1 - Food - really unappealing. While we are unabashedly foodies, we have also done a lot of traveling to places that are not known for fine cuisine, including a number of cruises, and I can state, unequivocally, that we found the food to be the least appetizing of any place we have been. The buffets, while certainly lavish in assortment and quantity, were unfailingly repetitive and bland. Virtually all of the meats and fish dishes were very overcooked and underseasoned. Pastas were generally the highlights, but how often could you really eat a dish of pasta - certainly not twice a day, every day! BTW....we heard similar comments about the food from a significant number of guests.We were very surprised by the lack of any variety of lettuce for salads and the complete absence of fresh fruit juices. All of the juices we had were very, very sweet and artificial tasting. The sit down restaurants were, at best, okay, but still nothing to rave about - very limited menus with little opportunity for substitutions.2 - Lack of air conditioning. As is the case with many hotels in the tropics, a lot of the public spaces are open-air and lack air conditioning. Here, the ONLY air conditioned public spaces were the main buffet restaurant, the Japanese restaurant, and the La Boheme room (where the shows were presented). Dining at the three other sit-down restaurants was HOT, as well as the main lobby bar. Remember, this WAS the end of August, and even at night, the temperatures were in the high 80's. 3 -Gym -Truly a major disappointment. Located in a couple of open-air buildings on Caribbean St., there was some very antiquated equipment in another non-airconditioned facility. A huge disappointment for a Palace level resort.Another thing to note. While we were there, North Americans represented only about 20% of the guests, with the majority coming from Spain, UK, and Germany. For us, that was certainly not a problem, but I make note of this only to state that if you are an American or Canadian traveler that enjoys vacationing with fellow countrymen (or those for whom English is their first language), this is not the place for you.So, in the end, the trip accomplished for us what we sought, especially given the difficult conditions we had to deal with at the last minute. Would we return? Probably not, as the deficiencies noted above really did detract from the overall experience.
