{"text":"Wonderful Experience I used Trip Advisor to learn about this hotel so I wanted to give-back to the Trip Advisor community. I booked this hotel as a special graduation gift for me and my 18-year-old niece. We were also joined by my friend. The three of us stayed in the charming roof terrace suite, featuring a private sun deck, views of the mountains and sea, and a wonderful bathroom. The rate was $966 Euros per night, per the rates quoted on the site.Things that delighted us:The room was wonderful and exactly as described on the website--large, modern, beautiful. Breathtaking views from the deck. Best ammenities ever--robes, slippers, chocolates, stereo system, L'Occitaine bath products. Free access to WIFI.We liked the semi-remote location on the hill overlooking the city. We had just spent a week in the center of Madrid and it was nice to have several days up in the hills.The staff was gracious, helpful and goodlooking. The young staff was very international with--we spoke to staffers from Spain, Mexico, Germany, Brazil, Venezuela, the United States, and Portugal. Communication was very easy.The shuttle to-and-from the city from the hotel was very convenient. It gave us the freedom we wanted and security that we could get back without hassle.The buffet breakfast was terrific, with a wide variety of fruits, breads, meats, fish, and sweets. Great service in a nice sunny atmosphere.Nice spa treatments--book ahead of time by at least a day if you can so that the hotel may get the right type of spa specialist for you.The pool area bar was wonderful during the day and evening. We sunned, swam, rested, drank and ate there several hours per day. In some ways we wasted the sun-deck in our room. We liked the atmosphere of the pool bar.Things that could have been better:The hotel is very intimate, which means you are really aware of the other people around you. During our stay there were two groups of business people staying at the hotel--a young group of Brits and a group of French representatives from the Dodge motor company. Whenever these groups came to breakfast or the pool bar their phones were ringing or they were powering up computers. This was slightly annoying because they changed the entire atmosphere of the restaurant or bar--seeing them made me think of work, when I was trying to relax on my vacation and not deal with phones and computers. On the day we were leaving, the hotel announced that they were closing the the pool bar area that night for a special event for the Dodge people. I'm glad we were leaving because that would have been annoying. There is no other place to hang out if the pool area is closed. I recommend that if you are looking for a quiet time here, check first to make sure no groups are staying in the hotel that week.Overall, this was a wonderful experience and I look forward to returning in the future.
