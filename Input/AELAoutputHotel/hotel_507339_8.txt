{"text":"Beach motel This is a very well-located, refreshed motel, not really a hotel as most frequent travelers would understand a hotel to be. It's best for travelers who like to stay in little inns, guest houses, motels, and nicer hostels and who seek out a fun adventure (rather than travelers who seek the consistency of moderate to pricey chain hotels). For what it is, Venice on the Beach is definitely a #4, which is why I ranked it as such, but I myself was surprised when I drove up to it because the reviews on TripAdvisor made it sound like it was a different kind of establishment. Instead it's very down home with some nice features. Just for context, I am a female business traveler who travels frequently and solo. While I usually stay in mid-range business hotel chains (Hyatt, Hilton group, Starwood group, etc.), , in my personal travel I like high-end hotels and resorts as well as artsy, cool little places off the beaten path.The really positive things about Venice on the Beach: great location right on the beach, warm and friendly staff, laid back and independent feel, good wireless, comfortable bed and pillows, soft, fresh white linens, rooms conveniently appointed, two great outdoor public areas to hang out which look directly out onto the beautiful beach where many people are jogging, walking their dogs, and enjoying the beach. Despite the action, it is relatively quiet.Less appealing things about it: The feel is definitely that of an older motel that has a fresh coat of paint (without having stripped the old paint first) and new windows and bathroom fixtures. There was some nice effort made, but the finishes and workmanship are a bit rough. As a solo female traveler, I would not have felt comfortable walking around the area at night, but I had a car. There are a few parking spaces in front of the building that are first come, first served. I didn't have trouble parking when I returned after dinner, but reportedly it is harder to find parking in the winter. I don't know what I would have done if all the parking spots were taken as street parking is very restricted around that area.My room was small but had a big window looking directly out on the beach (which I paid extra for but was worth it). The window had pretty white wood shutters. The bed was comfortable with fresh white cotton linens. The rest of the furniture (desk, nightstand) was white laminate that was peeling or stained in some areas. There was a small fridge and microwave in the room. Ceramic tile floor, small bathroom with new fixtures and a ceramic tile shower. Generally clean but because the redecorating was done roughly, the overall feeling is new finishes in a worn context. On the other hand, I fell asleep and woke up to the sound of the ocean right outside my window. Although I heard other guests when they were in public areas, my night itself was quiet and peaceful. I did not eat the continental breakfast in the morning, but there are packaged pastries, coffee, and tea set out. The staff was welcoming, accommodating, and warm. Well located for beach, restaurants, major highways, Venice, Santa Monica, and Marina del Rey. If you have a few extra hours, drive up to Malibu beaches along the coast.
