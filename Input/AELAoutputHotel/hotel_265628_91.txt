{"text":"A few Annoyances but Very Good Overall Trip advisor was very helpful in choosing this resort and most of the reviews are very accurate. I liked this resort a lot but you definitely have to go into it with a certain level of expectations and expect things to not go perfectly. I am 30 years old and I went with my GF for 4 nights to the Sirenus Tropical Suites .This was my first trip to a DR resort, and outside of Cancun my first resort ever. The good: The resort was huge and clean and the staff was very friendly. The pool was amazing and huge, the beach was big and very nice. The drinks available were extensive. If you ask for Bacardi or Stoli Vodka or Bialy√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ you can get it. Its hidden underneath every bar so you have to ask for it or you will be drinking local liquor. There was always something to do whether it be beach volleyball, pool volleyball, soccer, water polo, tennis, horse back riding, shows at night (which were very entertaing and I recommend all of them, but again don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect Broadway shows). The rooms were very clean. Now the all important food issue. The buffet is decent and you will find something you like each day and night ( I would not want to eat it 7 days straight for a week but you will do just fine for a few nights a week if you look around). The restaurants are all good. The Mexican, Italian and Japanese all had some very good dishes. I highly recommend them over the buffet but you must get on line in the morning to make reservation. Dispite the fact they are half full the resort will not let you attend usually without a reservation. We did get a few bad dishes but we just sent them back for something we liked a lot better. We always ended up with a very good meal. Wine with dinner and champagne at the lobby bar is the way to go.The Bad: Getting there was hell. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a 1 hour bumpy ride from the airport and our driver almost crash 2-3 times. Once we got there at 3pm our room was not ready and they TWICE brought us to a room that was taken. After 2 hours of walking around the resort we complained straight to management and we were immediately put in a nicer room by the beach. This was the worst part of the whole trip and after this it was smooth sailing and a great time. I will warn you not to expect too much from the mixed drinks. The Pina Colada√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ and Strawberry Daquari and Margaritas left a lot to be desired. (they all use the same mix which makes no sense). I kept to the Bacardi, Stoli, Baily√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ ,Wine and Champange the whole time. The staff didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ speak English at all and that was the one frustrating thing throughout the whole trip. In fact very few guests seem to be from America. Most were British or French. If you are single this is probably not the best place to go though.In short if you tamper your expectations and expect some annoyances I think you will be very happy with this resort considering the very low price compared to other resorts at its level. If you have a nice driver from the airport you probably wont mind driving the extra 30 min to save a lot of money. Just don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect check in to go smooth from what I read and what I saw.
