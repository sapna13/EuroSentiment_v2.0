{"text":"Location makes it work Stayed here for 3 nights in September, my second stay at this property in one year. I returned to this hotel due to its decent value for central Madrid - 98EUR - and fantastic location.This hotel is NOT without its issues, however. Among them: - hallway noise can be murderous at 2am when you are trying to sleep; doors seem to be thin- sunblinds did not operate so could not open the window- wireless internet, while free, does not quite permeate the entire hotel meaning some rooms are without- the elevator is on the slow side of, well, slow- the lights in my bathroom went out early one afternoon - maintenance gone until tomorrow- air-con went out later - maintenance gone for the day, will not be fixed until tomorrow- the showerhead was broken and sprayed sideways only; maintenance never fixed it- i know it is funny, but there was only one partial roll of toilet tissue and it ran out on first afternoon; housekeeping did not replenish for duration of stay even after I left a note, in Spanish- getting a taxi from the hotel is hit or miss - if they call, it takes 15-20 minutes and cost extra- we had two rooms reserved, on the hotel's website, under the same name. Upon arrival, one had been cancelled as they thought it was a duplicate and they tried to tell us they were 100% full. After a bit of friendly arguing (no voices raised or anything), they reinstated the booking as it was made and gave us the two rooms, albeit on completely opposite floors (floors 1 and 7).- many things in the room are broken - cabinet doors, the desk chair, sunblinds, lights...In short, the staff are friendly enough and try hard, but they seem overwhelmed easily when simple things are asked of them (like more toilet tissue, or bathroom lights repaired). For the money and location, this hotel is still a decent value - but if you're willing to spend a bit more, MUCH better options exist.
