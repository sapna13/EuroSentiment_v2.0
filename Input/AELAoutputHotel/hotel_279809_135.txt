{"text":"Beautiful Grounds - Rooms OK - Food Average With this resort, you get what you pay for. We got a great deal out of Atlanta. If you get a good deal, by all means - go and enjoy yourself! The resort grounds are beautiful and very tropical! Some of the best we saw. We walked around and looked at neighboring resorts and found our resort's grounds to be nicer even though some resorts were much more expensive. The rooms are not nearly as nice as you would expect based on the grounds, but they are OK. We had 2 double beds and could not upgrade to a king. When we first arrived the deadbolt wouldn't work and the sliding glass door wouldn't lock or slide. We reported it to the bellboy - don't waste your breath! He'll take your tip and say I'll send someone up and you'll never see him again. So then we called the front desk. Said that they would send someone right up. We waited and hour and then went down to the front desk. Finally, they sent someone up and both were fixed within 2 hours of arriving but obviously you have to stay after them. Then they came back in the morning to fix the locks - I guess they don't communicate with each other very well since they didn't know it was fixed the day before. So if something is broken, don't give up, just keep bothering them until they fix it. These were the only major issues with our stay. As for Punta Cana, the beaches are fantastic! But there isn't really a town nearby so most people never leave the resorts. If you do go into town, hire a guide. There are no street signs, you will be very obvious as a tourist, and they drive like the drivers in Rio or some other big city with very limited trafic control . This is a developing nation. Therefore, it is very, very poor. If you're there on vacation - then you have far more money than most of these people will ever have - so be generous - tip them! Yes, it's an all inclusive resort but a couple of dollars will go very far with them. We tip the bartender a total of about $12 over 5 days and he got my husband a 6 pack Brahama Beer in bottles! I travel for a living and had tons of hotel shampoos, lotions, and soaps. I left some each day for the maid along with a dollar or two and we always had Cokes and water in the mini fridge. When we went into town, I took a bag of these items and gave them to the shoe shine boys for their families. Everyone was very pleased and this cost me nothing but made them happy. These items are expensive and lotion is a considered luxury - so most families can't afford it. The food is fine..not great.. not bad. The seafood restaurant is good but only the pay entrees like lobster (reasonable in price and very good). The buffets are fine and offer a good variety. The egg guy was very nice. The pizza was not very good. Breakfast was excellent. Lunch and dinner OK. Everyone should be able to find something to eat.I enjoyed the trip, but I prefer to visit places where I can experience the culture and not feel isolated and removed from the people. I consider Punta Cana to be like Cancun - too designed and created only for tourism. It is nicer and much prettier than Cancun but still designed mostly for Europeans and Americans. Go enjoy your vacation but don't expect first class while paying for coach!
