{"text":"Wonderful holiday We were a group of 18 with APPLE VACATIONS. Everything went smooth from take off in PHL to the return from PUNTA CANA. The hotel grounds are beautiful. The rooms were the largest I have ever had. Very clean and the mini bar is replentished daily. It rained the first three days of our week but we swam anyway and it didn't ruin the holiday. Hightlights: you can walk to the right of the hotel to a watersports\/activity area. The banana boat ($8pp) was alot of fun. We also went horseback riding ($25pp) for one hour. I have read the reviews and people need to realize when they book a tropical island that yes, it is hot and there can be insects. So, do not wear hairsprays, perfumes that attracts the insects. Also being tropical it does rain almost every day even if it is a few mins. AND you are in charge of where you book your holiday. IF you book Punta Cana, it is a spanish speaking island. I found the natives very friendly and you are able to make yourself understood. There was a variety of food at this hotel. The Los Brisas was excellent with lobster every night. You can go to the other properties for the steak house and the italian restaurant. All three had great food and service. Do not go to the MANGU which is located in the Occidential Hotel. We were told $25 pp with taxi, entrance and one drink. When we arrived at the club, the female manager told us $50pp once she found out we were americans. We argued with her and advised we were going to make a complaint with the hotel, she told us $8pp which is the cover charge that is advertised. We left. There are several clubs on the resort which are fine. Overall, we were very happy with the hotel and the island.
