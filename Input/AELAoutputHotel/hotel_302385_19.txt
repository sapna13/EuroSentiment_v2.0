{"text":"The Truth of Nusa Dua Hotel and Spa Hi All, Ok a little about us, Male 34 and new Wife 31. Our Honeymoon both from Leamington Spa, EnglandReport of Nusa Dua Beach and Spa Hotel.Overall we had a great time at this hotel, we stayed in the Palace Club Suite and had the privilages of Breakfast, Afternoon Tea and Evening Cocktails. All these functions are served by Butlers or to us commoners waiters\/ress. This added benifit i would recommend! The staff are all very warm and welcoming, which we found to be a bit of fresh air! they always said hello from the manager down to the cleaner\/gardener would always stop and smile and ask how you are?. The gardens are in superb nic, and are the highlight of this lovely hotel. they must have about 20 staff always working in the gardens everyday to keep in trim. The hotel food is lovely but pricey compared to other aeras of Nusa Dua, for example;Hotel meal for two with wine was around √ä√£¬¢75Bali Collection meal for two with wine was around √ä√£¬¢40Nusa Aera (just outside the gates) meal for two with wine was around √ä√£¬¢25 and to be honest was just as nice. (The Tropical was the best for meals) We went to The Tropical a few times as we found it to be the best one. If you go to the Nusa Dua area (outside the gates) most resturants will give you a lift home F.O.CThe Spa.We spent most our afternoons by the spa pool as the sunbeds by the main pool where always taken, i did try on a couple of occasions to find beds at 8am but found towels everywhere with no-one on them ggrrrrrr. The Spa treatments are expensive again compared to others outside the hotel. However we found that the hotel was much more luxurious then others and i think was worth paying that little bit more, example;2hr Massage with facial in Hotel was around √ä√£¬¢130 (price for two)2hr Massage with facial in Nusa Dua area was around √ä√£¬¢40 (price for two).Nusa Dua is a very quite area indeed with the last bar closing at 1pm. However should you fancy a night on the town then Kuta is the place to go $10 USD will get you there in a taxi (about 20 mins) and you can party on till the early hours. Semenyak (is that right??) is a cool place as well and another $10 will get you there as well, great for sunsets as is Jimbiran Bay. If you just want a relaxing holiday then Nusa Dua has that to offer and we found it perfect for our needs as if we wanted a quite night then we stayed at the hotel or if we where in the mood for a night out then in a taxi we would go!!We also found the mixture of nationals to be good as well with Brits, Dutch, Thez Germans, Italians, Spainish, Ozzies, Chinese, France and the odd Yank \/ Canadian making it very interesting. It was just nice and refreshing to be in a resort not full of Brits!! (went to maldives last year and was like a little butlins!! lol).Pretty much everything is great about this hotel and im sure if your going you will have a great time unless your a fussy and a unhappy couple!!If i had to be sad the only down side to this resort is its beach and sea but having been to the maldives last year i think i will struggle to find beaches and seas like it is there!!Anyway have a great time you'll love it.Hello to the Dutch couple we met and told us about the orpanage.Also to Tony,Donna,Kez,Jess,Tom and ChrissyHappy Holidays.Rob and Hannah.
