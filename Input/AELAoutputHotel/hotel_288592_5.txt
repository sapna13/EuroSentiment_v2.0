{"text":"Pure luxury I booked the Conrad Miami for a two-night stay while travelling around Florida. The hotel is situated in the business district but there are a few restaurants and local bars in the vacinity so you can go out and about if necessary.The first impression of the hotel was the right one....a beautiful hotel; from the general decor, to the restaurant where breakfast is served. The Conrad has a very contemporary style and is imaculately kept, with most of the public areas looking brand new.On checking into my room I actually thought I had been given an upgrade to a superior category, but no, this was a standard room|! Extremely large bedrooms, with an even larger bathroom. Great selection of products in the bathroom, and the bedroom was equipped with a coffee machine, flatscreen tv, dvd, the works - very impressive. Although I didn't use the spa, I did go and have a look and it looked stunning! I did have the time to use the outdoor swimming pool, and although it was smaller than I exepected, the pool area is very welcoming with a lovely sun terrace and some nice views out to the sea.There is a nice bar on the 25th floor where you can take advanctage of sitting outside (if you're lucky enough to get a space as there is only limited seating) and the restaurant is nicely decorated just nextdoor.All in all, I found this hotel portrayed the true values of a five star deluxe hotel and was very impressive. Only small disadvantage is the split of the hotel between two buildings which means you need to leave the main building to go over to the fitness centre\/swimming pool but this was a small detail and did not detract from my stay.If I get the chance to stay again, I would jump at the opportunity and higly recommend it to anyone travelling to the area.
