{"text":"The Price is Rigth but... Our stay was from April 13th to 18th. The reason we chose the Makaha Resort was because my wife was attending a Mary Kay seminar being held there and the fee was $99 per night. The location in Waianae was not an issue since I used to live on Oahu and knew my way around. Negatives...1) Our room B207 was adequate but in need of an upgrade. The television was small and there was no remote. The fan in the room was very dirty.2) Staff...though friendly, at times there were not enough of them in the restaurant or in transporting guests from the lobby after check in to their assigned rooms via motorized carts.3) Waianae...not all of the locals welcome visitors.4) If you've ever been to a resort like The JW Marriott Cancun, Turtle Bay Resort Oahu, Hyatt Regency Maui Resort  Spa or The Venetian Resort Hotel  Casino in Las Vegas then you will know that the word resort does not apply to this hotel and golf course in Waianae. Positives...1) Price $99 per night2) Overall...friendly staff3) The golf course looked beautiful and the surrounding mountains were very scenic.4) Housekeeping did a good job each day we returned to our room.The Makaha Resort Golf Club is about 40-50 minute drive from the Honolulu airport. If you choose to stay there...rent a car. This place has a lot of potential but then you'd be paying a lot more than $99 per night. I would recommend this location for the price. It's a good place to crash and store your stuff since you'll more than likely be out and about i.e. North Shore, Waikiki, Haunama Bay etc.I would not return unless the owners of this property made some major enhancements.
