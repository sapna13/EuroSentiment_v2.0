{"text":"Excellent vacation spot I would like to start this review by saying that I was very concerned about this resort after reading the reviews on here.Having just returned from this resort I have to wonder what expectaqtions these people must have had.I stayed at the Bahia Principe for one week Aug 18-25th.From the moment I landed and got on the bus, the vacation was wonderful. The trip from the airport to the hotel was about 35 minutes. In that time, we were given information on the hotel, checked in and room keys given. When the bus arrived at the hotel we were greated with a glass of punch,our luggage was taken by bell boys and we were all taken straight to our rooms.  The Buffet is remarkable. What ever your taste in food is I am sure you will be very happy here. The individual restuarants were also very good. The Mediterranean was my least favorite but still very good. The staff were top notch. they were friendly helpful and all very hard working. The Beach is a great. Very clean. I had read that it was hard to find a spot to sit at the beach, but I can truly say at whatever time I headed to the beach there was always a perfect spot to be found. The activities on the beach are always fun, from the dancing to the volleyball, to the water sports. It is all great. The pools are also great. I just enjoyed the beach more. The rooms are spacious and clean. Actually everything in the resort was always spotless. Guest services at the hotel were always friendly and more then helpful with anything you needed. There is nothing negative i can say about this resort. If this is your pick you will have a great time. ","annotations":[]}
