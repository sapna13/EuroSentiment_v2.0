{"text":"Brill stay at the tropical We went as a group of 18 for a family wedding. The hotel is worthy of its 5 star rating. Book into the themed restaraunts asap as they fill up quick. The entertainments team were brill, day and night. You get beach towels there and they have hairdryers in each room. The cheapy cheapy shops arnt as cheapy as the airport on the way out. Which incidentally is down the steps at the back of the pizza counter, (not just the tiny shop as you go in) The trips to saona island, and shark swimming were amazing, the horse riding on the beach, quads and dominican discovery trips were also fab. take airbeds etc with you as they are quite dear there. Barter to at least half of what the cheapy shops are asking, it can be quite fun. All the staff speak good english, but speak spanish. We left a dollar tip for the maid each day, and tipped the waiters. Dont underestimate the sun, get at least factor 50 for kids.(and take loads of it) The beach is amazing and you can parasail for 45 dollars and the kayaks and catermarans are free. banana boat is 10 dollars. It is a truly tropical place, absolutely beautiful. There seems to be a lively, and a quieter side to the pool, the lively side is on the right hand side, the entertainments team are round there. The food gets a bit samey samey, but if youve got kids they will always have burger, chips and nuggets to choose from. You wont starve, there is alot of choice. The japanese and the steakhouse are a must. If you smoke, get your cigs on the way out as you have a great choice of marlborough, or marlborough lights when you get there. It also costs around 5 dollars for a throwaway lighter. You can get all brands in the duty free on the way home. And its very cheap. They are keen on luggage weights though. Take plenty of 1 dollar notes for tips. Get an insect repellant with a high deet content, there seems to be a bad hour on an evening when you are likely to be bit, and use it when you go on the beach as we got sand fly bites which are really itchy. Even though we never saw any sandflies. The sea is very salty but really warm, and if you like snorkelling, there are coral reefs everywhere. And as in europe, you have to bag the sunloungers and palm shelters early doors with a towel. It was an amazing holiday, would definately go again. if you go before april, take the reps, jenna and carly a pot noodle, they are 2 brill yorkshire lasses. Hope you like rum, they have one called 151. this is due to its alchahol content, its very potent, and a rum called mamajuana, which is supposed to increase a mans vitality. You will usually get offered a drop at the cheapy beach shops, either that or a lucky talisman chain. If you do go on the dominican discovery trip, you will stop by a school, we took sweets and pens for the children, they wernt begging, they were lovely. The bus journey to the resort was an eye opener, the roads, hectic driving and local houses etc are a right eye opener. You will see what i mean. Enjoy your hol. We certainly did.
