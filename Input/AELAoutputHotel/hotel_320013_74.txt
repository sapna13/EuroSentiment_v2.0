{"text":"Fantastic Resort The Conrad Bali is a lovely resort spread over large beautifully manicured gardens and surrounded by a meandering lagoon pool and one large central pool.Our expectations from brochures were surpassed when saw this resort. It is even better than any photos can show.We were upgraded to an ocean view room which overlooked the lagoon pool and the room itself was large, modern and subtlely decor'ed. Marble look floor tiles, marble look bathroom with separate toilet and shower. The service at all times was excellent and the numerous staff at all facilities and restaurants were very friendly and responsive.The location at Tanjung Benoa\/Nusa Dua is quiet and relaxing and we did not find the water sports, namely jet skis as referred to in a previous review, too noisy. Bottles of water were supplied free of charge as often as you wanted or needed them.Breakfast was included and provided a fabulous selection.The road outside was not the greatest to walk along and eating out was limited, however there are many restaurants at the Bali Collection shopping centre ten minutes away by vehicle and most if not all the restaurants provide a free pick-up and drop off to your hotel. We ate there most nights and the food was terrific.We have travelled to many countries and five star resorts and this would rate as one of the best.If you're looking for indulgence away from the hustle with friendly and efficient service and beautiful surroundings this is the place.I am a regular user of trip advisor and find it excellent in assessing the many hotel and resort destinations.
