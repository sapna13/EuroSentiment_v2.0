{"text":"This resort has improved in recent years. We were at the Bavaro Princess in Jan. 2005 for one week and felt that that wasn't enough so returned January 2 - 16, 2007. Two weeks is too much, however, and 10 days would have been perfect. Sadly, that's not offered in any packages we've seen. There is a new spa now that would rival any city spa and the VIP package has been replaced by the Platinum Club with a lounge built over part of what used to be a pond with a fountain. In other reviews, people have said that the Platinum Club must be booked through your agent, and it is standard with Air Canada, but it is also possible to go with cheaper tour operators and buy the package on arrival. The Platinum Club service is worthwhile. The lounge is a great place to hang out, with two computers and unlimited internet access. Most people just log on, check their e-mail, and get off, so it was never a long wait for a computer. This time we did find that the staff seemed to be getting a tad lackadaisical, not as eager to please as last time. I agree with another reviewer that the service in El Pescador (seafood restaurant) was very bad. The lunch buffet at the Hispaniola (in the lobby) is far superior to the beach buffet, but if you're on the beach it's handy and you don't have to get dressed. A reviewer commented that there is only one pool but that's not true. There is a smaller pool near the hotel\/lobby. It's quite private and near the spa. A petty annoyance, we were charged $2 for the use of the phone in our room. (We had tried to call friends in another room but there was no answer.) In general, over the last two years, I would have to say that the resort facilities have improved, but the service is less friendly.
