{"text":"Good business hotel... We wanted to burn a few points in Barcelona when visiting friends and we had the choice between two Hilton in Barcelona. My wife wanted a swimming pool. So the choice was easy: Diagonal Mar and not the more central one. We booked 3 nights with our HHonors points with 2 kids.We were upgraded to Executive floor and checked in in the Executive lounge by friendly staff. We had a corner room (slightly more spacious than standard executive) and asked for an additional bed for our kid. Free of charge and very good quality and length (could even accomodate an adult).The room are very nice with flat screenLocationNot in the city center but in a quiet area (no noisy construction very close)Near the sandy beach (easily accessible with a 10 min walk) where you can find a fresh water shower. Beach OK. ParkingIf you have a car, instead of using the overpriced hotel car park, park it free of charge in the street parallel to the hotel.Executive lounge OK but a little bit cramped and small with the usual choice of beverages and good snacks from 6pm to 8:30pm. We had our breakfast (good without a very large choice) there on the terrace having a view on the city and sea, very nice when you can get a table in the shade.We did not eat in the hotel as you have everything you need from sandwich to full fledged restaurant and tapas bar in front of the hotel. You do not need to pay overpriced meal in trhe hotel.The pictures on Internet are misleading as they make the sea appear a little closer than it is actually and it seems as if there was a grass garden near the pool which is on the second floor but the grass we see is next to the street.Swimming OK but a little cold (even in August). Ample free towels and lounge chairs.As already said, easy connections to the city center with tram, tube, bus and taxi (8 EUR).Overall a good new hotel without atmosphere.
