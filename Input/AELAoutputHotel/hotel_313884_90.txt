{"text":"Great Resort, So Much Fun!! My sister and I went to this resort for our annual Mommies Vacation from March 28th to April 4th, 2008. We have been away every year for the last ten years to many different tropical resorts. This resort was definitely our favourite to date. The front desk staff were very friendly and accomodating. Our first room was on the main floor and we really did not want to be on the ground floor. When we went to speak with the front desk -Julio - a very handsome man - happily changed our room to a third floor room. The room was incredible. We had wonderful views of both the pool and the ocean. The room service is fantastic. I don't see many people mentioning it but it is available 24 hours a day and they deliver your order very promptly. (I really liked the salads on the room service menu - I acutally found them to be better than the salad at the buffet. ) The staff at the resort are by far the nicest I have ever encountered at a resort. All of them SMILE constantly and are very pleasant and try very hard to speak English with you. The bartenders are very nice - but I did find that they do not serve the international brands of liquor and beer unless you ask for it and it gets kind of tiring to always have to ask when you go to order a drink. The bars all close at midnight except for the beach bar and they do not budge on this. A group of us were in the lobby one night and they would not serve anyone a drink after 12:00. This is not a complaint - they still have one bar open 24 hours - but when you are enjoying yourselves in the lobby - it is a pain to walk all the way to the beach bar to get drinks. The animation staff are really this nicest I have ever met. Jesus, Jose and the rest of the animation team are very pleasant and try really hard. It was the perfect balance for me because I don't really care to get all involved when I am away - there is just enough to do and they are not in your face all day trying to get you to do things you don't want to do. (My sister, on the other hand, loves to participate and managed to keep herself busy all week joining in most of the organized activities!) I could go on and on about this fabulous resort. We met so many incredible people who will remember and think of often. Thanks again to everyone at the PCP and all the great people we met who made this a trip to remember!
