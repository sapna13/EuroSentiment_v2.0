{"text":"Good resort; hit or miss on rooms We had a generally good stay at the Sol Melia Caribe Resort. The public areas of the resort are beautiful and offer everything we wanted in a Caribbean resort. Nice pool, well manicured grounds, expansive lobby areas with ceiling fans gently moving the air, and a well kept, large beach all lived up to the promises made in brochures and on-line.Food at the resort was good, too. The restaurants seemed well operated and the food was good, but not great√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√\u2020ut where in the Caribbean is it truly √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√\u2020reat,√à√\u2020\u2022?anyway. The Market Grill √à√\u2020\u2022?the buffet restaurant √à√\u2020\u2022?served notably good food and had a super variety for breakfast and lunch. You√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l end up there for dinner, too, unless you make your dinner reservations well in advance (days, if possible) at the specialty restaurants. Rooms and service are the areas where this resort needs some help.I was traveling as part of a group, and several members of my group complained that their rooms were run-down. While my room (2nd floor of building 22) was in good shape with attractive furnishings, operable fixtures and air conditioning, and everything in working order, that wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ the case in many of the rooms of our group. Many of my colleagues said that the air conditioning in their rooms could barely keep the room below 80 degrees. Three of the group members had problems with plumbing including leaky fixtures, drips from the bathroom ceiling, and other problems. One member of our group showed us how a part of the ceiling in her room literally fell-in during her first night there. While some of these problems are understandable given the climate and challenges they face there, the overarching problem is that the hotel staff and management refused to move these guests to acceptable guestrooms, and offered no compensation for the troubles. I have stayed at Melia-operated hotels in the past, and have not encountered management responses like those received by my colleagues at this resort.Service at the resort is OK, but not exceptional. Restaurant and bar staff were great and appreciated the tips we left after meals and drinks √à√\u2020\u2022?and it sure did help speed out service! The concierge desk attendant (Marlys) was extremely helpful with our request for dinner reservations and transportation away from the resort one night. The only area with so-so service was the front desk, particularly at check-out√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√®t was borderline rude, which leaves an impression as the last contact with the hotel staff, unfortunately.The resort is quite spread-out, but a handy tram runs every 10-15 minutes if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ care to walk from your room to the public areas and back to the beach.For a real treat, head to the beach in the early evening, turn right and walk about five minutes until you see the Jellyfish Bar just off to your right. This locally-owned gem is a rock and wood, freeform-looking creation with absolutely exceptional food and service. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a wonderful, short excursion away from the resort and you can interact with locals, guests at other resorts, and just have a laid-back meal while the breeze slices through the upper or lower level.All in all, Sol Melia Caribe is a resort I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° return to, but if my room weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ perfect at the moment I arrived, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° refuse it and insist on one in which everything works. Enjoy!
