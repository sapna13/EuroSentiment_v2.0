{"text":"Good (not Great) stay at the Gran Melia I rely on tripadvisor reviews, so I feel it is only fair to write my own.The Gran Melia is a beautiful property, like others have said, that needs a little tweeking. The first thing - rent a car. Absolutely, without a doubt, the best thing we did. Puerto Rico is really easy to drive around and we used our car to drive into San Juan about every night and drive to local bakeries to get lunch etc. Without a car, i think we would have been really unhappy.The pool is gorgeous. very big, lots of built in beds, very clean, great temperature. It was packed with kids over the weekend (we do not have kids) which was a little loud for our taste but they were just kids being kids, so we can't complain. Monday and Tuesday the pool was very quiet. Our room was nice, always cleaned promptly, very comfy bed, great flat screen tv with all the american channels. We found service very friendly and willing to help. We did not like the beach at the property (full of rocks, like the pictures show) but we took our rental car a few miles down the road to Luquillo Beach which was beautiful, easy to find and almost empty on a Monday. Highly recommend that.Overall, I would recommend this hotel to families much more than singles and also I cannot say enough about having a car to leave the property. There is a lot to see in Puerto Rico. The Gran Melia served as a perfect suitable home base but the beach on property and lack of diverse restaurant options made our rental car worth 10x what we paid for it. ","annotations":[]}
