{"text":"Affordable but out of the way... We just returned from a Thanksgiving trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico and stayed at the Normandie Hotel. All in all, I would say that the accommodations were fine. The room was clean, housekeeping was very considerate, and the hotel staff was very helpful generally. A couple of warnings about the hotel. It's in an area called Puerta de Tierra right between Old San Juan and Condado. There isn't much within walking distance to the hotel, except for the Caribe Hilton, a Subway restaurant right across the street, and Escambron, a restaurant that serves local fare about a 3 minute walk away. As such, you are in close proximity to two very nice areas but don't really get the benefits of staying in either. Cab fare from the hotel to Old San Juan was $10. I'm not sure about the cab fare to Condado because we generally just walked across the bridge. Except for the beach at the Caribe Hilton, every other beach that we saw was a public beach. The beach near the hotel (not the little area behind the hotel but the area behind Escambron Restaurant) is pretty decent and will serve your most basic beach needs. The nicest beach that we went to in the area was in Isla Verde, which was a $19 cab ride from the hotel (not the one near the Ritz Carlton...barf). You probably notice a pattern here! Lots of cabs! You can also take the bus to many areas but it's not terribly convenient.But I digress. Back to the hotel. The hotel has a bar on the second floor called the N-Lounge. The music is unbelievably loud. We were on the fifth floor and at one point during the night, our walls began to shake! I think that someone must have complained b\/c they eventually turned the music down. Also, the food in the restaurant downstairs was pretty good (except for an overpriced Thanksgiving holiday buffet). Finally, be aware that San Juan charges a municipal tax of $5\/person per day. I thought that I had paid all relevant taxes when I made my reservation only to find that I had to pay an additional fee when I checked out. (i was not advised of this fee in advance and was not pleased). All in all, the Normandie hotel was fine, but I would not stay there again. I would opt for a hotel in Old San Juan instead. With cabs and the traveling time, the price differential is probably worth it. Oh, by the way, make sure you check out this restaurant called Cafe Annapola in Old San Juan. It's along the wall between San Cristobal and El Morro. The food was delicious and the view is amazing!
