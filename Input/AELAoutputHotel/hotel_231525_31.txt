{"text":"24 - 27 Jan 2008 We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the H10 Raco del Pi.We had a brilliant time in Barcelona and loved this hotel. We took ages to choose a hotel after reading numerous reviews and we were pleased with our choice. The hotel is tucked down a side street very close to Las Ramblas so in a brilliant location. We had complimentary cava on arrival and the complimentary coffee\/tea and pastries provided throughout the day were great especially after a busy day out round the city.The staff on reception spoke very good English and were very helpful. We had room 407 on the 4th floor. It is on the back of the hotel so was lovely and quite but it only had two small skylights and a very small low level window (at ankle level!) so felt a bit dark. However it was clean and had everything we needed and to be honest you dont spend much time in the room so we didnt grumble. Looking at the floorplan on the back of our door we shall ask for room 402 next time which was much larger and had a balcony, but it it is on the front of the hotel so imagine it might be a bit noisy at night at busy times of the year. We would definitely recommend this hotel, particularly because of its position.We would also recommend using the aerobus to travel to and from the airport. It went from right outside the terminal to the centre at Placa de Catalyna and cost just 3.90 euros each. It runs every 15 mins even on Sundays and is less than a 10 min walk to the hotel.The hop on hop off Turistic bus is a must. The red tour round the north of the city was more interesting and we used it to get to and from the Nou Camp.For a lovely evening meal we would recommend Attic. A fab restaurant on Las Ramblas. Its above some shops about a third of the way down Las Ramblas. At night you cant miss it as you look up to see a modern and inviting restaurant overlooking the street with a queue of people waiting for tables! It was great to sit at the window watching the entertainers and people going by below whilst enjoying a lovely meal. It cost about 80 euros for a 3 course meal and a good bottle of wine. We loved it so much we went twice but would advise you to book a table or go before 8pm as there was always a queue after 8.30pm because its so popular.One word of warning - be careful about having a drink at the tables in the middle of Las Ramblas. We stopped for a rest and had 2 beers (not large ones) and they presented us with a bill for 15 euros! They charged us 7.50 euros each for a glass of San Miguel!! What a rip off - so ask the cost before you order.We absolutely loved Barcelona and will definitely return and stay at H10 Raco del Pi.
