{"text":"Not a 5 star resort; maid had sticky fingers I was at Paradissus from April 22-29, 2007, along with my wife and two kids (1 and 2.5 year old). By no means is this resort geared to children of such a young age; though they never advertised as such. The Kids Club starts at 4 years old, and the babysitters speak poor English, which made it difficult for us to find time to ourselves. Most of the staff were very friendly towards our kids, as it seemed a large proportion had kids of their own, with their families living hours outside Punta Cana.Our garden view suite was awful (building 10, ground floor). The roomwas extremely musty (upon arriving home we had to wash our clothes twice to get the smell out), the shower didn't work and the tv was about 20. Not exactly what we envisioned a five star resort to be like. Further, one morning I left my wallet on top of the tv while at breakfast, and came back, room made, and US$150 missing from my wallet. Initially I chalked it up to miscounting my money, but when the next day I noticed another US$120 missing, I called security. They ran an electronic audit on whom had entered our room, and the only person had been the maid. She denied it, and from their point, the case was closed. The manager didn't even try to make amends, but rather said you should have used the safe. In hind sight, that was the right thing to do, but then again, you shouldn't have to worry about your personal belongings in your own room. Bottom line - use the safe provided.Food - average - typical resort food. Though nice to have the varietywith all the a la carte dinner restaurants.Beach - by far the best beach I have laid foot on. Gorgeous blue water, sprawling waterfront, and cabana;s with mattresses made it unique to other resorts. Beach bar great to have a few afternoon drinks at.Scuba diving - equipment\/diving included in all-inclusive package. I did two, 30 minute dives reaching a maximum depth of 40 feet. Visibility was about 30 feet, aquatic life was average. Great comraderie with other divers. Non-licensed divers were able to go out, albeit not to same depths - I am a bit skeptical of this practice.
