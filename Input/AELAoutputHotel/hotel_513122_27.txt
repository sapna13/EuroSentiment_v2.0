{"text":"Great disappointment with Spaulding! Greatly disappointed with Spaulding Hotel. Was the worst lodging I had when I was travelling USA for 14 days. Paid $76 per night for 3 nights and there was a weird smell when I entered the hotel. In fact, the whole hotel had this weird smell. The front desk guy gave us a room on the 3rd floor initially which I felt terribly cheated when I entered the room. It was SMALL, DIRTY, DARK and OLD. This looked different from the photos shown on the hotel's website when I first booked it. Was terribly upset and went down to confront the front desk guy. I told him the room looked totally different from what was advertised and it was really not acceptable. He then gave us another room on the 7th floor for us to see if we liked it. It looked much better than the first room he gave us. Brighter and slightly bigger, at least. We had no choice but to accept it. We kept thinking that the hotel cheated us by giving us a smaller room without informing us although the price we paid for was for a bigger room. This left a really bad impression that the hotel was not honest in doing business.If i was in San Francisco again, I will never choose to stay in this hotel again. We had 3 luggages to move in and the rooms were situated far away from the lift where we had to struggle through 2 doors before reaching our room. It was great inconvenience! Although the location is in Union Square, there are certainly better hotels in the vicinity that although slightly more expensive, are more worth your consideration! Don't make a choice I regretted.
