{"text":"Great location! My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel Europa Firenze in Florence for 2 nights as part of our Italy honeymoon. Prior to actually visiting Florence all of my emails to the hotel were answered promptly and professionally. The staff helped me book reservations for the Accademia and the Uffizzi Gallery. When we arrived at the hotel I initially was a bit concerned going in the front door from the street as it is a dark, not very nicely decorated lobby in a very old building. You have to take a very small lift (only holds 1 person and maybe 2 small suitcases) up to the 2nd floor for the actual hotel reception area. However, once we got to the hotel reception area we were greeted by a very nice gentleman who proceeded to check us in, help us get our luggage to our room, and then show us how to work the lights and air in our room. We found out that the hotel is run by his family-they are all very friendly and helpful. The hotel reportedly just went through renovations. Our room was very clean and it looked like most everything in it was new. It was very simple though with no artwork on the walls....they may be still in the process of adding these. The bathroom also looked newer and was very clean. The bed was VERY firm and so were the pillows....a little too firm for me. They served a simple breakfast in the morning of pastries, meats and cheeses, cereal, fruit, and coffee and bread. They also offered free internet access which was nice. The hotel is in a great location in the center of town only 5 minutes to the Accademia, 5-10 minutes to the Duomo, and a 15 minute walk to the Uffizzi. Even though it was in the center of town our room (50) faced the garden area and was extremely quiet. The air conditioning was very nice too as it was in the high 90's while we were there . Overall I thought this was a good place to stay and I would stay there again if back in Florence.
