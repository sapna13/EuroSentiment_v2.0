{"text":"Fantastic, Friendly Hotel Just got back from a night stay in this excellent hotel. We've stayed there three times on three seperate occasions, and will deffinately stay here again the next time we're back in Venice. It's location is great for ease of access to the Bus Terminal, Train Station (directly opposite) and the majority of the major Vaporetto routes. There's a Gondola pick up point right outside too, which if you ask at the reception desk they can get you a discount. If you plan to visit Murano to see the glass blowing factories, It's also worth asking at reception as they can get you a free taxi ride to one of the factories on the island with no obligation to purchase anything.Of the three rooms that we've had, they've all been fantastic. Spacious by european standards, fully air conditioned and with a well appointed bathroom. Breakfast isn't included (I believe) in the normal price, but they do a deal with those that have booked through expedia (and maybe other online agencies) of a continental style buffet breakfast for √à√\u2020√ü?. I think that's great value, as you'd be hard pressed to find this price anywhere else.The bar area is great, and they do have chairs and tables outside so that you can watch people passing and boats chugging up and down the grand canal. The adjacent reception area also has a free internet access point. Above all, this is a friendly and relaxing hotel that we will always come back to. ","annotations":[]}
