{"text":"What a Great Experience 13-20 December 2008I am sure you have read a few reviews on the Punta Cana Princess - we read quite a few before going and we were really looking forward to our trip. The fact that many of the residents at the Punta Cana Princess are return visitors should tell you that it's an amazing place.Upon our arrival at the Resort, the check-in was quick and efficient. We were extremely satisfied with our room and even though it was quite late at night our first task was to check out the facilities. The beach was amazing that first night. Throughout the week whether it was day or night, whenever we did go swimming the water was exhiliarating - leaving Canada and being able to swim in December is indeed a novelty. One review we had seen stated that the food had been barely palatable - well there's an amazing selection of food for each meal. For breakfast a very pleasant gentleman made eggs any way you wanted them - including an amazing omelet! There was also a vast assortment of all kinds of different foods, whether it was fruits, cereals, oatmeal, etc. For lunch and supper the selection was also amazing. At lunch they would have a BBQ set up outside and the variety of the different meats was pleasing and tasty. I particularly enjoyed the pasta bar for supper - you could pick your favorite type of pasta and the gentleman would add your selected spices, ingredients and sauces and voila you would have an amazing little pasta dish. At some point during the week I did get ill - not sure what it was but I think it is something that a majority of us travellers will experience - my recommendation? Immodium is very quick in relieving any issues a person may have and you are able to continue on and enjoy your vacation.The staff was amazing - they would greet you at the entrance of the buffet area and bring you to your table and then would provide you with your drink of choice. In a previous review, someone had complained that the drinks were watered down? I didn't find this - I found the variety of the drinks pleasing and considering that the alcoholic beverages were provided from 1000 hrs in the morning to late at night - we had no complaints here!! There were bars set up at the beach, at the buffets and the swim up bar in the pool. All the bartenders were very friendly and would do their best to ensure we were well taken care of.The staff work so very hard to ensure that the diners are well taken care of for food and what not - every day you would normally see the same server\/hostess. Many of the vacationers would slip a gratuity to the server\/hostess to show their appreciation for their efforts.There were some complaints about the Entertainment personnel of the Hotel - they're job is to ensure that the residents of the Hotel are having a good time. They have very charismatic personalities and would do their best to engage the residents in volleyball, aerobics, Bingo, dancing, etc - if you didn't want to - then they would leave you be. The people that did join in did have fun - we played volleyball in the pool on our first day there and we had lots of fun (although our team lost against the Entertainment personnel). If anything these people worked very hard as they were often at the Resort early in the morning, were there throughout the day and would return for the evening activities.My sole complaint about the resort was the lack of English that some of the personnel spoke. But, when you think of it - I should have made more of an effort to have learned basic Spanish phrases prior to our departure - When we did speak Spanish they appreciated our efforts.In closing, if you do decide to go to the Punta Cana Princess, you will undoubtedly have an experience of a lifetime and will meet some amazing people also enjoying their stay at the resort.
