{"text":"Well worth staying at this great hotel Have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel.If I were to return to Singapore - this would be my pick again. This was the 10th trip to Singapore and this hotel was probably the best I have stayed, especially the location. Scotts Road is a buzz of activity and so convenient. I had good intentions to travel via the MRT, but in the end travelled everywhere via taxi. Too convenient when there is one waiting right at the front door for you everytime you step out.The staff were very unintrusive, and I did not have a lot to do with them apart from the 2 minute check in and out. The room was small but roomy enough especially since we didnt spend that much time there. We had twin beds which are equivalent to a small double bed. I left a list for housekeeping ( a long list mind you) and they accommodated and gave us everything on the list.Now the little gripes - The kettle in our room was terrible and had to be boiled twice and there was no clock which was a bit of a pain. Take your own hairdryer as the one supplied is attached inside the bedside drawer and the on button had to be held down constantly.... this was very annoying.The curtains are great though - block out which keeps the room nice and dark. I cant rave about the buffet breakfast.... very very ordinary compared to other hotel buffets I have had, but ample enough. I would not pay extra for the breakfast (we had it included in our rate) as there is food very close by. I loved the fact that MCDonalds - MCCafe was right next door as I could get my coffee fix regularly. The buffet finishes at 10am which I think is too early - especially when you are in no rush to get up in the morning as the shops dont open till 10-11am.The free water and drinks was a great bonus as there is not really a supermarket that close to buy these things. There is a shopping centre across the road - Far East Plaza which was very convenient and had great shopping-- better than the expense of Orchard Road.So, I would definately return and recommend this hotel.
