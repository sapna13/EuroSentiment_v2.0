{"text":"Save your money.....go elsewhere...terrible resort!!!! Very, Very disappointed with this resort. This was our fourth trip to the Dominican and we have loved it everytime.....except this time. This resort was a 2-star at best. First the good: the rooms were very nice. The a la carte restaurants were nice. That's about it. Now the bad: With the exception of the Cafe Dominicana bar, the drinks at the resort were horrible. Oh, they have top shelf liquor, but it's not all inclusive. You must pay $7.00 per SHOT (not per drink) for any top shelf liquor. So, for a Long Island Ice Tea, you're looking at over $30 for the drink! The bars were very ill-equipped. You have to repeatedly ask for ice in your drinks, and one bartender told me the reason there were never any limes at the bar was because they were too expensive. Also, unless you ask for alcohol in your drink, you don't get any!! Unless the drink is on their menu, they don't know how to make it. For example, I ordered a martini (which I had to pay $7.00 for), and they didn't know how to make it. How much more basic than a martini can you get?? My daughter's air conditioner in her room did not work, so she was finally moved after 2 days...to another room with an inoperable air conditioner! After 4 days and much complaining, the air conditioner was finally fixed.  I speak a fair amount of spanish, but I was surprised at how little English staff members speak. I can't even imagine someone going there who speaks no spanish....they'd be lost. There is a large local contingent always present at the resort. The resort is located right next to a suburban residential area of private apartments\/townhouses. ALL the residents have access to the resort, so it gets very crowded. As mentioned earlier, the a la carte restaurants were ok. The central buffet was not.....the same food every single day...no variety. Same with the pizza snack bar, and the same with the beach snack bar. Whatever you do, don't order a hamburger...it doesn't taste like any beef I've ever had before. The animation team was a joke. They too were very predictable....same thing every day....stretching and volleyball. That, coupled with EXTREMELY LOUD music blaring on the beach (and I might add, many of the same songs over and over and over again....enough already). And speaking of the beach, there are NO umbrellas of ANY KIND on the beach. Every other resort in the Dominican has thatch-roofed umbrellas for those not wanting to stay in the sun all day.......not this place.  If one had never been to the Dominican before, or to an all-inclusive before, one might think this is a nice place. But believe me, spend a few more dollars and go elsewhere. We have previously stayed the the Grand Oasis Resort, and the Sunscape Resort (coincidentally, located right next to each other). We had a wonderful time at both resorts and would highly recommend them over this place. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!
