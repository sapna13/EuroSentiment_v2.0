{"text":"A nice Hotel, but a couple of problems I stayed at the Giada for 4 nights in September 2006.A very nice Hotel, very comfortable, with a good bathroom.However, I would describe the Hotel as a bit antiseptic. It was cold and uninviting not a friendly warm Hotel where the staff became involved with the guests welfare. The staff were not overly friendly and the Hotel sometimes even smelled a bit of antiseptic. The famous San Lorenzo markets are in the same street as the Hotel making the Hotel a bit hard to find. I was really looking forward to seeing the markets and walking through them each time I left the Hotel. However, that was not to be the case. I found the markets to be a real inconvience and a dammed nuisence. They were extremely noisy and had nothing but junk. Most of the traders were north Africans who peddled leather goods and rubbish. There was absolutely nothing Italian about these markets at all. If you are looking for a real Italian market experience, you will be very disappointed..They started early in the morning and did not clear away until about 9-00pm at night. During this time the noise level was extreme and sometimes the noise continued on into the small hours of the morning, with the younger traders playing football and generally making a lot of noise. This did affect sleeping and it is a problem for this Hotel.The presence of the markets also made it impossible to see and photograph the old Medici chapels over the road from the Hotel.I would definately not go so far as to tell people not to stay at the Hotel. If the staff had been a bit more friendly and the markets had not been there I would have described the Hotel as excellent.It is very close to some wonderful restaurants and most importantly, it is within walking distance of the main Railway Station to enable you to drag your luggage there instead of getting a taxi. I would guess the distance to be about 400 meters.
