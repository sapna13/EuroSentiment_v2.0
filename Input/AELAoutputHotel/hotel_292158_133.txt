{"text":"Once again, spectacular!!!! Once again the Grand Palladium has done it!! This was our third trip to the Palladium in Punta Cana,but a first for my sister  her husband....... and they have been converted!! They are planning to return there again next year!As always the staff were wonderful at every turn,,, how they do it is beyond me...there were many occasions where I wished I would have spoke up , to let some of the guests know just how rude they were being to the staff. They rarely raised their eyes up ,when their wine was being re-filled before it was half gone!And on most occasions left without leaving a tip...This was also the first time, that I have had trouble with other guests taking a beach lounger (2 in fact) that had our towels on it! And when I caught them dragging the 2nd one away , they lied to my face  said ...in french ...and with hand signals ..that it wasn't mine....so I sat  stared in utter amazement...at the odacity of some people. Luckily, one of their party found 2 more chairs....and they gave me mine back( with the towels) and apologized (in french) that I didn't understand French!!!...Anyways , these particular quest were a thorn in my side....but it didn't ruin a Fabulous holiday at the Palladium!!! But in stead of giving Spanish lessons to questsof certain counties , they should be given ettiqette lessons intead!How to treat the staff who treats them so wonderfully..... ","annotations":[]}
