{"text":"Really good, but not as great as I expected The hotel is physically attached to the other two lower class iberostar hotels so technically all three hotels share the same grounds although people seem to stay within their grounds. Demographics seemed to be mostly middle class European and American in their late 30s to 50s at Iberostar Bavaro and lower middle class and young student groups in the other two hotels with fewer children The Bavaro Iberostar is a good clean hotel for a family vacation with decent size rooms, no insects within the compound (I saw personnel fumigating constantly) and well manicured from a landscaping perspective. The service and personnel are truly amazing, these people are so good at making you feel like the king.The best feature in my opinion is Lucys Club, a 9am to 5pm kids club that allows for the parents to do adult activities while the kids as a group go everywhere from the mini golf, to the beach, to the pool and they also have a small musical show at 7:30 every night (all the kids dance and sing)The pool is nice but too shallow and small. The buffet food is just above average, while they have a fairly large selection of everything nothing is out of this world or impressive. Hot dogs and burgers are served daily for lunch. The alcohol is mostly well drinks, no quality alcohol is served. The gourmet restaurants are honestly not gourmet, just average food coated with excellent service.Activities seemed to be limited to the typical, although water motor sports are non existant. I took scuba diving lessons and had a great time. The night shows are really amusing and enterntaining for the whole family and it's a good way to enjoy some time together after dinner.Overall it was a great family vacation if you don't want to go for the high end resorts.
