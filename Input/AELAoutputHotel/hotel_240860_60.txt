{"text":"Ultra Modern Hotel We stayed at this hotel for a 5 night break. We wanted a 5 star hotel and that is exactly what we got. From the minute you walk into the Reception the staff are there to look after you. Every single member of staff spoke english from the girls who tidied our room every day to the waiting staff. We arrived at the hotel at 11.30 a.m. we were taken to the first floor lounge, served two glasses of champagne and within 20 mins. the girl who checked us in brought us to our room (our luggage was waiting for us). The room was spectacular and the views were breathtaking. I have read previous comments of ships docking and distrubing peoples sleep etc. and I am a light sleeper! but this did not distrurb me.The breakfast is wonderful with the choice of sitting outside or inside. There is a wonderful choice and everybody is catered for.The only downside I would see to this hotel is that it is definitely geared more towards the business traveller, being in the world trade centre it attracts a lot of business class visitors. In saying that it did not bother us, but if you are looking for a hotel with character, charm etc. I dont think this is for you. It is ultra modern and ultra chic and unfortunately, the two do not go hand in hand.One word of warning, there are a lot of homeless people just outside the hotel and I found this quiet scary at times. There is a lovely park outside the front of the hotel and these poor unfortuantes camp there for the night. It is worth taking a taxi at night as some areas of barcelona can be quiet seedy.
