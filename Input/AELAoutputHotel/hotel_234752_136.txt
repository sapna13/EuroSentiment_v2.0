{"text":"Wonderful Hotel! my husband and i stayed at the nine zero for three nights earlier this month...we were very happy with our entire stay. the staff was one of the nicest we have ever encountered in all of our hotel stays and we do alot of travel. the hotel is small but intimate with a private feel. you never see many people in the lobby ...it is quiet and calm. we stayed in a corner view room on the 14th floor and had an amazing view, the windows were huge and it had a really wonderful urban feel. the room was spaced nicely even though it was not big. the matress was the best one i have slept on in a long time including just about every 5 star hotel. the linens were wonderful, clean crisp and white with great pillows. we were greated with a fruit plate and coffee as we arrived early in the morning. it was so nice to check in early with no questions asked. the room had a great choice of magazines and daily newspapers. the spiro restaurant was an excellant place for drinks and a snack. nice atmosphere. we also had a few fabulous breakfasts there. my only complaint was of the young bartenders behind the second floor bar at night. both during room service and at the spiro bar itself they were cold and did not know anything about the wines they had in stock, nor did they care to find out. it seemed as if they were bored students just making their buck , it supprised me that this would be the case since everyone else in the entire hotel was excellent...in spite of that we still had a nice time while we were there. Akeem and Thomas were EXTREMELY EXCEPTIONAL front house workers...anything you wanted they would help you with ( and with a real smile, not some phony yes sir or yes mame service.) the location cant be beat. its right next to park and a 5 min T ride to airport or a 10 min cab ride to airport. lots of great shopping and restaurants nearby and accross the park. the free internet access was a nice touch as well as the wine happy hour which we seemed to keep missing. the hotel had somewhat of a W feel but a much much nicer staff and cozier feel. we will definitely be back and will try out the other kimptons.
