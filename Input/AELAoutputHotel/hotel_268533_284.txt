{"text":"Argonaut great for families What a great place, particularly for families with young kids. Very good staff, not fawning √à√\u2020\u2022?just friendly, cool and on the ball. They sorted out babysitters and had a kids√à√\u2020\u2022?treasure box of free (cheap) toys. Very new hotel, lots of space everywhere, and although the nautical theme is taken a bit far, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not distasteful, actually quite fun. The Blue Mermaid restaurant is pretty good, great with kids, nice and relaxed and good value. Why it shuts at 9pm was beyond us √à√\u2020\u2022?go there early!Lovely big suite for $479 a night + tax which we thought was good value compared to our horror experience at its sister hotel, the Triton. Modern, very clean and spacious, with a superb deep hot-tub bath and Alcatraz framed in our bedroom window like a postcard. The area is touristy, but not crowded, and we liked it as a base for a 3 day stay. The cable car stop is just round the corner, so off you go into the rest of the city, and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ very handy for the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, bike hire (next door), seafood restaurants and so on. Cabs are so cheap that you can get to Union Square for $9, so being out of the centre doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really matter, and it has a nice laid back vibe down there. The wine tasting was a bit of a joke - a choice of two cheap wines, one of which was from Australia, but at least it filled up the spacious lounge with happy guests.One thing - don't make the mistake I made and call abroad from the room's phone. I had to change our rental car booking and a 10 minute call to an international Freephone number cost $128!!!! They halved it when I complained, but even so....Phone charges aside, we'd highly recommend The Argonaut.
