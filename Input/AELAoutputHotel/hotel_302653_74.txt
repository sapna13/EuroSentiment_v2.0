{"text":"Value for money I spent 1 week in Melia Bali in March 2006 and have mixed feelings about the trip. Of course, 70 USD per room is a very good price but there are several things to remember:1. The hotel is located in the forest, so you are back to back with nature. The views are amazing, but this results in very wet conditions everywhere. And there is nothing anyone can do about it. Neither the conditioner nor the staff can help. You just have to know that wet clothes will never be dry again; that paper will be also kinda wet. As for me it was no problem, it was like living in a jungle wood.2. The sea in Nusa Dua is very quiet. It is not good for diving etc. It is also a shallow and you should not forget about ebbs and flows. For us it was no problem since we used to swim close to the rocks (150+ metres from the beachline) with big waves.3. Staff is great. They will bring back the moon by your request.4. Food is also nice but of course overpriced as compared to the city.5. Rent-a-car is good, you can explore the island which is very big for several days and pay 25USD per day.6. No LAN in the rooms, however good set of TV channels. Internet is available in the business centre (but expensive like in most of asian underdeveloped countries).To conclude: good and very well priced but not for everyone. ","annotations":[]}
