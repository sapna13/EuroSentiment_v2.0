{"text":"Loved it We had read all the great reviews and we were looking forward to our stay .We checked in late evening and were warmly greeted and shown to a choice of rooms .The room we chose turned out to be a little noisy as I am a very light sleeper .The following morning we were moved to a room looking over the courtyard .Much better ,the room was very nice and clean and quite .Loved the roof beams and comfy bed .We enjoyed the bar and had drinks there every night of our 4 night stay . My wife used the gym every day and liked it a lot .I liked the free Internet in my room .The whole Hotel is very clean and tidy and the staff very helpful .Could not have asked for more .We had breakfast every day at the Hotel .Yes it seems expensive at 15 euros but you get as much coffee as you want and the food is very fresh and tasty .You can have bacon and eggs for another 2.50 Euros .The lady who serves Breakfast does not speak English and can appear to be grumpy but she gets the job done .There are a lot of great restaurants in walking distance .Wonderful food and wine at dinner for about $75 for 2 .About the same as the States .The gardens are opposite the hotel and are very nice .We had a wonderful time in Paris and would stay here again with out doubt .
