{"text":"This place is fabulous! The Hotel Antiche Figure is fully deserving of the praise it receives on this site. We thought the location was ideal - if you are carrying even a little bit of luggage, the steps and bridges of Venice can be a nightmare. Antiche Figure is steps away from the train station - cross one bridge and there you are. It is also close to some wonderful parts of Venice that are less touristy, such as Santa Croce.We had a lovely room with a canal view. The room was done in a classic Venetian style and looked pretty glam overall. We had no problems with canal noise, as the windows are likely soundproofed and had substantial shutters. The bathroom was spacious. There was plenty of closet space and a large desk in the room. They serve breakfast in a very nice dining area just off of the lobby. They made us a cappuccino every morning and the breakfast was quite good.The thing that makes this hotel a true gem is the service. The staff could not have been more helpful. The made dinner reservations for us, and then re-arranged them to accommodate the changes in weather so we could dine outside. One staff member actually remembered where we were having dinner one evening and took the time to ask us about it. They were also excellent about providing directions, which is a much needed service in a place like Venice. As we were checking out on our way to Florence, another member of the hotel staff gave us dining suggestions and even a few menu choices! These people are a class act.I would absolutely stay at Antiche Figure again - bravo!
