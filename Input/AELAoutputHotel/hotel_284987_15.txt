{"text":"Held Hostage at the Gran Melia My wife and I stayed at the Gran Melia as part of a conference. We've stayed in many nice resorts and hotels but we've never stayed in a resort that went so far out of it's way to take advantage of the guests. The illusion of luxury is little more than an overwrought resort experience lacquered over modern-day resort piracy.You begin your sentence with a $35\/person shuttle to the resort. You can rent a car in San Juan but they charge you about $15-20 a day to park it. Each group's calculus may differ but we should have rented a car in San Juan. The Avis agency in the actual resort charged me a little over $70 to rent their subcompact for the day. In the end, the resort does everything they can to keep there, preferably running up your bar tab.The food was outrageously overpriced and not very good. Your dinner options include an Asian Fusion, Italian, and a sort of Caribbean themed Cafe. (During our stay one was closed each night) The portions were very small and the dishes, while very artistically plated, were substandard. I asked to see a wine list but was dismayed when A) half the wines were not actually available and B) the rest cost almost as much as my airfare. There's also atmosphere problems- you're not close enough to the ocean, the napkins are disposable, and since there's no casual (or cheaper) place for dinner, half the guests look like bums. Olive Garden or Red Lobster would have been a substantial improvement. The waitstaff was polite, but not very charismatic, helpful, knowledgeable, or experienced.While Gran Melia's grounds get high marks for being immaculate, it has atmosphere problems, too. No actual sand was harmed in the making of the beach. It's rocky, silty, and not great for swimming. A walk at dusk on the beach led us to discover hundreds of tiny hermit crabs which was enough to make my inner naturalist jump for joy.  The pool is enormous, which is great, but there's no shade. After seeing the pool at the Rio Mar resort I realized how disappointing the Melia's sun-baked pool was. A hot tub\/spa is available for those guests that wish to spend $28 for a one-day spa membership. Gran Melia's lodging sprawls across 16 different multi-room bungalows and a handful of more expensive villas. The rooms themselves are exquisite with marble tile and nice fixtures. The compounds are connected by paths that are adorned by tropical plants, immaculate bermudagrass, and endemic iguanas. (My wife and I found the large iguanas endearing but other guests were a little put off) I liked walking the paths but I grew weary of the golf carts that the staff used, buzzing through and roaring like B-29s while I dove for the bushes. The rooms were nice but there weren't bathrobes or sandals or any of the other sundries you might expect from true luxury establishments. Our unit's air conditioner only worked 50% of the time but I'm not a real A\/C-o-phile so it didn't bother me that much. I imagine that it was a problem with our room and not with every room.The Casino was a little anemic-.a Casino without craps is like a prom date without a corsage- in bluejeans.Puerto Rico has SO MANY awesome things to do close together that I don't know why I would stay in a resort that penalized you for wanting to get out and see them on your own.Pros: Beautiful Grounds, RoomsCons: Food, Location, Beach, just about everything else.
