{"text":"Great resort I would rate this as one of the nicest places I have stayed. We got an excellent deal @ $130\/night (bookinhotels.com) when the average listed price is somewhere around ($250-$350\/night) - well worth the price-tag. 30 minute drive from San Juan airport, located right on beach with excellent grounds and gardens. Check-in was quick and pleasant; staff was gracious to upgrade us to a ocean-view room for the same price, however the view of the ocean was at an angle (we didn't mind that). Rooms are large, had a flat-screen tv (hardly watched tv), internet-connection, large well-lit, clean and nice bathroom, large balcony with a chairs and table. (We personally like the bath  body works toileteries that Wyndham provides, better than the ones in Hilton). The Wyndham's mantra is service and service we recieved was excellent. Unlike other hotels, beach towels were really soft, you could even take them to you room and not necessarily need to drop it off the @ the towel hut before going to your hotel room. Pools are great, separate one for adults, 2nd pool even had a small water-slide - how cool! We liked the breakfast, you do not necessarily have to eat buffet - b\/f from menu was equally good, filling and cheaper. Conceirge desk is helpful but avoid getting talked into a timeshare presentation, which would eat up your day.Richie's cafe which seems to be very popular with staff and others, is overpriced and average, view from the cafe is good though. Downside of staying @ Rio Mar is that your eating choices outside of the hotel are limited unless you are ready to drive 30 minutes to either San Juan or Fajardo. Would recommend having a rental car unless you plan on staying @ the resort at all times. Do the tours yourself - El Yunque, Bacardi etc.. you will save a bunch of money.
