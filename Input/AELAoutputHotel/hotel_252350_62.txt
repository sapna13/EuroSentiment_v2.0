{"text":"Exceeded our expectations! We stayed at the Watertown from 9\/11 through 9\/13\/07 as part of a tour of Seattle\/Vancouver\/Victoria. We booked the Watertown based upon reviews here at Tripadvisor.This hotel more than exceeded our expectations, particularly for hotels in its price range. First, the hotel. The rooms were large, clean and very modern in design, with an in-room safe, dorm-sized fridge, microwave, and coffee pot, complete with complementary coffee and popcorn. Views were so-so -- our room looked over an empty lot that was being rebuilt. If you want to see the Seattle skyline, then pay more for a downtown hotel.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is a few blocks away from University Avenue, which is the main drag for the University of Washington -- lots of shops, restaurants, etc. Just around the corner from the hotel is a vegan restaurant, Araya, if you're looking for vegan\/vegetarian cuisine. The hotel also has a free shuttle service to\/from downtown, so you can park your car in the free and secure, gated parking lot at the hotel and let the drivers take you downtown and pick you up. You can get downtown on the hour and picked up on the half hour, and if you're not sure how long you'll be, you can call the front desk to arrange a pick-up time and one of two pre-arranged pick-up spots. When we were there, the downtown buses were free to ride, which made this service even more valuable.The hotel is also along several bus lines if you prefer that route. There is a major shopping mall just down down the street, including a 24-hour grocery store (QFC), though you'll need your car to get to it. If you live in the midwest, the QFC is part of the Kroger chain, so if you plan to buy some groceries for the room and want to take advantage of the loyalty discounts, bring your Kroger card, which they'll accept!The complementary breakfast is outstanding -- scrambled eggs, sausage or bacon (different each day we were there), lots of oatmeal, cereal, fresh fruit, muffins, bagels, toast, juice, coffee, tea, dairy and soy milk, etc. All you need to get started (or pack a light lunch...). The workout room is relatively small but functional -- couple of bikes, some free weights, a couple of treadmills -- and is also where the free washer and dryer unit is located. You need to supply your own detergent or buy it from the front desk. We didn't have any problems using the wash, but since there is only one of each, it could conceivably get busy, so plan accordingly. Although the gym closes at 10 p.m., you can access the washer\/dryer throughout the night with your room key.Oh, and the hotel also features themed complementary carts that you may want to check out if you have some time in the room. We tried the spa cart, which included a portable massager, foot bath, some salts, tea, and other bath products. Very nice way to end a day of walking! Other carts included a computer\/printer combo, kids carts, board games, etc. (Book the cart in advance or when you check-in). If you need internet access, the room comes with complementary wired internet and even includes the CAT-5 cable so you don't need to bring one. Our room TV lacked any A\/V inputs so we couldn't watch any DVDs or Netflix downloads from our laptop, but since we didn't get into the room until late both nights, that didn't really matter to us. They do have a movie cart, though, if you want to borrow a TV\/DVD hook-up and watch movies.As others have noted, the hotel also has a wine bar, but we didn't have a chance to try it ourselves. Prices for wine and food seemed reasonable, though.Overall, this hotel was a great value and we would definitely recommend it if you're looking for an affordable, unique alternative to traditional and expensive downtown hotels.
