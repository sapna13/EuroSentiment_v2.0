{"text":"Wonderful hotel, cannot wait to return I stayed at this lovely hotel in this beautiful city for three nights (May 22 - 25) and I wish had booked a longer stay. I would like to keep the hotel a secret but that would not be fair! They deserve the business. The staff made my stay very special. By far this was the best hotel that I stayed at in Italy. I would recommend you choose this property for your stay for the following reasons:The staff - From the minute I arrived I was treated with the utmost courtesy and professionalism. All of the staff (I apologize I do not know all of their names) were wonderful. Each guest is treated like a valued customer. The lovely lady at the front desk was so pleasant when I arrived. She took the time to explain all of the main sites and options for accessing Venice. Linda (the very nice lady in the breakfast room) makes you a great cappuccino in the morning and is very pleasant. It is a nice way to start your day. The breakfast selection was great (meats, cheeses, cereals, pastries and juice). The location - it is right across the canal from the train station. You exit the train station to the left, cross the bridge and turn right and you are at the hotel. You do not have to drag your luggage on boats and canals. It is very convenient. In addition, the vaporetto stop (Ferrovia) is across the canal so you can easily access all of the sites. Tip:you can buy a 48 hour ACTV pass for 26.00 Euros or a 72 hour pass for 31 Euros. Walking is also possible with the signs that point you to San Marco and Rialto. I recommend a walk at night in particular. The room - I was upgraded to a beautiful suite which was located beside the hotel. It was spotlessly clean with excellent housekeeping service. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was large with a shower\/tub combination. The suite had a full kitchen and two TVs. The toiletries were very nice and replaced daily.The hotel also has a very nice bar and at night you can sit at your table and enjoy a glass of wine while overlooking the canal. TIP: I enjoyed a lovely meal at Trattoria al Ponte Tel: [-] Address: Ponte del Megio (Calle Larga), Santa Croce 1666 The sea bass was excellent!I cannot wait to return to Venice and to this hotel. Thanks again to all of the staff at the Hotel Antiche Figure for your hospitality.
