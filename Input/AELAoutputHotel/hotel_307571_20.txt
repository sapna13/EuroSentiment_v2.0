{"text":"As Good As It Gets Stayed at the Four Seasons Jimbaran bay in August 2007 for 15 nights. This place is just perfect. It's expensive for sure, but I don't mind paying for what you get and this place delivers it in big shovelfuls.So many great things to say about it. The staff and service is top notch, food and wine excellent, rooms wonderful... I am extremely hard to please but I couldn't find fault with this place.Went there with hubby and almost 3 year old daughter. Kids club is superb, right next to the sun loungers on the beach and kids to staff ratio was almost 1:1. They were looking for my daughter in the morning and were genuinely pleased to see and play with her. Eveey day had a new activity for the kids to get involved with, or not. It was laid back fun, and had a shallow, shaded and supervised pool for the kids. The babysitting is complimentary until 11pm, but we never used it in the evening because the hotel made eating together a joy too.The place is beautiful and caters equally well for families and couples. Everyone is made to feel special. The restaurants are good or a taxi to somewhere nearby (Ku De Ta, Nusa Dua...) is cheap and easy also.The management and staff were superb, and we even spent a night in their sister hotel in Ubud. Not so kid-friendly but a great trip nonetheless. Hotel allowed us to just go up their and spend a night at no extra cost.This was by far the best holiday we ever had and I wouldn't hesitate to go back. We were all so happy and relaxed by the end, which is magical. The whole holiday exceeded any expectations I had, and as a result everywhere else suddenly pales in comparison. Better work hard to pay for another one, eh?!If you go there, try Beds on the Beach and try and nab one of the four poster beds.
