{"text":"Gold floor - Great family vacation Best:- great location, great neighborhood for shopping, restaurants, strolling. One block from T and one block from Amtrak station at Back Bay.- great free breakfast in lounge. I think they say it's a limited service, but it's a big buffet. Hot dishes were usually eggs and potatoes. Bagels, english muffins, breads, superb croissants, pastries, coffee cake, smoked salmon, oatmeal, yoghurt, fruits, cheese, and more. Several fantastic staff are working very hard to refill coffee, clear plates, and make sure everything is going great.- free coffee, water, juice, and soft drinks all day.- free hors d'oervres every evening rotate through different Boston themes (e.g. North End = Italian etc...)- Great spacious room. Great bathroom.- relaxed atmosphere with a wide variety of clients. You don't feel like you have to dress up to go to breakfast, but you don't have kids throwing cheerios at you either.- free internet (ethernet) in room and two PCs available in the lounge. Wireless also supposed to be available.Not the best:- service was a little inconsistent. Gold floor staff were always smiling, friendly, and polite. As noted in other reviews, bellman\/doormen don't seem to do much. Evening turn-down came late or not at all. Check-in\/out seemed almost too casual. No paperwork, no questions. They just gave me the keys when I arrived and took them back when I left.- cable TV choices seemed a bit limited. Mostly news and sports. No disney, no nick, no bravo, no ifc and so on.- lounge has DVDs that you can borrow for free to play in the room, but the selection is pathetic.
