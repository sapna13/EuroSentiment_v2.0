{"text":"Average hotel in great location Stayed at the Four Points for a week on business. As a hotel, it's fine but not exceptional. My overall conclusion is that it's not making the most of its excellent location.The location is certainly fantastic, right by Darling Harbour - you can be on the boardwalk within a minute of leaving the hotel and this means that there loads of bars and restaurants literally on your doorstop. In addition, the main shopping area is only a five minute walk away in the other direction. Although the view from my room, onto the harbour, was wonderful, overall I would say that the bedroom and faciltiies were average. The room was slightly on the small side for what I would expect, it had an OK bathroom (which was functional rather than impressive) and a sense that the fixtures and fittings were starting to wear thin. All in all it felt like it's time for refurbishment. .I didn't use the restaurant but did make frequent use of room service. The service itself was slightly above average but the quality of the food was average to poor - a shamefully lame plate of fruit offering being a noticeable weakness. The lobby area gives a good impression of size and is relatively grand, but the corridors felt a bit gloomy. There isn't a hotel bar in the traditional sense - more like a pub tagged on the side. This was fine and although it didn't feel like it was part of the hotel I found that a good thing. Felt comfortable being in there by myself. ","annotations":[]}
