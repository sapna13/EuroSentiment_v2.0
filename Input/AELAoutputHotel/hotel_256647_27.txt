{"text":"Only stay here out of desperation Stamford Plaza Airport Hotel Sydney: Stayed for 1 night `9th July 2007. Pre paid for a deluxe room on the top 2 floors of this supposedly √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂?ith refurbished rooms√à√\u2020\u2022? Ours did not appear to us to have been done, if it had, it was not apparent. The rooms are not deluxe at all, no trouser press, no goodies, just a plain basic hotel room. Not what you would call a 5 star deluxe hotel of the quality of any Asian stop-over hotel nor of European deluxe standards.Upon check-in they said the room was not pre-paid, it took me, not the hotel some 3 hours of telephoning around the globe before at 11pm, some 6 hours after check-in for the hotel to acknowledge the room was paid in full. There was neither a reservation manager on duty nor a front desk manager just an assistant night manager on duty from 5pm. He was also the hotels night manager, who just hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ got a clue how to sort my problem out, as I was leaving on a 6am flight he said the reservation will resolve this after 9am tomorrow when they come in. For a supposedly 5 start hotel this hotel is very badly run from a gusts point of view.Our mini bar had nine (9) items missing upon check-in; it took them 2 hours to send someone to the room to fill it. They then said it was the past guest fault as they must have stolen the items after check-out. Be warned this is a very badly managed establishment.They only have one restaurant, which is next to then main entrance foyer and on a cold night the wind and draft from the main hotel entrance opening and closing made it a very chilly meal indeed. The food was deplorable; the selection on the menu was not of a deluxe standard hotel. One could say very 2 star food menu. The staff were almost all trainees and work experience, only one experience waiter on duty to serve a full airport hotel restaurant on its main evening shift. They were unable to cope and it showed in all of the food quality and service. They ended up giving us a bottle of wine as the soup served was in fact, coloured water. They all agreed that it was not soup and how it was served they have no idea, the steak was so tough that you had to slice it very thinly to even be able to chew it. With no management on duty to complain to, no wonder this hotel has such bad service, they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ care about guests here, as it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ on the airport. I suppose they have the attitude that because of so many delayed flights they will always be able to fill their rooms.Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ book this hotel for a luxury stay or a quality meal, book this out of desperation only, there are many good hotels in Sydney to choose from, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ choose this Stamford Plaza Airport Hotel.
