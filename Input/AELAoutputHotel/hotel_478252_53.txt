{"text":"Amazing Resort! My boyfriend and I just returned from a week at The Bahia Principe Bavaro and we had a fantastic experience. From the moment we got onto the bus to the resort everything was very organized. We were given an information package on the resort and the staff checked us into our rooms (arm-bands etc) before we even got off the bus! This saved time in line at the front desk. Our room was large and very clean. The bathroom was lovely with a huge soaker tub. The resort is huge so there are bus stops throughout the property and a trolley that comes every 2 or 3 minutes to bring guests to the lobby or pool\/beach. The property itself was immaculate. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe traveled many times to the Caribbean and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe never experienced such a beautifully maintained resort. The bushes, grass and flowers were kept in perfect condition. We never saw any garbage on the ground the entire week we were there. The main pool by the beach was very large and clean. The beach was one of the nicest I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe ever experienced. The water was crystal clear and you could tell the beach was maintained on a daily basis. The service at the bars, lobby and restaurants was great. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. Most of the employees spoke English or at least tried and this made us feel right at home. All of the dining we experienced was delicious. The buffet had several options and we were never bored with the food. The Garden Grill and Japanese a la carte restaurants were top notch.We decided to go on a day trip to the Saona Island. The trip was an entire day experience traveling by bus and then on a speed boat and catamaran. The only downfall is the amount of time spent on the bus. We left the hotel at 7:15 am and did not return until 7:30 p.m. and during this time we were on the bus for about 5-6 hours. The sights on the island are beautiful, but just be prepared for a very long day on a bus. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience and would return to this resort in a second. This was our first time to the Dominican Republic and it certainly won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be our last. I would definitely recommend this resort when traveling to D.R. you won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be disappointed. ","annotations":[]}
