{"text":"Excellent Hotel Excellent hotel. Stayed 11\/4\/07 - 11\/7\/07. We we booked for a room on the 2nd floor but I asked about availability higher up upon check-in. They graciously and quickly accommodated and we received a room on the 7th floor (highest floor) with a gorgeous view. They called it a partial view but I don't know why. It was a gorgeous view of everything. There's nothing negative that can be said about this hotel. One minor thing... $20.00\/night for parking. But, it's completely secure parking and worth the price. You can walk to the space needle. It took us about 10 minutes. PT is close by. They're building a light rail across the street so I imagine when Spring rolls around that will be ready. Still, the monorail starts at the space needle and that takes you right downtown so that was a great way to get around. We didn't have to drive our rental car once when we were visiting the downtown area. The exercise room and pool are top-notch. Everything is very, very clean. The breakfast was more than fantastic with a huge selection of whatever you want. Check out the restaurant across the street called Joey's! Wow! Excellent food, service, atmosphere. Casual dress is fine although you wish you dressed up but only because it's such a beautiful restaurant. I highly recommend Joey's. It was a perfect hotel all-around and I would absolutely stay there again. Free Starbucks coffee in the lobby 24\/7! And it was always fresh!
