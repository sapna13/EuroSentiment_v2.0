{"text":"Good location if you're a sports fan The reviews of this hotel made us approach a bit nervously, but we came wanting to give it a fair chance. Our room was booked online, and we stayed for 3 nights over Super Bowl weekend. The facility was adequate, and certainly not awful (no bedbugs, roaches, or problems mentioned in other reviews). But there were a number of little quirks, and a couple of big problems that may or may not have been the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ fault. First, the quirks: Carpets (room and hallways) not terrible, but could use replacement. Low shower pressure. Bedside lamp and clock were unplugged, and the plug was behind the mattress, where they would get jossled loose repeatedly. Beds were of different heights√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√¨¬Æ√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not sure why. Fitness room is only a few bikes and treadmills√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√®o weights. None of these were big problems, but just little quirks. Now, about the bigger problems. We were surprised that we were charged a daily fee for an in-room safe, and a resort fee. Not that these fees were a lot, but we would appreciate knowing ahead of time. Second, we had no idea that the hotel had rented out the bar and restaurant to another company that was selling superbowl tickets and admission to their pre-game and during-game parties. Part of our attraction to booking this hotel was the possibility of watching the big game in their sports bar. We were shocked to find out that admission to the bar during the super bowl would be $400. They also had another $400 pre-game party. (We talked them down to $50 for the super bowl meal, which was admittedly a pretty good buffet.) Again, these issues may have been the fault of the company that rented the restaurant space, rather than the hotel itself. Lesson learned: Be sure to find out ahead of time whether a special event in the area makes a difference in the price of the hotel amenities. To sum up our review, El Palacio has the best location for sports fans, being the closest to Dolphin stadium. But if your Miami plans are more about beaches or other activities, you should stay in South Beach or somewhere else. And be sure to investigate thoroughly whether a special event in the area will affect the prices of meals, parking, and other amenities. ","annotations":[]}
