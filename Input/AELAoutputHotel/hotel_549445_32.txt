{"text":"Staff rude and unhelpful We were really not very impressed with this hotel. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a YWCA, part of which has been transformed into a so-called hotel. We were certainly paying hotel prices (over $200 per night) but felt like we were staying in a youth hostel still. For instance, there was no carpet in our room, instead it had the sort of yellow linoleum floor tiles you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° find in a school classroom. The shower cubicle was also like something out of a school changing room; there was absolutely nowhere to put your shampoo container in the shower, apart from on the floor of the cubicle and after a few minutes you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° find the shampoo bottle floating in the water which was accumulating happily at the bottom of the shower. The shower head was fixed in place, and the only way you could switch the shower on was to place your arm underneath the shower head and get it soaked in freezing cold water. Despite a sign in the bathroom telling us that the room was √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂\u2022o smoking√à√\u2020\u2022?and that we would be charged huge sums of money to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√¥eep clean√à√\u2020\u2022?the room if the room smelt of smoke after our stay, our room absolutely reeked of smoke when we arrived, and only receded by the third day. The furniture was all veneered plywood, and there was a conveniently placed shelf just above the bed to bang your head on when you sat up.The worst aspect of our stay was the palaver we had with our room keycards. On our third day, after we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° spent hours walking around Boston following the freedom trail, we went all the way up to our room on the eighth floor to refresh ourselves and have a bit of a rest. But when we arrived at our room, our keycards wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ work. We went all the way back down to reception, and the man at the desk fiddled about with his computer for a bit, muttered something about our room being supposedly √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂?acant√à√\u2020\u2022? and then reprogrammed our key cards. He did all this without any sort of apology, and he reprogrammed our key cards without asking for ID to make sure that we were the people who were supposed to be staying in that room! We were made to feel like we were just an annoyance. Then exactly the same thing happened on our fourth day, and then again on our fifth and final day. Even though we told the woman at the reception desk that this was the third time it had happened, there was still no apology forthcoming, and we were made to feel extremely unwelcome and undervalued. We felt more welcome when we turned up at the Marriot Custom House Hotel one day to go up to their viewing observatory. We weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ paying them a cent, but we were treated courteously and felt welcome. We certainly would not recommend this hotel, as it was the only aspect of our stay in Boston which wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ absolutely wonderful.
