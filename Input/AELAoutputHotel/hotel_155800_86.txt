{"text":"Never ever again will we stay at this hotel!!!! My husband is from PR and we have stayed at many, many hotels while going to PR to visit family over the last 20 years. Also we are very extensive travelers throughout the US and the tropics. We stayed at the Hotel El San Juan 12 of us were staying there (different dates) for my step-daughter's wedding. By the second day, I found myself saying 'I'm sick of staying at such a nice hotel, paying the prices we were paying for room, food, drinks and then we were reprimanded every time we turned around. The ONLY positive I can say is that the housekeeping staff is very good. First time that I've ever stayed in a hotel housekeeping is the highlight of the hotel.Front desk, concierge, bartenders, casino workers, waitresses, waiters, pool attendents and the people working in the hotel shops were beyond rude and VERY much not customer orientated in fact I feel (all of us felt) very much abused and they could care less if we had a complaint in fact it got to the point that they could care less that we were even there. I did collect names of management that I fully intend on writing a letter to the Wyndham chain.If you are even considering going to this hotel, do so just to see the lobby and hear the music - that is the only plus - don't bother with odering a drink - very expensive and very rude bartenders that actually yell at you if you are not properly dressed. The last couples to arrived were walking through the hotel after stepping off the plane to then get their room but wanted a dring (4 drinks - $56.00 and unfortunately I tiped the rude bartender). Granted it is posted that after 7:00 pm you are to be in proper attire - no problem with that but if you need to walk through the lobby to your room after 7:00 and just getting off an airplane - even after explaining this they acted as though they were doing us such a huge favor. Excuse me but if it wasn't for US TOURISTS this hotel would not be in business and I think this is what the management needs to teach their employees - short staffed or not (which I never heard). We all came to the conclusion if you want the status of a 4 star hotel you need to offer more then 1 star service (being generous).Next time I'll stay at the Holiday Inn or the Embassy Suites or the Ritz or possibly the Condado area - heck I'd stay at a Quality Inn before I'd stay at this hotel again. Droppping $3,500 in 3-5 days for 6 of us and not counting what the other couples spent - we'll for sure take our business elsewhere and possibly not even back to PR - at least for any type of vacation.Dr. and Mrs. Peter Antonacopoulos ","annotations":[{"endOffset":429,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":425},{"endOffset":429,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":425}]}
