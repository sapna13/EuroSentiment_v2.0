{"text":"Fabulous Authentic Italian Hotel My husband and I were in Italy for our honeymoon and stayed in Florence for 5 nights. We typically stay at Marriott properties but there are none in Florence so we decided to venture out and try something new. After reading a lot of reviews on TA about Il Perseo we decided to go ahead and book it. We got a great deal that they were offering for Fall in Florence. It is conveniently located within walking distance to the train station which was a bonus for us. When we arrived to the hotel and realized the lobby was on the 3rd floor we were a little concerned but once we got up there (in the very small and old elevator) we couldn't be happier. The gentleman at the front desk was the owner and so nice. He walked us to our upgraded room and made sure that we were comfortable and happy. How could we not be happy we had a HUGE room with a view of the Duomo! Our room had a large bed, a sitting area and a nice size bathroom with a huge shower. The service from all the staff is top notch, they offer complimentary wine in the evening and breakfast in the morning. They are located steps from the Duomo in the heart of Florence. We felt very safe walking all over the city at anytime of the day. Since Florence was my favorite stop on our trip I will definitely be returning and staying at Il Perseo! Great hotel, great location, great staff!!!!
