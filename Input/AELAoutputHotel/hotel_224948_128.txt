{"text":"Why I'll never stay at another Omni Hotel Just a short note to explain to you why I will never stay in another Omni Hotel.I reserved a Signature Room at the Omni San Francisco Hotel through Hotels.com for 4 nights, arriving August 31 and leaving September 4, 2007.When I arrived at the hotel I was informed that they had over-booked their rooms. I was told that I would be put in a lower cost standard room, a room without the Signature Room complimentary services. Needless to say, I was not happy about paying the Signature price for the lower cost room, this because I had paid in advance.When I complained, I was offered a free breakfast. After I refused to accept the room they had offered, I was finally given a Signature Room. No doubt some other poor schmuck got stuck paying top dollar for a standard room. A first-class hotel would never have suggested downgrading a paying customer, regardless of how or how much they paid. But then, Omni isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a first-class hotel.Once I had checked into my Signature accommodations, everything was fine except for one minor detail. On Monday morning, September 3, while entering the bathroom in my suite, I stepped on a carpet nail that was protruding upward out of the carpet in front of the bathroom door. I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think I needed to be concerned about walking barefoot in my own room, not in a first-class hotel.I wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ as angry about being injured by Omni√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ negligence as I was by their response. When I contacted the front desk and explained that a nail had punctured my toe and that I was bleeding profusely, their staff offered me a band-aid. Given the fact that I was in pain and limping, given the fact that I now had to contact my doctor to find out when I last had a tetanus shot, given the fact that I now had to worry about catching some horrible disease from the last person who impaled themselves on their carpet nail - I would have expected a first-class hotel to be more consolatory than to offer me a band-aid.After I returned to my room, the Omni staff sent me a note stating that they were unable to find the nail that had injured me. They insisted that I point out the nail to their building engineer, which I did. As their building engineer was pounded the offending nail back into the floor, he stated that he discovered 2 more nails protruding upward out of the carpet in the same general area. I wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ aware that I was entering a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Øine field√à√\u2020\u2022?when I checked into the Omni hotel.But the final straw occurred as I was checking out of the hotel. The desk clerk inquired as to my stay. I explained the whole sordid tale, the nail, the blood, the limping, everything. I then asked what was the best way to get to the Oakland Airport. To add insult to injury, she suggested that I walk 4 blocks to the BART station.Once I returned home, I contacted the Omni management to complain. The hotel manager promised to send me a voucher for several free nights stay. This never happened. A first-class hotel manager would have been a man of his word.But then, Omni isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a first-class hotel.
