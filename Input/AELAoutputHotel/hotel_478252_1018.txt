{"text":"Bahia Principe- Excellente! Arrival- We were greeted at the airport with music and photo opportunity. After immigration you check in with your tour company and are lead to a tour bus. You are checked in on the bus and greeted at the hotel with a drink and taken directly to your villa. The resort is divided into two sides. Punta Cana and Bavaro , they are identical. We stayed in the Punta Cana side. We stayed in villa number 8- very close to the beach and main pool area. We were Club Golden- don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get an upgrade. We had all the same privileges as the other resort guests.Rooms- Our room was on the first floor. We heard stories of bugs, etc but experienced none of that. Our room was clean and well kept and our mini-bar well stocked. We tipped our maid $2 US a day. We also left notes asking for what we wanted, in our limited Spanish. Our maid also gave us the t-shirts that the guests who paid for the upgraded rooms received. Food and Bars- We had the ability to eat at three ala carte restaurants. We ate at the Mexican, Japanese and French. All were great, the French was fantastic. We ate at the main Buffet 4 nights. The food is fantastic. They offer a huge variety of foods and a great selection of Caribbean foods. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be afraid to try new things. They also have things like fried chicken for people who are afraid. Breakfast at the main buffet is great. They make omelets to order and have great fresh squeezed juices. The Snack Bar near the beach is also great. Hot food and lots of burgers and pasta and hot dogs. All of the bars were good. There are many. The bar in the hotel lobby is very nice. You can sit in the lobby and relax while being served wonderful concoctions by very nice people. It is a nice setting. The bar at the Snack Bar is also nice and Fabio, the bartender, is very friendly. Beach and Pools- The beach is beautiful. Very clean and well kept with white sandy shores and blue water. The hotel has lots of lounge chairs but you maybe out of luck if looking for shade. There is limited shade although you will get a palapa or a coconut tree of you go early enough. No one bothers you or harasses you on the beach. The pools are very clean as well and also have a large number of loungers. There are two jacuzzi√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ in the main pool area. There are two smaller pools on the middle of the property. One is strictly for Club Diamond members but no one will stop you from going in. You can also get a massage or a fake tattoo or hair braiding done near the pools. Entertainment- During the day you can take tours which are extra. We did not do any of these as we saw no need to leave the resort. There were tennis courts which we used. There is also mini-golf and bicycles available on the resort. At night there are shows put on by hotel staff. There is also a Casino which we spent time in. It is very small but adequate. The disco was small but lively. It opens up after the shows are over. Mainly Spanish music is played at the disco. Other- You don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to tip your servers or your maids or bartenders but they deserve to be treated fairly. Just because you are in a 3rd world country you should not forget your manners. These people work very hard and deserve to be rewarded. The resort is immaculate. Very well kept and maintained. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be deterred from going to Bahia Principe.
