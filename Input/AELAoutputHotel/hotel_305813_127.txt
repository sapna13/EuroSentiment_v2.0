{"text":"Excellent hotel, wonderful service, great location We stayed four nights in a Club room in early May. Everything was great about this hotel, from the pickup within moments we arrived at the airport until they dropped us of again four days later (we prebooked the limo service, very efficient email response from the hotel). The location is also brilliant, with old style Hong Kong outside the door and new shiny Hong Kong 10 minutes away on the MTR. Buy an octopus card as soon as you get there, it is the easiest way to travel, it is a type of cash card that you load with money and then use for all your travel needs, MTR, buses etc. You can even use it for shopping, we ended up using it everywhere rather than cash. Public transport is very cheap and superefficient.The hotel itself is spotless, with the most wonderful fragrance everywhere and the staff is lovely. They were always very helpful and friendly with not the slightest hint of snootiness. We had an excecutive Club room which gives you access to the Club lounge on the 36th floor. This is a wonderful calm place to chill out with a drink in the evening, overlooking the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong. The main bar downstairs is very popular and quite noisy so it was nice to chill out with a quiet drink upstairs before going to bed in the evening. The Club lounge is open 24 hours and you have free access to hot and cold drinks, cocktails, some very nice wines, several different kinds of beer, various nibbles, little mini desserts (and very nice too!) etc. This is also where you check in and out if you have booked a Club room. When you are in a Club room breakfast is included, either in the Club lounge or you can take it downstairs in the main breakfast room. The lounge is more quiet of course but the choice is bigger downstairs, with everything from traditional congee and dim sum to the full English, if that is what you like. It was probably the best breakfast buffet we have ever come across. Everything was of excellent quality and the staff very attentive. If you dont fancy eating in the hotel, just walk out the door, the Langham mall is just next door with a large food court, or head out on the streets for some local flavours! There is literally gazillions of options just around the corner.The room itself (on the 35th floor) was of good size, plasma tv and all other mod cons, the airconditioning was easy to control and worked, the bed very comfortable with a mountain of pillows, plus a pillow menu if you fancied even more or different style, including scented pilows. The view over Hong Kong was wonderful, could not have been better, we were overlooking Hong Kong island and Victoria peak. The bathroom was also lovely with a great rainshower and separate bathtub. The evening turndown service also serviced the room, tidying up, checking the towels etc so the room was actually tidied up twice a day! Also left some gorgeous chocolate to look forward to every night....The swimmingpool is on the 42nd floor so needless to say the view is wonderful. It is quite a small roof top area so the sunloungers were often all taken in the afternoon, but it didnt really bother us as we just wanted to cool down with a quick swim before heading out again. Some previous reviewers seems to have issues with the location, however, we felt that it was by far the best location in all of Hong Kong for us. Mongkok is still retaining some old style, where locals still live, and shop. There is a faboulus local food market at the back of the hotel, OK, it is not for the faint hearted as all sorts of living creatures are for sale for the dinnertable, but for us that is what travelling is all about. It is a perfectly safe area, just use your common sense as in all large cities. We wandered around the streets at night, ate at street food stalls and generally had a great time and then went back to our wonderful quiet room for a good nights sleep. When we return to Hong Kong we will definitely be staying here again, as it is one of the best hotels we have ever had the pleasure to stay in.
