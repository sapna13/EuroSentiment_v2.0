{"text":"Pretty good hotel, but with some caveats We recently stayed at this hotel while our kids were attending the Penny Arcade (PAX) video game convention at the Convention Center. We picked the hotel because it was one of the more lower-cost options (it was Labor Day weekend and the Bumbershoot Festival was also going on, so the town was very busy.) Overall, it's not a bad place to stay--here are my pros and cons:PROS:--Friendly, helpful staff--very good about advising about restaurants, directions, booking a car to get us back to the airport, etc.--Comfortable beds, including the sofabed (which is often very uncomfortable in hotel rooms.)--Free breakfast with decent options (cereal, muffins, pastries, etc.)--Quite close to the Seattle Center, which includes the Space Needle, Experience Music Project  SciFi Museum (I would not call it VERY close as some reviewers have--it's about a 10-minute walk.)--Fridge and microwave in room.--Generally quiet location, although see more about this below.--Nice, clean bathroom with good shower and tub.--Nice, large grocery store nearby (QFC) which is handy for picking up supplies for the room.CONS:--Once you have seen the sights in Seattle Center, you are not very close to the other popular tourist destinations. I don't understand some reviewers here who said the hotel is close to everything. It is true that it is easy to take the monorail from Seattle Center to Westlake, which puts you in the middle of downtown, near shopping, the convention center and not too far from the Pike Place Market. If you can get a good deal at the Comfort Suites and don't mind having to make this trip to get to these attractions, then it's fine. But just bear in mind that once you are in the true downtown area, you are quite far from the hotel and won't be able to just run back there to drop off shopping, etc.Also re: location: the hotel is located in a kind of out-of-the-way area which doesn't have all that much to recommend it. It's not a bad area, but it's not very attractive--mostly parking lots, busy roads, etc. There are a few restaurants within walking distance, but the variety is not great--they are mostly Asian (vegetarian Chinese, Thai) or noisy pubs. --Room size--we had a junior suite and I would barely call it a suite. The room was really quite small. It had two double beds, a small partition and a sofabed on the other other side. There was a fridge and a microwave (small) hidden in the entertainment unit. There was NO closet. I have never before been in a hotel room with no closet!--The room was a bit worn-looking: spots on the sofabed upholstery and on the carpet. Not enough to be really off-putting, but noticeable. --The free wireless Internet service never worked in our room, despite our calls to the customer support line. The signal was excellent, it was just that the connection was so slow that it kept timing out. We had to take our computer down to the lobby or breakfast area (where it worked fine) to use it. There are two computers available for guests off the lobby, but they are often very busy.--The breakfast room was always very crowded. They really need to somehow figure out how to have more seating for breakfast. There is an outdoor patio area with seating, but since smokers use it (I'm not sure if they are supposed to), it's not very appealing to eat out there.Also, some of the breakfast options were pretty mediocre, especially the fresh fruit, which consisted of bananas which were bordering on overripe and small Delicious apples. I don't understand how a hotel in Seattle, which has such great fresh produce, can offer this!All in all, if you are budget-conscious and can get a good deal here, and don't mind the Cons I've outlined above, this is not a bad place to stay, but next time I'm in Seattle I think I'll be looking for a more centrally-located, somewhat more upscale option.
