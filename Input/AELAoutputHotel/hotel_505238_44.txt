{"text":"Highly recommended I have just returned from a short break staying at the Barcelona Princess Hotel. All in all, this was a fantastic hotel. I would recommend asking for a room as high up as possible (as long as you don't suffer from vertigo!) with the city view. You get views from the huge windows across the entire city. Free mini bar was useful and the bathroom and blackout blinds were great. Although the hotel is not in the centre of Barcelona, it was very easy to get round the city. There is a metro station (El Maresme Forum I) within 2 minutes walking distance from the hotel, and you can get into central Barcelona in about 10 minutes on the metro. I would highly recommend using the metro, as it is a very quick and cheap way to get around. The shopping centre is loacted next to the hotel. Within this you can find a huge supermarket, although the restaurants are all chain restaurants so I would recommend venturing further into the city to eat. Barcelenta has some good restaurants by the port, particulalry if you like fish.Some quick tips? If your going to use the public transport, purchase a T10 ticket at any of the metro or train terminals. This costs about 7 EUROS and lasts for 10 journeys on any of the public transport options. The open top bus tours are a good way of seeing the city and you can hop on and hop off. although be carful as these can be fairly busy.All in all a great hotel in a great part of the world.
