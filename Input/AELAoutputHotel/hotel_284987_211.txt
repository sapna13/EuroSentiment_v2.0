{"text":"Gorgeous but pricey My husband and I stayed at the Gran Melia this past week for our honeymoon. I must say, when I got to the resort, I thought it was incredible. The pool was gorgeous, the view was breathtaking and the hotel was beautiful. I was a little disappointed that the outdoor grill wasnt open due to the resort making some changes. Unfortunately, I do have to agree with the other people who reviewed this resort. They definitely nickle and dime you to death here. We had the meal plan thank goodness which covered our breakfast and only covered either lunch or dinner so we mostly used it on our dinner. Our first day when we got here, we were about to starve and ate at Caribeno which was a buffet. We about had a heart attack when we got the bill which was $53 without the tip. There wasnt much else to do though bc the resort doesnt offer any type of sandwich shop which wouldve been nice for lunch instead of a huge buffet. After that, we felt like we had to eat all we could bc of the price so we endd up overeating all week!! My husband went and played golf at the Coco Beach golf club and it was very nice. The views were gorgeous with mountains on one side and beach on the other. The golf club is right down the road but the resort charged us $20 to drive us down there (Pretty ridiculous if you ask me) I went to the spa the same day for a massage. It was great but it was very pricey and I think very comparabe to the $80 massages I normally get where I live (ended up paying $135 as gratiuity is included). We decided to order room servie one night to save money and my husband wasnt feeling too good. All we ordered was 2 grilled chicken sandwiches (no drinks) and a slice of choclate cake....oh yes, they charged us $60!! I simply couldnt get over the food prices my whole trip down there. If anyone frm the resort is reading this, you MUST add an affordable lunch option!! I would say that the food options were my only complaint. The staff was very nice (esp Mark and David), the tour desk and concierge service. Our room was nice with a nice view (was a little far away from everything though). Overall, we had a great experience with this resort. If I give a low score, it's only bc of the lack of food options and the expensive food prices.
