{"text":"Absolutely Gorgeous!!!!!! We went to the Melia the first week of Janaury for our wedding! There was 21 of us and it was absolutely incredible. The grounds and beach are so clean, plus while it is a family resort those without children did not feel overwhelmed by the families with small children.My husband and I stayed in the Royal Service Suites and while the regular rooms are very nice, we highly recommend the Royal Service as they are newer and fresher and the service is even that much better. The food was fantastic, however we mostly avoided fruit and uncooked veggies just to be on the safe side. The restaurants were very accomodating for a group our size (the butler service in Royal Service greatly aides this) The staff is very polite and curteous and most spoke some english. Tips are highly recommended (note that its hard to get small US$ so bring lots of $1 bills). The wedding itself was amazing, the flower arrangments and the locations made it truly memorable. If you are looking for a night life this resort has it as well (disco and 24hr buffet) Everyone had a fantastic time (and came home healthy) We would go back in a heartbeat!The resort itself is huge and you can either walk, take the train or flag down a golf cart to get around...either way the landscape was beautiful with lots to look at!!My husband went golfing as the resort includes rounds of golf and he said the course was excellent!!!
