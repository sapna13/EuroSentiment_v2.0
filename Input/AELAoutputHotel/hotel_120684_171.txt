{"text":"a very good hotel in an excellent location We spent 6 nights in the hotel and overall it was a very nice experience. We chose this hotel as it had good reviews in tripadvisor, was reasonably priced and next to the waikiki beach. We had made a reservation for a partial ocean view room and got a ....partial ocean view room. The room itself was very nice, clean had a comfortable king size bed. Its size and bathroom size were big enough for a relatively long stay. The balcony was a little bit small for our taste, though.We tasted the food at two restaurants in the hotel, the grill and the dukes. The dukes is a little bit noisy and extremely busy during breakfast time, however at lunch time the buffet is a steal at 13 USD per person. The grill is fine for breakfast and reasonably priced if you choose a light continental breakfast rather than a full american one.The pool is nice, however there is not enough space for people looking for a shadowy place. Also , the beach towels are very thin and should be replaced by new ones.The beach is wonderful, however you have to pay up to 50 USD to get two beach chairs with an umbrella. I heard that this kind of service is free in some other hotels, so consider this when you compare prices within hotels of similar category. Concerning the hotel itself, it's a little bit outdated and does not have the charm or the elegance of its two neighbours (the royal hawaian and the westin) but considering the price, the outrigger is probably a better deal. The location is perfect and you are close to everything.Overall, we spent a wonderful vacation in Hawai and if you cannot (like us) spend more than 250 USD a night, this the right place to goThe only real complaint is that the walls are paper thin. So be nice with your neighbours. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":104,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":100}]}
