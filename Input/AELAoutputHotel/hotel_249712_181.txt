{"text":"Excellent with a couple of hiccoughs To be fair, this is a good hotel. We had an club level room and loved having the Apple computer and free internet access. It was extremely useful.We chose to stay here following reading a number of reviews on this web-site. The room was a good size and it was tastefully decorated. It was useful having breakfast in the club room especially with little ones. The location was good too. I had no problems with the location. Some people mentioned that Times Square would be a nightmare for driving because of the one way system. We had a navigation system in the rental car (an absolute must for going to NYC) and we didn't get lost once. Toys R Us with its ferris wheel is very close and the kids enjoyed the ride.On the negative side, we arrived at about 3.00 and the lobby was heaving so it took us about 30 minutes to check in. If you have a car parked at the hotel, do remember to get the reception to stamp your ticket and also to hand over the porter\/bell hop ticket so that your luggage is delivered to your room. I would have given this hotel a much higher rating if we didn't have a problem with the room cleaning. Having been out all day, we returned to our room to find that it still wasn't made up. I had left our dirty laundry in the appropriate bag on our door, as the laundry sheet advised that laundry to be done the following day should be outside your hotel room by 9.00 in the morning. I dutifully did this, but did not call reception to ask someone to pick the laundry up. The maid therefore saw the laundry on the door and decided not to clean the room. The maid gave me real attitude when I asked her why she hadn't cleaned the room and if she could do it now. I was quite surprised by how rude she actually was! I reported this to the concierge and to be fair the next day the cleaning was done quickly and efficiently. Lesson learned: if you want trays picked up, laundry picked up or anything else done - simply call the express phone number on the phone and don't hang around waiting for things to happen because they won't!Finally, we took advantage of the hotel doctor because my son had developed an ear infection and was in a good deal of pain. I should stress that there isn't a hotel doctor, but a number the hotel gives you for an on-call doctor who will come to your hotel room. The doctor called to understand the age of the patient and the problem before arriving laden with all the correct medications, antibiotics, drops, injection etc. It was a little OTT but we were flying in 36 hours and I didn't want to risk a problem. I was fairly impressed by the doctor's conscientiousness until I got the bill which was for $510. I almost fainted! Worse, I had to pay the doctor in cash as she wouldn't take any cards. Fortunately, there is an ATM in the lobby, but I did feel a bit like a pimp paying her by the elevators. Our insurance wouldn't cover the bill when we got back home because the doctor was outside of our health care network. Just beware of this in advance and check that you are covered should the need arise!Another plus (I thought) was the food. The room service menu was unusually good, varied and HEALTHY! The children's menu was also a refreshing change to the norm. I was impressed.
