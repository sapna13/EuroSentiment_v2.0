{"text":"Do not contemplate visiting this place We stayed here for one night for the Holland versus England friendly football game and i can honestly say it is the worst place i have ever had the misfortune to stay in. I have stayed in plenty of poor places during my travels over the years both watching England and on holiday in General. This place was disgusting! The room was tiny with a set of bunkbeds that were filthy with rotten torn mattressess and smelly pillows. We both woke up the next morning covered in bites that required anti-histamine tablets!!!! The room was at the top of three horrendously steep flights of stairs and the shared bathroom and toilet facilities left a lot to be desired. The best thing that i can say about this place is that it had a nice relaxed atmosphere. I did not go to this hotel for that, i went for a nights stopover in what i thought would be at least half decent accommodation after reading some of the reviews on here.I am certainly no prude and generally know what to expect when staying at the cheaper budget places. This was a really bad place that we decided on and i would not want anyone else to go through what we did after visiting this place.I would not reccomend this place to anyone. We got another hotel the next night, for the same price (Amsterdam House hotel Eureka) and it was a palace compared to this. Go there if you can it is so much better.
