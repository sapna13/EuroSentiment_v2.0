{"text":"Good hotel on a perfect location! We've just stayed here for 4 nights in a junior suite and we weren't disappointed! Very spacious room on the 7th floor which faced the very busy La Rambla, but because of the double windows we didn't hear a thing of all the noise outside. The bathroom was large and clean and bathroom amenities were replenished every day, even when, for instance, the tubes of shampoo weren't fully used yet.The only two downsides of the room were the very (!) firm mattresses and the airconditioning that didn't seem to work well. No matter which temperature we set it on, the same temperature of air seemed to come out. There was some renovation going on at the floors above our room but there was hardly any noise from that. The turndown service was a nice touch and they even cleaned the bathroom again, replaced dirty towels and emptied waste bins after turning down the blankets.The breakfast buffet was ok; quite pricey (√à√\u2020√ü?23) and we certainly wouldn't have used it if it wasn't included in the room price.Food and beverage are very expensive, even for a 5-star hotel! √à√\u2020√ü?5,50 for a (local) beer from the mini bar and in the hotel bar!The hotel staff at the front desk were very friendly and efficient; so was the staff in the bar. Staff at breakfast was ok; they seemed to be more friendly towards people who speak Spanish, but that was something we encountered in more restaurants.The location of the hotel is more than perfect: right in the busy centre of Barcelona with all tourist attractions nearby.All in all a good experience at this hotel!
