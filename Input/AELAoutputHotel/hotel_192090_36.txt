{"text":"Never Again..... Well, having stayed at this Hotel twice before, after reading rave reviews about the place, we found that is was VERY expensive for what it offers, and really does not offer good value for money at all, BUT, having been given a Virgin  Classic Break  for Xmas, we decided to give the place another chance...... BIG MISTAKE....... Arriving on a Friday afternoon, after a long journey from Wales, the reception insisted I HAD to swipe my Credit Card ASAP to avoid the Hotel being ripped off by Customers.Really makes you feel welcome when you have already paid Months in advance I can assure you.... Then to add insult to injury, they put √ä√£¬¢100 on my Credit Card, which was debited at once, and I am STILL trying to get it back from them. So my advice to anyone reading this and staying at the Park City Hotel is, do NOT give them your Credit Card details on arrival, as they WILL try and claim it from your account immediatelly.Be Careful Folks, this Hotel, does not respect your Credit Card limit at all. It can leave you short of money if they do this to everyone.... So, on to our stay.... We had paid for a  Welcome Pack  which was not in the room when we arrived, and we had to phone up for it, on 3 occasions, took them about 2 Hours to sort that one out, by which time we about to go out, so a total waste of time and money indeed, and it ended up in the rubbish bin, the next Day.... No sign of Tea and Coffee facilities in the room, so once again we had to phone reception for this basic facility, and we then got a broken kettle, after a wait of about an Hour, we then phoned reception ( AGAIN ) and were told there was not another kettle available at the moment, BUT, as a gesture of goodwill ( SERIOUSLY ) they would send us a jug of hot water, and they DID,and then the waiter expected a tip too, he stood there for a while holding his hand out !!!! As you can probably guess, this was not a nice stay for us, so we just got out of the place on Friday evening, went to our Concert at the 02 Arena, came back in the evening, slept in the large uncomfortable bed, had breakfast in the morning and got out of the Hotel early on Saturday afternoon, after checking with reception that we would NOT be charged for anything on our stay. I asked for the reciept that was swiped on my Credit Card when we arrived, but was told everything was fine, and it had been cancelled. We actually did not spend a penny in the place, as we did not think they deserved our custom, but are now engaged in a battle of wits, trying to get our √ä√£¬¢100 back... Personally,after our recent experience, I would advise you to avoid this Hotel at all costs, but if you DO stay here, check your Bill with a scrutinous eye.....As a footnote to this, I have now spoken to the Managers at length about our stay there, and WHY they debit your Credit Card on arrival, and have since been informed they usually put a √ä√£¬¢50 charge for every night you stay there. Which just puts salt in the wound as far as we are concerned, We only stayed ONE night, yet they charged us for TWO.......Lucky we didn't stay a week then, as my Card would have had √ä√£¬¢350 on it, when I got home.......We will certainly not be staying here again, thats a certainty...
