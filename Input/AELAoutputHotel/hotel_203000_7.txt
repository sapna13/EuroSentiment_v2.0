{"text":"Comfort, service and Friendliness My family (party of five) and I stayed at the Alba at the end of Sept to early Oct. and would stay here again if we return to Florence. The service was wonderful and the staff were friendly most of them spoke English; Maria our cleaning maid who does not speak english but her big open smile and her efforts to understand you with gestures makes up for it, the lady who serves in the breakfast room during the week and Sara the front desk person to mention a few made our stay a pleasure. We had rooms 101 and 400, which is on the 4th floor, elevator only goes to the 3rd fl but the walk up the short flight of the stairs to the 4th was worth it. Both rooms were very comfortable, lots of space and hot water. Room 400 is a triple and being 3 girls sharing it, the double sinks were heavenly. We had a bird eye view of the Duomo from the window and the bathroom also has a window and the sunlight streaming in makes it bright and cheery. I cannot find one bad thing to say. Initially we had a room on the first floor that did not have a bath, just a shower with a curtain round it and very high toilet seat which makes me think it is for handicapped persons which if it is, is wonderful. We asked for a change and the very next morning we were given the spacious room on the 4th floor. Everything is within walking distance and the train\/bus station is just around the corner. There are lots of places to eat and little shops where you can get the basic such as water, wine, grocery, etc. ","annotations":[]}
