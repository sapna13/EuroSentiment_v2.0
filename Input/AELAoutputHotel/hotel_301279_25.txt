{"text":"Home from Home I have been a regular visitor to Tokyo for more than thirty years andtried something like fifteen hotels before I settled for the New Otani as my home from home. Normally, I prefer to avoid large hotels and this really is a big one, as others have said, more like a small town than a hotel.The clinchers for me are the New Otani's seamless service, the marvellous Japanese garden and the reasonable room rate. Every time I get off the airport bus and a bell boy runs to get the bags I know that I will be looked after as well as in some of the world's most expensive hotels. Many of the staff call me by my name when they meetme in the corridor, something that is not common in many other hotelswhere I have also been a regular.I am amazed to read some complaints on TA about the attitude of some members of staff. I do wonder if some guests appreciate that Japan remains a different culture from the West. For example, raising your voice is considered very rude indeed and causing an employee, particularly a junior one, to loose face will ensure a sudden drop inservice from anyone who observes this. As in most circumstances in Japan, a smile and an apology for being a nuisance will get you a great deal further than will a loud complaint.My main worry about the New Otani is that when the refurbishment is completed there will be a dramatic increase in prices and I won't be able to stay there any more.
