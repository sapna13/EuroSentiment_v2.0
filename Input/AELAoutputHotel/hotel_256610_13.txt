{"text":"Mixed feelings about this hotel... We booked this hotel on lastminute.com.au. They offer secret hotels at good prices, you don't find out which hotel you've got until you book it. Anyway we decided to be adventurous and used this option. The location was good. Unfortunately we did not get a room with a view, we had a noisy street beside our window instead. My advice: if you are booking this hotel for the splendid views, make sure you get a harbourside room BEFORE you get to the hotel. We asked if there were rooms available on the other side, were told yes, but were also informed that it would cost 60 extra Aussie dollars per night. We decided not to pay any more for the room as we had the views during a previous visit to another hotel on the other side of the harbour (Four Points by Sheraton - definitely recommended :-)). The staff were not over friendly, which is unusual for Australian hotels. The internet is definitely over-priced. We didn't eat in the hotel at all, we decided to eat in the Harbourside mall across the bridge. You can get all kinds of food in the foodhall in the basement. It's well priced and a 5 minute walk from the hotel room. Access to the harbour is great from this hotel. I would recommend eating at JORDAN'S seafood restaurant if you want to enjoy some good food. Definitely book in advance, it's always busy. The food there is not cheap, but it's worth it. You can also have breakfast in and around the harbour. There is a Morrocan\/ Australia retaurant which I would also recommend for dinner in the evenings close to the hotel, it's called SUMAC. The staff are really lovely and the food is great (try the chocolate cupcakes for desert, if you love food like me you will love these). Get one to share though if you have had a main course!Back to the hotel... I would stay here again if I got good rates, but I would not pay big money for this hotel!
