{"text":"What a great hotel! This hotel was wonderful. The room looked exactly like the pics posted by the hotel's website and by other travelers. While the hotel didn't provide breakfast like some other places, it provided sherry and tea in the evenings. My two friends and I didn't take advantage of this though as we were always out site seeing. We did utilize the hotel's computer to check in for our flight home. The staff was great. We did an Alcatraz trip and were not going to make it back in time for check out. They allowed us to check out a couple hours later than normal when we called from the Rock to explain the situation. They also held our luggage for another couple hours after we had returned to check out. We used this time to do some last minute shopping at Union Square. The staff was very helpful throughout our stay.I'm not sure if it's because of the bad economy or not but we didn't see too many other guests at the hotel. We didn't even hear any neighboring guests. It was really nice.Oh, and the best amenity this hotel has is the plush beds. They are so great - very luxurious and make you really feel as though you are on vacation. I would definitely stay here again as it is close to everything and it was such a great experience for my friends and I. This trip was our first to the City and we loved it completely!
