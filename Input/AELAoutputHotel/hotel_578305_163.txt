{"text":"Excellent location, nice big room and free food. Just got home from a 6 night stay at the Residence Inn NYC. The best thing about this hotel is the location! There is a subway stop right across the street from the hotel (B-D-F-V) or you can walk one block over to Broadway and 2 blocks up towards Time Square for another subway stop (1-2-3-N-R-Q). We also used the bus to get to the Convention Center which picked up on 42nd street and got us there in just 15 minutes. Bryant Park was full of activities including an early morning concert for Good Morning America. While its not right in Times Square, its close enough to walk and far enough away to not make you feel like a total tourist. The rooms were spacious, much larger then a standard NYC hotel room, but not as big as the old JW Marriott on 56th street(no longer in the Marriott family). Only one complaint, our room was not cleaned one day which was irritating after being out all day long, but after letting the FD know, the room was cleaned first thing each morning. The breakfast served on the 3rd floor was plentiful with both hot and cold breakfast foods offered, and M-Th the hotel offers evening social hour with either soup and salad (4 different soups to choose from and a nice salad bar selection) or a main entree item. A calendar is posted in every room to let you know whats on the menu.Staff at the hotel were friendly and welcoming everytime we walked thru the lobby and free internet access is available at the conciergedesk if you dont mind standing up while you use it. The 3rd floor offers a bar in the evening, but there are also severalplaces to sit and meet with friends at any time of the day or night. One night a group of friends brought over a few bottles of wine and some snacks and we sat around on the 3rd floor near the TV talking and enjoying each others company. It was comfortable, relaxing and saved us a lot of money in an area bar or nightclub and we didnt haveto spend the entire evening shouting over the noise.The next time we are back in NYC, we will be sure to book our reservations at the Residence Inn!
