{"text":"Better than you'd think I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights as part of a business trip to Barcelona. Having been to this city as a tourist on several previous occasions, I wasn't expecting much from this hotel (which my company chose for me) - mainly due to the location near Sants station.It is true that the location is a little uninspiring and the views to the front of the property are of the main road whilst the rear looks onto apartment blocks. Nevertheless, once inside, the hotel punches above it's weight.Reception is clean,modern and efficient. There is a small bar area with outdoor seating and a friendly (if a little quiet) atmosphere.The rooms are also clean, tidy and with reasonably modern.fittings. Tea making facilities are provided - but no coffee!!. The TV service is ok but not much for English language speakers (or any language other than Spanish for that matter).Breakfast on my first day was fairly extensive and good. Served in a bright restaurant on the first floor. Inexplicably, the next day was poor with no hot food available and no reason given.If you are a tourist, there are better located choices, but don't dismiss this hotel. The price is fair and the metro is nearby. Journeytime to Las Ramblas is just 8 minutes and only 1.25 euro. If you're here for the football, it isn't too far to see Barca either.On the whole, for business this is a good choice. It does everything you need without subjecting you to the nightmare city centre traffic. For the tourist - consider it but bear in mind that you'll need to be hopping on\/off the metro regularly.
