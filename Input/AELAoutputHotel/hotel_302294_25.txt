{"text":"The hotel to stay in, In Singapore!!!! This was the last leg of my trip back to Australia from Europe and Dubai (Emirates are a fantastic airline by the way) I had decided to have a 5 day 4 night stopover in Singapore and had originally booked the Fairmont. However when i saw that the Pan Pacific was nearly $400 cheaper and getting better reviews i cancelled the Fairmont and booked here, best decision i ever made!!!!!!Upon arrival i noticed they have dedicated lines for Arrivals\/Departures\/Concierge etc, What a great idea i thought! The guy that checked me in was very polite and efficient, Before i knew it i was heading up the glass elevator\/lift to my room on the 18th floor. The Atrium is amazing and about 40 stories high. Once i got into the room i noticed it had a bit of a Polynesian theme to it, As does most of the hotel. Truth be told the room itself is probably more of a 4 star but it's the facilities and staff that make this a 5 star hotel. The bed was very comfortable and the plasma tv had about 25 channels including Star World, Star Movies, Mtv etc etc. My room had a nice view of the Suntec Convention Centre and the Conrad Hotel. My room also had electronic blinds but didnt have a balcony, Apparently some rooms do, Some dont. I had a shower and bath, with decent tolietries in the bathroom. I also had a Clock with built in Alarm, etc. I didnt get to use the bar but i noticed each night they had live entertainment with a woman singing. The pool is fantastic and open until 11pm each night! I had a few swims in it and loved the fact they pump music under the water, Great to just lie on your back and look up at the sky! The deep end must of been at least 3 to 4 metres. it was so deep i could never touch the bottom, And i'm 177cm tall so it must be very deep!I never got to use the gym but i did use the business centre, The Internet was very good and the staff up there are so polite and friendly!The location: Probably the only downside but not enough to keep me away. About a 15 - 20 min walk through Citylink, Suntec City and Marina Square mall's. I'd suggest you don't take the MRT from the airport to City Hall MRT and walk to this hotel unless you know the area, Otherwise you could be walking for hours! It is signposted but you've got to know where to look, (If you see a HMV and an American Diner you're heading in the right direction) I'd suggest taking the MRT too the airport on checkout, As by then you should know the area!Staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble!If this is an indication of how all Pan Pacific's are i will be making sure i stay in quite a few!Will definitely stay here again next time i'm in Singapore!
