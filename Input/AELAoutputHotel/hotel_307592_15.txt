{"text":"A Tried and Tested Formula Aman has really got it down pat √à√\u2020\u2022?fabulous resorts with unparalled levels of service. The number of 5-star rated reviews that Amankila has received is testament to their ability to deliver a consistently high level product for each and every guest who stays at their resort.My wife and I have just spent a week at Amankila and generally agree with all the positive reviews. This is a beautiful resort √à√\u2020\u2022?amazing design (despite being 15 years old this resort looks fresh and timeless), great villas and a wonderful choice of pools and black sand beach.It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ definitely the staff that makes the place. They are personal but unobtrusive, warm but discreet and are well trained to anticipate guests√à√\u2020\u2022?needs. What I do find surprising is impressed some other reviewers are of the service to the point of suggesting that some of the staff are almost telepathic. Perhaps I am a bit cynical but I think it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a pretty simple formula √à√\u2020\u2022?the resort runs a high staff to guest ratio who are highly trained to provide good service and anticipate the needs of guests. Given the relatively small number of guests they have on the property (there are only 35 villas), I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think this is rocket science but clearly what Aman excels at which is why they have such a great reputation √à√\u2020\u2022?when you stay at an Aman resort you are virtually guaranteed to have this kind of experience. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ what you are paying for.I reserve 5-star ratings for experiences which are flawless or transformational and even though it has been a fantastic holiday, I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel Amankila met either of those criteria. I have deducted one star for a couple of reasons: (i) price √à√\u2020\u2022?the rate is definitely not cheap. Guests are paying a premium for privacy and seclusion and amazing service. If you are not that focused on either of these factors and are working to a budget, I would suggest also considering other resorts such at the Oberoi, the Bale, Four Seasons Jimbaran and the Legian √à√\u2020\u2022?you can have a similar experience with change to spare for spa treatments, day trips, dining out etc(ii) food √à√\u2020\u2022?while there is a diverse menu, my wife and I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ find the food particularly authentic or tasty and also felt that they could have had more specials. The dining options are limited, there are no restaurants nearby and by the end of the week, we both felt rather jaded about the food choices.A few other points to note if you are planning to a stay at Amankila:- Stairs - the villas are connected by a series of elevated walkways. There are many steps so the unfit or aged may want to request a villa nearer to the main pool and dining complex;- Villa choice √à√\u2020\u2022?we stayed in a Garden View villa. These are identical in layout and size to the Ocean View villas except the orientation is different. The Ocean View villas have outdoor areas which face the ocean directly while the Garden View villas are perpendicular but you still get views of the ocean and the same level of privacy so if a good choice if you are working on a budget (the difference between these room types us US$200 which I think is excessive).- Location √à√\u2020\u2022?the resort is pretty isolated so trips out to local restaurants are not really an option (as they would be if you stayed in an area like Seminyak for example). Obviously the big plus is the seclusion and privacy but as I noted above, the choice available at the resort can get a bit tedious if you are staying a week or more.Overall, we had a great stay at Amankila and would recommend it to our friends albeit with the warnings above. Definitely looking forward to future stays at other Aman resorts.
