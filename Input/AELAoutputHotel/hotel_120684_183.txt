{"text":"Exactly As Advertised My wife and I stayed in Room 424 (Ocean Front with spa) for 10 days. We were not disappointed in any respect and everything was perfect for the sort of vacation we were seeking.Let me get to some important facts first:Noise: We heard absolutely nothing from any neighbouring rooms. There were occupied by families with kids and we heard nothing, nada, nichs, rien, nol. The room walls are not paper thin - those reports are not true at least for our room.There is general beach noise and party noise from Dukes on the Ground Floor until about 11pm - but if you close your lanai door it's barely perceptable.Wedding Vow Renewal Ceremony: Surprisingly well done (and free). Well worth signing up for.Staff: Very friendly and courteous check-in staff. We got an early check-in (9am) which was great after an 11 hour flight. Maids were very friendly and the standard of room preparation was excellent.Cleanliness: Room was cleaned twice daily to a very high standard.Room Amenities: Exactly as expected for a solid 4-star hotel. (Bed was particularly comfortable).Elevators: There are 3 elevators servicing floors 1 - 12 (higher floors have a separate elevator). During peak times, the wait was up to 2 minutes. It was NEVER 5 minutes as some others have suggested. Mostly the elevator wait time was less than 1 minute. Your on vacation people - you can afford a few minutes!View: Perfect. Exactly as advertised.If you are after a good 4-star room on the beach at Waikiki, this place will deliver. ","annotations":[]}
