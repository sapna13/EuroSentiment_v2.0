{"text":"Great Location and Friendly Staff We stayed at the Hotel Globus during a 3 week trip around Italy and were happy with choice of hotel due to its location, within walking distance of all the main sites, and the friendly and helpful staff. The area is quite lively with plenty of restaurants and shops. We did find it a little noisy in the morning as the market runs along the same street as the hotel but it wasn't a major problem. If, like us, you arrive late in the evening don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be put off by the rubbish on the streets, this is due to the market being packed up for the evening and the streets are back to normal in the morning. The staff at the hotel Globus are extremely welcoming, especially the staff on reception and the gentleman that serves breakfast. Don't let the entrance to the hotel deter you, once you are upstairs the hotel is very modern and clean. The room itself was very compact, same width as a double bed with tiny bathroom but we expected this from the description and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ spend much time in there except to sleep. We loved the mini lift and free internet access in the lobby. The only problem was the air conditioning unit which seemed to work on a timer and you couldn't set it to your own preferences which meant the room did get quite hot especially when getting ready.If visiting Florence again, which I hope I do as it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a truly beautiful city, I would consider the Hotel Globus due to its great location but would upgrade to a larger room. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a great place for people on a city break who would spend most of the day out of the hotel sightseeing and are looking for somewhere clean, convenient and welcoming to sleep after a busy day.
