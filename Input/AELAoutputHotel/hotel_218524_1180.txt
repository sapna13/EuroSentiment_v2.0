{"text":"Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!! We can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ say enough about what a wonderful and relaxing vacation we had at the Excellence Punta Cana. We searched quite a bit when looking to book this trip. We had been planning it for a while and there were a lot of variables that we were looking for. We wanted luxury accommodations, an ocean view room, a gorgeous beach and a beautiful setting. Excellence Punta Cana was all that and more!! From the moment we arrived we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ help but immediately relax. We had read many reviews online and decided to go with the junior suite √à√\u2020\u2022?oceanview in the excellence club. The excellence club staff, especially Roberto, could not have been warmer or more helpful. They were awesome!! When we got there we asked if any honeymoon suites were available and could we see one before we upgrade? Roberto immediately took us up to one and we fell in love! Needless to say, we upgraded. It had a sprawling balcony, with a hot tub on it, 2 lounge chairs, a table for two and an amazing view of the ocean!! We definitely spent a lot of time on that balcony. We also had another side balcony, which overlooked the pools. It was luxury all the way! Maid service was awesome, as was the guy who refilled our mini-bar. We asked for the liquor and drinks that we liked and he kept us stocked. In addition, the staff was constantly working on keeping the resort clean and in immaculate shape. It was amazing! The food was outstanding! We liked the Mexican restaurant, Agave, the best, with the Lobster House coming in a close second. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even really like lobster, but it was delicious!! We also enjoyed the Grill. We had the filet mignon there. All of the restaurants were good. Lunches on the beach were delicious and the fresh tuna sandwiches that they bring around the beach and the pool were out of this world!! You could feasibly stay on your lounge chair all day and have drinks and food delivered! The bar opened at 10am and the waiters\/waitresses would come around with the drink of the day, which was usually fruity so it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel like you were drinking alcohol! They even serviced the beach, which was really nice. The staff was warm and kind. Their standard answer whenever you ask for ANYTHING is, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Øy pleasure√à√\u2020\u2022? We did not encounter anyone who was anything less than accommodating. Tips are not a necessity, but they do appreciate them. We also brought over a bag of mini-chocolate candy, like Snickers and Twix, etc. We had read that they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get that in the Dominican Republic. The staff always enjoyed it when we gave them a handful. We also brought over school supplies and gave them to our cleaning lady, who was greatly appreciative.We spent most of our time at the beach. It was a little windy the first 2 days, but it calmed down after that. The water can be a tiny bit rough, but it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ too bad when we were there. One of the best things about the pool was that there were pool floats that you could just lay on in the water. We never had trouble getting a chair or a pool float.Overall, we have NOTHING bad to say about this resort. The ride from the airport was a little lengthy, but we had read that on here, so we were not surprised. It is DEFINITELY worth it! As we left the resort we said, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??e know we will be coming back here!!√à√\u2020\u2022?If you are reading this, getting ready to go, we are jealous! You will have a great trip!
