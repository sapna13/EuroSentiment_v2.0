{"text":"Sparkling property, but watch out for the hard sell! I just returned from four nights at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge. The hotel and rooms were beautiful. We had a room with 2 double beds, and while not huge, it was comfortably sized, and the bathroom is spacious and nicely appointed.The beds were very comfortable, and even with the soaring temperatures, the air conditioning worked well and was pretty quiet.This hotel has over 900 rooms, so you can imagine how large it is. We chose to self-park, not to save money but because I like the convenience of coming and going on a whim, being able to access things stored in the car, etc. The only problem with the free self-parking is that there are not adequate spaces, and you have to walk probably 1\/4 to 1\/2 a mile from the parking lots to the hotel. By the time you reach the lobby, you are practically suffering from heat exhaustion! Fortunately they have dispensers of cold water and iced tea in the lobby area.When we checked in, I was given a letter outlining the benefits of my Silver Elite membership. It's not a big deal to be in this category (only requires 10 nights per year or that you have a Marriott Visa card!) The letter said we could visit the Marriott Canyon Villas desk in the lobby to receive a deluxe postcard set. Of course, they want to sell you a membership in these timeshares. We also received a scratch-off lottery ticket upon check-in, that had to be scratched at the, guess where, Canyon Villas desk to see if you won some Marriott points.The icing on the cake was the recorded message we received on our last day, thanking us for staying with them. I thought what a nice touch until I kept listening to the message, which went on to offer us a great rate on a return visit ... of course you must book this through the Canyon Villas to see if you're eligible, etc! They just couldn't give up that last opportunity to try and sell something. Would definitely have been nicer if they had just thanked us for our patronage ... period!We didn't eat in any of the hotel restaurants, since there are so many wonderful choices in the Phoenix\/Scottsdale area. It was great having a Starbucks on-site, but keep in mind that like most hotel-located Starbucks, they close around 8 p.m.All in all I would recommend the location because it was clean and beautiful, but just wanted to give a heads up about the parking situation and timeshare overkill.
