{"text":"Great Location, spacious rooms, ideal for a group A large group of us were in Amsterdam for a stag last weekend and stayed in this hotel. We could not have made a better choice. Arriving late with a group of thirsty lads, it was important to get checked in, and out on the town as quickly as possible. The hotel is right across the road from Centraal station and we spotted it straight away. We were all checked in within about fifteen minutes and ready to hit the pubs. Again we found ourselves in the perfect position, with the hotel just around the corner from the RLD where a lot of the pubs and coffee shops are located. The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from Dam square and very close to trams and taxis to explore the city further, should you feel the inclination. We booked both twin and triple rooms and all were clean and very spacious. One of the twins (324) was in the annex and was more like an apartment with its own kitchen (minus a fridge). All of the rooms had a table and seating area, a TV with BBC as well as local channels, and some radio stations. Unfortunately I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ comment on the breakfast as I never made it, but I have been informed by other members of the group that it was good. The bar adjoining the hotel is a traditional Dutch √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√±rown bar√à√\u2020\u2022?and was perfect for an ice cold beer in the afternoon.I found that the staff were excellent, and were available to answer any queries before, during and after our stay there.After a quick poll of the group, some minor complaints were:- Only one key card per room √à√\u2020\u2022?awkward if you arrive home at different times.- The hotel bar closed fairly early and was not available for residents after hours. (Not a major issue as there are many bars within two minutes walk.)- The check out time of 11am is too early √à√\u2020\u2022?12 would be better.Overall I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anybody heading to Amsterdam in the future.
