{"text":"Overpriced Underserviced=Gran Melia Gran Flop The photos definitly sold me, the web site led me to believe its charm and being outside the city sold me. However, from the start I was checked into a damp musky room which I later switched. We ate at the resort the first night at their steak house ranging from $28-$45 dollars steak only. It was not that well prepared for the price, sides cost extra and the service was not that great. More over we felt as if we were suppose to tip very high...we didn't. So letting the first night go we decided to go outside the compound to experience the culture. We went to Old San Juan which rocked with service, taste and friendliness. We spent less for better tasting meals and drinks then at the resort. Note that if one rents a car from outside the resort its $10 dollars a day to park where you are staying. So after a great time we had bought some drinks and wanted to hang out at the resort only to be told we cannot bring in outside alchol or food. We later found out that you can bring in food, there is nothing in the pamphelet that states otherwise.  As for drinks: the resort charges for 2 ounces of rail liquor 7-8 dollars. Which would be fine if the food was cheaper.  Next breakfast, this was the worst part of our trip we said its our last day lets get up and eat the buffet. For 25 dollars a piece we ate food less then par for a Dennys. Further more I and my girlfriend got sick. Though we were told we would be compensated I have no proof yet that I have been. The eggs were not hot, the one cook just made omelettes and the fruit was all but ripe.  lastly, after fighting to keep our moral up we checked out, I was not given a reciept, not given a zero balance when I asked for one and was hung up on when I called from the states to check on my bill.  Please do your research and call. There are other hotels.Sincerely,Unsatisfied.
