{"text":"WONDERFUL VACATION!! This was our first trip to the Dominican Republic and to an Excellence resort and I think we definitely chose wisely! As others have written, the drive from the airport is horrible but you do get to see some of the countryside and realize what it is like outside of the resort. That is all the good I can say!!We upgraded to the Excellence Club upon arrival and while it was nice, would not do again - not really worth the extra money to us.The grounds of this resort are impeccable, the drinks always flowing and the food for the most part very good. Highly recommend ordering room service for breakfast - tasted better than in the restaurants. As for the dinners, yes, if you go after 7:30 you usually have to wait but well worth it at Chez Isabelle and Toscana. The entertainment team, especially Alexandra and Ines, the crazy hair lady and dance teacher were great! Make sure to look them up when you are there - they are in the Disco at night too. The disco is small but fun, casino VERY small and Sports Bar fun place to watch sporting events!Everyone on the resort is extremely friendly and we were fortunate to meet a really nice couple (hopefully now lifetime friends) that we plan on traveling with to another Excellence resort next spring. Take bug spray - the bugs are bad at night but nothing that can't be dealt with. This resort is first class all the way and I can't imagine going there and not having a memorable time.
