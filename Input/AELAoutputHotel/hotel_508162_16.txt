{"text":"Welcome Home We were confused by many of the not so great reviews that were posted to this site. We had made our plans back in March, and had trepidations about going, BUT based on our enjoyable vacations at Dreams in Puerta Vallarta, and in Cancun decided to stick it out. (We love the Dreams' concept) We just got back, and one word describes it Terrific ! and three words describe what was wrong vacation too shortThe greatest thing about this Resort is the staff! Always a smile,always working to make your stay and the hotel better. This goes for the groundspeople, room maids, wait staff, people in the office, as well as the entertainment staff who probably work 15 hours a day, doing daytime activities as well as the shows at nite, which were very good( choreographed, costumed etc).I'm a people person, and wanted to see why the bad press. Basically people who take one item and blow it out of proportion as the following examples: Trip from the airport, yes about 1 hr or slightly more..roads are not highways as some expect, but the bus drivers careful and safe. Sit back, relax (you are on vacation) and look out of the windows at native life, the people, the fields, the schools. Another previous complaint..dirty beach, Yes, if you walk off the Hotel beach (which is perfectly clean) you will see litter either from the locals, or washup from the ocean. Too bad they don't have a litter law, but again NOT the hotel's responsibility. Another complaint was ants in the room (we only saw aunts..a little humor) never saw ants but after speaking to various people, decided a combination of tropical weather, and the fact that people leave open packets of sugar near the coffee pot, or dirty dishes on the floor from ordered in room service. We found the mattresses fine, others have said firm, others hard. THe same with the food, varied comments, but we found the food varied and plentiful. You can't go hungry with the choices, or with the portions. Drinks..again I could easily become an alcoholic if I stayed there long enough. Daytime activities were constant, or you could just sit out and veg. We never had a problem getting a lounge at the pool. So what if you have to shift over a few places because someone else got there first. While I don't want to lecture, it is apparent that many are looking for problems instead of enjoying themselves. The experience in each country that we have visited is different and that is what makes the trip. Chinese food in NYC is not the same as in China, and certainly not the same in DR.We literally met people from all over the world, and saw that they were enjoying themselves. While we didn't have any children did notice that those who did had their children completely occupied by the kids' explorer club.How bad can it be?? when we met people who were returning for the third and fourth time??Don'T hesitate in booking this resort . You will be glad that you did, and will start your vacation with being greeted Welcome Home ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1688,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1682},{"endOffset":1688,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1682},{"endOffset":2469,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":2462}]}
