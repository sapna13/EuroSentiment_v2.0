{"text":"Awesome Pools, Horrible food - Excellence Punta Cana The Good:  Great drinks (The banana-mama and Dirty Monkeys were a hit), Amazing pools and beaches, Terrific Atmosphere (Not crowded, zero kids, and an undeniably beautiful resort), and amazing rooms. Definitely a romantic place. The endless supply of good room coffee and Oreos was a plus also, though we wouldn't mention it if the food wasn't as bad as it was.. The Bad:  The food was extremely disappointing, with all 8 restaurants being mediocre at best with Agave (the Mexican themed restaurant) being the worst followed closely by Spice (Pan-Asian). Here are some of the things that comes to mind: undercooked risotto rice, under-cooked chicken, ketchup with noodles that was labeled as spaghetti, runny bland eggs, and an especially offending Arugula Gorgonzola cheese salad that was seriously spoiled. There were many others and basically, we were extremely disappointed with the food. Room service takes an average of an hour and a half (to their credit they do mention a long wait) . They have a forgettable evening entertainment program and EXTREMELY pushy resort sponsored souvenir vendors (beware the vendors in the light green shirts - once they get those trinkets on you, it's going to be very hard to get away from them. They are seriously aiming to rip you off, and you can talk them down to a fourth of their original asking price). There was always a shortage of yellow beach\/pool towels so hold on to them.The ride to and from the airport is truly an experience with giant potholes and litany of near accidents and is not for the faint of heart.Overall, we had a great time but will not return. If you aim for a romantic experience, this is a place for you.Previous resorts we have been to are various Riu locations, Moon Palace, and various cruises.
