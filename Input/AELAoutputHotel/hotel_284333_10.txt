{"text":"Nice Hotel on a Crowded Island Nice hotel for the money. We were a bit cramped with 4 people in the room and all of our luggage; used the bed and the pull out sofa bed. There is a small kitchenette which adequately served our needs: had a small refrigerator, microwave, cooktop and coffee maker. All rooms have some type of patio or balcony. Unfortunately we were assigned a room with no view so we did not use this feature. Request a room with a pool view. There are various brews of free coffee in the morning by the pool area where you can sit and relax and enjoy your coffee. Very limited parking accommodations even though you pay a daily fee to park (but this seems to be the norm and not the exception these days on Oahu). Once they run out of parking spaces at this hotel they have an agreement where you can use a hotel's parking garage across the street at a reduced fee but still higher than the fee that you pay to park in this hotel's lot. Even though we prepaid for this hotel, was charged an additional $3.99\/day for a resort fee. I must say that the pool area is very nice, the hotel is located close to Kuhio Avenue (major shopping on this street; close to International Market), and not that far from the beach and the great public transportation that this island offers. The hotel has pizza parties and other activites that the hotel guests can participate in (for a fee). The absolute best thing about this hotel is the front desk staff....they were extremely kind, pleasant, professional and courteous all of the time! Although there is a desktop computer located across from the front desk that can be used by the hotel guests the front desk staff was able to provide directions and answer all questions. If they already didn't have preprinted directions available they were more than glad to print up whatever you requested. The people behind the front desk are gems! Overall, a nice hotel for the price.
