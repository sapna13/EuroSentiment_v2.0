{"text":"Not What We Expected My husband and I decided to take a weekend away to Frankfurt.So we booked this hotel.Upon arriving it was impossible to park outside the hotel.The website did say they had parking ,this parking is underground and you have to get them to open the main door up to park the car.As there was no parking directly outside the hotel to be able to ask them where their parking was we had to park in the main car park near the train station and that cost.Once inside the hotel we noticed an awful smoke smell .The girl at the desk was not very helpful at all.The lift to the rooms is tiny and very very slow.They give you a very strange key to open the room with.Once in the room ,we knew we did not like it ,it smelt awful of smoke,the mini bar they say they have is not what we thought either.I asumed like in other hotels it would be small bottles of spirits ,its not its a couple bottles of coke and water.The beds are very soft ,only two English speaking channels unless you pay for a movie which was very expensive.Tried calling down to the front desk never got through.The room is a good size ,and bathroom ok.There where times there never seemed to be hot water.If you want a quiet stay this is not the right hotel for you ,it was very loud at times,we could hear others in their room.The rest of the hotel is a bit run down.The breakfast they serve is great .The location is good ,right across from the train station,we did have the red light district also ,not a very safe area we thought.And if you have a big car then good luck with parking in this hotel,they charge you 11 Euros a day.
