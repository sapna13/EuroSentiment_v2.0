{"text":"Overall okay hotel, not what I expected for 4.5 star resort My wife and I vacationed at the bavaro resort for our honeymoon(3rd week of July). The resort itself is beautiful, starting with the lobby and the pink flamingos!Check-in was quick and easy.I have read some complaints about the food but we thought the food was amazing. The a la carte's were okay but the buffet's with their a different theme each night was great! For the a la carte, we booked them our second day there and 3 of them that we had wanted were already booked. The beach is beautiful. White sand, no rocks, very little seaweed, lots of lounge chairs(that is a real issue as some resorts I have been too!) and nice large waves!We were in the deluxe room. The room itself was very nice and roomy. Our mini-fridge did not work. Each time I called, they sent someone who would move it and say it would be okay in an hour. I had to call three times and then they finally got it to work(I think it was plugged in to an outlet that was not working). Our air conditioning was not very good at all. The coolest it got was 25 celcius. We called a few times, they came to look at it and each time said it will be okay in an hour. It seems everything somehow fixes itself in an hour. As we were really in our rooms only at night, it ended up not being too big of a deal.In the room, I don't think they changed the sheets at all. Also, we were never given any clean glasses. The two glasses that were in the room when we got there were the ones we had all week. When we asked for some clean ones, she said none were available. I spoke to another couple and they had clean ones everyday. We ended up taking some plastic ones from the sports bar.We did the Bavaro Runner excursion where they bring you through the town, to a ranch and a farm as well as some horseback ridding. There were 5 of us from our resort that went on the day that we went. They somehow forgot about picking us up. Someone called them and they eventually came. Over an hour late and the driver had to rush so we can catch up with the tour. The ride was very uncomfortable in the jeep. The ride back wasn't as bad as the driver was doing a more reasonable speed.The Casino is small but was fun. Lost $80...My biggest complaint would be the nightly shows. Out of the 7 nights we were there, there were only 5 shows. The shows were not that good compared to other places in the DR and Cuba I have been too, and the bandshell where they are performed is unbearably hot. Overall an okay trip. Really loved the food. Was not impressed with the shows. Very surprised that not one staff member spoke English(or French for that matter).
