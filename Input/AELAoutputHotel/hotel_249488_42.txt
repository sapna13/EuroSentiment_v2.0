{"text":"Isolated Experiences I just returned from a five night stay in a one bedroom, garden view casita with my husband and daughter. Everything we experienced was positive. It was quiet, peaceful, clean, accomodating, family friendly (everyone seemed to have kids), easy, worth every penny.Anything negative that I read online beforehand or heard in person while we were there, was easily worked around. I along with nearly everyone we spoke to seemed to feel that the positivies more than outweighed the negatives. Here were a few things we worked around...The food is expensive!! For some reason when I read that, I thought we would be able to make better restaurant\/menu selections and not spend $250 a night on dinner. On average you are going to be looking at $16 burgers, $44 steaks, $10 mixed drinks. As soon as we arrived we spoke to our butler about creating an order for groceries and I even took someone's advice from this site  added alcohol to the list. Others we met hopped in a taxi and went to Wal-Mart themselves. Las Casitas sends someone to the grocery store and charges you based on what you spend, so it ends up being $25 for every $100 you spend. We spent $150 for groceries, two bottles of alcohol and the surcharge  it kept us in stocked for breakfast  lunch the entire visit. The beach is rocky. For the most part it's actually broken coral from a reef that you can walk out to. We wore flip flops in the water, which wasn't ideal, but wasn't a problem either. None of the kids seemed phased and most of the adults seemed okay to consider it a non-issue.NO INTERNE or movies! They are accomodating and will let you use the internet in the Las Casitas office. Otherwise, you have to take your laptop to the main hote (El Conquistador) for wireless access. They said they are working on getting wireless to Las Casitas, so at the very least check in with them. Also, our living room had a DVD player, but there were no On Demand movies available. They said they don't have a subscription for anything other than the El Conquistador, so if keep that in mind if your like to curl up with an On Demand movie during your vacation.
