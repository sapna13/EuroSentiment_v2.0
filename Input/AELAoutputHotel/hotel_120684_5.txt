{"text":"Wonderful EXCEPT for the noise.... A lovely hotel, GREAT staff, terrific restaurants, and what a location! BUT, if you want to sleep on your vacation...this property is not a good choice. Walls are paper-thin between rooms and you can hear EVERYTHING going on in the adjoining rooms (on either side, and above). After reporting concerns to the front desk they said we had to call them as soon as we heard the noises (which were more or less non-stop) and they would send Security to investigate...not really something we want to become involved\/engaged in during our vacation. People in other rooms were not being that unreasonable...the hotel just needs to do something about soundproofing. There was also a gaggle of musicians making noise for donations directly in front of the International Marketplace (right across the road from this hotel). The drum, electric guitar and steel drum solos carried on until after 2:00 am, making it impossible to have a window open. We spoke with hotel security staff at the entrance and they said there was not really anything they could do about it. It was obvious that we were not the only ones being bothered as we witnessed others voicing similar complaints. I would think the surrounding hotels would be taking steps with the local authorities to establish some guidelines. We spoke with the police at the Waikiki Beach detachment and they had received similar complaints that same day. We live in the heart of downtown Vancouver in a condo and are not unreasonable about city noises, but between the poor sound proofing and the unregulated noise makers across the road we did not get one night of sleep in two weeks! So, if you are hoping to get any rest during your stay in Waikiki I would personally not recommend this otherwise lovely property. ","annotations":[]}
