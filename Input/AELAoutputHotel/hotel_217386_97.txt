{"text":"would stay again We stayed at this hotel September 2-5, 2006. I found it to be a nice upper-moderate hotel. It definitely has an international feel....the staff are from all over the world. Nice big marble lobby, which the staff constantly keeps clean. Valet is about your only option for parking, unless you snag a street spot - don't hold your breath. We were fortunate to get an oceanfront room with balcony. The room was what you'd expect from a moderate. The beds were quite hard (like you'd find in Mexico). My only complaint here was that the dresser drawers had a very powerful musty\/old smell to them, so I just didn't use it. They use the old style safes, where they give you the lock\/key. Be sure not to over-pack the safe or the lock will stick. We were very pleased with the location and the beach. We were relatively close to South Beach. We only had breakfast at the hotel one morning, but I was totally satisfied with the choices. They had an omelet station, egg - any way you want, among other options. We never stuck around in the evening, but we did notice that they had some sort of entertainment most nights. They offer internet services for a fee, but luckily you purchase how much you want - and can log in and out at will until used up. All in all, we were pleased with our stay. Yeah, maybe the decor could be updated, but you come to Florida to see the sights - not your room.
