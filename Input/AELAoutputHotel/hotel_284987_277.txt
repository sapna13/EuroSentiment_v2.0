{"text":"Wanted to love it. My party was at the Paradisus for the Thanksgiving holiday and although the grounds were kept up well, facilities really nicely layed out, and food pretty OK for an all-inclusive - I am left a bit dissapointed.  The staff gives off an attitude - like eveything is your fault if the dinner reservation is screwed up - they almost seemed annoyed that you are there...and this is WITH royal service. We were paying extra for WHAT? The Royal Service pool is amazing - absolutley beautiful and you can reserve these amazing cabanas for the day...but they do not do a good job at patroling the reservations - basically you need to be your own police when you get to the pool to kick the people out of the cabana you have reserved....not exactly what I want or need to be doing on vacation. The Spa was by far the best experience while we were there. It exceeded my expectations for a spa at an all-inclusive. It is first class and the therapies were very very very well done.I guess when I look back - I am just disspointed in the level of customer service...some people were nice, but overall I felt like I was annoying them to ask a question or resolve an issue. It is really too bad because the resort is well done - has a lot of options (no beach though) - and the food was pleasant for all-inclusive (although the wait service stinks...good luck getting a drink without assalting the waiter).Note to management: Get the staff in line - and don't sell royal service just to rip people off with no SERVICE!
