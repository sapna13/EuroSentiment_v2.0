{"text":"Disappointed in Riu Bambu I just returned from a week at the Riu Bambu and I have to say I was disappointed with the service.Last year we stayed at the Riu Taino (in the same complex) and loved it so much that we decided to go back to the Riu complex but at the Bambu instead (for a change). The hotel itself was fine - clean, beautifully landscaped, pretty to look at. The maid service in the rooms was also fine - no problems there.The problems arose with the waiters, bartenders and general dining room staff. The food was fine - it was the service.First of all, every day they ran out of something - the first day it was scrambled eggs, then orange juice, then a pasta dish, then ice. I found this to be unacceptable - there are many people standing around - couldn't one of them have noticed that something was empty? At one point, I asked a waiter if there was any more orange juice and he told me it was gone forever. A half hour later it was working again.It was virtually impossible to get a waiter to bring you coffee in the morning or water\/wine at dinner. I had no problem getting up to get it myself - after all, it is a buffet - but they notice you near the wine\/water\/coffee and tell you to sit down - they will bring it to you. I don't know about you, but I like my beverage with my meal, not when I am done with it.Same problem at the bar. If you didn't call them, they would completely ignore you.I had my stash of dollar bills to give as tips, and handed them out freely when deserved, but you have to have some actually wait on you first, and that was hard to do.We did go back to the Riu Taino to see if this attitude was now pervasive, but we had the same great service there as we did last year.Bottom line, I would NOT recommend the Riu Bambu to anyone.
