{"text":"9 days in Bali I booked this hotel for a 9 day vacation for my family of five plus my mother. Choose the hotel for the rate (US$95) as we needed two rooms. Plus I thought the hotel would have a nice beach access. The hotel is a little bit older, but has a great Bali feel with the faux monuments, fish ponds, lush gardens  Bali architecture. My three kids (6, 3, 1.5 yrs) loved the two pools, fish ponds,  gardens. The breakfast  room service was good. Kids enjoyed feeding the fish every morning after breakfast with the bread provided by the staff. We only ate dinner at the hotel one night, but it a very nice Indonesia buffet with a show. Only complaint I had at the hotel was the mold in the shower could have been cleaned out better. Also, beware the beach at the hotel is not a swimming beach due to the amount of boats  water sports. No problem with the beach though, the hotel has a free shuttle to Gerger beach ~ 30 minutes twice a day. Gerger beach is a great family beach, no waves, great swimming, full facilities for food, bathrooms, etc.Also you can hire a driver, Mardy, for the day cheaper than upgrading to a hotel on the beach. We ended up hiring a driver for the week. Use him or his team almost every day, heading out to all of the great locations  beaches around Bali. If you are going to Bali  need a great tour guide I highly recommend him, mardana45@hotmail.com In the end, I was only charged US$90\/night for the first week  then US$95 for the last couple days, which I did not complain about! We had a great trip  if we went back I'd stay there again  hire Mardy again.
