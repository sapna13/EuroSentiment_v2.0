{"text":"Overall solid, but not special We stayed for 4 nights the last weekend of May 2007. The reviews on this site are very much on target, and the property offers a very nice stay, although not perfect. We booked directly on their website, although weren't offered any of the packages mentioned by others on this site. We paid full price for a junior suite, and breakfast was not included. The hip-factor of the hotel is a little overplayed in some reviews -- yes, its a little trendier than most, but certainly not as trendy as lots of other new European hotels. That said, we were pleased with the room (spacious but not large by US standards). We think there was a problem with the A\/C which was virtually undetectable even at full blast (and the lowest temperature setting was 21C (~69F), but it certainly didn't cool the room when it was 32C (~89F) outside during the day). Although we would have liked more air circulation (and detected a faint odor at times due to lack of air), we didn't complain because it was easy to open the windows and it didn't bother us much, and we didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel room. The buffet breakfast is pricey (18 Euro) if not included, but everything everyone says it is. We walked most places in the city easily from the hotel, but also used taxis and the S\/U-bahn a lot. Location is generally good and where we wanted to be, but I noticed there were several other new properties of apparent equivalent quality that are even better located in Mitte -- next time I'm likely to try one of those.
