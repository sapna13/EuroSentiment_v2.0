{"text":"Plush hotel - work in progress- My husband and I stayed at this hotel on our last night in Spain and we stayed in the property across the street. Evidently, both properties have construction going on...the main property was super loud in the lobby when we checked in and the guy said, don't worry, you are staying across the street. That property was a bit more modern in decor and there was construction going on there as well. Right outside our door in the elevator shaft. Luckily it stopped at 6 or 7pm and we had to be up at 7am to leave but I can imagine that others on our floor would be upset and after seeing other recent reviews, I think it's a problem. The room itself was sleek and modern but oh so cold. The thermostat was set to 20\/21 but it felt like an freezer in there. Luckily they had a down comforter in the closet. The bathroom is really cool but the design of the shower is stupid. Water just flows out onto the bathroom floor and beyond. The location is great although you are in the middle of the shopping\/tourist areas but if you want to stroll down and visit a couple of Gaudi's famous works, they are right there. It is also close by a metro stop. You gotta go through a construction zone to get to breakfast and like another reviewer said, it's set up to feel like a business-travel hotel but the food was good and a great selection of fruits\/fruit salads. I'm sure both properties will be ultra cool\/lovely once they are finished with all of the work.
