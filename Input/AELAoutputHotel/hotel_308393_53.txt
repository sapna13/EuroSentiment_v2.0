{"text":"Nice price, nice experience We chose to stay at this hotel because we were offered a discounted stay due to the fact that we were flying with Singapore Airlines. The room was comfortable, with a TV, tea and coffee making facilities and a lovely view over the river and out to the city. The hotel is situated about 15 minutes walk from Orchard Road, the main shopping district in Singapore. We liked the location, however, because it is away from the noise and bustle of Orchard Road but still within walking distance of everything. It can get quite hot in Singapore, however, so we usually took the bus to get to places. There is a bus stop right outside the door of the hotel.There is an outdoor pool in the hotel which is simple but pleasant and a nice place to cool down after the day's shopping! In the evening, there is entertainment provided in the hotel bar. When we were there, the entertainment was usually in the form of different singing groups.The hotel's restaurant serves a la carte and buffet dinners but has a limited selection of western food so be prepared to try some things that you've never eaten before if you do choose to eat here!When booking this hotel, I would recommend that you ask for a room in the newer section of the building. The rooms in the older section are fine but you get a bit more space and more modern decor if you get a room in the new section.I would say that this hotel is no better or worse than other hotels of this price range in Singapore and, while I may choose to stay somewhere else on another visit, I would recommend the Hotel Miramar for a comfortable, enjoyable stay in Singapore.
