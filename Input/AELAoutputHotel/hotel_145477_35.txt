{"text":"Clean beds, great location. What more do you want? A party of 8 of us stayed at the San Juan over New Years. I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews (among the group were my parents), but I must say that the San Juan is a fine place to base yourself if you want to explore South Beach and not pay $300 for a room. Here are some of the positives:1) Location, location, location. SJ is on Collins Ave (A1A\/Ocean Dr.), 1\/2 block from Lincoln Ave., and 1 block from the beach. You don't get much more central for the price2) Friendly staff. They might not speak impecable English, but they are friendly and helpful. It seems to be a fairly small staff and it feels as if they know each other quite well. Think Fawlty Towers...3) Cleanliness. Some people have complained about dirty beds. Perhaps the hotel took the complaints to heart. When we stayed there, the mattresses seemed to be brand-new and the sheets and towels were impecably clean. There are some negatives, but they're mostly the result of the hotel class. Budget means budget. You don't get much for $100-$150 in South Beach. Yes, the tvs are old (what are you doing watching tv anyway?), the plumbing is old (lukewarm showers are the norm) and every room seems to have an alley view. These are not rooms to hang out in. If you want that, pay the $300 to stay at the Nationale across the road and stop whining!
