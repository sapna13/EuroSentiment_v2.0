{"text":"The WORST stay EVER!!!! This was the worst stay that I ever had ever! The service was horrible. It took over an hour just to get a plate of chips at the BallyHoo Bar and Grill. All the restaurants had bad service and so-so food. Also, the prices were really high. It was $3.50 for a bottle of water. The room service took a hour and a half for a bowl of cereal and some coffee. Really, the only good thing was the comfort of the beds. The hotel workers were grumpy and unfriendly. It took a whole day to get the towels that I had ordered the day before. The hotel was one hour away from San Juan Airport and you need to take a bus to the hotel. There is no beach on the mainland so you have to go to Palomino Island, but there could be bad weather so you can't go to the beach all the time. The Las Olas pool and the water park pools are not heated. There is no jacuzzi at the water park and the shady seats are very, very limited. The normal seats are limited, too. The jacuzzi at Las Olas had BROWN water and towels are very had to come by, so if you see some, grab them. We stayed at the Marina, so we had to take trams to go up to the main hotel area. The first few times are O.K, but it gets old. The direction to hold on to the rails comes on AFTER the tram moves. All the rooms were recently renovated, but we thought that we were staying at a beachfront motel it looked so cheap. We thought the furniture was from IKEA. The service at the front desk takes minimum fifteen minutes to speak to someone, and they sound like they don't care. My daughter thought that this was horrible and wouldn't go back even if there was first class airfare all expenses paid. Our trip WAS all expenses paid and it was STILL bad. The food was good at The Strip House. They have great steak. But, that was it. A glass of wine costs at least fifteen to twenty dollars per glass. They don't leave chocolates on your pillow when they clean the room. If they say they are a four star hotel,(we couldn't believe it), they should act like it. My final words are, DON'T GO.
