{"text":"Will never forget My wife and I lived in 7Bridges in March, 2007. We stayed here for 4 nights. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ very nice  romantic small hotel (thanks to tripadvisor.com for making a right choice and Gunter for nice days spent in the hotel).We were first Russians visited 7Bridges. Russian tour companies do not book such small hotels so we made all reservations by our own. It was not difficult and we did not have any problems with visas. Gunter was so kind to send us an e-mail confirmation of the reservation and Holland embassy in Moscow was fully satisfied with the printed copy of the e-mail. The only problem is to book the room in 7Bridges. We were very lucky to find an unreserved room only two weeks in advance. So we advise to Russians not to be afraid to make reservations by yourself and to stay where you want rather than where your tour company imposes you to stay.We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe got room A with individual entrance from the canal. We found it very romantic to have our own key imagining that we are true Dutchmen. The minus is that this room is not served with breakfast but it has a small kitchen with tea\/coffee facilities and a small refrigerator. You can visit small stores for natives near to the hotel or visit numerous AH stores.Also I would like to note that a smart coffeeshop is located 25m from the hotel. It was rather small and we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have any problems with noise or didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see any junkies on the street. But it was very comfortable to return home after having some smoke.The hotel is situated very close to the center a few minutes walk to Rembrandt square. At the same time it is a quiet place. Thanks to 7Bridges we will never forget our first visit to Amsterdam.
