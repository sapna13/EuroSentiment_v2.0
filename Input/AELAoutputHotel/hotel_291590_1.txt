{"text":"oooops....still Cool (not Barcelo Sants) √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√™ool!√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>Barcelo Sants gogirlie3 West CoastDec 2, 2008 I think it was booked thru travelocity or expedia. not sure - whoever american airlines uses. ANYWAY. Great little place away from tourist central but with a great view of the beach (across the blvd). We enjoyed it. The young women at reception were pleasant, helpful and attractive. The guys weren't helping the business much - terse, snobby, tired of their jobs. We even tried to butcher their language while communicating (oh, maybe that was it - our Catalan was so bad we might have accidently said something wrong - sorry, we tried, this was our first time). The restaurant was really great with excellent Ports and desserts. They were very friendly and understanding of our late hours coming in after a day of touring, hungry. the service was just right and added to our enjoyment. And we even got to take our pic with a Spanish futbal star who was staying there. would always go back. A little hard to find at first, but you can get there via the train from the airport(cheapest way -get a multiday pass) you'll just have a 5-10 minute walk from the nearest station. parts of the neighborhood look like they could be sketchy after dark. Like all cities-night wouldn't be the time to walk alone. Beds were comfortable and good sized. Room was very clean, housekeeping generally friendly and flexible, in-room safe, amenities were nice. There was a conference and we really didn't notice any noise from conference goer's partying. We would go back. ","annotations":[]}
