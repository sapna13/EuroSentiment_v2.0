{"text":"Fantastic stay! I am so glad that I listened to all of the great reviews this hotel has received in the past. Yes, the hotel is right near the airport and you can hear and see planes take off all day, but the noise really isn't all that distracting. And it's pretty cool to watch the planes take off while you relax in the ocean or on the beach. The beach.......is beautiful! The hotel provides lounge chairs and towels and it was never crowded during our five night stay. The hammocks on the beach were awesome - very relaxing under the shade of the coconut trees. The hotel staff were all extremely happy, kind and helpful. And the food was tasty at all four food outlets. (My husband caught a cold our second day, so we did all of our eating at the hotel.) Sirena's is the finer food restaurant and is on the patio. The food is delicious. The Picante Bar menu has your chicken fingers, chicken sandwich, hamburger-type fare and all were quite tasty. And all of the drinks are quite potent and delicious. The Bananas ice cream shop is a counter in the lobby next to the bar and lounge which serves hot dogs, pizza, sandwiches and ice cream. The ice cream is Ben  Jerry's. The Salsa restaurant's breakfast buffet is delicious and the dinner buffet is pretty tasty too (if you like Puerto Rican cuisine). All prices were reasonable considering (of course they're higher than local joints, but you're paying of the ease of it all). The casino is small, but enjoyable if you're a gambler (we didn't have much luck, but we witnessed some winners). The hotel overall was very clean and well-kept. The room wasn't huge, but it fit a king bed, sofa and desk and what more does one really need? The bed was super comfortable and the balcony (two chairs and a small table) was a nice touch.
