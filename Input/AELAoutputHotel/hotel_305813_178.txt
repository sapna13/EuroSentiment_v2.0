{"text":"Great hotel, shame about check-in We have just returned from a week's stay at Langham Place in Mongkok. We had a lovely time apart from a bad experience at check-in.We took the limo transfer from the airport to the hotel where we were offered soft drinks and newspapers and were given a PSP with a video presentation about the hotel. The staff at the airport and the driver were helpful and friendly.Once at the hotel, the check-in was quick and easy, but we did not find the staff particularly welcoming or pleasant. On leaving the lift at our floor, we noticed a strong smell of smoke and on entering our room we found it also to smell and have an ash-tray and matches. We booked our room well in advance, at the time requesting a non-smoking room and reconfirmed this the day before we travelled. We were not told at check-in that no non-smoking rooms were available and were allocated a smoking room. We called the S.M.A.R.T Centre (guest helpline) and were told that no other rooms were available and they would send cleaners to carry out an air treatment within the next ten minutes. After waiting for 45 minutes with no sign of the cleaners, we went directly to reception to try and get the matter sorted. They were suprised that the cleaners had not arrived and offered to send the cleaners back immediately. We didn't think this was acceptable after waiting so long, and asked to be moved to another room. After another 10 minutes of two members of staff looking at the computer and talking to each other in Chinese, a non-smoking room suddenly became available. Although this room was on a lower level, we had no choice but to accept it as we were tired after 13 hours of travelling and just wanted to get to our room. No real apology was made apart from a sorry for the inconvenience as we left to go to the new room. It was not the level of service we would expect from this standard of hotel.Our room was lovely as other reviewers have described. We booked an Executive room which we found to be of a good size with lots of storage space, which was handy as we were staying a week. The bed was very big and extremely comfy with lots of extra of pillows. The bathroom had an amazing walk-in shower and separate bath with plenty of amenities, e.g. toothbrush, razor, cottonwool, comb etc. The glass wall was an excellent idea to see the view or TV from your bath, but also had a blind if you wanted privacy. Cleanliness was of a very high standard.We had breakfast at the hotel every day. The restaurant was a lovely setting with a huge choice of western and asian food. We particularly liked the chefs who were very friendly and jolly. Breakfast closes promptly at 10.30 which the waiting staff remind you at 10.15 by pointing at their watch and bringing olive oil to the table ready for lunch!The location of the hotel was excellent and unlike other reviews, we did not find the area scary at all. We liked that we were surrounded by locals and it wasn't too touristy. The MTR station was just outside the hotel, also accessible through the adjoining mall. The mall was very modern with a huge of range of shops and restaurants and a mini supermarket in the basement.Overall, the hotel itself and its location were faultless. The staff, particuarly the chefs, concierge, housekeeping, doormen and pink ladies were extremely friendly and helpful, but were let down by the indifferent check-in staff.
