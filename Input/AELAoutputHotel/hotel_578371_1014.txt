{"text":"Beautiful Resort! Needs to work on a few things!!! I just returned on Oct 16th and figured I would write a review hoping that someone from the hotel will see this.  When we arrived for check in we were pleasently suprised to find out that we we upgraded to a colonial suite which has a living room, a large patio with a jacuzzi tub, and a large patio on the 4th floor. I prefer higher floors because there are less bugs and the view of the beach\/pool was spectacular. Room service was included although the options are very limited. The room was clean and spacious. They really need to work on those beds and pillows though. The pool was immaculate. There is not one bad thing that I can say about that pool. There was always a palapa or just a beach chair in general for that matter. There was always enough room for everybody and never over crowded. Loved that!! The pool is extremely clean. The only issue was the pool bar. It's far unless you are on that side of the pool.  Now the food. We have alot to discuss. There is no snack bar during the day, which baffled me. No place to get a good hot dog, hamburger chicken fingers, chicken sandwich nothing. I know I am not in the US but sometimes you get a little craving for a snack. When they did have hamburgers at the beach restaurant, which was once, they are a mystery. I have no clue what kind of meat those burgers are made from. I don' t think I want to know. The hot dogs were defintately no better. They did have a snack bar from 11pm-6am. Who the heck feels like walking that distance for in the middleof the night. We did it one night because we got extremely hungryand only wound up liking the chicharrones (fried chicken chunks). Please majestic change thoose burgers and get an all day snack bar. This is the only hotel I have ever been to without one. The service is something to be desired. You would wait a good 15 to 20 minutes for someone to even take your order. Alot of times we would just seat ourselves which shouldn't be. Especially for the buffet. The waitresses didn't know who needed drinks etc. Very disorganized !!I went to every restaurant except the french, Le Gourmet. The seafood restaurant was good I had grilled lobster. The steakhouse was delicious get the ny strip.Buffet restaurant was okay. The food was always lukewarm or cold. My boyfriend ate something bad and about 2 hours later he was in the bathroom.The Japanese was okay also. We have definately had better japanese at all inclusives. The real winner for us was the fried ice cream.The Michael jackson show was good and I won $400 at the casino. Thats about all the entertainment I did, but it was fun.The beach is incredible. It was honestly the best beach I have ever been to and I have been everywhere, including Paradisus Palma Real. There are no rocks or seaweed. The waves were a little rough but it was worth it.All in all, this place has the potential to be a great hotel. It just needs a little tweaking. I thoroughly enjoyed my 8 days of relaxation. Thanks for reading!!
