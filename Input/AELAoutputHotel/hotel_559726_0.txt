{"text":"Aqua Palms and Spa Is Very Overrated I booked my reservation at the Aqua Palms and Spa Hotel through the hotels.com web site. When my wife and I arrived, we encountered numerous issues with the hotel, and those issues were:1. ElevatorsThe two working elevators (the third elevator was under renovation) were slow and the doors quickly closed on people. During our stay, there was one day where none of the elevators worked.Aqua Palms and Spa personnel made comments about the elevators. One staffer stated that it is frustrating that the elevators do not work and that Aqua Palms and Spa does not have a service elevator.2. Condition of RoomMy wife requested clean drinking glasses, and a hotel staffer informed her that the hotel does not provide clean drinking glasses daily. Please see other reviews for confirmation of this fact.There were stains on the lamp, headboard, and sheets. Also, there also stains on the walls and wallpaper was peeling. During one night of our stay, we entered the room to discover that maid service placed a stained upper sheet on our bed, which we found disguisting.3. Room ServiceThe maid did not clean the coffee pot everyday and neglected to provide coffee service for the majority of our stay. In other hotels that my wife and I have lodged at, it is customary for the maid staff to replenish soap and other hygiene items. Unfortunately, the maid staff did not replenish soap until we begged for more soap.4. Location of Laundry and Ice MachineThe self-service laundry and ice machine are located in a parking garage that is accessible to the public. If you went down to use the laundry room or obtain ice during nightime hours, it was very dark and unsecure\/unsafe environment. One day, three out of the four dryers were not working, and my wife had to walk approximately 1\/4 to 1\/2 mile to a laundromat to dry clothes. 5. Guest ServicesThere was a mixed attitude among the staff. Some staff were very helpful. One example of this was Sergio, the front desk person. Sergio would go out of his way to assist you. However, there were other staff members that possessed a poor attitude about helping the guests.Once my wife and I complained about the non-working elevators and how the lack of elevator service created a situation where the hotel was in non-compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The guest services manager agreed to comp two nights for the inconveinence of non-working elevators. 6. Representation of Hotel on hotels.com and Aqua Palms and Spa web siteIn all honesty, I believe the hotels.com and Aqua Palms and Spa web site provide misleading information regarding the conditions of the hotel. I am not the only individual that noted this fact. If one reads other reviews posted about the Aqua Palms and Spa, one will see that others noted that they believed that the Aqua Palms and Spa web site provided misleading information regarding the hotel.7. OverallGiven the numerous issues, I cannot recommend this hotel to any friend or foe. I believe that physical amenities of the hotel are poor and that the hotels.com and Aqua Palms and Spa web sites dramatically overrate and vastly exaggerate the conditions of this hotel.Therefore, I would recommend three things to individuals contemplating a trip to Oahu and reading this review. The first recommendation is not to use hotels.com to book a room due to overexaggeration of hotel conditions and the poor customer service that I received reporting the previous items to hotels.com. Second, I would read the reviews before booking a stay at Aqua Palms and Spa or any other hotel. Third, I strongly recommend that you stand up for your rights if you believe that you received no or poor customer service from this or any other hotel.
