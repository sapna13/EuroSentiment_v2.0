{"text":"Never again! First the good: The staff (except for manager, see below) is attentive, friendly and helpful.The bad: It is a horrible hotel. We paid for an Executive Level room -- 4th floor -- the only other perks are a bathrobe (whoopee) and a mini-fridge. Within the first hour we had maintenance at the room 3 times.The mini-fridge had a 1 hole in the center of the door where a lock had been. Maintenance fixed it by putting duct tape over the hole. Didn't cool. I insisted on a replacement.The shower did not drain. Not at all. Doesn't housekeeping ever notice this?The room was hot, thermostat showed 78 when we came in (3 pm on a Saturday, 100 degrees). I turned the dial to the lowest setting - 50 - to cool the room. One hour later it only read 77. I asked for another room, was shown 2 others, all of which were hot, didn't have mini-fridges and were on the inside corridor, not outside. I opted to stay where I was because:1) The manager, Henry ?Nagle?, told me They are working on the air conditioning.2) The inside pool was so heavily chlorinated it reeked. The smell did dissipate over the week I was there but it was nauseating for the weekend. Inside rooms had balconies that opened to the inside pool but were steamy (from the pool) and dark. Our hot room at least had an outside balcony. The halls and the elevator are NOT airconditioned below 80, due to the inside pool. This, in Phoenix, in August. You walk in from the outside 100+ heat to a lovely cool reception area, then through doors to a hot hallway, a hot elevator, and into a humid, warm room. Not nice.On Saturday night I found another maintenance man, complained about the hot room again, he told me Management wants it at this temperature, I can't change it. I found the manager again, he said, Oh no, not so, we are working on it, that's wrong. By Monday the room temp averaged about 74 even though we had it running constantly on Max Cool and dialed to 50. It stayed that way all week. Always warm and humid. Why didn't we move? We were there for a group meeting. And we heard MANY complaints about hot rooms on the east side of the hotel where we were. We figured we just had to put up with it, as we were lucky to have a room with an outside balconyHOWEVER.....on the following Saturday when we began packing to leave, the room got up to 78 again. On another floor I stopped by to see a friend, saw a housekeeper wiping the sweat off her face and asked her, Why is this hotel so hot? She ever so politely said, They are working on it. I had an inspiration -- I took a $20 bill out of my purse, held it up and asked her again, Why is this hotel so hot? She took the $20 and said, The manager insists on raising the temperature level every weekend. We hate it, it's horrible here on the weekends. And he knows the ducts on the east side don't work, he's known for months.The gift shop in the hotel doesn't take credit cards -- Management hasn't hooked us up yet. Me: How long have you been here? Answer: 3 years.Avoid this hotel, nice staff people don't make up for a poorly maintained, shabby facility with a deceitful manager.
