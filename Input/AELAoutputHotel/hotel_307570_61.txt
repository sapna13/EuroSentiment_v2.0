{"text":"Extensive renovations Although I'm sure the Grand Hyatt is a reasonably nice hotel generally, do beware if you have booked a Grand Club Room. The Grand Club has been closed for renovations for some time (it was just reopening when we left due to customer pressure, but was suffering numerous teething problems). The Hotel opted to keep the Grand Club open during the renovation work so as not to lose revenue, but housed guests in the cheapest area of the hotel, namely the West Village. The rooms here are rather dark and dingy and located at the back of the hotel. The hotel claims they have been renovated, but the renovations only extend to painting the walls. Our room had large damp patches, badly scuffed and stained floors and bed-linen so washed out that on some nights it was ripped. We were extremely disappointed with the standard of accommodation and would have chosen another hotel if we had known the Grand Club was unavailable. By the way, it costs 60 dollars per room per night to upgrade to the Grand Club locally, but Kuoni charged us 70 pounds per night. The grounds are very nicely laid out and the main swimming pool and river pool with waterslide are very nice. The only problem is that they become rather over-crowded. Although we had paid for the use of the private Grand Club pool it was shut and no alternative was offered. Throughout our 14 night stay we were unable to get sunbeds around the pool and sat on the beach instead which was quieter but rather windy. The Bay Club pool only has 8 sunbeds and the Balinese pool is probably more suitable for adults. We found the hotel restaurants (those that were actually open) rathr lacking in atmosphere and used the Galleria shopping centre oppposite and took taxis to Jimbaran Bay (great for sunsets and fish dinners on the beach) and other local restaurants such as the Bumbu Bali.Overall we had a very negative experience at the Grand Hyatt due to the closure of the Grand Club for renovations, the closure of the Grand Club pool and the closure of 2 restaurants and in these circumstances it is difficult to be positive about the resort. However, I think it would be a pleasant place to stay once all the renovations have been completed and out of the high season. The Grand Club rooms looked as though they will be very nice when completed, but the standard of room in the west village is certainly not 5-star. We have stayed in many other 5-star hotels and although the grounds and hotel facilities compare well the rooms really let this hotel down. For information, we heard good things about the Sheraton, Westin and the Conrad.
