{"text":"lovely little hotel this hotel is lovely and clean, there are however some points i must make to make this a fair review. We had a quiet room at the back of the hotel, the a\/c unit is direct to the outside so some street noise can always be heard..what you do need to bear in mind though is that this is new york city, there will always be background noise. the room itself i felt was small, (511) as was the shower room. what we did miss was a bath, after pounding the streets for hours and hours personally we would have liked a relaxing soak, but that is very personel preference. we cannot however distract from the very personel service that this hotel offers. turn down every evening with chocolate bar, wine and cheese, complimentory 5pm-8pm every evening and the very high standard breakfast offered every morning was a real bonus.All the staff were extreamly helpful, polite and courtious throughout our stay and find it hard to believe that some reveiws have been negative towards staff here, we greated everybody in the same way we were greated every time we walked through the doors and never had a discourtious word said. i have to say with this hotel it's the little extra touches that make your stay very special, nothing too extravigant but you are made to feel that little bit more welcome than some big chain hotels. this hotel isn't cheap, but for the service you receive is worth those couple of hundred more. we had a complimentiry bottle of bubbly included in our stay and the front desk made sure we received this. all in all i would book to return to this hotel as the location is fantastic and central and the little extra's make your stay that little bit more special.....tony's italian next door, good pasta, reasonable prices, $20 for pasta and meatballs enough for two, be warned the beers are expensive, $7.50 for a corona, also spankys bbq just up the street is worth a mention, just what you'd expect from an american eatery, reasonable beer, good ribs and chicken and the service and staff very good. we loved nyc and will be making a return journey sometime in the future and if the prices at cassablanca stay reasonable, will book to stay there again.Joanne and Martin McGee, West Yorkshire.
