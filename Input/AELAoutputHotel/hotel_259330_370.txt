{"text":"GO GET AWAY this was our first visit to Punta Cana and we were very pleased. The food was very good with variety. the only food we didn't enjoy was the steak, the rest was very delicious., especially the Italian food.Our room was acceptable, clean, etc., I don't know where you would stay and have a room without some small problems. this is not a new resort so if you want new that is where you should book your plans. there was plenty of activities at the resort and outside the resort. if you book an all inclusive you have a huge variety of outside adventures. we went on a snorkeling party boat which was great!! we swam with the dolphins and took a 40 minute helicopter ride. the staff for the most part was very helpful . we ran into a problem with the gift shop staff, they will run off most of the business if the Paradise keeps them, they were rude and tried to jip our friend out of $8.00. very unpleasant experience, they acted as if you weren't there when you went to check out but the whole time you were shopping they watched you like a hawk and kept looking at the tags on your items. we stayed in the junior suites so we had to take the train, we never found this to be a problem. we went to the sports bar a couple of nights, we did a little gambling but mostly did our activities through the day and didn't care to do a lot of evening partying. the pools were good some debris but not bad. the beach was wonderful, the water at the time was a bit rough . don't drink the water unless it is sealed bottled water. Overall I would go back again for sure............thanks to the staffRay and Dee\\Atlanta Ga ","annotations":[]}
