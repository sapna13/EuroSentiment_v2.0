{"text":"I'd go back in a flash A nice little hotel tucked into a busy area of Venice, the Antiche Figure is directly across the Grand Canal from the train station. To get there from the station, simply gross the bridge, turn to the right and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ about the equivalent of a city block at most. The bus station to the airport is a short walk beyond the hotel and across a couple of bridges and you can travel to either Marco Polo or Treviso for very little money. With the trains, gondolas, heavy foot traffic and constant coming and going of the vaporetti, you might at first wince at the prospect of a room fronting the canal, however, we spent two nights there and slept like babies.Rooms are smallish but comfortable, with a worn-around-the edges sort of elegance with plenty of closet space, in room safe and fridge, TV, phone, antiqued furniture and silk drapes, and the spacious and elegant baths which seemed to be the standard during our stay in Italy. Personnel is crisply efficient and consistently available. There is an elevator, an ample Continental breakfast of fruits, yogurt, cereal, and pastries or croissants. There is a machine for American coffee and staff will quickly offer you freshly made cappuccino if they spot you in front of the apparatus. Granted the Antiche Figure is a long walk to Piazza San Marco (which can be obviated by traveling via vaporetto) and perhaps it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not the most glamorous spot in Venice, but the view is still lovely. Frankly, after the hordes of tourists in Piazza San Marco, I found the area rather an oasis.
