{"text":"Nice hotel but in it for the Money I am just coming to the end of a stay at this hotel for the IBM WebSphere Conference. First impressions are that it is an impressive building (with the lobby full building height and the rooms balconied off it and a glass walled lift). The rooms are very nice, with a large bed and sofa, as well as the usual office area for work in the evening. TV was replaced with a trendy LCD one during my stay there. Bathroom is OK (though mine had cracked glass in the door dividing the toilet area from the bath area and a cracked sink, which you wouldn't expect from a 5* hotel.Nice live piano music echo's up the structure to the rooms in the evenings which is nice too.However all this was spoilt for me by the hotels agressive money focus. Even with our conference bulk booking reduction the price was 240E a night (bed and buffet breakfast), which in it's self isn't too bad for a five star hotel, however they seem to have managed to exclude absolutely everything from this. - On arrival I was shocked there was no tea and coffee.. and not even a bottle of water to drink or a biscuit. Had I wanted to pay 5E i could have had a small 250ml bottle of water from the fridge. - Should I want a Twix I could pay 7E yes 7E (1000% mark up). I instead payed 22E for a disgusting raw burger with fries (the fries were good).- My friend couldn't get an iron to iron her shirts because they insist you use their ironing service, which cost more than the shirt.- A film on the tv costs 14E- Swimming is included but on the third day of swimming i was told I must buy a swim hat at 6E which they insisted on cash for and would not put on my room. I hadn't brought cash funnily enough because they won't let guests have a key to a locker without becoming a yearly member of the leisure club. You have to take your clothes and leave them pool side. shameful. - After all this price stress you might like to unwind with a dip in the jaccuzi\/hot tub by the pool. But this isn't included you would have to pay another 20E to use this.I am still here at the moment but I sudder in fear at what they will have charged me per toilet flush or for each breath of air.I stay in various 5* hotels but expect at least some of the basics to be included. My company gives us a daily allowance for food etc on top of the room rate. we can't expense everything like some people can.. so this is totally unacceptable.
