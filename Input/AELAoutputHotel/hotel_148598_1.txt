{"text":"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome We stayed at a two bedroom condo on the grounds of the Rio Mar Resort. It was in a gated community called Cluster 3. It was a fabulous condo filled with every amenity. It had 2 and 1\/2 baths, large terrace, living room, family room, dining room, open kitchen, master bedroom with huge his and her closets and a second bedroom with two double beds and a double futon couch. We had 3 t.v.'s and all the laundry facilities. The condo was fully stocked with all the necessary laundry and cleaning supplies as well as a kitchen stocked with all the supplies you could need to cook a gourmet meal. It was super clean and quiet! We rented a car which is a total necessity. The condo came with a golf cart which was a convenient way to get to the beach. The beach and pools of the hotel are 3\/4 mile away from the condo but it is a lovely walk or an easy golf cart ride. There is so much to do on the island of Puerto Rico. We hiked up to the clouds in the rain forest and then down to La Mina Falls. We were gone all day, we had a blast! We tried Snuba (highly recommend). We rented bicycles and cycled on the boardwalk in Pinones. We saw a professional Puerto Rican baseball game in Carolinas. We kayaked in the Bio Bay in Fajardo. We spent a day on Luquillo Beach. Everything exceeded our expectations! We can't wait to go back. The grocery store is just down the street. It has exotic choices as well as our recognized brands. We felt very safe. We never had anyone approach us to buy anything. The weather was awesome! We have 3 kids age 10 -15. We all had a marvelous time. ","annotations":[]}
