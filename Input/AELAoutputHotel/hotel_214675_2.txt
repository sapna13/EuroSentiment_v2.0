{"text":"Better in 2009 I would not suggest booking the The Castle Maile Sky Court until next year. They are in the process of replacing the elevators, so in the 24 floor tower, only one of three was working and in the 42 floor towner, only two of four were working. This project is not going to be done until January.Also, there is no Internet in the rooms, only in the lobby. They have signed a contract with TimeWarner to put new cable to all the rooms that will provide Internet and HD Television. I don't know when this will be completed, so ask very specific questions like do you NOW have free Internet in the guest rooms?The staff was very accommodating, the restaurant was good and the location was close to the Convention Center and the Waikiki strip. They have a free muffin and beverage breakfast or a $4.00 discount at the restaurant, for any meal. With the discount the meals are priced reasonably.Ownership changed last October from Outrigger, who did not maintain the property well. The new Japanese owners have a lot of catching up to do.Another problem we had was our tools, about $2000 worth, were stolen out of the locked rental car, so don't leave any valuables in a car. The hotel security and police responses were quick, however they couldn't do much about it. We are checking to see if insurance will cover the loss.Hawaii was great!, We climbed Diamond Head two days before they closed it for a month to do improvements. We toured the USS Missouri Battleship and hiked into Waimea Falls. Nearby we enjoyed a wonderful dinner with a view of the sunset at Jamesons by the Sea.I would stay there again, after the improvements have been completed.
