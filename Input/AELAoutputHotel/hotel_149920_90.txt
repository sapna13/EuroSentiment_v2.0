{"text":"Great stay in Marriott in April 2008 We just returned from our mini-vacation in San Juan, PR in Mid April, 2008. We chose Marriott because we trusted their chain all over the world for the professional service and clean rooms. Marriott San Juan is a perfect place to stay if you'd like a comfortable, clean room at a great, well-maintained place. Our room was on the 18th floor with beautiful ocean view. The hotel gets a little crowded at night due to live entertainment in the bar area, but we went out to Old Town San Juan every night and only can speak of one night we spent at Stellaris casino. To those who complain about the beach being closed: red flag meant there were waves and swimming was not recommended, you could sun bath as much as you wanted: I bet you would complain about the hotel even if it were raining. The beach is wonderful with comfortable lunges, literally two steps away from the hotel entrance. The beach itself is not the best as all the beaches around the island-you need to visit surrounding island if you want a great beach experience. The hotel has rather expensive Internet access of $15 per 24 hours and pricey breakfast for $25.00 which is not the best, but definitely better than surrounding restaurants. The Tuscany Italian Restaurant on the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ ground floor is one of the best places for Italian food.I would highly recommend this hotel to couple without kids and those who rent a car on the island because of hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ location being pretty far away from all the historic sites and clubs and restaurant in the Old Town.
