{"text":"we're looking forward to our next visit We stumbled on the Rex as we were planning our honeymoon. We're both literary fans with a streak of artsy-fartsy, so this was right up our alley.For months, we told all our friends about our upcoming stay at the literary salon. They all thought we were nuts. Upon arrival, (about $40 by taxi from the airport) we checked in and found ourselves in a very comfortable, albeit small room.We were told that the rooms get bigger the higher up you go, and we were on the second floor. Bathroom was smallish, but not uncomfortably so. There's a well-stocked mini-bar (great for holding leftovers from the restaurants in the area), and spa robes in the wardrobe.The hotel is situated a comfortable walking distance from both Union Square and China Town, and smack dab in the middle of a run of galleries. We spent a lot of time gallery hopping and checking out the very active art scene in the city.If you want touristy-type stuff, the staff can help you figure out the best way to spend your $$--a weekend pass vs individual admissions...There's a delightful cafe adjoining the hotel, as well. A wine reception in the evenings was a warm welcome after a day of running around. The best part though, was the artist series the Rex has in the Salon. We stumbled upon the Antigone Gone concert--a worldclass guitar player who would be impossible to see elsewhere...the salon is intimate--about 80-90 guests, so there isn't a bad seat--and you can actually SEE the musicians playing! we LOVED our stay at the Rex and plan to celebrate many anniversaries to come!
