{"text":"Great hotel, avoid Exec Club We stayed at this hotel a few years ago when it first opened. At that time I assumed the Service problems on the Executive Club floor were only the growing pains of a brand new hotel. Apparently not....years later, the service on the Exec floor is slow and inefficient. During cocktail hour, I have never seen SO many waiters do SO little SO slowly.At breakfast time the number of tables available was completely and utterly insufficient for the number of people who wanted to eat! The hotel should either add more tables or allow Club members to use room service as a complimentary alternative.Having criticized the Club floor to bits, I'd now like to state that the rest of the hotel is gorgeous. The rooms are large (by HK standards) with LOTS of storage, cushy beds, wifi, massive TV, minibar, kettle, great bathrooms with seperate tub and shower stall, and wonderful floor to ceiling windows. The pool has a wonderful view....I assume you're not going to HK to tan, but if you are, be advised the sun goes behind adjacent building after 2 pm.Check-in can be dicey: we were kept waiting for our room from 4 pm to 6:30 pm upon arrival.....given we used the hotel car and thus the hotel knew when we were arriving it is a puzzle how they could get it so wrong. I found the best rates for this hotel on the hotel website. When we stay here again we'll book a room ONLY....the Executive Club is not worth the extra $$ given the inconveniences, slow service and inadequate facilities.
