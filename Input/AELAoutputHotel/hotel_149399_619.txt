{"text":"Honest review; the good, bad and ugly Grounds: are beautiful and well maintained, although a very large complex with cobblestoned roads that are tough on the feet and very slippery when wet. Beach is very pretty, although the daily battle for umbrella'd huts which are too few, requires an early wake up call and reserving your spot with a towel or other personal item. Pools are nice but need some maintenance. Pool patrons are pretty sloshed by midday and usually best to avoid (beach has a nicer element)Rooms: Decent rooms, not enough towels, once had to wait until 6 PM for clean towels. Light switches weirdly connected. TV without any pay-per movies or video games for kids nor any info about resort or activites. No information in rooms about amenities, times of activities, etc.Food: Mediocre at best. Ridiculous reservation system forcing you to wake at 7 AM to call for next day reservations with constant busy signals (like buying tickets for a concert through ticketmaster!) Just what I want to do on vacation!! If you happened to get a reservation, not at a time you necessarily want. Dishes quite unimaginative, typically overly well done, and rehashed from restaurant to restaurant. Rice and beans at a Chinese restaurant? My wife and I each had a bellyache at some point. Service: Staff are generally friendly, nice, but most don't speak English and often don't get the job done. Instead of asking for assistance from a coworker who speaks english, your requests for help result in a smile, a shrug, and ultimately nothing. I brought dollar bills to tip the staff but this didn't result in better service for the most part. On the Caribe Beach, a waiter carrying drinks for the patrons was frankly rude and made insulting comments in spanish to guests and to me, even after I tipped him! What a jerk. There is a desparate need for formal instruction on Basic service issues for the staffBars: No beach bars; a major bummer. No waiter service at beach or pool except for the obnoxious guy mentioned above who carried around crappy warm beer and non alcoholic sweet drinks. Limited alcohol choices and clearly watered down stuff. I could swear the Absolut and Tonic I ordered had some cheap vodka poured into an Absolut bottle. Only one beer, Presidente, which makes Bud look like Heinekin.Night life: Super lame shows with lipsynching entertainers dancing to 20 year old music. Pathetically bad. Casino tiny but adequate. One disco which caters to tweens and teens between 10 - 12 PM and then they turn the lights up, kick the kids out, and play super loud salsa music from 12-1 am, clearly catering to one group of patrons. Quite disappointing. Essentially nothing to do at night except have a mediocre dinner and drink afterwards. PS, they're desserts stink.Tip: Much better to spend $25 for an air conditioned cab ride to and from the airport than deal with the horrible buses and vans that pack you in like sardines, are hot, and make multiple stops at other hotelsWould go back to Punta Cana but not to Melia; they need a lot of work ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1226,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1219},{"endOffset":2234,"mention":"Absolut","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Absolut_Vodka"],"startOffset":2227}]}
