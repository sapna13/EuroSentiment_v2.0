{"text":"From a family with a toddler We just came back from one night here while stopping through Seattle. The price wasn't too bad with the AAA rate of $312\/night, though for that price I have high expectations. First arriving, we were greeted by the valet attendants and these guys were all very friendly\/helpful. They get 5 stars from me!!We didn't have to wait in line to check in, which was nice. However, the one negative for me was that they said our luggage would be right up and we were supposed to have a crib in our room since it was noted with our reservation and I called a week before to comfirm. The crib wasn't there so I called downstairs and they brought it up. The crib ended up looking very nice and we also got some baby toiletries with it. After waiting for our luggage 20 minutes, I called again and it was brought to our room. This normally isn't a big deal but we did have to wait for it for going out. The room we were in on the fifth floor, 534 did look out with the pool right below us, so if possible, request something away from there.It had a suite with a tv, bedroom, large closet area and bathroom. Everything looked beautiful in marble, the hotel is beautiful too and fancy and is centrally located for the pike's place market (several blocks away walking). If you want to get to the seattle center you will have to take another mode of transportation, as it's too far to walk, but there is a bus stop and monorail stop a few blocks from the hotel.There is also a benihanna's on the next block, which I recommend. Our toddler loved it(: ","annotations":[]}
