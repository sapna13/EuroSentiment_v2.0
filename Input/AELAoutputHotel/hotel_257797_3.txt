{"text":"Below Average We found the standard of the Crown Plaza hotel way below 5 * ratings. Depending on your hotel experience and your expectation of a hotel I would not chose or recommend the Crown Plaza. If you can afford a five 5* hotel, try the Amora Jamison Sydney. My husband and I stayed at the Crown Plaza for three nights whilst he was at a Business Conference in the city. Our stay was during √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√âorld Youth Day√à√\u2020\u2022?and many Pilgrims were staying at the hotel so the volume of people catching the lift was quite heavy. The lifts were disappointing, very small and extremely slow. I was also pregnant and went down for breakfast one morning, requested boiled water and waited 20 minutes only to realize that the waiter was never coming back. Dinner at the restaurant was expensive. The menu choice was limited and the meals that they did provide was tasteless and average. The room size was OK, but the bed was quite √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√ºorrible√à√\u2020\u2022? It was a queen bed that was very low to the ground and the mattress extremely uncomfortable. It was also in winter and they had no blanket on the bed and only one fitted sheet on the bed. The pillows were uncomfortable and not very clean. My husband asked for extra sheets and pillows. They obliged and told us that it is hotel policy that the bed is made with only one sheet. The last night of our stay (which we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ wait to leave) our 14 months old son joined us. They provided a cot for him that was completely old, tattered and toured. I quest the only good thing about the Crown is it location close to most things.
