{"text":"Loved Antiche Figure!! We have just returned from 4 nights at Hotel Anitche Figure in Venice. We stayed there prior to boarding the Splendour of the Sea on a Greek Island cruise. The hotel is on the grand canal and beautifully maintained. The service is fantastic and all of the staff we met were charming and friendly. The hotel is right across from the train station and next to the major port and bus stop - we were able to walk with our luggages to get on the cruiseship. The four of us stayed in 2 separate rooms, I believe rooms can only accommodate a maximum of 3 people. My two daughters had their own room close by and the rooms are very comfortable with beautiful bathrooms. The included breakfast is simple but really tasty with enough items to keep us going for the whole day. We hiked\/walked to the famous San Marco Square every day. It was an advanture to take a different route on a daily basis. We enjoyed sitting in front of the hotel in the late afternoon with wine and snack looking at all the passerbys. It was a positive that the hotel is not at the center of the tourist area around San Marco. The shops around tend to have better prices and are less crowded than around San Marco and the Rialto Bridge. The staff also showed us some new residential units, i.e., apartments that are part of the hotel in the street next to the hotel. Since it was our first time in Venice, we wanted to be overlooking the grand canal, but we will definitely consider staying at those units the next time. We will definitely go back to Hotel Anitche Figure when we plan on returning to Venice. ","annotations":[]}
