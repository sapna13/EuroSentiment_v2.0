{"text":"Great Family Hotel My husband and I took our two oldest (of 4) children on a spring break trip to San Juan to enjoy the beach, learn some history, and practice our Spanish. The beaches of San Juan are comparable to those of southern (Miami) Florida, with nice sand and clear water. We experienced some of Puerto Rico's prettiest beaches on a day trip to the offshore isle of Culebra, which has little to recommend it other than its beautiful sand and waters.San Juan's history -- especially the old Spanish fortifications -- is interesting, if a bit underwhelming. The nearby rainforest of El Yunque National Park was certainly beautiful, though not quite as spectacular as I had expected. That said, both old San Juan and El Yunque offer quick, easy, and interesting diversions if you do not want to spend all day at the beach.The people of Puerto Rico were very kind and accomodating and one young man gave us a friendly and free ride back to San Juan from Fajardo (1 hour +) one disastrous evening (long story).When my husband and I travel without children we stay at the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton and Mandarin Oriental hotels, so we are accustomed to good hotels. However, when we travel with our kids we try to stay at hotels that have nice pools, good activities and a lot of space. The Hilton El Caribe was wonderful on all counts.The rooms themselves are best described as perfectly standard and good business-class hotel accomodations. Our room -- a King Garden Suite (# 843) -- consisted of two connecting rooms. Each room had its own entry door, work area, mini refridgerator, safe, telephone, television and balcony. The main room had a king-size bed (quite comfortable), a full bathroom (standard), and a spacious and separate entry foyer. The second room had a full-size, pullout sofabed and a half bathroom. Pleasantly, our rooms had views of the old Fort San Geronimo (on site) and the ocean, and importantly, we experienced absolutely no daytime or evening noise.The El Caribe's grounds are quite lovely and especially fun for kids. There is a large main pool, subdivided into separate pool areas with waterfalls, or a basketball hoop, a bar, or hot tubs. The Condado Villas have a separate, more secluded and smaller pool area with its own hot tub. We generally retreated to that pool area to relax at the end of the day.The hotel has a private, man-made beach with fronts a clear, calm and small little inlet. The calm, inlet ocean water has waterslides and you can rent little boats.In addition, the El Caribe's grounds have a large carp, goldfish and koi pond. There are basketball and shuffleboard areas. There is a small children's playground. There is a pier where you can feed and observe fish in the open the ocean day or night. There are chessboards and other outdoor games scattered throughout the place. For adult relaxation, there is a nice health club, outdoor morning yoga classes, three outdoor bars, lounge chairs everywhere (on the beach, by the pool, facing the ocean pier) and hammocks in a lovely grove of palm trees. The is an onsite rental car agency (Hertz), and travel tour company (didn't use it).Finally, the El Caribe has many on-site restaurant choices (though we usually went offsite), including the truly good and relaxing Lemongrass, as well as a Starbucks coffee, Morton's steak house, Madrid tapas, and a standard hotel restaurant which hosts a breakfast buffet (kids are free) and dinner every day.The hotel's location is convenient, fifteen minutes to the airport and five minutes to Old San Juan. In short, the Hilton El Caribe -- opened as the El Caribe in 1949 -- is as good a place to stay in San Juan as any, especially with children. I would certainly stay there again if I ever return to San Juan.
