{"text":"Nice hotel, convenient location Visiting Singapore in December can be a scary option at times. Room rates are outrageous. So i was a bit surprised to see that I got a rate of SGD 175 for this hotel on the website. It is a good 4*+ hotel and to get this rate around Christmas was a surprise. This can be attributed to the global recession. The hotel is pretty nice. It is situation on Clarke Quay, which is the action and is packed with bars, clubs and restaurants. We had paid for a Swiss Business Advantage room which is level 2 in their room category. They had a club room but that was 110 SGD more. As we were staying for a week we did not want to pay the extra money. The room itself was largish for Singapore standards. Bed was decently comfortable although I found the pillows not much comfortable. The room has a flat screen TV but no DVD player and a very very poor selection of TV channels. The hotel has a 24 hour gym and a pretty good pool. The rate was including breakfast which was identical for the entire week that we stayed at the hotel. So it can get boring at times. Opposite the hotel there is the central shopping center. The shops there are nothing much but they have some good eating options. And of course there is Clarke Quay. Lots of night life over there. Taxis are plentiful and the hotel is also adjacent to the Clarke Quay MRT station. So there are lots of commute options. Overall a good stay at the hotel. Nothing much to complain about. And price was pretty good considering the time of the year.
