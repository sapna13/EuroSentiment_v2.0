{"text":"Nice Resort, but not prefect Just came back from Conrad Bali 17 until 20 DEC 2006. Basically, consider new resort in Bali (about 2 1\/2 years old). I got not much to complaint about this hotel, but breakfast in this hotel must DEFINETELY TO IMPROVE. I got the package with breakfast (at SUKU). Due to the SUKU restaurant in open air condition. So, you may find that flies are flying everywhere. In term of hygien, I will give them Terrible 0 mark. Besides, the staff in SUKU are friendly enough, but they don't really meet your expectation. I requested for two orange juices, came only after few times reminder. Besides, breakfast defietely not 5* quality. They must learn from other porperty like Ritz etc. I really got a lot of complaint about breakfast. I called room services for dinner twice. NASI GORENG is tasty, but expensive. Cost about Rupiah95,000++. But in famuos Bali restaurant BUMBU BALI, just about half price. And one restaurant opposite the Conrad hotel just charge Rupiah 27000. Overall, for 5 stars hotel. In room dinning price is acceptable and tasty enough.I got the Deluxe Oceanfront Room, I think the price was worth for it and you got nice view from the room itself. (BUT TOO CLOSE THE BEACH, IF YOU NOT CLOSE YOUR WINDOW, YOU MAY ANNOY BY THE JET SKI FROM THE ROOM).  Oh yeah, bottle water is free of charges. I got more than 10 bottles of water everyday. They only give 4 bottle during room service, but you could call and request more (But their bottle is very small, only 380ml) Day before I depatured, I walk accross the jodging path. I compare Conrad their neighbour hotel, base on distance- Tropic, Melia Benao, Club Med(500M), Nusa Dua 1.5km, Westin 1.7km, Laguna Nusa Dua 1.9km. I think Conrad is the best. Laguna Nusa Dua also very nice (I may try it on next stay). But the room in Laguna Nusa Dua is smaller, just about 36m2. Conrad about 45m2.Anyhow, I will still consider to stay this hotel in the future. I advice that you could call Airport Hotel Transport before arrive. Price is reasonable USD16.00 per way. And for daily rental, USD12.00 per hour. I rent one car 4 hours charged me USD48. I went to UBUD.If you want to know more, you could email to me leongaik@hotmail.com ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":808,"mention":"NASI GORENG","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nasi_goreng"],"startOffset":797},{"endOffset":808,"mention":"NASI GORENG","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nasi_goreng"],"startOffset":797},{"endOffset":808,"mention":"NASI GORENG","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nasi_goreng"],"startOffset":797},{"endOffset":808,"mention":"NASI GORENG","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nasi_goreng"],"startOffset":797},{"endOffset":808,"mention":"NASI GORENG","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nasi_goreng"],"startOffset":797},{"endOffset":808,"mention":"NASI GORENG","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nasi_goreng"],"startOffset":797},{"endOffset":1163,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1159},{"endOffset":1647,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1643}]}
