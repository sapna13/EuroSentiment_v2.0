{"text":"Downhill Slide For The Ilikai I would think twice before booking a trip at the Ilikai Hotel in Waikiki. I stayed here on business 5 years ago and the place has gone downhill since then. The elevators don't work every time. Even if you are supposed to go down to the lobby area, they sometimes go up to the 24th floor. At first, I thought I had too many Mai-Tais, but other guests were making similar complaints. There is a sign next to the elevators saying that they are renovating, but I don't see any work being done on them. My room's refigerator doesn't work and it looks like that has been the case for some time. The knobs on the a\/c unit are missing, so I cannot adjust the temperature or fan level and the iron's control knob is missing as well. Almost forgot-the ice machine on my floor is broke so I had to use the stairs to get some ice!To be fair, the staff has been very polite and helpful, but the maintenance and quality control is really lacking here. They should spend less time and effort keeping the lobby area immaculate (it is very clean and beautiful) and more time fixing all of the little problems that add up to unhappy guests. They don't even have a restaurant that serves breakfast or lunch in the hotel. Hotwire.com rates this 3 and a half stars-NO WAY! There have to be other hotels at a similar price that you can stay at instead of here. I booked the Prince hotel last year for $30 more a night-what a difference!!! Unless I hear from other travelers in the future that the Ilikai has done a huge transfomation, I would never stay here againButch PaulaPleasant Hill, CA ","annotations":[{"endOffset":85,"mention":"the Ilikai","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Ilikai"],"startOffset":75},{"endOffset":1511,"mention":"the Ilikai","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Ilikai"],"startOffset":1501},{"endOffset":1511,"mention":"the Ilikai","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Ilikai"],"startOffset":1501}]}
