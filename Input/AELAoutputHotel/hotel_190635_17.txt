{"text":"Pretty great, bit tacky Stayed here in August, on holiday in a standard deluxe room. Paid √à√\u2020√ü?45 for room and breakfast.This is a pretty nice hotel, as I guess you'd expect. The lobby is on the first floor, which is a good safety measure, I think. D√ã√\u2022√ñcor is kind of neutral and expensive-looking - lots of beige, grey, cream etc. Some parts of the hotel are showing minor signs of wear and tear - e.g. carpets - but very minor. Check in was fine - arrived about noon and they were able to give us our room straight away. Reasonably high - 14th floor, with decent views of the beach. I did notice later that some of the rooms on the (I think) 2nd floor seemed kind of dark, with windows looking out onto the rear of the pool-level caf√ã√\u2022√ñ- I'd try to avoid them if I were you. Great BO sound system and LCD TV in the room. Also a Nespresso machine, but the hotel charges √à√\u2020√ü? per capsule, which is kind of crazy. I know it's a top-end hotel, and you expect to pay more etc, but √à√\u2020√ü??! That's a markup of around 1300%. Watch out for the √à√\u2020√ü?5 CDs too. Very comfortable beds, great linens and towels. Large bathroom with separate shower cubicle and toilet cubicle. Breakfast was pretty good - standard hotel buffet in the ground floor restaurant. No eggs cooked to order though, for any egg fans out there.A lot of people have noted that the hotel isn't in the centre of town, but it's only a short taxi ride away. It's within walking distance of the Museum of Catalonia and the Maremagnum shopping mall, though. Both are pretty rubbish, actually, so don't be too upset if you don't include them on your itinerary. The museum has the worst rooftop caf√ã√\u2022√ñ - recommended in the Time Out Barcelona Guide - very unfriendly service and poor aircon, so very hot. The Maremagnum mall has very few shops, and of those there are very few you'd actually like to buy things from.The pool was great - decent enough size, not massive though. A lot of children and families around - more than I had anticipated. Lots of attendants to help you find a lounger etc. Plenty of little Spawn of Satans running around, belly flopping and splashing. Tended to get busy by late morning, all the way through to mid-late afternoon. August is very hot, so there's not much point going out until later, I guess.Although it's a very nice hotel, it's got a sort of tacky\/trashy feeling at times. It's built on top of something called Casin-Oh! and the whole Olympic Port area is a bit cheesy - a lot of naff-looking bars and restaurants around and underneath. That said, we did eat at one place - Bestial - which was very nice. Guests at the hotel are a mixture of Europeans (Italians, French, Germans - some topless by the hotel pool, watch out), and the stereotypical well-preserved cruise ship guests waiting to embark or having just disembarked. A lot of tight faces wearing sunglasses to breakfast (indoors as well as outdoors) - you get the picture.
