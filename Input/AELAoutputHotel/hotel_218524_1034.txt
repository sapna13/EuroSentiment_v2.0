{"text":"Loved it (again) a third time! This was our third trip to this resort. We visited in January of 2002 when it was Royal Uvero Alto, then again in September of 2005 when it was Secrets. As an Excellence property it has gotten even better. The service is what stands out most. We stayed in the Excellence Club, which for us was worth the extra $$ as it was our anniversary trip. The personalized service we received was amazing! Roberto was our representative there who greeted us by name whenever we saw him. You have available a nice buffet with hot and cold foods throughout the day, if you, like my husband and I, don't have big appetites. We received a call every day asking if we needed anything and how was our stay. We were able to make our spa appointments and other arrangements at the Excellence Club instead of the main concierge. You also have access to the Excellence Club private beach with plenty of chairs and palapas. As far as the rest of the property, the service, entertainment and restaurants are all well above average. The beach is one of the nicest we have experienced. There is a constant breeze which helps to keep you cool when temps are in the mid 90's. Other travelers to the Punta Cana area were complaining that the beach at their property was seaweed covered and no breeze at other resorts, so just another reason the longer bus ride out to Excellence is worth it.Luciano and Daniel in entertainment are awesome! Altagracia is one of the nicest and kindest of the servers. Sara at the X Bar sang Happy Birthday to me in spanish, it was so sweet. Be sure to visit Luis in the sports bar for the coldest beer on the property and lots of laughs! There was a nice mix of 20, 30, and 40 something's celebrating honeymoon's, anniversaries, and weddings. We also met some solo travelers and some groups of singles. Plenty to do, or not to do, right on site. We have already started planning our 4th trip back for the winter holiday!!!
