{"text":"Ritz Carlton San Juan Booooooooo!!!1 Let Me start off by stating , my wife and myself frequent the Ritz Carlton Properties as often as we can. We had a horrible experience at the R C San Juan.. This was the second week of our Honeymoon (the first week we stayed at the R C Grand Cayman Islands which I can not brag enough about) and then we were brought to this horrible excuse for a Ritz. Lets start off by our check in that was very nice, we received 2 glasses of champagne as a initial congratulations. We then were brought to our room , which we noticed the Bathroom toilet was leaking and not flushing correctly. I called maintenance around 5 times during the first 2 days there and it was never fixed. Our first dining experience was not so good at the steak restaurant and then we were told √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≤ext time you come back we will take care of you√à√\u2020\u2022? now why would I come back after this experience? The pool was nice if you could dodge all the dirty cups that were floating around and if you wanted to physically fight with people about the limited rafts.. Oh yes and who could forget the MINI BAR Filler who would walk into our room religiously every morning even when we asked him to wait a minute √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬Æere on our Honeymoon√à√\u2020\u2022? The lobby bar was a great time we spent a lot of time there and our bartender was great. Oh and who could forget the couples massage we both got, yes that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ right the masseuses were about as talented as my bulldog with less manners, my masseuse literally sat on the table the whole time and burped not once but twice. My wife√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ masseuse was equally as untalented. This was the most horrific experience we could of ever had unfortunately it had to be on our Honeymoon with a hefty Price Tag. Oh yes don not let me leave out the fact we contacted the concierge√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ as well as the RC San Juan Management and nothing was done about any of these wonderful memories we have of our Honeymoon..
