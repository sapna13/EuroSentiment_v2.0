{"text":"Perfect location The Marriott Waterfront is a perfect location. We stayed in a waterfront room on the fifth floor. There is a lot of noise from interior doors slamming and you can hear people talking\/yelling in the hallways. At one point we heard hotel security knock next door and ask them to quiet down. The bed was VERY comfy with great linens. Turndown service is provided upon request only. We requested turndown before going out to dinner and when we returned, over 2 and a half hours later, it had not been done. We called at your service and someone came, dumped a load of towels on the counter and refilled the TP. No turndown of the bed, empty wastepaper baskets, etc. We stopped at the front desk on our way to the lobby bar to ask if that was the Marriott standard turndown,which the reply was No. They asked if they could return to the room to complete the service, which they did. We ordered room service the first night there. We placed our tray outside and called at your service to tell them they could come and pick it up (this was after 11:00pm). At 9:30am the next morning when we left our room, it was still outside (along with other trays in the hallways). We booked a package that included breakfast at the restaurant. The second morning our food arrived over one half hour after we ordered and it was lukewarm, even more on the cool side. I could understand if the restaurant was busy or had a limited staff, neither of those were a problem. Valet parking does cost. However, they don't mind if you come and go, and were happy to go get your car for you. The Marriott is in a perfect location for walking or driving. ","annotations":[]}
