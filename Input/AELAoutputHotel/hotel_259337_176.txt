{"text":"loved the resort this review is long overdue but here goes, i took my gf of 2 years here jan 23-jan 31. It was amazing, the resort is the nicest i have ever seen. The beach is impressive crystal blue water and white sand. The staff was friendly but only if u smile or say hi first, i think this is because of a lot of the rude europeans that frequent the resort. I saw a german \/spanish man almost push another maN over trying to get a better seat on the train! Finding a chair was a nightmare, so one day we were so annoyed we just started throwing the towels off the chairs and taking them-it clearly says in the rules of the resort- no saving sunbeds!! The food was good, entertainment was ok, it WAS in spanish mostly so i couldnt understand it. The resort is huge- there is everything u need just on the resort, all ur souvenirs and rum cigars etc etc. There is some very good tours available i reccomend the VIP soana island and the bavaro runners. The resort is quite far from any local towns or anything so you will have to calla taxi if u are wanting to see some real domincian lifestyle. I tthink next vacation i will choose mexico where the tourists arent as rude and all speak english. all in all Rooms were great they were large and comfy the resort was amazing and clean, staff was good, other tourists were quite rude. if u have any questions email me ok..
