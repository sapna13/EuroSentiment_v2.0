{"text":"Beware Paradise... My Fiance  I traveled to Punta Cana on April 12, 2006 to plan our destination wedding and stayed in the Riu Naiboa. It was a complete nightmare, the elevators were broken, it was crowded, the rooms smelled like dampness and the smell remained on your clothes afterwards; it was Horrible. So we decided to go back and look on 7\/15-7\/22, we dicided to stay in the Paradisus. Oh my god, as soon as you arrive you can feel the diference. The lobby is spacious and clean, and the fish ponds and gentle music playing make the whole ambience so serene. There are beautiful gardens and rare birds and plants. There's a shuttle that takes you from the lobby where the casino, the mexican restaurant, the japanese restaurant and the theater are located to the villas, they come often, but we chose to walk to enjoy nature. The staff is very pleasant and are willing to bend over backward to please. We tipped when we could, they work extremely long hours and don't get paid very much. The rooms are spacious, and clean...no musty smell. there's a balcony in every room, and there's couches a coffee maker and a fridge with soda and water, constantly stocked. There's room service. GREAT food. You have to make reservations in two of the 9 restaurants ( Romantico, and Sahara). We ate in eveyone of them except the chinese restaurant. The beach is wonderful, and beautiful. The water is not quite serene but it is wonderful. The pool is amazing too, i did the aqua aerobics each day at 12 and it was a blast! lots of fun.**HINT** when you do aerobics, if the instructor asks you what is his name, just say Jose, and You'll win a souvenier. Overall this hotel has something for everyone, beach parties for the young and shows for the older crowd, and cartoons and a mini zoo for kids. I loved it! So much so that i'll be getting married in this hotel next year!
