{"text":"The Real deal with Waikiki Parc Here's the Real Deal on Waikiki Parc - Let's get straight to the Point - service is Lousy , asking for help from the Front Desk is totally useless! We asked for simple things like 'how to take the Bus'  they said that they only have one Bus route map for the Hotel  cannot give it to us. Fine! They didn't even show it to us  made a few useless scribble on our map. We asked about other things such as are there 'good casual smaller restaurants without being too much of a Party atmosphere ?  they couldn't come up with one -  Yes they send us to Roy's (Hawaiian Fusion Fine Dine) told us it's casual  no snooty people -------- really, HELLOOOOO???!!! Over all the Front Desk Clerks didn't seem to really care , just casual answers of confusions. They are so clued out on service, I'll give it 1.5 STARS! Great that they turned this Hotel into 'Sort of a Boutique Hotel' but PLEASE up grade the SERVICE too! We're surprised 'Nobu Restaurant opened up in this Hotel.' Never ate there  wonder what their service is like??? mmmmmmm????The Expedia Center across from the Front Desk was Helpful with organizing the Tours  it ended there. They pointed out the Tours that were available but never gave good\/interesting suggestions. You point - They book'em!The room we had was fine 'Deluxe Ocean View' , for what it is we fine it a bit expensive even when we were put on the 23rd (Top) Floor. The Ocean view is fine, looking out between 2 buildings.Room was a bit small  the Show Head had very little force, very weak.We had a Great Time on our Trip to Honolulu , we just wish The Hotel's Front Desk Concierges care more about the Customers. We felt a bit ripped off. ","annotations":[]}
