{"text":"Put on your walking shoes and don't forget your flip flops for the bathroom This Adam's Mark is not up to the standard that other hotels are willing to be at. The conceriege gave us bad information on three different occasions. I booked a non-smoking room. That is what the sign on the door said it was. The blanket reeked of smoke. One of the bed springs was poking through so I put a pillow over it. Don't expect any HOT water after 9am until the next morning. You will not get any. It is almost like they turn off the water heaters during the day to save energy. The distance from our conference room to lunch was a solid 2 city blocks. The selection of lunch places is fantastic over at the Westin. Just be prepared to take the tram to the West End for a dinner or be willing to pay big bucks at the hotel. Where else do you pay $6.50 for an imported beer. We tried to go to the Charappel Steak House but you had to have reservations at least a day in advance. The distance from my hotel room to the conference location was one city block. They charge $10 a day additional for wireless. And, it does not have enough strength to stay online to complete business transactions. They have a business center at $5 for 15 minutes of computer time. No complimentary breakfast. Be prepared to walk the two blocks over to the nice mini-mall lunch area at the Westin. Don't forget that you have to pay $20 additional a day for the parking. Definitely, go to DART.org to look at the bus and train schedules to get to and from the airport. The SUPER SHUTTLE kept going round and round the airport finding more customers until the van was full. It took over 2 hours to get from the airport to the hotel. Coming back to the airport, we were packed like sardines in a can with a full van.
