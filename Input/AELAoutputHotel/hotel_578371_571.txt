{"text":"Resort was beautiful but thats where it ends We just returned from a 5 day stay at the Majestic, glad it wasn't our usual 7 day stay I was ready to come home by the 4th night.The property itself is gorgeus and the staff very friendly the rooms clean (but the bed horrific, asked for a mattress topper but it never appeared) and the water and pool beautiful. It was my first time at an ai and that may sway me to never try one again.I should always follow my motto of you get what you pay for. The house wines were awful and I never tasted such a horrible margarita in my life. I can't beleive people actually thought the food was edible. Breakfast was the best and safest meal but that only goes so far. If we were not there with a great group of people (very large group) we definitely would not have enjoyed the time there as much as we did. I did not get sick but did not eat salad and brushed my teeth with bottled water and took pepto 3 days before and the whole time there. Sadly friends that were leaving with us had to take their teenager to the hospital and did not return till 3 days later. And majestic colonial had no rooms available and made no effort to help them so they slept at the hospital for 2 nights. My husband survived the time there but has been sick since he has been home. Too much of a crap shoot for me to ever go back.
