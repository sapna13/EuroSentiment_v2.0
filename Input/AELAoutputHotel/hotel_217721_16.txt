{"text":"Outstanding! What Every Hotel Should Aspire To! The Hilton Dallas Park Cities is in my opinion the best hotel in Dallas. I have stayed there several times in the past year and plan on staying there exclusively for all of my upcoming trips to Dallas. Firstly, the location is a bit off the beaten path from downtown and the stores and restaurants in the area close in the evening but that is one of the reasons I enjoy this property. It is located in a quite, very nice area of Park Cities just off of the Dallas North Tollway. Unfortunately, this location only has valet parking available but it is not too unreasonable at $18.00 a day - and very convenient as you literally exit your vehicle at the front door of the hotel.What I love most about this hotel is its attention to detail. Upon entering the lobby you feel as if you are in a luxury, boutique hotel. Everything is immaculate, the decor is classy and the hotel staff is extremely efficient, personable and helpful. The rooms are very elegant with high ceilings - at least on the 10th Floor. I have requested the 10th floor ever since because of the extraordinary high ceilings. The decor is very elegant and the room is very inviting. Again, attention to detail is great at this location. Each time I have arrived at this property I have found my bed turned down with chocolates on the pillows, ice in my bucket, with complimentary bottled water awaiting. And, as an even nicer touch, the staff has the clock radio on some kind of smooth jazz station - making your arrival heavenly! The rooms are extremely clean and the bathrooms are great. Very elegant tile floors and a very nice marble sink top grace the bathroom. I must say that the showers are a bit smallish but that is just nitpicking. The bathrooms are also very clean and immaculate. The price is also very reasonable. I believe I have paid from $179 to $249 a night for my stays here. The hotel staff should be commended for keeping up such a great location. I have paid upwards of $600 a night for rooms at places that were nowhere near as good as the Hilton Park Cities. Overall, I recommend the Hilton Park Cities without hesitation. It is classy, clean, elegant, and their attention to detail is outstanding. I easily give this location 5******************Do yourself a favor and try it when you are in Dallas. It is far superior to any other hotel in the area!
