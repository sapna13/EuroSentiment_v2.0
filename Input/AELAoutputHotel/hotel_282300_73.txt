{"text":"A Dissapointing Experience Based on the reviews here, my husband and I booked this hotel for a week. Our first impressions of the hotel were that it was lovely, but in a rather remote area of town. We were fine with that, and were excited to be near the harbor and beach. Our impressions of the hotel were immediately lowered when we spoke with the reception staff. Very rude, no hello or welcoming glass of cava, just √Å√ò√¨do you have a reservation?. They certainly were not child-friendly. They honestly looked horrified that my two year old son was with us. They scowled at him every time we walked through the lobby. √Å√ò√¨The first night we were there we asked if there was a quick restaurant in the area that served simple, child-friendly food. Our son was tired and hungry and we just wanted to crash. Reception suggested that we eat in the hotel restaurant, but we wanted something a bit faster and less fancy. Reception was able to name two 4 star restaurants within a 15 minute walk, but the only simple restaurant that they could name was a 20 minute cab ride. We chose a direction, and began to walk, and within 5 miutes were able to find a perfecty fine place that served pizza. My son was happy.The room was fine, nothing special, although after a week in Paris it seemed especially spacious. There were some small things wrong, like loose bathroom fixtures and a slightly leaking sink, but we never called maintenance.The rooftop pool was nice (no kids, which I understand) and would have been nice to use at night, swimming in view of the Barcelona lights, but it closes at 6.Overall, this hotel seems uneven. Sitting in the lobby, I saw other couples check in that recieved very warm welcomes from the manager and several glasses of complimentary cava. Maybe they were as cold as they were because of the child? They really should take a cue from many other 4 and 5 star hotels, who will at least pretend to be welcoming to children. Overall, definately not worth the $180 a night we paid. There are seveal otther hotels in Barcelona, that are similar in quality that run no more than 100 euros a night.
