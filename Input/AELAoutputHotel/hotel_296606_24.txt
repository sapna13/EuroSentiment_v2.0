{"text":"Great Location!!!! Nice hotel for the price. A friend and I went to Europe for 2 weeks in July 2007. Our first stop was Amsterdam and we stayed at the HOTEL LUXOR. It looks a little seedy but we felt safe. We knew this hotel was a 3 star so our expectations were average.CHECK INCheck in time was noon but we arrived very early in the morning as we took the red eye from toronto. Our room wasn't ready yet so we were told to wait. The front desk\/ bar told us they would watch our bags if we wanted to walk around the streets to familarize ourselves with the city. We returned around 11am and our room was ready for us.The hotel looks a little seedy but it was great. You had to get buzzed in so we felt added security made it less seedyROOMRoom was a nice size. Two Twin beds, a desk and chair and a large washroom. The shower didn't have a shower curtain so it confused us as at first..The room had A\/C which was great if it was warmer. With added blankets it was perfect.HOTEL LOCATION.2 minutes from the train station.in the heart of the red light2 minutes from Damn street15-20 min walk to the bar\/club area. Or you could take the bus or cab. We chose to walk everywhere.5 minutes from shopping areas10 minutes from Anne Franks House.Many amazing restaurants right on the street. Go to the Mexican restaurant. Yummy fajitas and salsa. Other amazing shops and sites to see. Conclusion.Great place to stay. Great location. Glad we stayed in the heart of the red light. Not as seedy as I thought it was going to be. I would go back.Hope this helps ","annotations":[{"endOffset":23,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":19},{"endOffset":755,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":751},{"endOffset":1327,"mention":"fajitas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fajita"],"startOffset":1320}]}
