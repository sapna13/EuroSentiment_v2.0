{"text":"Great hotel, fantastic service My partner and I stayed at the Hotel Axel in July 2006 for almost two weeks and had a really wonderful stay. First, the staff was, across the board, all excellent. From the patient front desk staff who all spoke English and had excellent knowledge of the city, to the wait staff that was super friendly to the housekeeping staff that kept our room in perfect shape for the entire stay. We had a third floor room on the street. We never had a problem with noise either from the street or from the hotel itself. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ quiet enough to get a great night√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ sleep and the optional black-out shade was a bonus for when we stayed out late and wanted some extra shut-eye.We also loved the rooftop deck. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a great place for hanging out and enjoying the sun and the plentiful eye candy. Yes, the pool is super tiny and not deep at all. But, it was still nice to jump in and cool off when laying out. The Jacuzzi is clean and nice, as are the steam room and sauna. Again, the service in the Sky Bar is excellent and the drinks yummy. The free Internet was really helpful and the free bottled water saved lots of money. Finally, the location of the hotel is great. It's 2 short blocks to the Universitat Metro station (with a good Starbuck's on the way). It's also just 5 blocks to Passeig de Gracia and restaurant \/ shopping paradise. It's right in the middle of the gay neighborhood so you don't have to go far for gay bars, clubs and restaurants. We loved the Axel and recommend it highly.
