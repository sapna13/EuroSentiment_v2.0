{"text":"Great Hotel and great location in Tokyo Just returned from 6 day family vacation to Tokyo and had a marvelous stay at the Park Hotel. Arranged my stay via Hotel Website after reading accolades from Tripadvisor, very easy to use.Hotel is easily served by Airport Limo Bus Service from Narita Airport. Service is extremely attentive from the greeting at entrance to check in. English is not an issue. In fact, Tokyo is a lot easier to get around now with English translations in buildings, restaurants and subways.Hotel itself is very modern, airy and serene at the top of a 38 story building in Tokyo Shiodome, which is a series of modern skyscrapers serviced by subway and trains below street level and connected via pedestrian walkways on the third floor. Very quiet despite the activity down below. Didn't use the trains, but found the subway connected to the Ginza and Asakusa Lines, which will hit just about every tourist site in the Tokyo area. There is also a monorail that will take you to the seaside development of Odaiba. Hotel is ten minutes from the Wholesale Fish Market by foot--this a Tokyo must see, if you get up early.With my family of 5, got a twin and a triple. Rooms generous in size for Tokyo, bathrooms and amenities were very good. Restaurant services a very good breakfast buffet which our family enjoyed before hitting the streets. Did not eat any other meals in hotel--seemed pricey, but the building is connected to other Shiodome buildings--Carretta and City\/Pedi Shiodome had a number of inexpensive and good restaurants offering a variety of Japanese and non-Japanese foods. There is a Family Mart in the basement level of Park Hotel building for snacks. While we were staying in the hotel, there was a free jazz concert every nite in the lobby.Service was excellent. The concierge services were very helpful and helped me to work with a tour agency that had lost our reservation for a tour to the Ghibili Museum on the outskirts of Tokyo. Fortunately, the concierge was able to clear up the problem and we got to go on our tour.Can not think of anything negative to say about the hotel, definitely worth the price, would definitely go back and would definitely recommend it to my friends. Thanks to all fellow Tripadvisor reviewers for the high rating this hotel gets and deserves!
