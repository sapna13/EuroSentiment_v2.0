{"text":"Be Careful! This place is really different - and a mixed bag. No stupid rip-offs with the mini-bar, lots of terrific extras - all 'free' and a really great location. BUT, the breakfast was about as poor a standard as could be imagined, eg scrambled eggs made by reheating already-made stuff resembling yellow rubber, poor selection etc. This is not what hotel dining rooms should offer. The safe was broken, the phone didn't work, and they would only move us to a different room at OUR expense. The free WiFii turned out to last 50 minutes and in one room didn't work at all. Hmmm.The worst part was that our foursome booked for 2 days and were forced to leave after one due to genuine and serious circumstances beyond our control. We asked (at breakfast time) if they would let us off the second night's charge. The (young) guy at the desk was very tough and said he would 'ask his manager', later saying he did so and was told 'no'. I said I expected a more lenient attitude under the circumstances and wanted to speak to the manager myself and he immediately said 'OK, we will let you off one room but not both. We can't lose money because of your problems.' I later discovered that they managed to fill the entire hotel that night but still pocketed the room charge they demanded from us.I know we had booked for 2 nights and technically, they may be said to be in the right, but I doubt the manager was even consulted and whereas the small things are what could make this hotel so attractive, knowing they employ transparently poor actors like him and are happy to 'fine' us a (not inexpensive) room rate they ANYWAY sold to somebody else, makes me reluctant to set foot there again or recommend them. You need to feel comfortable in a hotel, but they run it so poorly it spoiled the whole experience. ","annotations":[]}
