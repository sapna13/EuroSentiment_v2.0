{"text":"A respite in Florence My wife and I had just flown into Rome to find out our bags did not land with us. We were moving fast and hard through Italy in the early days of this trip so the less than reassuring, Ehh, we'll find you at some point and deliver the bags in the next 3-5 days, from Alitalia a game killer. This threw our initial logistics into disarray; the comfortable train rides into Florence from Rome became let's wait for our bags to arrive 3 hours later, miss our trains and switch our reservations with Hertz to get the car now and drive to Florence instead. I had never driven in Italy much less the autostrada at night, fortunately I'm from Boston so it was easy. We arrived in Florence well after midnight and got to the Hotel Colomba where we were greeted by a very kind gentleman who helped us to our room and explained the room and hotel amenities. Additionally he took the time to explain our location relative to Florence's many attractions. The hotel was clean, the room was large and the staff incredibly helpful. We were only in Florence for the night but we had a great night's sleep and a delicious breakfast before we pushed off. I left behind one of my favorite shirts and did not realize it until the end of the trip. I called the hotel and spoke with the owner who graciously offered to mail the shirt to me. Not only did she mail it she sent it priority entirely at her expense. That is the kind of above and beyond customer service that I place great value on as a consumer. The Colomba Hotel is a superior value and offers amazing customer service. Highly recommended.
