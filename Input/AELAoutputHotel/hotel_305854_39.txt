{"text":"not the best in this category Harbour Plaza Metropolis is quite well located in Hong Hom at walking distance from TST. Some rooms have great views on the harbour and the fantastic buildings of Central and Causeway Bay but the hotel is, in general, not really good. If the lobby is clear and huge and gives a good opinion about the hotel, the rooms are not very large and the bathroom is terribly small just with a shower. We booked for a Superior One Bedroom Suite but we arrived at the hotel early in the morning and i think the hotel staff told us this category wasn't available for an early check in just to sell a higher category. Consequently and even if i'm pretty sure a Superior One Bedroom Suite was available, i've accepted to buy an upgrade because we were too tired to wait 5 hours. It costs 70 euros per night to be allocated in a Grand Deluxe Harbour view Suite... It's one of the best category in this hotel and that's true, the view is good but there is nothing special in more except the huge space for the living room. Consequently, the atmosphere in the suite was too cold and it wasn't really clean (dirty sofa, chair covers...). The soundproofing is not excellent and the curtains are not well fixed and you'll be wake up at the first morning light... it's not very comfortable...About the staff, some are really smily and nice, some other ones are not good at all but it's OK. The buffet breakfast is interesting with a large selection of european and asian delights but the decoration of the restaurant is simply ugly...In conclusion, i think this hotel is very affordable but there are other hotels much better in this category...
