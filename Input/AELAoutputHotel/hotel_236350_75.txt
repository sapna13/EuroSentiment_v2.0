{"text":"Can businesstravelers trust Sofitel St James London?! I booked my stay at St James Sofitel London 1,5 month prior befor arriving. I choose a comfortable delux or something room and booked on the Sofitel site self. All went well and i got my confirmations. A need to know: I also have a priority guest Sofitel card. All set and done i thought.The booking resitriction were clear for me..... but were NOT for Sofitel apparently. A few hours befor arrival, i got this telephone from booking. If i was planning to come by myself or with 2 persons? I answered that i was traveling alone. we cannot offer you the room that you booked because many people want to sleep at our hotel this weekdend and we will put you in a small one single bed bedroom. You can take one drink from the minibar as complementary drink - do you accept this offer? And sorry Sir but you have no other option.I was stunned. And angry. And argued. I made my reservation, seccured by creditcard and as a preferred guest. And for that moment it was not possible anymore to get another room elsewhere. Angry because I cannot trust Sofitel!! St James did choose for the money, as they could book my room to a couple and push me into a prison room of 4m2 or something with the most tiny single bed i ever saw in my life (maybe 1m80 x 90cm). They disregarded our agreement!I really looked forward on my stay at this hotel, but feel betrayed by Sofitel. How can they do this to preffered guest cardholders - i still cannot figure this out.Overall experience: i was not happy at all here because of how they treated me. It felt as if i was a B-guest instead of a preferred guest. I will use the Sofitel hotels worldwide, but not the St James anymore. Because i serieously doubt. A SPECIAL WARNING TO ALL BUSINESSTRAVELERS AL ONE: CAN WE TRUST SOFITEL ST. JAMES??? beware of this hotel, because if they wish, they they change agreements by the snap of a finger.
