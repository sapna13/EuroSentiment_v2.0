{"text":"worst hotel ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Our stay in this hotel was ruined when I went to get into bed and as I pulled the covers back I was hit with the stench of urine. A previous occupant had wet the bed and the cleaning staff ignored it completely. This was at 9pm and my 18mos old son was fast asleep and we were faced with moving rooms. This is only the beginning...the front desk clerk fou an hour to find us another room and had us move all of our stuuf across the parking lot to another section of the hotel. They refused to refund our money and offered us a free continental breakfast instead. The next morning I realized I had left a few of my sons things in our first room and asked the front desk to retrieve them. After waiting over an hour to hear from them I went to the front desk where I was told that the cleaning people had not found anything in our first room. I then asked if I could look myself which the woman agreed to. When walked into the room there was a pile of our things in the middle of the non-urine soaked mattress. THe woman did not apologize and when I asked her for the General Manager she only said that they were not here and she could not do anything for us. THis was the WORST hotel I have ever stayed at with absolutely NO customer service to speak of. ","annotations":[]}
