{"text":"Nice hotel, good value  We stayed for two nights between Christmas and New Year in one of the Comfort level double bed rooms. On arrival the staff were friendly and throughout our stay they were always helpful. The room itself was clean, a decent size, by Parisienne standards, and looked like it had recently been refreshed\/decorated. The facilities inside the room were good including a mini-bar service, flat screen T.V. and modern\/new shower unit. The only things worthy of critical comment are pretty minimal, however so that others are aware: if you stay in rooms at the end of a corridor you need to know where the light switch is, to illuminate the area in front of your door, otherwise it can be quite difficult to see the handle and unlock the door. Once you've found the light ouside the door for the first time it's no problem from then on. There are some areas with suspended panels for the celing and when you open\/close a door the pressure can sometimes cause these to move and they can startle you a little. Finally, like many older buildings you can hear most every noise in the rooms around you. This is just the way things are in older built apartments  hotels and simply cannot be avoided. So, minor criticisms aside, overall we liked this hotel, it has a good location and is near the Metro and Rue Cler market\/cafe areas, where there are several excellent little bistro's and retaurants. We would happily stay again.
