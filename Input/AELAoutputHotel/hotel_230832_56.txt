{"text":"Perfect Business\/Vacation Hotel Great hotel in a cracking location. The staff were very business like and efficient. The houskeeping of the room was faultless. Free copies of the The International Herald and the Financial Times are to be found in reception. The Breakfast wasnt worth the money (what hotel breakfasts are) although the pastries and the coffee were lovely. It is first and foremost a business hotel and has all the trappings a business traveller needs - WiFi, minibar and laundry service. That so, the recomendations for the beach were spot on. We liked the 24 hour security guard in reception, when getting in at 3 in the morning its a welcome sight rather than being intimidating. Our safe wasnt working and they had a maintainance chap in to replace it in under an hour. The rooms have a small hallway allowing for two sets of doors to the room resuling in no corridor noise and more privacy. The windows open rather than being sealed shut, so even though the aircon was excellent you could get a bit of fresh air in the room too.As a side we found a lovely little 'rustic' bar - Babia. Its mostly locals but they have a few tourists who stumble over it The food is lovely - we went every night!. Directions - Left out the hotel. Then right, straight over the cross roads and up the ally way at the left hand side of the bar (called Living - the car park is full of motorbikes.) When coming out of the ally way turn left at the corner and its midway down the road. Say hello to Rollo from Paul n Julie!
