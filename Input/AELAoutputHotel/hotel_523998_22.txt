{"text":"No bad for the rate We stayed here for 6 nights and we were happy with the hotel. The rooms are worn down and the beds are hard ,but all beds in China are hard. The front desk staff were helpful as well as the bellman, but you need to know a little Mandarin to get the best use from them. Our room was a corner room with two double beds. There was a seating area and ample closet space. The rooms were adequately cleaned each day and the hotel supplies a kettle, which helps becuase you can boil your own water. They charged for the internet at the business center 30 RMB for half an hour- we opted for a much cheaper intnernet cafe in the neighouhood. Bring your passports.The hotel is conveniently located next to New World Centre and is within walking distance of the Subway. Across the street is an indoor market called Origus. We bought many of our meals here - cheap and good. Just point at what you want and hand them money. NOr more than 10 RMB for a good meal. The other markets for tourists we found were twice as much. Overall, the hotel is older and not so clean. Don't expect North American standards. Service was friendly and elevators are slow. The workout facility is very modern as it is owned by a private residence next door. We booked three to a room and expected to pay and extra $40 USD for the third person, but were never charged - bonus!
