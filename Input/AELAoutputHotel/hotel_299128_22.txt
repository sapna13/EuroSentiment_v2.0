{"text":"Loved the experience We stayed at the InterContinental in July 2008. We chose to stay in a Club Singaraja room. The benefit of this was a slightly larger room, but this wing also had a 24 hr concierge plus basic drinks and snacks available 24 hr a day. The main benefit of this was a free lunch, with scones\/danishes\/snacks plus fruit juice, water and tea and coffee facilities. The room itself was clean, spacious, with a lovely balcony view of one of the pools with the ocean in the distance. This is one BIG hotel.We tried a few of the in house restaurants. The Japanese restaurant was very slow in service for both drinks and food. We booked at one of the Teppinyaki grills for 7.30, but didn't get to eat until 8.50. I ordered an appitiser off the menu, to be presented with it from the kitchen, not the Teppinyaski grill! For a business lunch I would have walked out, however as we were on holiday I just had another beer and waited...The Italian restaurant was lovely, we dined on the verandah with a lovely seabreeze.Beachside dining was fine, but not top shelf. Happy hour was greeting enthusiastically most days whilst watching the sunset.Local eateries are only a few minutes walk down the beach should you not wish to dine at the resort.The resort itself swalllows a lot of guests, it was 100% full when we were there, but you could still source a sunlounge with prior planning (i.e. dump your books\/sunscreen on one on the way to breakfast)All pools are superb, with good poolside dining and drink service. There is also a swim up bar. There was a variety of guests, from young couples to families and mature couples. I never felt like it was too noisy or busy for me to relax. Kuta is only a few bucks away in an airconditioned meter taxi when the shopping bug bites.Breakfast was excellent, better than the Laguna in Nusa Dua that we later stayed at.You could do a lot worse than stay here. I enjoyed the experience immensely.
