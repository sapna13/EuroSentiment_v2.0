{"text":"An extremely comfortable stay! My wife and I stayed at the Intercontinental for 3 days. The service and facilities are impeccable. Our harbour view room was clean, spacious and decked out with contemporary Asian furnishings and decor.The newly renovated pool area is fabulous and we could have spent all day there. Three spa baths adjacent to the octagonal pool are maintained at various different temperatures, 18, 30 and 40 degrees. Frolicking in the various bathing areas was a refreshing break from the Hong Kong humidity and air pollution. The hotel is actually under the main departing flight path, but watching the various jets flying overhead in the late evening while lying on a pool lounge was strangely relaxing.The real highlight for me was the buffet breakfast in the morning. I've experienced a lot of 5 star hotel buffets, but this was probably the best I've tried. So much variety that even the fussiest palate is sure to be satisfied. The Intercontinental also has one of the most expensive mini-bars I've encountered and we made regular trips to the 7-11 across the road to get our drink and alcohol fixes. Actually there is a VERY nice supermarket on the fourth (4th) floor of the adjacent 'New World Center' shopping mall. Highly recommended unless you want to pay $10 for a can of coke. On the positive side, plenty of distilled water is provided by the hotel. My wife reports that the Swedish massage in the I-Spa is very nice and decent value also. We would definitely come here again.
