{"text":"Wedding \/ Honeymoon \/ A MUST READ Well I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know where start with this, so her it goes.We planned our special day (wedding) that the Palma Real for 20 people. We coordinated this with there Romance department for one of there best wedding packages available. After receiving numerous email confirmations, speaking to their head representatives via phone (no 800 number, we got billed for these calls) confirming our reservations and wedding details we proceeded with our travels. We paid for all of our guests to spend 1 week at the resort. As you can imaging this was and expensive wedding for us to say the least, but for our special day money was no object.So, we all flew in, reservations were a mess, we stayed in the hotel lobby for a few hours before us and our guests were brought to out rooms, even after received confirmation letters a few days prior, but I guess that meant nothing. After that experience we again arranged a few meetings with the director of the romance department to ensure that the wedding went over well. Well, to our surprise, it did not at all. Our wedding day was and embarrassment, nothing was coordinated, at the last minute (during our wedding) were informed of changes to the wedding, changes in locations, food, planning, etc√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√°nd were also shortchange things we paid for. We did express our disappointments to the Wedding director during the wedding and she during our special day gave us one excuse after another. So, we made the best of it and continued on knowing that this day could not be repeated, taking it on the chin and tried to have a good time.But wait it gets better, 4\/6 hours after we conclude our wedding one of our mothers was extremely sick. It started with excessive stomach pains then quickly moved to excessive Vomiting, Diarrhea and nausea. We rushed to her room at 4am to find out there is NO Medicate Doctors were on site during off hours, so we rushed her to the DR hospital. After being up for almost 24hrs straight, the doctor in the DR most respected hospital came to concluded that our Mom had a stomach infection caused by bacteria \/ parasites in the food or water. She stood in the hospital for 1 week. Also, I have you note that all of the medical costs were out of pocket for us, as out of country insurance is not respected in DR. OK, so after spending about $35,000 on our wedding and trip to DR, were now facing and additional $15,000 medical cost due to food poisoning to one of our Moms from our wedding dinner, HOW EMBARSING!!!!So, we spoke to the Palma Real Management team and they actually had the nerve to bring in there doctor (who is employed by the resort) to rebut the illness. As I write this on our so called honeymoon, we are still awaiting to see what the resort will do for us, if anything at all. It has already been conveyed that we will have to bear all of the medicate costs.So, after reading the other reviews, I agree, the Resort is nice but the service (in all respects) is a joke. Stay Away from this resort, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be a victim like us. ","annotations":[]}
