{"text":"Great Value on Union Square Stayed for 4 nights in two rooms over Christmas. Worked out really well for us. The bed was super comfy. The shower had plenty of hot water. The room was quiet for us. The room isn't large but has a couple of chairs and a desk. Free wireless internet too. San Francisco is one of those cities were if you are spending lots of time in your room, you just ain't doing the city right.Our 3rd floor room faced Powell street which is where the cable car runs and they start at 6:30am. This didn't bother us but we also don't sleep late. I'm guessing if you are a light sleeper who wants to sleep in you should ask for a room either higher up or not facing Powell. BTW, our 19 year old teenagers had no problem sleeping late! (Based on my other reviews I seem to be a little more sensitive to noise than others.)The front desk was very helpful in recommending places to eat.Only complaint (and the GM seems to read these comments) -- more chocolate chip cookies and fewer cinnamon raisin! Wow, that should be the complaint about all hotels right?We rented a car for a few days to go north along the coast. We self-parked which is no big hassle -- just around the block.We really liked the hotel's restaurant for breakfast. We ate there two days and service was fast and friendly. My coffee was refilled so quickly one day that I lost track of how much I drank and spent the day wired! The Sears Fine Food place next door gets lots of hype and a line of people standing out in the COLD for maybe 30 minutes to get in. It was good but not that good. The french toast at Sears is in my opinion better but the eggs were better at the hotel.We took BART from the airport and walked up Powell to the hotel. That was exactly 1 hour from the domestic terminal to the hotel's door.
