{"text":"Location, value, comfort and service! Excellent hotel. We have just returned from a 10 day family trip to gorgeous Singapore. (Plese see review for first four days at Raffles The Plaza and a Trip Report is still to come). The last two nights of our trip were spent at Royal Plaza on Scotts (RPS), July 11 and July 12.The excellent customer service began before we even left Australia when, after directly booking their best price for two Premiere rooms (1 X King and 1 X Twin, connecting) on the website, we received both confirmation and welcome emails. Then, within a couple of hours, I happened to stumble upon a significantly cheaper rate on another website (all others I'd seen previously had been more expensive than RPS own website offer) and contacted the hotel asking for their policy on Best Rate Guarantee. Whilst the cheaper price did not fully qualify (as it was not instantly confirmed) the hotel came back to me the next business day and said they would match the rate - this actually saved me about AU$300 as we had booked two rooms for two nights so I was very pleased and had a great feeling about the hotel right from the start.I was already aware that RPS was an inner city type of hotel which is what we needed for our two days of shopping. No views, but an excellent location near Orchard MRT and across the road from Far East Plaza and the Grand Hyatt with Tangs and Lucky Plaza just around the corner.The hotel is easy to miss from the outside but it is right next to DFS Galleria which has a large shop front. The lobby is very special and one very quickly leaves the bustling feel of the city behind within a few steps.Michelle checked us in and she was very helpful. Initially though the rate she had us booked at was not the cheaper one confirmed days earlier by email so luckily I had a copy of the email with me which she took to confirm the lower rate. Also our connecting room was not going to be vacant until closer to 10pm (it was 5pm at this stage as we had just arrived via ferry from Bintan - another review on this part of trip will follow). She did her best to see if anything else was available but as the hotel was full this was not possible. So we happily checked into one of our rooms and then went off to explore - upon our return just after 9pm our other room was ready and the rate had been sorted out. Michelle was still on duty and handled the situation very well.The hotel has recently been fully refurbished and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. Quite small (enough room to walk around beds, plus built-in good-sized desk and one arm chair) but we were expecting this so were not disappointed. As we had booked Premiere Rooms we had rooms on the 12th floor and each bathroom had a bath. The rain shower was the best shower I have ever had in my life! It was sensational! Much better than the one at Raffles The Plaza! The beds were comfy and pillows great. The flat screen TV was fantastic. The complimentary mini bar - beer, soft drink and water - was the best thing when you're travelling with two teenagers! Loved it!I never did see the pool so can't comment - although I understand it is more of a lap style. The buffet breakfast in The Carousel was very good but not excellent. Service was a bit erratic and toaster did not work well, but the tea (when it eventually arrived) was hot! I suppose we were spoiled by the breakfast at Raffles The Plaza and for many people The Carousel would seem first class.Our second day at RPS was actually my husband's birthday and at 9pm that evening there was a knock on the door and a tray with a spray of singapore orchids and a truly divine cake from the chocolate shop downstairs was delivered as a gift from the Hotel. It was accompanied by a handwritten birthday card. How special was that!! We organised a late check out on one of the rooms from 12 noon - 4pm @ S$20 per hour as our flight did not leave until the evening. This was easily organised when we checked in.Our check out was efficient and friendly without a hitch. All in all a wonderful choice and I will return there on my next trip to Singapore.
