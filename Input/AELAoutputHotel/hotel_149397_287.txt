{"text":"5-star resort with 1-star clientelle We stayed at the Bavaro Princess May 1-8, 2007 and it was the first all-inc experience I had.The GoodFirst off, I must say that the landscape and gardens of this resort was gorgeous. Lush vegitation, palm trees, parrots and peacocks roaming freely made each walk to the beach like a trip through a tropical forrest. Our hotel room was about a 5-minute walk from the beach, they also have a trolly for the lazy people that drives to the beach every few minutes.The Staff were on the most part very friendly, there were a few guys who were rude but most were exceptionally friendly. The room was okay, not comparable to the 4 or 5-star hotels here in Canada but it's to be expected. The beach was perfect, nicer than any other I've seen. There were always chairs available, however we had to get up there before 8am to grab one under the shade each day. There were 2 restaurants that had terrific food (El Pescador and Sakura), I would be happy eating in either restaurant all week. I highly recommend the grilled lobster.The Not-so-GoodThe buffet restaurant, for whatever reason, never seemed to have even moderately-warm food. While we were never sick, the food at breakfast was never enjoyable (save for the fruit) and always cold, and the nights we had dinner there we found little that interested us, and again most of the food was cold.Also, while no fault of the resort, there were usually long lineups at the bars. Sometimes the bartenders would ignore you to serve those waiving dollar bills, and the beer was very watered down. The place was very busy, the crowd for the most part seemed to be composed of ignorant americans who didn't know how to act in public. For a five-star resort there were lots of annoying frat-boy thug types and obnoxious, rude classless americans who treated staff like garbage.It was also very expensive, the same box of RJ cigars that my gf picked up in Cuba for 25$ was 200$ here. For a 750ml bottle of the local rum it was 25$. Even tacky souveniours were way overpriced, even by Western standards.The final complaint was the mosquitoes. I look like I came back from a camping trip rather than a beach vacation. This was especially annoying at some of the restaurants located near ponds, as the restaurants have no walls the mosquitoes are numerous. In fact, we had to cut a few meals short due to being eaten alive. Bring lots of repellant!Overall, a beautiful resort well worth the money run by energetic and friendly staff. While I would probably not return myself (would rather go to Cuba or Jamaica), I do recommend this place. Many of the things I complained about could have been due to the time of our trip and not necessarily the resort itself.
