{"text":"great place but not much to do we stayed at ocean sands in august this year from the 9-23 having read the reviews on here before we were looking forward to this holiday very much and after having been thought we would write our review from the english perspective ok the airport in punta cana is very easily negotiated both coming and going and despite what everyone says about opening up every single suitcase this doesnt happen you just have to dodge the suitcase guys who are all after a tip to move your cases about 10 foot but a firm no keeps them at bay check in at the hotel again very easy and they give you a cocktail and soft drinks for the kids (we have 3 12 10 and 7)we were allocated villa 9 which is opposite the blue pool but we got a back room over looking a dirt road and coconut trees but wasnt bothered as we didnt spend too much time in there the pools are huge but towards the end of our holiday were going green with mould because the pool guys just cant keep up with the maintainance the blue pool is the quieter pool and the yellow pool is where all the activities go on the blue pool barman victor blows very hot and cold seeming to have a problem giving the english budweiser and baileys but after quite a few complained about this there were no more issues entertainment at night was like a very poor version of butlins entertainment but the guys and girls on stage work very hard and are always happy and love the kids so we went to see the show most nights we ate at the buffet most days and it is very good food we also tried route 66 and that was terible and the mexican excellent mikes coffee shop was not bad but we have had better and the cakes are the same as you get in the buffet the beach is superb white powder sand and despite being the atlantic the sea is warm although a little rough we got up to se the sunrise and that was fantastic we done the trip called kontiki and that was great for the kids its a party boat and they take you snorkling and on a boat slide constant food music and drink great afternoon we were supposed to go on the safari trip but it was cancelled because of hurricane dean overall a great hotel great people and very very cheap if you are going here enjoy your stay and take plenty of high factor sun cream we used 40 and still burnt!!!
