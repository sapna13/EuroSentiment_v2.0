{"text":"Worth every cent This Midtown Manhattan hotel on West 44th St between 5th and 6th Avenues gets high marks from other reviewers (which was why we booked it) and they are not wrong. Location: great. Five mins from Times Square and Broadway, ten mins from Macy's and all that wonderful shopping, Empire State Building, and a cheap cab ride from Central Park. For longer expeditions use the ultra-safe subway at just two dollars a trip. Hotel amenities: no excessive frills (eg no pool but a good gym) and an attractive brasserie with terrace that doubles as breakfast\/bar\/restaurant. Hotel interior very clean and smart with well maintained public areas and plush spotless carpets. Rooms vary in size but all have good bathrooms and extremely comfortable beds - ask for high rooms for the best views (we had views of Empire State and Rockerfeller Centre on 23rd floor - stunning.). Housekeeping first class, with exceptional attention to detail and cleanliness. Breakfasts sumptuous (but make sure you know the deal you are staying on: some deals include breakfast, in which case you are given a voucher to present in the restaurant - this can lead to a muddle if you are a family of four like us two of whom had vouchers and two who did not - this is one area the hotel could do with clarifying for their own waiters' benefit as much as guests'). Desk staff are terrific: friendly, efficient, helpful. We had a welcome complimentary bottle of champagne to mark one of our birthdays, and chocs too - a nice touch. Everyone seems thoroughly trained and the atmosphere is of calm professionalism. Concierge and his team excellent. Most remarkable of all: in your room, high above the horn-honking mayhem of Manhattan, you will hear....nothing. Not the merest whisper of a police siren disturbs your peace. You could be in the middle of the countryside. This is not the cheapest Manhattan hotel but solid value for money, and with the pound going so far in the USA it is even better value. As I said, a hotel does not earn such a consistently high rating without being consistently reliable, so book the Sofitel with confidence.
