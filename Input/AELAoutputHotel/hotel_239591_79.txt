{"text":"Great location, great value We spent an enjoyable 3 nights in Barcelona, staying at the Hotel Principal. It's a lovely hotel, just off La Rambla. Okay, it's probably the wrong side of La Rambla, but we never felt threatened √à√\u2020\u2022?the street leading up to it is busy all day with locals and tourists alike.The room was very clean and had obviously been refurbished quite recently. It was a little on the small side but perfectly adequate considering how much time we actually spent in it. The bed looked a little small at first glance (mind you, we have a king-size at home) but it was actually very comfortable. We were lucky to have a room with a balcony overlooking the street. My parents were also staying at the hotel and their room overlooked an internal courtyard, which meant that it was quite dark, though on the plus side it was probably quieter than ours. We didn't have problems with noise from the neighbouring rooms, but were waken up by people in the corridors returning to their rooms late at night and on one occasion by a rubbish truck beeping loudly outside.The breakfast was quite good √à√\u2020\u2022?there was a large selection, although if we'd been staying longer we probably would have checked out the local eating establishments √à√\u2020\u2022?there were plenty of them.If you want five star luxury, then this is probably not the hotel for you. However, if you want a decent hotel in a great location, then give Hotel Principal a go. Barcelona is a fascinating city and this hotel is a great base from which to explore it! ","annotations":[]}
