{"text":"Great Time! We , Hubby and I, our 2 son's (21  17) had a wonderful vacation. We connected as a family, once again. The Ritz was wonderful!! The staff were beyond our expectaions. We stayed on the Club Level which I am convinced is what made our vacation special...if you can afford the extra dollar, do it. I promise, you WILL feel special, and you connect with new friends from around the world staying there.Yes, you hear the airplanes at the airport taking off, however NOT in your room, we could hear them loud and clear on the beach. It was no bother really , we became immuned to the sound, except when a really large plane would take off , that is when we really became aware to how close we were to the airport.  Snorkeling was great out front on the beach, we saw lots of sea critters; starfish, sea turtles and even Nemo. We went deep fishing 1 day, my sweet Hubby and I got seasick because the seas were 4 to 5 feet swells, ( I can't type anymore about it or I feel queasy again :( ) The captain took my husband and I along with our 17 year old back to the marina. Then he, the captain took our 21 year old back out to the rockin' an a rollin sea..UGH..brave fellow!! They got 1 strike in 5 hours, but no fish. We mostly stayed on the property at all times, we visited El San Juan Hotel a couple of times which by the way was FUN!!! An absolutely must see!!!The Ritz casino SUCKED our money out of our pockets, but we had a great time trying to get it back, it is NOTHING like Vegas if that is what you are looking for, very small.We have traveled to many places , you will never meet any nicer people than at the Ritz Carlton and Puerto Rico.
