{"text":"Another great Sofitel stay We stayed here for three nights at the end of a trip around the Capitol region and enjoyed the hotel enormously.The feel of the hotel was different to other Sofitels we've stayed in, as it was much more traditionally decorated, but I guess this suits a very conservative city and the hotel's typical clientele. Overall, however, the quality and service were of usual Sofitel standards.We reserved a deluxe room with city view and were not disappointed with our large, corner room on a high floor with views out over 15th Street. The room was very elegantly furnished and we had no problems at all with the cleaning and housekeeping service.Overall the hotel provided a great place to retreat to after hot days spent pounding the streets of DC (which is probably my least favourite of the 20 or more major American cities I've visited) and I felt the weekend rate offered good value for money, even though I was paying for it myself.Other reviewers have commented on the lack of dining and other amenities in the vicinity and this is true to a certain extent but the excellent Old Ebbitt Grill is only a short walk away.The hotel is reasonably well located for visiting most of the major attractions in DC (especially the White House and the Washington Monument) and has a small business centre which proved invaluable for reserving tickets for the Washington Monument and checking-in for our flight home.The bar was inviting and, on our last evening, we ate in the hotel's own restaurant which serves superb French-influenced food. The service was impeccable and the meal was delicious, although one of our dishes was rather eccentrically presented.The only real downside was the valet parking service (note to staff: don't expect a gratuity if you rush departing guests into their cars and leave them to reverse out of an alley into heavy traffic).I doubt I'll be going back to DC but, if I did, I'd look forward to staying here again.
