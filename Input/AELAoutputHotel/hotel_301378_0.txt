{"text":"Nothing fancy but it will do for the price Clientele mostly Japanese or other Asian. A handful of Brits, Euros and at least one American -me. Many hotel staff spoke very little English. They weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ rude, but not overly friendly either.I took the lowest price available so I got an unrenovated room that was very basic and unimpressive. I think if you pay more the renovated rooms are nicer but still small. My room had no coffee maker but had a little hot pot and a couple teabags provided. Bring some powdered coffee and you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be set. Water pressure in the shower was good. My floor had a vending machine that sold cold beer for ~US$3.50 a can.The lobby is not particularly opulent but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ bigger than a lot of low cost Tokyo hotels and there is actually a fair amount of lobby seating for meeting business associates. If the main lobby is full, try North tower across from the 7-11. Its lobby is on 2 and has quite a few chairs, usually open.Regarding location. On my Tokyo map, Shinagawa looked like it was way out on the edge of town. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not really. Even so, there is little or nothing for a Western tourist to see there. I think that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ why I saw so few westerners at this hotel. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ easy to get to things from the hotel on the train; but if this is a trip of a lifetime I recommend springing for a big name US hotel up in Shinjuku or maybe Ginza. The JR station practically adjoins the hotel lobby, and even though it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ called Japan Railroad it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ more like a subway train coming every 5 or 10 minutes, not every half hour like a US commuter train. Take the Yamanote line to Shibuya and Shinjuku in one direction (about 20 min), Ginza and Tokyo metro station in the other (10 to 15 min). You can grab the Metro at any of those to go elsewhere.I took a bus in from the airport but leaving took the JR Yamanote line to Tokyo station where I got the Narita Express to the airport. Narita Express has assigned seats. I got my ticket at Tokyo station. ~US$30 one way. Runs every 30 to 60 mins. Follow the signs in Tokyo station.100V AC power in room worked fine charging my US laptop  digital camera, but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ only 2-prong sockets so bring one of those 99cent adaptors if your power supply has a third prong. A hair dryer is provided.No free in-room internet access, at least at my rate. I bought the American style breakfast for ~US$11 each morning upstairs in the Yahoo caf√ã√\u2022√ñ and it included use of computers with internet access after. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ that or you hit the McDonalds downstairs for US$6 but then you still have to buy a coffee or something for another $5 in the Yahoo caf√ã√\u2022√ñ to use the internet so I opted out of the McD route. Printing was around 50 cents a page in the Yahoo. Probably to cover trademark infringement insurance. : ) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":439,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":433},{"endOffset":439,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":433},{"endOffset":528,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":522},{"endOffset":2642,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2636}]}
