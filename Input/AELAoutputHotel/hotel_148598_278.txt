{"text":"Wonderful Long Weekend - Great Hotel! We stayed at the Westin Rio Mar from March 22-25. We chose this hotel because my husband is a Platinum Starwood Member and we wanted a quick long weekend away. We had a great weekend! We upgraded to an Ocean View Jr. Suite with points and everything about the room was excellent! The view was great, the location was great and there was nothing to complain about!After reading some of the previous reviews, we had decided to rent a car. It was much cheaper to rent ahead of time and from the airport. For less than the price of the two of us on the shuttle, we had the car and had access to many neaby restaurants. We tried out Richie's (Great view!! and great service!!) and the Brass Cactus! We also went on a little drive one evening to Walgreens nearby and got some bottled water and munchies. Also, we saved a lot of money by doing our own El Yunque tour for only $6 rather than the expensive hotel tour! So i definitely recommend renting a car and getting out of the resort.In the resort, the beach was great, weather was great, and had no complaints about service. We ate two meals at the resort and would have to share the same feelings as previous reviewers on food reviews. The taste of the food was not that great (in fact, many restaurants outside of the Westin were much better and much cheaper!). But the service was outstanding. One evening, we ate at Shimas, the sushi bar...and becuase I was not in the mood for sushi, the waiter gladly offered to go and get food for me at another restaurant in the resort while my husband had sushi. The service was great and they did everything they could to make our stay great!I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would gladly go there again. ","annotations":[]}
