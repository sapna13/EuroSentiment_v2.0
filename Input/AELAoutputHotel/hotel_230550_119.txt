{"text":"Everyone should stay here!! After reading the trip advisor reviews, and bearing in mind which sights I wanted to see with ease, I decided on the Park Inn, in Alexanderplatz, east Berlin.Getting there very late at night I got a taxi, which wasn't a fortune compared to UK prices.First impressions were, wow, the tv tower at night next door looks really lovely, but looking at the hotel I thought am I going to the office?!! This is because the exterior of the hotel isn't what you would call classy. However, as soon as I stepped inside, I knew I had picked the right place! Very modern, tip top condition, spotlessly clean, and soundproof. Excellent value for money, considering it's location and views, couldn't believe my luck!I asked for the highest floor possible and was very very happy to have been offered a room on the 34th floor which was smack opposite the tv tower - that was it, I was totally mesmerised by that view, I only wish I could have captured that lit-up, night-time view from my room on camera (sigh).Again, the room was spotless, and very swish. As it was just me I didn't mind the wc having just a glass door, in fact I thought it was ultra trendy!The bedding, I just have to tell you, was the most comfortable ever - I cannot describe it, but the material and weight of that duvet was sheer luxury. Each night I slept like a baby!The hotel was brilliantly situated for the olde Jewish quarter, and for tram rides eastbound outside the city, but also what was great, was, right next door to the hotel was a massive C  A dept store - for us from the UK this is a luxury, for there are no more C  A stores in the UK anymore, so I was pleased to have a store on my doorstep! Also, a U-bahn, S-bahn, and a tour bus all there for the asking, just a few feet away, and, a huge dept store adjoining the hotel, with I might add the most amazing range of chocolates!The hotel has a terrace roof which only opens at certain times and under certain weather conditions, but if you ask nicely, someone will let you go up there, on the roof, to take a few photos - incredible to be so high up, from where you can see all of Berlin's major architecture.Decided to eat in the a la carte restaurant on the 2nd floor. Asked for the pork meal, but the staff advised me not to order it, as it wasn't a pork chop, but a whole leg of pork - for one!!!! Ordered another dish, couldn't even eat that there was so much of it, but the desserts well I had to have some of that so I found room!The only criticism I have is the breakfast - it's an average affair. Granted there's lots of choice, but as a Brit I found all the herbs and sausage meats and breads too heavy and spicey\/herby first thing in the morning, but it was great to have a whole jug full of coffee on the table so I could drink as much as I liked.I would definitely stay here again and, as one of the previous posters wrote, it's best to ask for a room away from the lifts. By the time I left, I kinda liked the way the exterior looked, and, where-ever I went in east Berlin, I could spot my hotel from afar, even from the plane when it flew over Berlin before hitting the clouds, and just thinking about the Park Inn now makes me smile; I know I'll return there again!
