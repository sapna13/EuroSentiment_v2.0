{"text":"Severely Overrated I arrived at the hotel and waited 15 minutes for the front desk clerk to get off of the phone. I was patient, but that didn't seem to matter. He did ask if I was staying for business or pleasure, and I responded business. He then put me in room 103, which is literally in the basement. They call it the cellar, I call it lame. I did ask to be moved, but the guy at the front desk said there wasn't anything available until the next morning. So a little about the cellar - You can hear the ice machine running most of the night, you hear anyone purchasing from the vending machines, and you hear the cleaning people early in the morning. In addition, the person that sets-up the breakfast station for the morning crowd has to come down there to get ice, which sounds like a handful of quarters in a dryer - this happened around 4:30 or 5 a.m. In addition to the creep factor of staying in the basement and all of the noise, when I went to use my hairdryer in the morning, it was broken. I did call the front desk to ask for another, to which they replied, We don't have portable hairdryers. At this point, I'd really had enough and asked for another room. They did give me another room, and I moved my stuff to the 9th floor. It seemed odd to me that a room was available at 8 a.m., but not the night before. So I didn't really believe the guy at the front desk from the night before. The new room had a lovely view, but it was definitely a smoker√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ room, and had a stale smoke smell. The room was fine, and the morning staff was far more helpful. I wouldn't recommend staying in the Cellar, although the one redeeming quality was that it had a small patio. Unfortunately, when I was there it was about 17 degrees outside, and it was completely unusable. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not 100% sure why the guy who checked me in asked if I was there for business or pleasure, because he gave me the noisiest room in the place. I walked away believing he was simply a jerk. There are a lot of hotels in New York, and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ stumped as to why this one gets such high marks. It makes leery of the reviews that people write, and I would recommend spending some time searching around before settling for this place. ","annotations":[]}
