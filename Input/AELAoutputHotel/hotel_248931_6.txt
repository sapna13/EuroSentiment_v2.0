{"text":"Nice Place, bad service The location of Hotel River was perfect, in walking distance to everything but out of the way to relax. The room was nice and we had a view of the river. The only issue was the concierge. I can't remember his name, but he was the most unhelpful man I ever met. We asked him to make reservations at a reccomended restaurant. He replied you don't want to go there it's touristy. We asked him than to reccomend another restuarant. He said to give him a half hour. We cam back down only for him to inform us that they were all closed. He didn't reccomend any others and it was too late to go to our original choice. Another issue that I had with him was we booked the florence in a Day tour. He only took cash and when we went to the tour they said our concierge booked us for the lesser priced tour, yet we paid him full price. Thankfully the tour people trusted us and let us do the whole tour, in which we paid for. Upon checkout he gave me a bill, which I was sure I pre-paid through expedia. When I told him this he became extrmely defensive. I went to go on line so I could figure out the problem and he literally was harassing me to pay him and wait till I got back to the states to work out any issues with expedia. he literally came into the internet booth with me. Very wierd. All in all Hotel River is fine as long as you do not deal too much with reception ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0}]}
