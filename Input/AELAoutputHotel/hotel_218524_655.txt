{"text":"Excellent We are a married Canadian couple in our late 40's who have travelled extensively through the Caribbean and stay at all inclusive resorts seeking 5 stars if available. We were at Excellence for 2 weeks 08-22 January; our third trip to the Dominican. The drive to the resort is as everyone claims; unnerving and horrible. It was very stressful especially at night after an 8 hour flight. The check in was prompt and we asked for a better room and were moved the very next day to a perfect poolside room at no extra cost. The rooms are very clean and comfortable; maid service consistent. The ocean is very rough and we found that disappointing as we are beach people. It is yellow sand, not the white sand on Bavaro beach. We discovered, and this is important to note, that if you walk down the right of the beach only 5-10 minutes, the water is smooth and perfect for swimming or wading; absolutely warm and clear and calm., the beach is safe and well travelled. The food is above average for the Dominican. Our favorites were Spices and the French restaurant. The lobster house is good, but limited selection and not the lobster we know in Canada; but very nice in a beautiful setting sitting outside. Lunch has 2 options - the grill a la carte or the buffet. The buffet is very hot during the day with no air conditioning or fans; but the selection especially the salad bar is great. The grill is sit down service and very relaxing by the pool with a lovely breeze. They also have a cook prepare lunch daily on the beach which is fun. The service at this resort is outstanding and the staff are very friendly. We did not eat breakfast often as I opt for the gym in the morning, but it is buffet. The bar service is good, especially the martini bar staff are outstanding. One little waitress Jenny, brought my husband clamato juice she had at home for his Caesars; as we Canadians have trouble getting clamato at these resorts - what a sweetheart!! They have Domingo the sax player at night who is wonderful, we bought one of his CDs to bring home and there is dancing. A few nights the adult piano bar guy is in the martini bar, who is hilarious. The shows were very good. The gym is quite good, with treadmills, ellipticals, stepper, bikes and weight equipment with free weights. Somedays were busy and others empty. The fella who runs the gym is very good, he will be your personal trainer if you ask him! The Spa is nice, with daily specials.We found the age range at the resort covers every decade. Not many singles, mostly couples. The day activities are geared for the younger adults.We would likely return to this resort again. We had a wonderful, relaxing time. I will say again that the staff are excellent. We did not like the long drive from the airport and that will influence our decision to return as will the roughness of the ocean at this resort location. We will definitely seek Excellence resorts in other destinations. But overall, it was a great resort and you will enjoy yourself without a doubt.
