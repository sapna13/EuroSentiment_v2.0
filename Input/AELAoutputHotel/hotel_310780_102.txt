{"text":"Great place to stay in Florence We booked this hotel the night before we needed a room for 3 adults. The hotel was very accommodating, and actually gave us the family suite since it was the only one available. They were apologetic because it was the only thing that they had available and it was on the main floor. There was definitely nothing to apologize for since the suite was huge and exceeded our expectations. The room was clean, and had very high ceilings which were painted with beautiful murals.We had also wanted to see Michelangelo's David, which was right around the corner from the hotel and the hotel had made reservations for us to see it that same day we arrived. Seeing as the line to get into this place, especially last minute, was hours long, this was a huge help! The hotel also booked a tour of the Uffizi Gallery for us as well, which was also huge since the wait to get into that museum was just as long as to see the David, if not longer. The hotel also did not charge us to make these reservations, they made them for no extra charge.On our last day there, they gladly held onto our bags after checkout, for no extra charge, while we took the day to continue our exploration of the city.I have some pictures that I'll post once I finish sorting through all of them. :)Overall we had a great experience there and I would definitely stay there again when I come back to Florence!
