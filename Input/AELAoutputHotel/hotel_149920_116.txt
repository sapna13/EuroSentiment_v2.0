{"text":"Great Hotel, Great Service **We booked a single night for Friday, 2\/15\/08, as a stopover before a cruise that left on Saturday morning. We selected a pool\/oceanview room. The room was very expensive ($436), but that was because it was the weekend before the President's Day holiday -- apparently all the hotels in San Juan jack up the prices for that period.***We arrived in the lobby about 1:00 pm and it was very busy (many cruise people) -- I was worried that the very busy staff would provide mediocre service or that we wouldn't be allowed to check in so early. Not the case at all! I got in line for check-in, and while I was waiting, a waiter came by with a tray of free fruit drinks. Nice touch. When I got to the counter, the hotel person was friendly, cheerful and efficient -- got us checked right in.***The room we got was in the short part of the hotel (8 stories -- not the tower). The room was nicely appointed with beautiful bed spreads and nice furniture. The bathroom was about average size, but very nice -- marble countertop and large shower.***The pool area was nice, with more friendly staff. It was really beautiful at night.***The restaurants\/food was expensive but good. The evening buffet was about $30\/person. They also had a very nice outdoor buffet by the pool.***Overall, this hotel had the look and feel of an upscale hotel, and the service (and price!) matched it.***I have stayed at one other San Juan hotel -- the Intercontinental in 2006 at the same time of year and about the same price. Both were very nice and I was pleased with the service and pool\/beach areas at both hotels. The Intercontinental has a nicer pool\/beach area, and the Stellaris has a little nicer rooms. Overall I would recommend either of these two hotels.
