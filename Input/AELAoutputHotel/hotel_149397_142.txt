{"text":"Beatiful beach and the most friendly people Let me start by saying that I also had my doubts after reading so many negative reviews! But I'd like to assure you that we had a great time and were impressed with the hotel, location, beach, and yes even the food!My friend and I were at the Bavaro Princess from Jan.26th to Feb.2nd. We flew out of Toronto and got there quite late (close to 11pm). Our room was ready, the only problem was we had requested a room with 2 beds and were given a room with one king size bed. This issue was rectified the next day, so no problems at all.Check in  check out - no problem. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The guys we spoke to spoke very good English, and some even French. Because we were leaving late on the 2nd, we asked for a late check out, but the hotel was fully booked. We kept our luggage in our friends room  showered there. We were allowed to keep our towel cards and bracelets so we still had access to all of the amenities. Room - clean, yes, it was a bit older, but how much time do you spend there? The beds were not that comfortable, but the room was spacious and cleaned every day. We tipped our maid a couple of times during the week and didn't notice a big difference with what she did. Nonetheless, they all do work very hard and are extremely friendly.Food - the buffet was pretty decent. We had breakfast at the main restaurant every day; there is always something you can find to eat, even if it's just a croissant and some coffee. There is an omlette station which we never tried. The dinners were good too, great variety, and again always something you'll find to eat. The wait staff very friendly and accomodating, really have no complaints about the people whatsoever. A la carte restaurants - we went to Sakura which was supposed to be Japanese, but it wasn't (more like Chinese), but it's ok, the food was decent and the staff very friendly. We also tried El Gaucho, our favourite - the steak was very good and everything else that came with it. Bella Pasta was decent as well, I had the lasgna and it was good. Remember when you are travelling that there is a chance you will experience 'tourista' so be careful with what  how much you eat  drink. We are tourists so are not accustomed to many things. My friend and I were fine and did not get sick or anything at all. I think when people do report they got sick, it's probably a combination of too much sun, alcohol and the wrong foods...Entertainment - we only went to one or two shows, yes they are cheesy, but the kids really do work hard all day long.Beach - absolutely beautiful. clear white sand, and beautiful tourquoise water. you can walk in either direction for quite a distance and it's just as clean and beautiful. we found the waves were a bit rough the first couple of days, but it seemed to calm down afterwards. either way, it's a gorgeous and very clean beach.Excursions - definitely do the Outback Safari - we had a blast! Our tour guide was Eddy who showed us all a good time. This tour gives you a better idea to the Dominican life and you make many stops along the way. The boogie boarding was fun too :) I would not recommend the Saona Island tour. We were picked up about 6:45 - 7:45 and because we were the first ones picked up, we had an extra hour each way because of all the other pick ups  drop offs at the other hotels. The bus ride to where we took the catamaran was about 2 hours after the last pick up. The Catamarn ride about 1.5 hours...so by the time we actually get to Saona islan it was close to noon...we then left at 2:30 to check out the natural pool with starfish. All in all, this tour was definitely not worth the cost of $90USD. They advertise you're taken to a secluded island, but they dont' tell you how long the commute is nor do they tell you there are thousands of other toursists on this secluded island and vendors constantly harassing you to buy stuff from them. It was a 13 hour day for us and we spend in total about 3-4 hours on the beach  in the water (catamaran  speed boat).
