{"text":"5 week reservation at the sterling hotel My son needed a room for a 5 week internship inDallas this summer. We spent all day Friday visitingvarious extended stay hotels in the downtown Dallas area.Example: Budget Suites,Intown Suites, Candlewood Suites,and the Sterling Hotel.Our first stop was the Sterling, the manager on Duty gaveus a key to see a room. I can tell you, I was notimpressed. The carpet was very dirty, and there wereeven holes in it. It was a very poor room, we returnedthe key and left. ( this was quoted for 600 a month).The other two extended stay places,( Budget, and Intown )were ok, really looked nice and clean on the outside, but theinside of them smelled like smoke and urine.The Candlewood was by far the nicest, and cleanest ,but thebest price we could get was 60.oo a night, which wouldbe around 1800 a month.The other suites werearound 850 to 1000 a month. I remembered a review saying they had stayed at a renovated room inthe Sterling hotel, so we decided to go check theSterling one more time. When I asked the desk clerkif they had renovated rooms, she said of course.This time we got a key to a renovated room. The differencewas night and day. This might be the reason thereviews for the Sterling are all over the place, fromvery poor to good. The quoted price of $600.00 was forthe older rooms. We told them we wanted one of therenovated rooms. The desk clerk went and checked withthe manager on duty, and made us a deal. Our son got a renovated corner room. The room was quite a bit smallerthan the first room we saw, but it was updated. We got the 600.00 a month price. If you want thesmall fridge and microwave it was $75.00 a month more,or you can bring your own. We apprecaiated themworking with us. I'm surprised they haven't updatedall their rooms, it would help their reviews.
