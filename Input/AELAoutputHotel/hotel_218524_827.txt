{"text":"Disappointed We took this trip for our 20th anniversary in October, 2007, without our boys. We had a gardenview junior room (requested oceanview) and ended up in a room that looked out at the back window of Chez Isabel. Not much water to be seen from here. The garden was not what we expected. Management tried to accommodate our request but the only room that would have done this was a honeymoon suite--for an additional $2,100.00. This included a hot tub on the balcony, which you would not have been able to use after 6:00 p.m. because of the mosquitos. The first two days here, we had no face cloths--makes it kind of hard to wash off the suntan lotion. We had to hide the wash cloth we finally got on the balcony so it didn't disappear with maid service. We did get clean towels again in the late afternoon\/early evening on Tuesday.We booked our anniversary dinner through the concierge and had our reservation confirmation ticket. We arrived at the restaurant (Spice) and we were not on their list.After two days of warmish soda and water in the fridge in our room, we asked management for a replacement because things were not cold and were told that they aren't fridges, they are coolers. Warm beverages in 90 degree weather wasn't what we were looking for.As far as the alcoholic drinks we had, there was little to no alcohol in our drinks. We even saw the bartender at the Martini Bar adding water to some of the bottles. After 6\/6:30 p.m., you could not go outside without getting eaten alive by the mosquitos. We tried to eat at The Grill for dinner and had ordered, but had to leave because we were being swarmed and bitten. We tried again the next day for lunch, and asked that the tartar sauce not be put on the fish sandwich. My husband actually saw the chef take the food off the counter, wipe the tartar sauce off with paper towels and place it back up for service. When it came to us, we just left. The entertainment staff, Rey, Francisco, Inez, Altagracia, etc. were fabulous. They add some fun to the day. Without them, it would be pretty boring. They went out of their way to try to include you in things that were going on. They had pet names for some guests. The shows we attended were decent.As far as food service went, a meal took at least 1 to 1 1\/2 hours to get through even when there were only 10-15 couples in the restaurant. The food was pretty good - we tried some new foods at the restaurants we ate at.During the middle of our first night, our phone rang in the room one time. It continued to do this throughout the night at various times the entire week we were there. We were told the problem would be fixed by Wednesday, but it kept happening through Saturday when we left. Not bad, being woken up at 5 a.m. on your vacation. We finally took the phone off the hook - hoping our kids did not need to reach us.The bed was very uncomfortable - just like sleeping on the floor. The shower was very small (3 x 3 maybe) and dark.We were very disappointed for a 5 1\/2 star resort. We will not return nor recommend this resort to anyone. There are much nicer places out there.
