{"text":"Lovely The Hotel Brighton is a lovely, charming hotel perfectly located in the heart of Paris.We booked an apartment that had a modest-size bedroom, full bath, and separate small living room with a pullout couch. There was plenty of room for all of us throughout our entire stay. This room configuration and size were perfect as we were traveling with our college-age daughter. The room had been recently updated; was clean; and quiet (we had an inside courtyard apt). Our room included two flat-screen TVs, a refrigerator, safe, full bath (with two sinks), tub, shower, separate toilet area, hair dryer, and plenty of closet space. WiFi Internet was available in the room using a prepaid internet card purchased at the front desk. Only nits: Shower was weak and took 10 minutes to get any hot water and cable television went down.The staff was wonderfully helpful and welcoming. Anytime we needed anything, they provided it to us in a friendly, expedient manner: restaurant recommendations, taxi, directions, etc.The hotel is located near EVERYTHING: across the street from the Metro, Tuileries Garden, the Louvre, L'orangerie, and Jeu de Paume museums. Walking distance to great restaurants, bateau mouche, and amazing shopping. Tips: Rue Ste. Honore, one street away, has all the couture shopping anyone would ever need. We enjoyed dining casually at the Imperial Cafe one block away. We also loved Le Souffle (fabulous to have appetizers, entrees and desserts prepared as souffles) and Il Cortile (a fine Italian restaurant located in the Hotel Castille).One last tip: Be sure to purchase a museum card, which is a prepaid advance ticket that gets you into almost all Parisian museums. The card can be purchased for a variety of days and is activated (by writing the date on the back) as soon as you use it the first time. We purchased ours on the afternoon we arrived at the Notre Dame Cathedral, because there is barely a line at the ND ticket booth. If you purchase the card at any of the museums, you'll have to wait on a long, serpentine line. The museum card can be also purchased online (takes 10 days to mail), or at the Paris airports. Once you get the card, you enter all museums via a separate entrance on a short line. Be sure to check your coats--you'll roast in the museums.Be sure to have hot chocolate and a pastry at Angelina's Salon du The, which is located four doors down from the Hotel Brighton on Rue Rivoli--It is unbelievably scrumptious! Be sure to go before 3PM, because the place is a zoo afterwards. Last word of advice: I purchased lovely cookies at Angelina's while in Paris; and, like a good citizen, checked YES are you bringing any food item into the US? Well, had I known I would have to stand on an additional customs' line because I had food (cookies). I would have left the yummy treats with the hotel staff. Goodness, Uncle Sam, was that necessary?We really had a great trip, and would go back to Hotel Brighton again.
