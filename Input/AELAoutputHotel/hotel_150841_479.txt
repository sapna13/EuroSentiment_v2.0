{"text":"Bavaro Vacation I stayed at IberoStar Bavaro from Aug 6th until Aug 13th. First of all if you are going to stay at the IberoStar resort, pay the extra $14.00 a day for Bavaro and not the Domenica or Punta Cana - there is hardly anything to do at those 2 resorts. The ride from the airport to the resort was kind of sad - Dominican houses and little bicycles with motors showed how poor their country actual is. When you first get to the resort one of the ladies brings you a welcome drink - do not drink it - it has ice in it and really upset my stomach. The rooms are beautiful. Big enough and very very nicely decorated. The pool area beautiful also, alot of activities to do during the day from dance classes, to water games to beach volleyball games. The beach is right past the pool area - the ocean was very clean but not as blue as i thought it would be. Wear lots of sunblock you get burned very quickly and do not even realize it. Dinner well that was the worse part of my vacation. All their foods taste funny. Hamburgers do not taste like they should nor does any of the meats. Potatoes are not boiled throroughly. Shows at night very well performed and get the audience involved alot. I also did horseback riding on the beach which was a great experience - 2 hrs for 55 dollars. Also bargain with the Dominicans. If you say your going to walk away they will follow you and settle for the deal you made. Also, for all you animal lovers - you will see alot of stray dogs around - they are very friendly - try to bring bottled water from the room for them they are very hot in the sun all day. Overall, I had a very relaxing time at this resort, just watch out for the food - bring alot of immodium and malox:) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1031,"mention":"Hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1021},{"endOffset":1031,"mention":"Hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1021},{"endOffset":1031,"mention":"Hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1021},{"endOffset":1031,"mention":"Hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1021}]}
