{"text":"Charming Paris Hotel This was our first trip to Paris and I wanted to stay in an old world paris hotel with tons of charm! Well after reading all the reviews from trip advisor I booked this hotel and I fell in love it!HLP was wonderful from the minute we checked in. The lady at the front desk was so gracious and even carried our luggage up to our rooms. We had a standard room overlooking the gardens.It was very beautiful and it had 3 windows with two facing the gardens and one facing the courtyard. What I loved was in the evening when we would retire to our room we would crack our window to the courtyard and you could hear the fountain trickling and you could smell the fire from the fireplace in the library. Very relaxing!The staff was super friendly and helpful . I loved the library and the atmosphere and the way the hotel would smell when you would come back from a long day of sightseeing. They had this amazing candle and fragrance in the lobby when you would walk in. I bought a candle and every time my husband and I light it ,it reminds us of Paris! After visiting Paris we realized we were in the best location you could be in, in the City. HLP is within walking distance from so many great local things as well as the Louvre, Notre Dame etc. You are also near a great bus stop that takes you directly to the other great attractions!We will be staying here again and we have already recommended this hotel to friends that are going in November!!
