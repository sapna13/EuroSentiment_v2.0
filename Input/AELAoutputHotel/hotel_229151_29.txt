{"text":"Everything was exactly as described...AWESOME On a whim, I decided to stay over in Amsterdam for 1 night. I wanted to go all out and stay somewhere 'Fancy' and was ready to pay for it. But the reviews for the Luxury hotels were spotty and I didn't want to make a 300 Euro mistake.So I held my breathe, went with Hotel Estehrea after considering everything else and settled in on the location, price (I paid a special 99Euro for a Single room), and its reputation.What a great location! Remember I only really had 24hours. This location was picturesque, right on the Canal, and close to everything. You cannot go wrong with this choice of area. For breakfast, I grabbed an excellent coffee and Croissant a mere block away on the Singel. AMAZING.The room. My room was a lot bigger than I thought. I thought because I went with the lowest rate, I'd get a closet - but I got a very roomy\/comfortable room. I was very happy. Very quaint. I'm a bit of a design snob and wanted to stay in something modern and luxurious, but I was very satisfied with the room and the decor. Okay - it could use a bit of updating - but like I said, quaint.The staff. EXTREMELY FRIENDLY and HELPFUL. Check this out: I only had a credit card from the airport to the hotel (Taxi was about 43Euro). Because I didn't have cash, the front manager had no issue giving him cash and charging the taxi to my room. I travel every week and stay in the top 5 hotels in the world on a monthly basis. No one EVER did that for me. Extra kudos for making it easy for me. I also left my shirt and tie. They contacted me after I got home and asked me where to send it. Have you ever heard of such proactiveness?All in all - I arrived at the Hotel at 6pm and only hit my bed at 5am to check out at 10am the next day. I had a great stay in Amsterdam and this Hotel was a big part of the reason. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":688,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":682}]}
