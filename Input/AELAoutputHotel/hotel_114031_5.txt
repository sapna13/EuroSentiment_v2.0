{"text":"Great hotel despite renovations My boyfriend and I just got back from a 5 night stay at the Ohana Waikiki Beachcomber and had a great time. I was a little worried since I knew they were undergoing renovations but it didn't bother us at all. We got to the hotel about 2 hours before check in but our room was ready and were able to go right up. I was surprised to see that we had a partial ocean view since I had reserved a standard. The rooms have been completely remodeled and look just like they do on their website. Theres a small refrigerator so you can buy snacks and juice and keep them cold. Unfortunately, there is no microwave. I love the granite in the bathroom, I just wished there were some drawers in there. Our bathtub got clogged one day but they came right up to fix it. The front desk was very courteous and helpful. I reserved our airport shuttle through them for $9. I also liked the the hotel had pastries and coffee in the morning since we could stop by for a quick bite before heading out for the day.Since there is construction going on, the pool area closed. However, we were able to use the pool at the Ohana East or West. We decided to go to the Ohana West since they have a bar area with $3 happy hour drinks. It was about a 5 minute walk. Also, the lobby exit on to Kalakaua ave was closed so you exit onto Dukes Ave. and are about 20 steps away from the main street. The location of this hotel was great. We weren't ON the beach but we were right across the street, less than 5 minutes away. The International Market Place is next door and there are plenty of restaurants in either direction. Overall, if I went back to Oahu I would definitely stay here again. I'm sure the pool would be ready by then.
