{"text":"Not all that excellente! We stayed at the resort from 25th July for two weeks. Having stayed last year at the sister resort Secrets Excellence Riviera Cancun in Mexico we had alot to compare it too. The Mexican resort was truly 5 star and we highly recommend that you stay there if you enjoyed Excellence Punta Cana. We didn't think that Excellence Punta Cana was 5 star by any stretch of the imagination. Prehaps 3\/4 star and that 4 star is pushing it. We have been fortunate to stay in 5 star hotels in the Caribbean before including Sandals but we are no means snobs we just want good value for money, because it is expensive if you are travelling from the UK.Now don't get me wrong the beach and setting of the hotel is beautiful but as I said as returning Excellence members we would rather have spent the same money and stayed at Excellence Riviera Cancun in Mexico!Don't bother upgrading to the Excellence club! Spend the money on flight upgrades instead! We met a lovely couple Glenn and Kim whilst there and we compared rooms. Glenn and Kim had upgraded to Excellence club and they only recived a paper, free internet and liquors in there room. We both had exactly the same room ( although we had cockroaches )so the √ä√£¬¢300 extra spent we all thought was a waste of money!The food was lovely at the hotel and there was lots of choice. As previous members have written it is a good idea if you brush up on your spanish beforehand as it is difficult to divulge in conversation in restaurants. The room service is also very good however it usually took up to an hour during the day to come.Maid service was very good however rooms were not serviced until late in the afternoon and they start cleaning early and are very noisy!We would say that 80% of the staff were fantastic and gave us brilliant service but the other 20% were very poor and this poor service\/attitude tainted the good service we recieved.The beach was beautiful, the sea was nice and warm and choppy- but this was good fun to play in!If you are like us and want somewhere nice and peaceful to chill in the days then the bottom end of the pool is great! Good areas to shade and relax. Good access to floaties and nice bar with lovely service called 'SOL.' Try a Banannamamma! Wow pure heaven! Unfortunatley there was lots of flies and insects in the pool which we think it was down to a lot of people smoking cigars and eating fast food in the pool and we never saw the same people leave the pool for toilet visits- need I say anymore? The swim up bar area was the same we didn't dare venture down that way as I didn't pack enough anticeptic wipes!we are not snobs by any means but we have been fortunate enough to stay at quite a few 5 star all inclusuive resorts in the carribbean and unfortunately this one is no where near the top of the list...however all in all we as an okay stay but wont be returning to the hotel or to the island again.
