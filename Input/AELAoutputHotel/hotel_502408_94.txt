{"text":"Super stay We stayed at the Affinia 50 at the beginning of April for five days and, like almost everyone else, found it to be an excellent choice. Before arrival I had emailed Joseph Rauer to advise him that we would be arriving before the standard check-in time and he told us he would make sure that one of our two rooms was ready for us early. In fact, they both were, which was great. (He also let us have a late checkout on the day we left, which was brilliant). We had upgraded to junior suites on a high floor for both our rooms and were delighted we had. There was so much room in my son√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ room on the 16th floor that I think it was bigger than my first flat! A complimentary bottle of wine and large nut assortment in the rooms went down very well and were a nice touch. The beds are very comfortable and although there is noise from the street I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ find that it stopped me sleeping and I am usually very restless when I'm away from home. The rooms are clean and simply decorated and although the bathroom is small it is so well stocked we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to bring our own toilettries. Yes, the kitchens could do with a facelift but they are functional and it meant we could enjoy a coffee and bagels from Ess-en-Bagel on 3rd between 50 and 51st Street in comfort. I know people have recommended the lunchonette but we found it overpriced and my son was sick after eating there on our second day. The staff, from front of house throught to housekeeping, are all great - helpful but not in your face all the time. The doormen were lovely with my teenage son, even when they discovered he was a Knicks fan! The night we had to cancel our arrangements because my son was ill we asked one of the guys on reception for a restuarant recommendation and were directed to a noodle shop close by. It doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ look much at all but if you're after cheap, good Chinese food then Mee√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ on 2nd between 49 and 48th Street is a good bet. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ well located to reach almost everywhere you might want to go with ease and if we go to NY again I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ sure we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l go back to the Affinia 50, too.
