{"text":"Casa Camper, oh so good! My husband and I stayed for five nights at Casa Camper in Barcelona and truly it was one of the best holidays we have ever had. I had been trying to decide whether to book with Casa Camper or another hotel. I was going to surprise my husband on the accommodation front so I was a little nervous as I wanted to get it right. Casa Camper as it is not your traditional type of hotel and I worried that perhaps it would be too funky for us. Don't get me wrong we are mid-40's, young at heart but I for one like my comfort especially as I travel a lot for work and I was worried my husband might not be too crazy on this hip design concept. I was going out on a limb here or so I thought. He wasn't disappointed and neither was I. Comfort and hip were parallel, nothing was sacrificed.The design of this hotel is superb. It's the finer details that are looked after. From the massive beds with pure cotton bed linen, air conditioning, bottles of water being left in your room, a large safe for all your valuables, your bed being turned down with classical music tuned on your radio lulling you into your bedroom to huge fluffy bath towels; robes and slippers at your disposal. The showers are incredible, like a fire hose which definitely wakes you up. We had a suite so also had a bath and that was a luxury to soak in after a long day pounding the streets of Barcelona sightseeing. The hammock placed right next to the windows (with French doors and a teeny, tiny balcony √à√\u2020\u2022?just perfect), so you can absorb the Catalan vibe from the streets below. The music that plays in the reception area and lifts is all designed, not just your regular CD's on a loop. I can't say that I heard the same songs twice and the music at breakfast was always nice and jazzy. It was great! The help yourself to salads, snacks and drinks anytime was brilliant. You would think that you would over indulge but you didn't. Water was a lifesaver. Just bring up a couple of bottles to your room and then more was delivered later. The breakfasts were great. The chef cooked what you ordered in the line of eggs, tortillas, bacon, etc. There were cold meats, cheeses, lots of perfectly presented sliced fruit (no pith!), pastries, yoghurt, cereals, bread to toast, juices, tea, coffee, I can go on...The city is a walker's city so the location of the hotel is spot on. About two blocks off Las Ramblas but very, very quiet. You might hear the green parakeets chatting away in the daytime on the palm trees nearby - amazing to see so many of them. The roof terrace is a great place to chill, grab a drink and take it up there. A real feel of the city, with views as far as the eye can see. Boy, this place was the best; totally different, great atmosphere and absolutely fantastic staff (who were friendly and most helpful but not intrusive). Because it was so relaxed and chilled, the staff really made it for us. There was always a friendly face, a Hello! and How was your day?. It was never any trouble to recommend somewhere, book a restaurant or post a letter. They were so kind. And their recommendations were spot on. It was also nice that they asked us about a tapas bar we had been raving about because one of the other guests wanted to go there. That was cool to share info. Very observant!I had read up on Trip Advisor prior to booking this hotel and as one reviewer had said he would go back in a heartbeat - I can understand that. We plan to go back next year. The hotel might be a little more expensive than others but it makes sense to us to stay somewhere where we know it will be comfortable, clean, safe and friendly. Hats off to Casa Camper! Excellent - Five Star Rating all the way!Well done! To all the staff who were just great, thank you and especially Fernanda, Gemma, Guillermo and Sarah A seriously funky but extremely welcoming and comfortable hotel. Apparently, they will be opening one in Berlin sometime soon - I always wanted to visit that city too!
