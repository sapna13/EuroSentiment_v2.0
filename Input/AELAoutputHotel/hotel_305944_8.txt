{"text":"Terrible Customer Service Stayed here over 30 times, for the location and used to have cheap rooms. Rooms of course tiny, but the bathroom is a closet. Have to go out to the main room to dry off after a shower. Always a few bruises from bumping into the bathroom walls. Bed is terrible; sink straight to the bottom, like sleeping in a hammock. No heat, so don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go in winter. You can ask for a portable heater, but they will hassle you about it.But by far the worst part is the staff, which know nothing about how hotel hospitality is supposed to work. Only follow polices and are incapable of deviating from them. Never been greeted by name or offered any upgrade. Every time I ask for a 1 hour late checkout, I am flatly refused. Worse, they will lie to your face and tell you that they are fully booked the next day, when they have many rooms available. They have a 72 hour before √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√¨rrival time√à√\u2020\u2022?cancel policy, but they will try to enforce a 72 hour √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√¨rrival date√à√\u2020\u2022?(96 hours) policy. I spent an hour on the phone talking to 3 different √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√Üupervisors√à√\u2020\u2022?before they canceled my reservation, even though they were fully booked for my dates and could easily get twice the rate I had reserved.They just don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ understand hotel customer service. I filled out the General Manager √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022\u2022omment Form√à√\u2020\u2022?and requested that I be contacted, but never was - don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think there is a GM. I now stay in a nearby hotel with upgrades, late checkout, nicer rooms, and cheaper rates. ","annotations":[]}
