{"text":"Sad if this is the best Starwood can do in NYC I am a 25 year veteran of Starwood's best hotels around the world - in the US, Asia and Europe - we are big fans, and I am sadly disappointed with this effort in NYC.We stayed in the Westin Times Square in early December 2006 with moderate expectations based on reviews from this site. And to be fair, nothing was terribly wrong - it's just that nothing was terribly right either. Overall I would say that the service and physical plant of the hotel was highly disappointing.Let me start with the sole positive from our stay: We had luggage wrapped in plastic from our return flight from South Africa. A very courteous gentleman from the maintenance staff saw us coming down the hall and offered to cut open the plastic. When we offered him a tip, he graciously refused, saying it was his pleasure to help us.Starting with check in: we were greeted by a young man at the Preferred Checkin counter who couldn't muster a smile or eye contact. His manner was somewhere between indifferent and curt. We truly felt we were imposing on him when asking if we might check in. And at the time of our check in the lobby was empty - no lines, not busy, no excuse for this kind of attitude. This sort of set the tone for the whole stay.We were in a Club Room, which I would not recommend in this case (although we almost always prefer club floors at Westins around the world). Although the room came equipped with a nice new Mac computer, we would frankly rather have had that investment go into updating the tired carpet and walls or part of the dingy bathroom. Or include (as almost every other premium hotel does on their version of club floors) free access to the internet. I will say the bed was fine - clean sheets, firm, etc. But the industry is at a point now where this alone doesn't get you a whole lot of extra credit points.The Club Lounge itself was tired, and the staff there seemed even more tired than the room, and almost studiedly unhelpful when we asked questions or for assistance. We got the distinct feeling that if we dropped dead in front of them they wouldn't stop reading their magazines, as this would be 'not my job'. They were clearly not the cream of the crop which, again, you sort of expect in Club Lounges.A list of further small gripes, just in case someone from Starwood\/Westin reads these reviews:The coffee table in our club room was terrible - peeling black paint on a cheap table which looked at least a dozen years old.The bathroom sink was a dented tin-can effect. Not chic-art, just old, cheap and dented.Throughout our stay the 'Service Express' line couldn't answer a single question for us, and really didn't seem interested in finding anyone who could. After disconnecting me three times when transferring to the Concierge, I had to forcefully insist that the Service Express operator stay on the line until he had connected me with a real person who could answer my question.The walls in the hotel are thin. Really thin. Several times we could clearly overhear conversations from our neighbor, and they seemed to be talking at a normal (not loud) volume.Local phone calls are charged at $2.50. Okay, so some places still do this, but with the falling cost of calls and when you are in a Club Room you don't expect this kind of highway robbery.There were no slippers, not even the inexpensive $0.50 ones you find in mid-range hotels. And our query to find out if we could get some was given a rude response from the Service Express operator.
