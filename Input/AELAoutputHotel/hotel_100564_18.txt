{"text":"Give it a big miss For those thinking of staying at this hotel due to its price and location tot he city - think again. I booked this hotel for the above reasons and now regret that decision. You would be better off paying a few more dollars and staying somewhere decent or staying a little further out of the city - everything is close so walking is not much of a problem. Rooms are small, beds are like sleeping on a cement base and the smell!!!! When i arrived in my room I found hairs in the bed and somones dirty old sock on the second shelf of the bedside table - and it was not my sock!! Dirty in other words. The cleaning of the rooms is brief and not through by my view. The light from the hall way\/walkway outside the room shines under the gap from the the door keeping you awake, and if that was not enough the noise from the traffic would wake you anyways once you did finally get to sleep. I had 5 nights booked and ended up checking out of the hotel and cutting my trip short from australia just so i didnt have to stay any longer in the hotel.If you are looking for a room like that described above, have a grat stay, I however would never stay there again. This is the first time I have had written a review on here, even though I have travelled alot...I just hope it saves at least one other person the dissatisfaction of booking a room here, only to be disappointed.
