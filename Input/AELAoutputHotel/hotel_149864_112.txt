{"text":"Even couples will have a good time Reading Club Med Punta Cana reviews on TripAdvisor, the family orientation is strong. I was a little concerned that Punta Cana might be overwhelming for couples. However, we've just returned from six days following Thanksgiving and had a wonderful time. The rooms (suites) are spectacular for those of us habituated to the small, spartan rooms characteristic of Club Med of the past. Television, fridge, balcony, phone, plenty of closet space and air conditioning. As always, you can do as little or as much as you choose. The club is particularly well laid out with most activities very close to one another: eg kayaking, trapeze, pool, weight room, beach volleyball, sailing, windsurfing etc are all very close. As a tennis nut who loved Paradise Island, the tennis program isn't quite at the level that Paradise achieved. There are hard courts and an odd carpet acts as the 'soft' surface. The pros are well intentioned and if you don't meet guests at your level, it's definitely worth paying for a private hitting session or two. Many reviews refer to a long hike from room to the central area. Be warned that if you pay for an 'ocean view', your room will be quite a way from the main action. I did hear that bikes are available if you're faced with too long a walk.The GO's are all well trained, courteous and professional. Punta Cana's MiniClub program demands that the GOs speak French to the kids so many are Canadian or Haitian.Clientele is largely French with a sprinkling of Canadians and Americans. If you don't like the French, don't go. If you're intrigued at the prospect of a different culture, enjoy water sports, the beach and beautiful gardens, and are open to meeting different people, you'll have a wonderful time.And yes, the white chocolate bread is addictive - best kept as dessert.
