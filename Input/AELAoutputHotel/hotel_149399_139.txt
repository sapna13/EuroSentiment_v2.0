{"text":"Excellent resort for everyone I just got back on Sunday, May 25\/08 from the Dominican Republic, Punta Cana where a friend and I travelled to. We went down to stay for our yearly 2 week stay away from all the stresses of everyday life. We stayed at the Occidental Grand Flamenco Punta Cana for 1 week and didn't have a very good time at all. The grounds are beautiful and clean, the staff were amazing especially Cesar and Alexis who were always willing to help with what ever was needed. However we had problems with the dirty public washrooms that always had feces and paper in them and wouldn't flush, there was no water for good parts of the day and we were supposed to have satelitte t.v. and didn't. Both my friend and I ended up sick and I have been to Punta Cana 11 times and my friend 8 times and we have never been sick before. We paid an extra amount of money through Air Transat to be moved to another hotel and we ended up at the MELIA CARIBE TROPICAL which was AMAZING. The grounds are beautiful and clean and the staff are all fantastic. The a la carte restuarants where to die for especially the french Ma Maison and the Gondola Italian. The rooms are comfortable and the beach is well kept. There are trains that run every 15 minutes to take you around the grounds as it is a very large resort but so worth going to. Many activites for the kids like wall climbing, zip line etc... I am booking this resort for Christmas and taking the whole family. I highly recommend this hotel to all groups of travellers. Hope you have a great time if you choose to go to the Melia Caribe Tropical Punta Cana - i luv to travel 28 ","annotations":[]}
