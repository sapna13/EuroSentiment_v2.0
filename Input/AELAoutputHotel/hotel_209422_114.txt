{"text":"Convenient We booked our stay in the Prince Kuhio after leaving another hotel on Oahu for various reasons. Overall, we were very happy with this choice. Our room was recently renovated, attractively decorated and was comfortable. The bathroom was particularly nice. There were however a few drawbacks. I would have liked to have had a bathtub and we were not able to access our balcony because of renovations on the outside of our hotel. It was also quite warm, although we had the airconditioning cranked up, it was not as cool as we would have liked and the hallways were sweltering. Another drawback was the noise - the soundproofing in the rooms is not as it should be and you will hear each and every door on your floor close!The staff was pleasant and helpful, although the bell staff was less than efficient in getting a taxi cab when needed. The restaurant staff was particularly friendly but the food was lousy.With all of this said, if we had to go to Oahu again, we absolutely would stay at the Prince Kuhio again - yes it is very expensive for what it is...Welcome to Hawaii!!! We were in Hawaii on a family vacation so we had the opportunity to compare our room with other family members staying in other hotels. Our room was significantly nicer (and quite a bit cheaper) than that of my sister and brother-in-law who were staying at the Sheraton Moana Surfrider - their room was large but ugly including a clothes line on the wall of their bedroom and an old plastic shower curtain in their bathroom (we had a lovely marble and glass bathroom that was gorgeous). No, it did not have the service and the amenities of the Marriott at Ko'olina but it was also not $450 per night and we had a far more convenient location. All in all, while it is expensive for what it is, for Oahu it is a real bargain!!! After staying in 5 different hotels on 3 different islands in Hawaii, we were most happy with this Hilton.
