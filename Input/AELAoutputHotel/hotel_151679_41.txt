{"text":"Awful experience - find a hostel, even if you're older This was my second experience staying at At Wind Chimes Inn. The first time it was a nice experience but this trip was horrible. Upon contacting the Inn, they apologized but didn't offer to help at all.Here were some of our problems from our stay:-On night one, there was a loud commotion in the lobby and the door across from us. It turned out to be someone dressed like a prostitute demanding money from two men in the room. They argued for over 40 minutes which should have been dealt with by someone in the lobby since our rooms were practically in the lobby.-Hot water √à√\u2020\u2022?we had no hot water in our room throughout the entire stay there. Upon requesting why at the front desk, we were unable to obtain a reason or assistance and were told to shower in the lobby.-Check out- We were not informed of our check out time at any point. Presumably it is because there was no paperwork printed out upon check in as the printer was broken. When we checked out at noon, we found out that we had to pay an extra $20 for the hour (25% of the room rate). -Services\/your service book- after trying to obtain information about church services was next to impossible. The people working the front desk the Sunday we stayed refused to help us other than to say, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√£f it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not in the book then we don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know√à√\u2020\u2022? After some discussion, we tried to attend a service that was listed in their guide book and the church was closed as the service no longer existed. - The one positive I'd say was that their adventure travel recommendation was good. He took us on a great trip to the rain forest and he was reasonably priced.
