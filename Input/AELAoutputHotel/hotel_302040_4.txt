{"text":"Legendary Peninsula Hong Kong! My first recommendation as a Peninsula guest is to pre-book a Rolls Royce transfer upon arrival at Hong Kong Intl Airport. At the arrival gate, you are met by an airport staff who escorts you through immigrations and help you to collect your luggage. What a shame I flew Cathay Pacific√à?√¨s first class and automatically was the first passenger to disembark the Boeing 747...After the baggage claim you are escorted to a Rolls Royce Phantom and you have a 40 minute√à?√¨s ride in absolute luxury, it really sets the tone to your forthcoming stay!When you arrive to the hotel a receptionist greets you at the stairs of the Peninsula and kindly ask you to proceed straight to the elevators for in room check-in, nice and smoothly.I stayed in a Grand Deluxe Harbour View Room in the Peninsula Tower at 14th floor with a stunning view over the harbour and Hong Kong island. The furniture is quite traditional with chinese antiques. The service of the staff is one of the best I have ever experienced on a hotel, in every aspect the staff of Peninsula carry out their duties with a friendly excellence!The Spa is really worth a visit, even though the prices are rather high the environment is luxury beyond belief.However I found two things negative. The breakfast served at the Verandah had very little variety of food, really disappointing. Avoid the Felix bar, it feels really cramp and you have limited view.The location of Peninsula is superb, all major shopping and transportation are a few minutes away.If you want a golden stay in the marvellous city of Hong Kong you should stay at the Peninsula!
