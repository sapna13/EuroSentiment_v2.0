{"text":"Ok, worth what I paid. We just returned from a week long stay at this resort on 9\/24\/06. I have traveled a lot and and here is what I think. This is not a 4 star resort, more like an American 3 star resort. Here is the following:The rooms: we were in block 6 - which is the spa elite club portion of the hotel, if you can upgrade to this part of the resort, it is a good idea. The rooms and bathrooms are better than the standard rooms. It is also located on a quiter part of the resort. The Food: terrible. Good if you want to loose weight while you are on vacation. As a matter of fact, everyone we spoke to felt the same way, so I know it was not just us being picky. The beach: one of the nicest I have seen. If you want to get a hut (which is a good idea as the sun is strong), you need to put your towels on the chairs under the hut very early, do it by 6AM - and be sure to put your towel on all of the chais under the hut, even if you are not using all 4 chairs, or you will be sharing your hut and be unable to move your chair according to the sun. The pools: pretty lame, but really doesn't matter as the beach is so nice, who wants to be at the pool? Entertainment - very lame. don't count on anything great. The person impersonanting Michael Jackson will likely be serving your coffee in the morning for breakfast. Most of the employees do service and enteraintment - need I say more?The people - the Domicians were very nice. We speak fluent in spanish, so I think this helps. I did notice some other reviews before we went about not helping people who only speak english and I do have to say, I did notice this with people who only speak englisth. I don't advise going here unless you can get around with a little spanish. In general: less than 5% were Americans, mostly Spaniards and Itailians. They can be quite rude in my experience, so you just have to ignore it. Topless sun bathing is about 70% on the beach, so if you don't want to see it, don't go here. Also, bring cash. While they say they accept credit cards, they don't everywhere on the resort. None of the stores accepts credit cards and if you want to do any water sports, it cost! Anything over about $75 will only accept cash. Bring your cash as the ATM's only give Peso's. Again, I'm telling you, bring your cash, or you will be dissappointed. If you have a problem - complain to the manager, but don't expect him to keep his appointment. We did complain, and finally he kept his 3rd appointment as the food was so bad. Let him know, he needs to hear it. As we said, the place is really nice, but boy the food stinks. The place would be really good if it had better food. Only he can change it, so either complain about what you are not happy about and let them know what you are happy about or they will never know.Would I go back here? No. But only because there are so many places to see. I got a really good deal on the vacation, if I had paid more, I probably would have been a bit upset with the experience. But for what I paid ($930 for 6 days, all inclusive, including air and everything else), it was worth it (just to give you a gage on price and what it is worth). it was nice, I wish the food was better, I wish they treated the Americans better and took credit cards - if they did, I would say this would be the perfect place!. Buyt hey, no place is perfect. It is an experience to be enjoyed. Last bit of advise - if you go and have the same problems, just drink a lot - it's all included and will make you feel better.
