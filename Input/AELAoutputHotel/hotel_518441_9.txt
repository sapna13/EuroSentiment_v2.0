{"text":"Not as great as expected but OK My husband and I have stayed at the Chedi Hotel in Chingmai and had a good impression of the hotel chain so we decided to stay at the Chedi club for our trip to Bali. The Chedi club is located near the mountain side of the Bali island, which was what we preferred but found out later it is quite far from the Seminyak area (which is the best shopping area in Bali, in my opinion). The hotel room is overall ok but our butler doesnt speak very good English. He did not push us for the activities in the Chedi club like the other review but instead it was quite difficult to communicate with him. The other services were ok, the shuttle car drivers were always nice, but we have to check ahead of time to make sure the cars are available. The birds were very loud in the morning and we cant sleep in! We could also hear people walking by or singing outside our villa--this was not ideal. The bed was comfortable and my husband had no problem getting internet access. The cmplimentary breakfast was very good. Bali has become a very commercial tourist spot overall, some meals we ate outside of the hotel were the same price as New York and London. We did enjoy the John Hardy jewelry workshop--nice price for amazing pieces. Also we very much liked the restaurant Mosaic, located in Ubud. Definitely try the tasting menu.
