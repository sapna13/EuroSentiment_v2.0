{"text":"A great choice for Berlin in a great location We stayed on the first floor of this hotel for a week in August 2008 and found it to be excellent value for the money we paid.Location:The Moevenpick is a modern hotel situated in a fantastic location in Berlin, right next to the Anhalter Bahnhof U-bahn (subway) station. You can also walk to Potsdamer Platz in 10 minutes and connect to many other transportation lines. The neighborhood this hotel is in is very quiet, while still being central. Rooms:The rooms are very modern with adequate space by European standards. The often-mentioned issue of the glass-block-wall bathroom is indeed a concern for anyone who may be uncomfortable being seen (albeit in a fuzzy fashion) while in the bathroom. I can definitely see many people having a problem with this, but I actually enjoy the stylish glass block construction. Beds, sheets, pillows:The beds are adequate, although the mattresses are definitely not as firm or high quality as I like them. Linens were excellent quality and the comforter\/duvet was the best. Bathroom and Shower:While there was plenty of counter space and everything in the bathroom functioned well, my MAJOR complaint and really the only reason I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ give this hotel a perfect score of 5 is that our shower had the lowest water pressure I have encountered in a hotel in the last five years. I could not get any shampoo out of my hair, even with a 30 min rinse. In fact, using a wet towel to wipe soap from one√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ body may be more efficient than attempting to use the trickling water from the shower we had. We were on the first floor, so I cannot imagine that this was a random situation, although I am amazed more reviewers have not noted this problem. Cleanliness: Our room, bathroom and bedding was very clean and all surfaces were cleaned daily. The edges of the room where carpet meets the wall were in fact vacuumed often enough in this particular room, such that the common grime one sees in most hotels was not found at all. I was very pleased with housekeeping.Temperature control:This may be a second problem with the hotel for some guests: The minimum temperature setting is set to 21C, which is 70F. However the room really doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ reach this temperature, which means that for those who are used to cooler temperature settings (ie most Americans) things can get a bit uncomfortable when the city gets hot. However I do applaud all the measures like this that the hotel has taken for energy conservation Internet:No free internet anywhere in the hotel, and no real business center. Internet fees were ridiculously high.Noise: The rooms were relatively quiet relative to those next door, with thick sound-protective doors. However we could hear a child jumping around in the room above us. Additionally, right behind the hotel is currently a huge construction site (Aug 2008) and drilling would start early in the morning and we could definitely hear a lot of noise from the construction in the mornings before we left the hotelRestaurant, lobby and public areas: Very modern and well decorated and clean. Staff: The staff were lovely. Excellent English spoken by all, and every single staff member was supremely professional, always nice, smiling, and helpful. They went out of their way to meet our needs.Avoid in this area:By all means avoid the Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ Stresemann at the corner. Incredibly rude staff (all three people we dealt with in one sitting) with absolutely no interest in clientele, and horrible food.
