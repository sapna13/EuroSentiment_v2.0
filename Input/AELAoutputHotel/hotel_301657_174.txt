{"text":"Strong positive - a few tips Based on the reviews from others on this site we stayed here in early June (07) - and were not disappointed. Not much to add that has not already been said - so I will offer some local pointers for those that would like to stay here: 1. The Limousine Bus from the airport stops and picks up at this hotel which is great. This bus is an excellent way to get to and from the airport - as cabs are very very expensive, and if you have a lot of bags, using the subway can be a challenge. You can easily find the ticket counters @ the airport when you arrive and the hotel will sell you a ticket at the front desk when you depart. 2. This hotel is two quick subway stops from the Tokyo (Tsukiji) Fish Market that is in many guide books. You need to get there very early but it is worth the trip in my mind. Unique and fun. But wear shoes that you are OK getting wet and mucking around in (It is an active fish market - not a tourist attraction). 3. For great sushi try Midori-zushi - remarkably reasonable prices given the quality. Note the sign is not in English but it we found it. It is in Ginza and very close to the Imperial Hotel. Address: Ginza 7-108, Ginza Korida-dori 1F. Open 11am-2, 5-9:30pm dailyWe would stay @ this hotel again on future trips.
