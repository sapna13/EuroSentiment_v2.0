{"text":"sadly...disapponted.. the excellence is beautiful. the people are very nice and the grounds keepers are exceptional. with a few changes it could be excellent.1. no shorts or sleeveless shirts in the restaurants. this was very annoying and my husband hated wearing jeans and pants, with weather that should permit vacationers to relax and wear appropriate summer clothing. i am not saying to walk in with a bikini and bathing suit bottoms, but lets relax!!!!!! friends and i found this very disturbing. we would walk into a restaurant like toscana which is a glorified buffet, excellent food, and my husband and his friends would walk in with lacoste polos and nice dressy shorts around the knee area and they would not let them in. it really made them angry. they need to change that rule. 2. we went on vacation with 4 other couples and the restaurants would not permit us to put nor would they put the tables together, though they were the tables adjacent to eachother. in many cases we did male and female tables, so we wouldn't have to split couples up.. that bothered me more than anything. this policy is very silly and again angered all of us.. i mean, we planned a vacation to share times and dinner together but could not because of some silly rule. i found them to be less than accomodating.3. the food was ok. the best was toscana and chez isabelle, the french rest. barcelona was terrible, they were out of almost all the fish on the menu and said they could not make us coffee because they turned the machines off. the lobster house was mediocre and the asian place had much to be desired.4. getting a drink on the beach was like waiting for a turtle to finish a marathon. i am sure if it was a cash bar more staff would have been assigned to drinks on the beach, not just the bar area and what annoyed me the most was we always left tips, only until friends of ours befriended the waitstaff did we get drinks and service. it really stinks for others. i lay on the beach for three hours to the right of the bar closest to the gazebo and the beds and not one drink..great all inclusive. the best was the pool area near building 1. it was never packed and the bartender always made great drinks. however, never a towel to be found after 10:30 am. overall, the place is cozy and the grounds are beautiful and clean, but this place does not know how to make vacationers relax and be happy, too many ridiculous policies that need to be changed and with a little tweeking it could really be excellent. sadly disappointed!!!!
