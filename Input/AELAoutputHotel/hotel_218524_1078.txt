{"text":"Perfect Vacation We stayed at Excellence Punta Cana from May 26- June 3. We were completely satisfied with everything and thought the trip was FABULOUS.The staff is great. They really care about your needs and want you to have a good time. The servers and hostesses are excellent. Enricque and Kelvin were great. If you see Kelvin, give him a fist pound for us!We never had to wait for dinner or for drinks. Everyone working therewas eager to please. We tipped everyone, but we noticed many people did not. Regardless, everyone got excellent service. Most people spoke English relatively well. We heard a couple complaining to the management about some of the maid's and other staff's inablity to speak English. To these people, I would like to say that you are in a Spanish speaking country. These people are trying to speak a foreign language...give them a break. You dont hear them complain that you cannot speak spanish! Also, there are plenty of hotels in the US that have maids that do not speak fluent English. Have realistic expectations!The entertainment was wonderful. There are activities planned all day and all night if you choose to participate. We were content to hang out on the beach and in the pool, but others seemed to be havinga great time. I cannot imagine being bored. At night, the entertainment staff has a different show planned each day. We loved the Michael Jackson show. It was the best by far. The shows are really entertaining and a good way to spend your night.We also spent a fair amount of time at the Casino. We played poker and black jack and had a great time. We ended up breaking even but had tons of fun. We heard that the Roulette and Keno were the worst games to play if you want to win money, but we thought the black jack and poker tables were fair enough.The food and alcohol was great. The morning breakfast buffet had a large variety of food. If you dont like buffets, one restaurant serves a sitdown meal and room service is always available. The French, Asian, and Mexican restaurants were very good. The meals were all amazing. The food may be slightly different from what you would get at a US restaurant, but it is still outstanding. There are bars everywhere and you have no problem getting most any drink. We also did the couples massage at the beach. It was the best. It wasrelaxing and very romantic. We went on the Outback safari tour that we booked through expedia.com. I recommend waiting until you get there to book your excusions. It makes it WAY easier. We endorse this tour. It was a great way to see the countryside, meet Dominican people, and get a feel of the country out of the resort. Eddie was a great guide.The beach is the nicest i have ever seen. The sand is soft, free of rocks and shells, and a glistening gold color. The water is turquoiseblue. The waves are a bit rough but there was no seaweed or jelly fish. The pools are warm and clean. They are large enough that you can either be around other guests or find an area to be alone. We actually spent the afternoon the upper section of the waterfall pool without a single other person in the water!We have absolutly no complaints about this trip. The people of DR are all very nice and very welcoming. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a romantic getaway. Most people are honeymooners and couples celebrating aniversaries.
