{"text":"Nice hotel, ok staff. The actual hotel is very nice. The rooms were large and clean. The ac was fast and cool and the beds were very comfortable. If your wanting to hang in the West End area this hotel is the perfect location. The West End bars  restaurants are literally right behind this hotel. You can bar hop and walk home to the hotel. very easy.However, the afternoon\/evening staff when we check in Sat. about 4:30pm was very rude. The valet staff was lazy and rude. I walked in to give him my keys and he couldn't even bother to stand up. He stayed sitting in his computer chair and just held his hand out for the keys. No hi, no thank you, nothin. I'm not expecting him to kiss my butt, but I should expect a little more than that since I am paying an extra 20 a day for this valet service. The front desk chick was also pretty helpless. I was told that they would be charging an authorization fee of $180 and it would be pending on my card for at least 4 days maybe a week. I was very upset as I had not been told anything about an auth fee. Then she swiped my card for the auth fee before I told her ok.When we checked out the next morning it was like a 180. The front desk gentleman was VERY nice and helpful. He also informed me that the Authorization fee would only be held on my card until the end of the day at the latest?! I don't know why there was a difference in info but, the evening staff should know what they are talkin about. To some people (meaning me) $180 is not exactly chump change and I need to know for sure how long I will be without my money.AND the older valet gentleman that morning was sooo nice. He was friendly and quick with our car, so unlike the young guy who was working the night before.Overall, based on the hotel rooms we would stay again as they really were very nice rooms for the price. I just wish they would educate and hire better staff for the evening shifts.
