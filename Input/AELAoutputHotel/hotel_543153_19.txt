{"text":"I felt like I was in a playhouse I have been to Barcelona many times in the past few years and this time around, I decided to try Casa Camper. The hotel is by far one of the nicest ones in the city and probably the funkiest. I am sure there are other luxury hotel chains that will give you the feel of a normal hotel but Casa Camper is a different experience. Each room actually has two rooms across the hallway from each other. One is the bedroom and the other one is the hangout room. The colors are bright, there is a huge window for a wall in the back that overlooks in the Casa Camper courtyard. Most of the furniture is the room is trendy (you can also buy it at this famous design store in the city) and functional. The bathroom has an excellent shower and great products, shower gel, shampoo etc. The living room has a huge hammock in it, a couch and a flat screen tv. It is unconventional but if you really think about it, it is a great idea.  At the lobby of the hotel, there is a small restaurant area where you can get some food and snacks 24hours per day. This is included in the prices along with the breakfast. All the people working at Casa Camper were super-friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is very central, just off Las Ramblas close the Plaza Catalunya and it is surprisingly quiet for how close to the action it is. The best thing about Casa Camper is that it feels like home. If, for example, you have been walking around the city for the whole day and you need sometime to relax, it is felt so much more fun to return to the hotel and hang out in the living room where you can take the food upstairs and chill and do not have to be stranded in a standard hotel room. I highly recommended to anybody who likes boutique, trendy hotels that diverge from the normal and expected. ","annotations":[]}
