{"text":"Griya Santrian is a must for any discerning World traveller Confirmation that this hotel is everything that you read in the reviews. The people are very friendly, and really cannot do enough to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as you could wish for.We got a room upgrade when we arrived, and can recommend the Beach Wing rooms. less than 50mts to the pool, another 30mts to the Beach. how lazy do you want to be? oh all right then... the Massage bay with five girls to pamper you is between the rooms and the pool... (The brochure photos of Pool and Beach do not really do the hotel Justice. They are much better when you see them in front of you. The Hotel is also constantly updating and improving facilities, Rooms etc. I am told this by Aussies who were there also, and who go back every year.For Breakfast, I would recommend skipping out to the Mona Lisa restaurant over the road from the entrance. This place is one of the best for food in the resort. The Picadilly Pub is not given a name to do justice to its food and the sporadic entertainments they also put on. Everything is so far above what you expect. Forget the 'Pub' tag, because that is not what it is all about.Taxi and driver can be at your beck and call for the day at a price of less that √ä√£¬¢20 including fuel. (negotiate hard, then add a tip. They like that.Be warned... it is hot in the tropics close to the equator, so don't plan too much jogging and aerobics... The bars will assist you in raising your glass full of Bintang Beer (very good) but if you have a taste for (say) Gin, you will need to go to the hotel Tandjung Sari (go to beach, Turn left, walk about 50mts.(you will soon get the hang of this).I also recommend you take a Jukung boat (Outriggers style Canoe) to the reefs. You probably won't see many fish etc, but the experience and cool breeze is worth it. The boatman will also tell you loads about Bali.Girls... Get you nails done etc by Mary. she is easy to find...go to beach, Turn right, walk about 20mts (you got it yet?). absolutely everything is where you want to find it.Trip into Kuta if you must, but you could do more interesting things with your time...(Another Bintang). Iced Capuccino is pretty good at the Griya Santrian too. They will even bring them to you on the beach.Food is great just about everywhere in Sanur. Cannot really put you off trying just about anywhere to eat. Try the Nasi Goreng, Mie Goreng, and Tom Yang Goom soup, Try Black Rice Pudding and Fried Ice Cream, and you just have to have at least one Arak...Neat.Trips out.... Go by Taxi yourself...You will see more, do more, and return in fair state.Bali Bird Park is very interesting. Pricey maybe, but when you get in there you understand why... can't say more, or I would spoil it for you. There are Komodo Dragons (you will find them...) and there are Geckos absolutely everywhere. Be also aware that Bugs in the tropics are a little bit bigger than those here.....Oh all right.... They are HUGE... but don't worry, you will be fine.Tanah Lot looks impressive, and so does the Sea there, but the memories are of Fruit Bats and enormous Snakes basking in the sun with their Keeper...(next meal perhaps?)Seriously, If Bali is on your 'Must Do' list (and it should be) then the World's number two most popular Island will be a definite high point of your life.Don't expect alcoholic stupours, Kids everywhere screaming, or a rushed, noisy place full of Hi-Tech gadgetry shops, because it is not the costa brava.Go to Bali with an open mind expecting to be pleasantly surprised that EVERYTHING you want in a holiday is there.Start by booking the Griya Santrian as your base, and then come back and confirm that all I have written is the truth.Enjoy, and here's to the next tick on my list.
