{"text":"Hard Rock Hotel Best Choice Me and my two teenage sons booked this through wotif hotel discounts website. We booked for 7 nights and got an upgrade to a delux room from superior via the website. When we arrived we were given a nice room but it wasn't what we imagined - the hotel changed it at once to a similar one right outside the chill out pool which was great. The staff were great, smiley and accommodated our every wish. The breakfast buffet which was included in the price was terrific with everything you could possibly think of on offer. We paid √ä√£¬¢457 or the seven nights which was very good. If you're going to Bali with Teenagers this is most definitely the place. Lots going on in the hotel, lots to do and a band playing every night. Security is very high here although the Hard Rock Cafe open to the public has access to the hotel and I found this the only worry as security was pretty none existent here and anyone could have wandered in through the hotel entrance side. Kuta was the right place for the kids too and we enjoyed the surf and surfing, the great beach and the shopping. We had a driver take us around the island on a couple of days and that was around √ä√£¬¢25 for a 12 hour day - amazing! I loved this hotel and would go back to it again next year if I could afford it! Swimming pool was the best in Bali - massive complex with cabannas, variety of eating places, good food, great entertainment and for those with young children a terrific nursery and activity programme for all ages of children. The rooms are not overly luxurious as say a Stamford but the facilities in the place are great and as I said the staff so friendly and welcoming and helpful. One quibble I'd have would be the internet and its use. The hotel should log who uses it. My son used it and left his details on there, he received an email from someone who had used it after him and it was filthy. I reported it to the manager and I suggested they use a sign in log for anyone using it. I noticed on our last day that nothing had changed. Apart from that though the hotel was totally brill and simply the right choice for us.
