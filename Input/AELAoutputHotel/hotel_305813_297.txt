{"text":"One of my all time favourite hotels I travel a lot for business  the quality of the Hotel makes a big difference to me. I really like the Langham Place and in comparison to the Hotels in HK Island or TST, think it is excellent value. The Hotel is brand spanking new and has a fresh contemporary feel to it without being boutique like. The rooms and facilities are really excellent, the MTR is a short walk so you can be anywhere in the area pretty quickly. I love the service (I think they pay people to stand around  smile !!) and the spa is wonderful (albeit a bit expensive)Only downside is that Mongkok itself is quite run down so apart from the Langham Place mall and the local markets you tend to spend 30 minutes on the MTR or in a Taxi going to the usual haunts like TST or Central.TIPS1) Buy an Octupus card, which is a pre-paid card upon which you load credit, it makes using public transport a breeze !2) Like all Hotels, the breakfast, while good, is expensive. I usually go to the nearby Mall where there is a Delifrance and Starbucks just across the walkway from the Hotel. 3) Taxi drivers don't all have good English  this Hotel seems less well known the some of the other more established ones. So you really need a card from the Hotel concierge with the name written in Chinese characters to ensure you get back !I always try to stay there when in HK  always enjoy the experience.
