{"text":"Great Experience!!! Reading some of these negative reviews, it seems as though we stayed at a different resort altogether...I'm 23, my boyfriend is 29, we stayed at the Bavaro Princess for a week and had an absolutely fantastic time!! As mentioned in some previous reviews, keep in mind that you are travelling to a 3rd world country so obviously things are going to be a lot different if you're not an experienced traveller. That said, it is still definitely a good time. The resort is quite large, with beautiful, well maintained grounds. We stayed in room building 53, room 532, which is right by the buffet restaurant main building. There is also a pool right outside as well which is fantastic. I would really recommend this area (if you are not picky about an ocean view or anything like that) as it is very accessible to all amenities. The walk to the beach from here is only 10 minutes or so and you enjoy all the beauty of resort. Or, if you prefer, the tram is right there too and it will take you straight there - we walked every time and it was great. Our room was impeccably clean and everything worked fine. There were no bugs in it whatsoever and the housekeeping service was fantastic. The water pressure was the same as at home and there was always hot water, not that you really need it, but it was always there and didn't run out. The people at the resort are great, very friendly and always willing to help. Remember that their main language is Spanish, but most of them speak English and French as well. If you have issues with language barriers, what country would this not happen in if you weren't familiar with the local language? Neither my boyfriend or I speak any Spanish but we managed fine since the barternders, waiters\/waitresses, and almost all other hotel staff spoke English.The beach is absoutely beautiful and was always great to be at. It is really busy there from about 10am to 2pm so during that time, it is really hard to find a spot under an umbrella, or even any chairs at all. I would suggest to wait until after 2 when it becomes less busy and you can find a spot to relax. The big pool with the swim (or wade) up bar is right behind the beach and is very relaxing also. Lots of beach chairs and umbrellas around here too but same issues with the time of day. The food is something that lots of people have had issues with and it really is not as bad as some people experienced. The one thing that I would definitely recommend however, is to stay away from any hamburger - whether at the hotel restaurant or the beach\/pool snack bar. They are always pink and you would probably get sick if you ate a whole one. We had a couple undercooked experiences when we ordered them and after a few bites that was it. We didn't get sick from them though, because we were sensible enough not to eat them. Would you eat a pink burger at home? The main buffet at the resort is great, a lot to choose from and very attentive staff. There are also 4 other restaurants to go to on the resort but we didn't try any of them so I can't say anything about that. All in all, it was a fantastic experience and my boyfriend and I both agreed that would take the trip again. I am a very experienced traveller but this was his first trip ever - and he had no complaints. Please don't be scared off by the negative reviews, they are most likely isolated incidents and could happen anywhere. Feel free to email me with any questions at dara_m@telus.net as there is still lots that I can tell you that I haven't included in this review - it was long enough, don't you think?!
