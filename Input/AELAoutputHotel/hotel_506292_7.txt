{"text":"Great hotel but not in Ubud downtown My friend and I stayed at Uma 2 nights last week after a longer stay at Warwick Ibah located in the same area.The room:We had a garden room and it was just perfect. It looked like a private bungalow divided in 2 units: bathroom separated from the bedroom with a patio between. The open air black and white bathroom was astonishing. The bed was perfect and the room was clean and looked quite new.But I also agree with a previous post saying that the sense of space is relative and the private garden in front of the bungalow is very small. I kind of felt surrounded by walls nicely hidden by the vegetation.The hotel and it's staff:The service at the restaurant was 1st class, even a little bit too courteous. The staff at the reception is friendly and helpfull. The pool is nice and quite large. As the number of room is very limited in this hotel, it's never get too crowded or noisy.The location:That is the only problem. The hotel is a good 25 minute walk to monkey road and Ubud Palace wich is quite long because of the heat (and all the holes in the pavement). Don't trust the map on their website: it's quite confusing without a scale.They provide a shuttle service but only 1 every 2 hours and until 5 pm only. Do they do so to push clients having dinner at the hotel? So after 5 pm you need to take a cab and then starts a long negotiation about price as they don't have taximeter there.... We finalely payed 10,000 rupiah to go to Ubud Palace (do go to the dance show there on thursday it's awesome!).If you don't want to go having dinner downtown you can still go to the Mozaic restaurant wich is only a 5 minute walk. That restaurant is really gastronomique but then get ready to digest the note also ;-)Overall:The hotel is so great and the staff so nice that it's still almost a 5\/5 experience to me though they really should increase the frequency of their shuttle and extend that service until the evening.
