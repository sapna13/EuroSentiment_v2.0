{"text":"Harbour Plaza Paradise My wife and I recently spent 3 nights at the Harbour Plaza on our way to Thailand and whilst the weather was unkind to us the hotel certainly made up for it. I booked direct with the hotel via it's website back in September and at the time it was the cheapest way with no upfront payment. About 3 weeks before leaving I saw a cheaper package offered and when I contacted the hotel and explained they were more than happy to match the price! We booked a Harbour Club Harbour view room and we were very pleased with it.The extra cost of the club room is well worth it as it includes Breakfast either in the Club lounge or downstairs in the main breakfast area. ( Two breakfasts alone are nearly as much as the club supplement! ) You then have the advantage of fast track check in and out, Tea  coffee throughout the day and a splendid  Afternoon Tea  from 3 till 6. Then from 6 till 8 you can help your self to pre dinner snacks, wine and beer. The staff were all very helpful and polite and the maid service was twice a day and very proffesional.We did not use the hotel restaurants as they were fairly expensive although we did order room service on our first night as we arrived quite late. The Fish and chips were probably the best we had tasted for quite some time and the cost very reasonable.We used the hotel limo for our airport transfers and whilst a bit more expensive than the mini bus it is a little bit special to be whisked along in a top of the range S class Mercedes with the driver pointing out all the points of interest along the way ( Cost $550HK one way or $1050HK return )As mentioned previously the location is a bit out of the way but that is a bonus to be honest so don't let that put you off. I can honestly say that if I return to HK in the future it will be to stay at the Harbour Plaza.
