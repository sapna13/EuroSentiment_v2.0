{"text":"A fantastic hotel that you wont want to leave... I spent a night here is September 2006. And it was a complete joy. We didn't have a view we had a wall, but we hadn't asked for one. The hotel was clean smart and funky. The room was big with a lovely bathroom continuing Fresh! Toiletries. Although I have noted some negative reviews on here about staff, I found them beyond helpful, just generally made us feel great making the service second to none. The bar is lively with what looked like a post work crowd and I liked that, it didn't feel like a traditional hotel bar. The situation on the quay by the lovely stores and restaurants was a real treat and being opposite the wonderful Boulevard gave the hotel what distance wise was pretty much a second dining option. If your looking for traditional glamour, in an old school Nob Hill hotel no this isn't for you. But if your looking for a boutique hotel with all the service of a 5star resort and very reasonable rates, you wont be disappointed. I would stay there again and again and look forward to my trip back.I stayed at the Lambourne for 4 nights prior to my stay at Vitale and was without doubt the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I see that its no longer on the site? One can only hope the depressed staff got the help they needed and someone decided to put them out of their misery. ","annotations":[]}
