{"text":"Totally Not a 5-star resort This is my first time writing a hotel review. I feel that I owe it to future travelers to let them know what they are getting at this resort, because the information on the hotel website is misleading and not completely accruate. First the good points - the beach is nice and the weather in Punta Cana is beautiful. The beach grill had good seafood.Now the bad points (need much more space for this)1. The rooms are run down and in great need of rennovation. There is mould throughout the bathrooms and ceilings.2. The food at this hotel is mediocre at best. The buffet is comprised of low quality, poorly prepared food. The one good restuarant on property (Chez Palace) is NOT part of the all inclusive. You have to pay $30 US pp to eat there, and although the food was good we didn't think that it was worth the money we spent. Plus at an all inclusive you don't expect to have to pay to eat at the restaurants.3. The alcohol was absolutely horrible - the wine was the worst we have ever tried, and the vodka and beer were not much better. 4. There were no waiters serving drinks around the pool or beach...it was all self-serve. Service was slow and not friendly.5. The servers did not speak hardly any English and the overall attitude was not service oriented. 6. The towels are worn out and in need of replacement.7. The TV's and phones do not work reliably in the rooms.8. The entertainment was poor and there was no disco on site. We were very disappointed with the quality, service and overall experience at this hotel and would not ever stay there again, nor would we recommend it to others. We have stayed at other 5-star resorts in the Dominican and would rate the Barcelo Palace as a 3-star at best.
