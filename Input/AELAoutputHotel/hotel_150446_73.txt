{"text":"Nice, but not great! I enjoyed my stay at the hotel. The pool very nice and the beach was ok. The tide was a little ruff. The cafe was small but the food was excellent. Fair prices considering your at a resort. The waitresses and waiters was all friendly and courteous. The Pina Colada's were excellent.......Waleska made the best. The hotel was a little to quite for me and the casino was small and had out dated slot machines. We stayed in a suite which was nice and clean, but small compared to many suites I have seen. There was no tub, which in my opinion is not a suite. All the suites only had a city view with a very small balcony not big enogh for a small table or chair. And with having a city view suite there is not much privacy because you are on the front entrance side of the hotel and there is alot of traffic in and out of the hotel. There are plenty of places outside the resort to get food at a great price. Not sure of the exact name but I believe it's called Misa Casa ( great food \/great price) which is in th shopping center across the street from resort. There is also a nice small sushi bar about a block up the street that served excellent sushi and the miso soup was to die for. I visited a few other hotels in the immediate area and found the El San Juan was the place to be to hang out on the weekends. All in all it was a good stay, I will return to Puerto Rico but probably will choose another hotel.
