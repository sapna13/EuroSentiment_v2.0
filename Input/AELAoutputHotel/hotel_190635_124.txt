{"text":"Great Location, Beautiful Hotel The hotel at the time and may still be, the tallest building in Spain, well the neighboring Mapfri building is the same height. The location is unbeatable. On the waterfront, a five-star world-class hotel, with almost everything to be expected of it. The room was fantastic. The automatic blackout shades were a great amenity, to block the breathtaking view of the water, city, and the shimmering Frank Geary 'fish' sculpture below... while recovering from jet-lag.The bathroom was in a class of its own. It was nicer than many hotels \/ resorts community spa areas Dining, beaches, discotheques, all 15 floors down, and 50 yards from the front door. The concierges were extremely helpful, with any request. One of the best perks.My only gripe was the security \/ front desk people were rude (condescending) and disrespectful: We were constantly being challenged, as to what we were doing, what were our names, room number etc... I can understand this once or twice. We stood out, American, meager Spanish speaking weak mexican-spanglish at best, and dressed to casual country-club attire standards excluding my flip-flops (unless heading out on the town.) The point is We stood out so I expected them to learn my name, or recognize there is the American with the $12 flip-flops that has been here all week. At ~$1000\/night I expect that courtesy from staff. Which they failed to do, or intentionally did not do (aside from the Concierges and Bar \/ Restaurant staff who were great)It finally became semi-entertaining. Lobby staff, Um, excuse me, may I help you? Me, (continuing to walk towards the elevator) Sure, send up three ice cold aqua's con gas, no wait two con-gas, one no gas, gracias!, it's room 1520Overall a great hotel, I loved it, the slight disrespect aside, I still highly recommend it.
