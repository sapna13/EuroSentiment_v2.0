{"text":"Superb value for money!! Stayed here with friends for two weeks. Absolutely beautiful. Food first class. Staff friendly, helpful and happy. Seven restaurants to chose from, two of which did carry an extra supplement. Too be honest we didn't use these because we were completely satisfied and spoilt for choice with the others.These included Mexican, Dominican, American Diner, Italian and two buffet restaurants. Mike's tea and coffee - An absolute must!! We went every night after dinner for our coffees and believe me there were too many varieties to chose from and certainly too many to list! Mustn't forget the pastries either!! Scrummy!!All in all a holiday that we will never forget.OK! so one bad thing - Timeshare - If anyone reading this, decides to book remember the following - If reception send you to a side desk and you are invited to a VIP breakfast, don't go. It is to try and get you to cut out the middle man and buy holiday time at their hotels. If you miss this, you could get caught by a salesman when going into the buffet restaurant where you will be offered a free massage!! It is another way of trying to get you to give your time (at least 3 hours) to listen to one of their salesmen. It is called H10 Premium and the hotel are part of it and well aware what is going on!! We cottoned on very quickly so politely said 'No thank you' and we also warned others. However, we had a great holiday, this happened on the first day so we were left to enjoy ourselves in peace! Only a minor moan out of a very positive review. Enjoy!
