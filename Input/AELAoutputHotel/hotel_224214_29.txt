{"text":"Safe, Clean and Courteous I needed to find a Manhattan hotel for seven employees (including myself) from Canada. Some only stayed a few days, others needed to stay on for three weeks. Because there was a group of us, I decided to try phoning hotels within a certain radius because the hotel rates listed on websites were astronomical. After two days of phoning I called The Bryant Park Hotel. What a find! Despite it being Fashion Week, they gave us a reasonable price. When I first walked into the Hotel upon arrival I was a little worried because of the nightclub feel of the lobby. Once I saw my room, my fears disappeared. Besides being very stylishly appointed, the room was clean, comfortable, and the bathroom was gorgeous. As it turned out, The Bryant Park hosted several of the fashion functions but that affected our stay very little. We just flashed our hotel keys and were whisked through the crowd at the door toward the elevators. I am a woman and tend to feel nervous staying in hotels alone. Not so at The Bryant Park. I always felt safe. I didn't get a chance to eat dinner at the Koi Restaurant but some of my co-workers did and said it was fabulous food - especially the fish.The hotel has a booming nightclub in the cellar but I never heard a peep from my room. It was nice and quiet. I believe they knew we were working so they put us at the back of the hotel where our only view was the brick wall of a building. However, when one of the fellows wanted to change to street view, that wasn't a problem. Overall a very positive experience.
