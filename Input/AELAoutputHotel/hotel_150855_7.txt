{"text":"Excellent service! Spent the first week of December 2008 at the Riu Taino in Punta Cana. This was our first visit to Punta Cana, and our first vacation with our son who is 18 months old. The service was outstanding! From the moment we checked in, which was very late at night 11ish, and with a baby wired for sound (very hyper), all we wanted was to get to our room and have a quick bite to eat. The check in was amazingly fast, no paperwork to be signed, everything ready to go, with a late night snack waiting for us at one of the bars. Everyday after, I can honestly say that we were treated like gold. Our initial room was a little on the small side and when we inquired if there were any larger rooms available we were instantly moved into a family suite, facing the ocean at no additional cost to us. Riu staff ensured that we had everything that we needed, extra pillows, a crib for Jules and lots of drinkable water. That same service happened at the main buffet restaurant as well. First night we sat in a section, got to know the waiter and the next night the same table was reserved for us, with a high chair and a glass of red wine waiting for me. Loved the service...best I have experienced in all of the Caribbean. Jules was a hit with everyone there too. Dominicans love babies and make sure that the babies are well taken care of. I gave this hotel a 3 star rating because the actual resort is starting to seriously show its age. A lot of the furniture has tears\/rips in the material, and the buildings are somewhat run down. We have stayed in Mexico on numerous occasions, (Puerto Vallarta, Cancun and Cozumel) and the Riu Taino is not a 4 star to me based on what we have experienced in Mexico. With this being our first visit to the Dominican, I am not sure if my expectations were too high, but thought I should share my thoughts. The beds were exceptionally hard...and I like hard beds, so for me to complain is rare! They also did not have room service...a pet peeve and one that would not normally affect me except that to get a cup of coffee first thing in the morning I had to walk from one side of the resort to the other...which on the first couple of days was fine...nice walk, great weather...but by day 4 I really would have liked to have my coffee waiting for me! Call me spoiled, but when I am on vacation I do like an occasional breakfast in bed! Beach was the best of all the properties on that strip. Lovely white sand, with a constant gentle breeze and lots of well established palm trees for cover if you wanted it. Food was fine, no complaints. Lots of choices and plenty of fruit. Did not like the specialty restaurants though, buffet turned out to be better. Not much to do unless you take one of the excursions (you are looking at a cost of 80 - 100 US Dollars per person) and then with us having a baby we were really limited. Again, very different from Mexico where you can leave the resort and head into town and experience all kinds of things for free. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who does not care if they have room service, do not mind the smell of mold and things not looking brand new. If this review were only about the service I would give it a 5, as I can honestly say that this was the best service we have ever received.
