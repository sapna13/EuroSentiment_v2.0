{"text":"En el centro del centro - superbe location and comfortable Spent three nights at the Preciados. The location of the hotel is absolutely excellent if you want to be in the very centre of Madrid. All the monumental places (Gran Via, Palacio Real, Puerta del Sol, Plaza Espana, etc. ) are within walking distance, more or less. Surprisingly, the location is rather quiet, also because the rooms have double windows . The old (around 1900?) building has been completely overhauled and now has extremely modern amenities, the rooms are modern style, clean. The four stars are well deserved. Everything, including bathroom, works very well. However, there is no coffee maker nor ironing board in the room. Bed is very comfortable. Staff is very friendly. Rooms are a bit small. There are rooms facing the street, but also rooms with no outside view (single rooms). There are many light switches, about 20, you have to identify before going to bed. Breakfast is charged separately at 15 euros plus tax, the buffet is mas o menos ok, but sometimes no waiter or waitress around. If you are not hungry and want to save money, there are a few bars in the vicinity that are substantially lower cost. In restaurant there is a smoking zone, but in the cafe section with the television, no smoking. The minibar appears to be free of charge, but we hadn't knew that, what a pity. The reception is helpful, they also arrange taxis e.g. to the airport at regular price. But to conclude, we really enjoyed the sojourn at this hotel.
