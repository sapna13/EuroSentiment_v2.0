{"text":"VERY nice hotel in smelly, untidy neighbourhood Good pointsOur room was great: polished floors, marble bathroom, safe, minibar, comfy bed, quiet air conditioning. The shower worked well and there was always lots of hot water and the water system was very quiet at night. The breakfast is very good: meats, cereal, breads, cakes and many drinks - eat as much as you like. The staff are very friendly and will speak english, if required. You can leave your suitcase(s) at the hotel in a locked room free of charge if you have a late flight. The is a metro nearby with very good access to all the sites of Barcelona.Bad pointsFirst of all, for its star rating, there are no bad points to the hotel: it's truly a great hotel. However, the area around the hotel is very unkempt and smells bad (I'm guessing it's the sewage system).On Friday, you can look forward (???) to the street party 3 - 7 am, yes AM, where the local hooligans play loud music, dance and sing songs for your pleasure...hmmm. Perhaps they'll let you join in.I am not sure how safe the streets are but nothing happened to us and we walked from the metro to the hotel late each night, It's not really that bad...just a bit smelly.Warning:The main cathedral is currently under cover as it is being repaired. Also, the cable cars are out of action.Worth seeing:Sagrada Familia...a newish cathedral that is still being built.The zoological park in the SE...nice zoo. The fortress on top of the hill to the West.Good restaurantsThe Attic on the Rambla (√ä√£¬¢40 for 3-course meal for two) Egypt on the Rambla (√ä√£¬¢16 for 3-course meal for two inc wine)Taxi to airport is 30 EurosTaxi to city centre is about 6 Euros...USE IT and you'll have a wonderful stay.
