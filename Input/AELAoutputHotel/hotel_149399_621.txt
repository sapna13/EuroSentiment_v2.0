{"text":"Royal Service -- The only way to go.... Fantastic trip The Royal Service ( RS ) at the Melia Tropical is the only way to go. We stayed for 10 days and had a super family vacation for 7.We arrived at the airport, paid our $10 for a tourist card each ( which you don't keep for your return flight.....this is different than the Santo Domingo airport ).The Royal Service check in was quick and efficient in the VIP lounge. Our Butler Davis was lame, we saw him only once or twice over the 10 day period. That's a small issue, I can run my own bath.The Gaby club buffet was outstanding for breakfast and lunch. They had a pasta bar, omlete bar, and typically had 3-4 people waiting on our table. Try to sit in Tomas' area in the Gaby club. He's the most efficient and courteous waiter we've ever had. He was always ready with spoons, napkins, or drinks for us. Please ensure you tip the staff, they work so hard and are so courteous and efficient.The bar near the Gaby club was well stocked ( Johnny Walker red and black, Courvassier, Tanqueray, Brugal extra anejo, etc...).Miguel is a very courteous bartender that remembers the folks that tip.We stayed in the Royal Service junior suite, which is very nice, with a very large hot tub ( seats 3-4 adults ). The fold out bed in the living room is uncomfortable for adults, but it was perfect for our young sons.The flat screen TV, comfortable bed, and stocked fridge of beer, water, and sodas was very nice. The room service often took 440 minutes to deliver but was well worth the wait and they served until 11 PM.Transportation: The grounds are very large, and it's best to call the concierge to ask for a pick up by the RS staff. They'll pick you up in a small cart to take you anywhere on the grounds. Riding the train wasn't bad at all either. We'd simply exit at the Caribe lobby and walk over to the RS area.The RS pool is incredible. It includes 2 hot tubs, a swim up bar, and several built in lounge chairs in the pool. The pool is surrounded by several bungalows and large mattresses to relax. The pool grill is fantastic, with an ice cream machine for the kids, and they make BLTs, pizzas, hamburgers, and sandwiches as well.Since we booked with the Royal service, we had no issues getting dinner reservations ( even for as many as 9 people ). The Japanese and French restaurant were the best. The steak and lobster at Ma Maison was outstanding.The kids club is good for kids 6 yrs and older. Younger than that and they just watch your kids in an air conditioned room from 10 - 5 PM. The 6 yrs and older kids go swimming, rock climbing, on a high wire course on site, do face painting, etc... Our 6 yr old son had fun at the kids club.The kid disco at 8:30 every night was fun for the kids to dance on stage with Fred Flinstone. At 9:00 we danced Merengue and Salsa in the bar area to the live music of Cafe con Leche a small local band. The disco isn't worth visiting.The private area on the beach was nice, and efficient. The water was beautiful and warm as was the beach. Our kids loved it.We had a super 40 minute helicopter tour from Prieto Tours. We really enjoyed it.I highly recommend the royal service at the Melia Caribe. The service is outstanding, you don't have the restaraunt reservation hassles, the liquor and food is of higher quality in the RS area, and the living and pool areas are awesome.It's well worth the extra money. We can't wait to return next year.We'll ask for a different butler next year though. ;) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":558,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":554},{"endOffset":558,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":554},{"endOffset":558,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":554},{"endOffset":623,"mention":"pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":618},{"endOffset":734,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":730},{"endOffset":969,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":965},{"endOffset":969,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":965},{"endOffset":969,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":965},{"endOffset":1040,"mention":"Tanqueray","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tanqueray"],"startOffset":1031},{"endOffset":1040,"mention":"Tanqueray","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tanqueray"],"startOffset":1031},{"endOffset":2096,"mention":"ice cream","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ice_cream"],"startOffset":2087},{"endOffset":2145,"mention":"pizzas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":2139},{"endOffset":2157,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":2147},{"endOffset":2157,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":2147},{"endOffset":2173,"mention":"sandwiches","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":2163},{"endOffset":2173,"mention":"sandwiches","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":2163},{"endOffset":2173,"mention":"sandwiches","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":2163},{"endOffset":2415,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2411},{"endOffset":2415,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2411},{"endOffset":2415,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2411},{"endOffset":2583,"mention":"rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rock_candy"],"startOffset":2579},{"endOffset":2583,"mention":"rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rock_candy"],"startOffset":2579},{"endOffset":2812,"mention":"Merengue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Meringue"],"startOffset":2804}]}
