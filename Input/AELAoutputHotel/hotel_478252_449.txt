{"text":"Immaculate Paradise Stayed from November 24 to December 2,2007 and had a fantastic time. A good mix of party crowd and scenic serenity. Nice a'la'carte and decent buffet. Beach was beautiful and activities were pretty good too. Room very nice and spacious however bed was a little hard and pillows a bit flat. Notes and tips help for maid if you want extra beer and water. Overall very nice pools and swim-up bars. Great shopping within resort but be prepared to barter if you shop outside the stores. Staff was very friendly and nightly shows were entertaining. Ok I'm taking over for my hubby now as he seems to think the above paragraph is a very helpful review!!Not sure if it worth upgrading as it didn't seem to make a huge difference, for example - even though our towels (for the pool) were to be placed in our room when the room was cleaned, this only happened one day. We were able to make two additional a la carte reservations however, and the Diamond Club also includes 20 minutes of free internet use daily. Diamond Club also includes access to a private pool which we loved on those mornings we weren't feeling so well! The difference in the room and service between the Diamond Club and other guests was minimal, therefore it would depend on whether an additionl night's reservation ,private pool, and internet access are worth the additional cost. We upgraded when we arrived and for a week it cost us $200. We booked through Sunwing and had a orientation on our first morning. This we found was really useful. Krisha and Ryan went out of there way to help us with questions, offer suggestions when bartering with the locals and recommended the Marinarium day excursion. The Marimarium was great, just a half day which was nice and the snorkeling, swimming with rays and sharks was really fun.A lot of people have written the resort is too big for their liking. I found the resort to be large but not overwheling. We ran in to the same people over and over again and I don't know that would happen if the resort was as huge as people claim. The trolley service was great and they ran all the time, if you miss one another one will be right around the corner. It is only about a 10 minute walk from the beach to the main lobby and the walk really lovely and worth the time. It's important to remeber the resort is split down the middle and is a mirror image of itself. The Punta Cana side has more rooms but a smaller lobby and the Bavaro side has less rooms and a large lobby. Each side has a Japanese and French retaurant, while there are only one of some of the other restaurants. Just use the map - it is useful and easy to read. Try to have all of your money exchanged before you get there. US works best. We had a lot of DR Pesos and tried to get the hotel staff to exchange it to US and they wouldn't. then some shady bellboys asked my husband and our friend to step into the bathroom and offered them a private deal at a terrible rate. Also some of the hotel's shops claimed not to have change after we bought items. Lesson: take a lot of singles so that you lose $.30 rather than $4.30.Remeber to save $20 US each (cash 0 they will not accept credit or debit) for the tourisim tax at the airport for the way home and keep your suitcase BELOW weight. We were overweight when we left Calgary and didn't think anything of it. When it was time to go, you will be charged $10 US for every Kilo you are over. For a couple you are allowed 40 kilos (total) or your checked bags and 10 kilos (total) for carry on items. We had to pay $50. Someone else had to pay $70. All in all we had such a great time. Beach was so beautiful. Volleyball and beach aerobics were great. Lots of topless women which made the men either really happy or really grossed out! Buffet was good in the lobby and also at the beach. Make it to the buffet in the lobby for breakfst before 10:30 or you're s.o.l. until 12:30, however the beacj buffet is always open. Service was fantastic and everyone had a great time. Bahia has many resorts all over the world and we would definitly go back to either Punta Cana or another one of their resorts. Enjoy your stay!
