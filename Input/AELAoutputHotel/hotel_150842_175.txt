{"text":"Great Time My girlfriend and I just returned from the Iberostar Dominicana. Although she has been Punta Cana many times, it was my first trip there and I wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ sure what to expect. HOTEL √à√\u2020\u2022?First and foremost I would say CLEAN, the rooms were very clean and the public areas were also kept clean. There seem to always be someone mopping the marble floors and there was never any trash sitting around. The rooms are very spacious with a semi-private balcony. The courtyards were well maintained with lots of different varieties of plants trees and fountains. The center courtyard was awesome with nice stoned walkways that were well lite at night. The walkways are lined with shrubbery that looks like they trim everyday. Now if you are expecting the Ritz Carlton, this isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ your place. However you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get much better for the money and lets face it, how much time are you expecting to be spending in the room? POOL √à√\u2020\u2022?Again, it was very well maintained and clean. They have ample chairs with cushions and plenty of huts for those who what to stay out of the sun. The only down side to the pool is that they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a swim up to bar. Although there are a few bars located very close to the pool area. BEACH √à√\u2020\u2022?WOW is all that I can say. Again very clean, there were people walking around all the time picking up any trash or glass that were sitting around. Again there was an ample amount of chairs and huts. Although it was a little windy when we were there I would guess and say that the water was about 82 degrees if not warmer. This beach is a top optional beach. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° say that not more than 5% of the women were topless and when they were, it was tastefully done and there wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a lot of gawking.FOOD √à√\u2020\u2022?The buffets offer a wide variety of different foods, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ a picky eater and we had our concerns that I might not find enough food that I like. It turned out not to be a problem. The food wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ the best tasting food I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe ever eaten but it was good enough.EMPLOYEES √à√\u2020\u2022?This was the area that surprised me the most. Every worker we meet always greeted us with a smile and a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≥ola√à√\u2020\u2022? They were very pleasant and very helpful. SOME HELPFUL TIPSThe Iberostar Dominicana and the Iberostar Punta Cana are located across the courtyard from each other. They are the exact mirror image of one another with even the pools being identical. If the one of them is booked the week that you want to go, check the other place, they are both the same. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ forget to bring your insulated mugsGet your chairs at the pool early before you go to breakfast. The pool area fills up fast. Chairs at the beach seemed not to be a problem when we were there. At the end of the day when you turn in your towels, exchange them for towels for the next day instead of towel cards. This will allow you to save the chairs in the morning before breakfast, because the towel place won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be open that early. American items WILL NOT plug into their electrical outlets. Go to Wal*Mart and buy a universal adapter for about $14. The air-conditioning WILL shut off when you open the sliding doors to the balcony. Neither one of us got sick while we were there. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ over stuff yourself when you eat, eat smaller meals because there are places to eat open all the time and you can get a snack whenever you want it. The Dominica Republic is a very low-income area and the workers at these resorts make very little. They live off your tips, a couple of dollars here and there will get you even better service and it means a lot to them. There is no need to take Spanish classes prior to your trip. If you learn a few basic words and greetings you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be fine. Most of the service people speak very good English. If you want to use the safe in your room, just stop by the front desk and ask for a key. They are free. There are hair driers in the room but there isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ an iron.
