{"text":"absolutely heaven We went to Bali for two weeks in June and stayed in 3 different areas. The first please we stayed was at the Komaneka for 5 nights and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to leave. We arrived into Denpasar around 7pm and arrived at the Komaneka around 8.30pm. We were impressed as soon as we got off the coach. The entrance to the lobby was stunning very open and welcoming feeling. The staff were very friendly and efficient. We were offered a seat a wet towel and a welcome drink which was very refreshing. After doing the paper work for checking in we were escorted to our room and the layout of the resort was explained to us. The grounds were immaculate not a leaf out of place. We were shown to our room which is very private almost like a villa, it was stunning. The love heart flower arrangement on the bed was so fantastic that we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to remove it. We were than shown the room layout where the light switches were, the complimentary water, biscuits and fruit. The room had a great bath (including bubble bath) which after a long flight we took advantage of. It would have been around 9.30 10pm and we were still able to order room service and the food not to badly priced. We had a few massages as well and by staying 5 nights we actually had a complimentary 60 minute massage per person heaven. The location is great walking distance the Monkey forest as well as restaurants right outside our door. The only thing that was average was the breakfast but with restaurants almost open 24 hours who is to complain. Nothing could be faulted at the wonderful place. Staff were fantastic including the garden staff who were quiet willing to take our bags from us and help us to our rooms. Will definitely be going back.
