{"text":"Nice business hotel I stayed at Palace Hotel for one night on Dec. 20, 2007. I booked via Leading Hotels (130,00 Euro\/night incl. breakfast) and as a Leaders Club member I got an upgrade to a superior room (ask for this newly refurbished category). The marble bathroom was not refurbished but quite spacy with seperate tube and shower stall and like the room very clean. Plus:- Prompt doorman service and luggage transfer, quick check-in;- greetings from the management, complimentary fruits and a small bottle of red wine in the room,- turn down service;- good quality room service (excellent club sandwich with french fries for reasonably priced 13,00 Euro, nice arranged with flowers and candle lights);- very friendly and personal wake up-call;- excellent buffet breakfast with a wide variety of hot dishes.Minus:- no atmosphere in the lobby (no guests, no music),- the only dinner restaurant first floor is a very formal gourmet restaurant (one of the best in Berlin) with a high end pricing; the bar didn't offer any snacks just cocktails - so one has to use room service (24 hours) or to step outside the hotel,- at departure the doorman didn't take care for a clean accepable taxi so I had to request another one out of the lane (e.g. the doorman at the Berlin Hyatt take care for a good taxi quality and simply sent the dirty old ones away).In summary a good hotel (mainly for business travellers) with good value for money, ideally located in the city center.
