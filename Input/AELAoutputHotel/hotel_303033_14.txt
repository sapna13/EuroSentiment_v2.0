{"text":"A Joanna Lumley of a Hotel Just returned from 10 days at the Ayodya and the hotel fa√ã√©?ade and grounds are nothing if not impressive.But it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a Joanna Lumley of a hotel, the exterior is undoubtedly beautiful with an incredible entrance past those glorious lakes and fountains, and even this is outdone by the beautiful lobby area, and the central lagoon where the herons dive for the fish you feed and the lizards swim alongside them. But this is where it stops. Like the beautiful Miss Lumley, nowadays gorgeous on the surface, but not sure I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° like her in the early morning sunshine.The rooms are shabby, poorly maintained and need a whole new make-over. Showers don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ work properly, (when there is water, only hot properly morning and evening and sometimes switched off) furniture is stained and old, and air con barely copes. (And we were upgraded to a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëeluxe√à√\u2020\u2022?room).In the bars expect VERY high prices, 26,000 rupees for a bottle of water that is 1,500 rupees in the supermarket, we ordered a coke, a beer and a bottle of water, and later that night ate out for four people three courses for the same price as the three drinks. No wonder the bars are empty after the first night. The restaurant food is OK-ish, but again ridiculously high prices not justified by an increase in quality. (Eat anywhere outside the south-gate Mai Mai particularly recommended)Breakfast was a joke, drop a croissant and add to the broken marble they were so hard, and how do you take ALL the taste out of a pineapple? Staff here, unlike the rest of the hotel, were surly and not very helpful. Still the daily omelette helps to bind up any cases of √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√®ali belly√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>Pool area is nice but take goggles, after ten minutes the massive chlorine will have your eyes streaming with tears for a couple of hours. Beach OK, but not safe for children to swim due to very nasty undercurrents with the waves and it gets deep quickly, OK for a strong swimmer but not much else. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat at the beach restaurant next to the hotel, hot and cold running salmonella. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ book any tours on the beach, crazy prices go into town and buy them for at least half the price.Nice try guys, but the hotel needs a complete refit to be given a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬Æould go back√à√\u2020\u2022?and then reduce all the prices by 75% for food and drink and maybe.
