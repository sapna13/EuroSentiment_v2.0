{"text":"I liked it a lot I liked this resort a lot. My wife and I stayed in the I building with a great balcony view of the pool and the ocean.We thought our service was good with at least two daily visits by housekeeping. The refrigerator was stocked daily.There were a robe and slippers for each of us.The evening shows were very good with a live show every night. Most of the other resorts have a live show every other night or less but these shows were not only given on a daily basis but were high energy, lively shows with much dancing by a group of hard working young people. After the evening shows there was a nine piece salsa type band with dancing on the patio adjacent to the theater whcih was a lot of fun. The staff is there to make sure everyone has a partner.The bar staffs were very friendly and could mix anything with a little guidance. The bar stock was not very extensive (no bourbon, no brand names gins or vodkas) but it was okay. Try the mamajuana which is served at most bars and specialty restaurants and is served with a laugh or at least a smile.The food is okay. We found plenty to eat at all times. Not gourmet but satisfactory.The specialty restaurants were good and we rank them in this order: Japanese, Seafood, Italian, Mexican, and Steak House.(With the steak house a distant last place.)Beach, pool and scenery are all outstanding with the grounds crew busy at all times. We were with a group of 11 people whose reviews would vary considerably but my wife and I liked this place a lot and would go back.
