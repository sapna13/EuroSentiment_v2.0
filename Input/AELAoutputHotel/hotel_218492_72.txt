{"text":"Poor upkeep Maintanance and upkeep of the hotel is terrible. The property was sold to us as a 5 star hotel by the tour operator, Sunwing Holidays, but the only thing that was 5 star in the hotel was the size of the rooms. All rooms on the main floor were very moldy. The mold most likely lives in the air conditioning. I had to change rooms twice and although the smell in the last room I stayed at was not as bad as in the previous ones, I could not spend any time in my room, only when I had to go to sleep. Returning home I had to wash all my clothes three times, even those ones I did not wear at the hotel. Most of my clothes still smell bad of mold. Mold is very unhealthy and toxic, it can cause bad migraines or serious lung problems mimicking Tuberculosis, etcWe were not allowed to put our wet bathing suites on the balcony to dry them, we had to leave them in our cold air conditioned rooms. Of course they could not get dry inside the room, they just simply soaked in more mold. It was impossible to adjust the cooling of the air conditioner, so it was either very cold or too hot when we turned it offI asked guest services at the hotel to clean the air conditioning in my room, I do not know if they did it or not, the smell of mold was still prevalent when I checked out.I spoke to guests staying on higher floors, They did not have mold but they lacked water pressure in their room, they could not take showers.I found live cockroaches running around in the bathroomFood was mediocre but the selection was good at the buffet. We were allowed to have dinner 4 times in different restaurants within the resort. 2 of these restaurants were bad. I can recommend only the American Grill or the Di Mario restaurants where the food selection was limited but the servings were tastier than in the main restaurant serving buffet food. Do not eat desert at any of these restaurants though. 90 % of the food is imported, the deserts tasted like card board freshly taken out of the freezer. The worst restaurant is the Aqua which was supposed to serve new, innovative food. Instead, they served stale, dry Italian Focaccia bread, untoasted with a thin slice of cheese and a bite of Prischiuto as one of the 3 entrees on the menu. It was obvious that their chef has never been in Italy There is lots of food going to waste at the buffet (Window) restaurant. After each meal all the untouched buffet food is thrown into the garbage even though the country is very poor with many people starving on the island. The beach is nice but for some reason they cut most of the branches of the palm trees, so there is hardly any shade. I had to get up at 6 a.m. on my vacation every morning to secure lawn chairs with umbrellas on the beach. Do not go to this property in July and August. Since the hotel is owned by a Spanish hotel chain, most guest were from Spain as Europeans take family vacations in July and August. While there were very limited number of people from English speaking countries, they had huge Spanish families. The hotel is catering to kids. There is not much adult entertainment and with the exception of the front office, the staff does not speak English. It was surprising that the host of the evening entertainment program did not speak English either. I have been at other resorts, even 3 star ones in the Dominican Republic where they had much better entertainment and many more bilingual staff.Drink selection was good, they even served imported wine and other alcohol. Landscaping was nice, although during the period I stayed at the hotel there was construction going on at the middle of the resort as well as at the next door hotel. It was impossible to enjoy quiet time on the beach due to the construction noise from both directions ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2126,"mention":"Focaccia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Focaccia"],"startOffset":2118},{"endOffset":2132,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":2127},{"endOffset":2126,"mention":"Focaccia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Focaccia"],"startOffset":2118},{"endOffset":2132,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":2127},{"endOffset":2126,"mention":"Focaccia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Focaccia"],"startOffset":2118},{"endOffset":2132,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":2127},{"endOffset":2161,"mention":"slice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sliced_bread"],"startOffset":2156}]}
