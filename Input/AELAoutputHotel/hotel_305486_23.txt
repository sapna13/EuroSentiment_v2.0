{"text":"Big Rip Off !! We stayed at the Golden Landmark during a short weekend break in Singapore this Aug. The booking was done through their reservations desk via the website - which we thought was smart on our part but little did we know !The bad parts ? - - The reservations did not tell us about an additional tax ( on top of the regular 17%) which was applicable on every night basis- The room was badly maintained - housekeeping did not clean the bathroom on a SINGLE day of the 3 days we spent there, nor were the so called 'complimentary' tea  coffee sachets replaced.My sister ordered room service on the first night, the tray was not cleared till the next day evening...and that too only when we called and complained !- The breakfast was a crime, for the 15SGD you pay for it...and ofcourse, u pay a service charge on that as well ! Actually, there is a service charge on everything, do keep in mind...- On checking out, our bill included an amount for two telephone calls made from our room...during a time we were not even in the hotel ! Had to spend 20mins telling them why we wouldnt pay for it...before they agreed to strike it off..The good parts ?Not enough for me to make points...the location near the MRT I guess ( though we never got around to using it) - though taxis can be quite difficult to get near the entrance...it's a one way street, and most cab drivers did not want to get in...so would drop us off some distance away..Summary - You can get a 100 times better experience in other hotels which cost marginally more...so dont waste your money - unless you dont really mind dirty bathrooms :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":47,"mention":"Landmark","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Landmark_London"],"startOffset":39},{"endOffset":543,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":540},{"endOffset":551,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":545}]}
