{"text":"Recommended - what is there to criticise? I don't know how anyone can knock this hotel. The public areas are smart and stylish, the rooms well equipped, very clean, nicely decorated (we had a lovely bathroom) and a comfortable size. There was also free internet access in the swish foyer! The staff pleasant, efficient and professional- all one should expect really: they are not there to be your friend!In terms of noise, we had had a room on a lower floor above the entrance and yes we could hear traffic when we had the window open but when it was shut, it was barely audible apart from the odd siren (quieter than my London flat anyway!). We were disturbed by another guest outside our room on her mobile but a hotel is not accountable for its guests and it is a hotel not a library after all. I would not describe it as noisy.The best bit though was definitely the breakfast - fantastic choice of food from the buffet such as cold meats, pastries, cereals etc (none of it rationed) as well as freshly cooked dishes (first time I have seen real bacon served by a continental hotel!). It is also served in a very nice conservatory style room.This hotel seems to have its detractors - I can only think they want a 5* hotel at 3* prices. This is definitely the best 3* hotel I have stayed in that I can think of. You can certainly do a lot worse for your money. Recommended!!
