{"text":"Good service and pretty good value, right on the beach My husband and I went to this hotel in May for short trip. We had a good stay.Service: Very good--friendly, and helpful. The front desk people were very polite and efficient. The concierge did a great job of setting us up for a flight to Culebra at the last minute.Food: Also good. The buffet has good Puerto Rican food, including a whole pig every night, and in the lounge the churrasco skirt steak is fantastic. Room service was good for breakfast, accomodating and fast. The coffee is good at this hotel.Casino: Kind of dreary and small. Rooms: Not luxurious, but clean with good linens and toiletries. Our room had none of the mold or musty odors that other complained of, but the hallway did. It's a tropical environment, so I doubt this is a sign of poor upkeep. Housecleaning was more friendly than in most places.The pool and beach areas: Very nice. In May, there were no crowds. Plenty of chairs and umbrellas, plus hammocks. The have a towel attendent. They swim-up bar is fun and the bartenders are good. They have a hot tub, too. We ventured out into a few areas ,and this info might be useful:1.) San Juan is very much like being in the mainland U.S (except the people are friendlier and the service is better). Everyone speaks English. Most of the stores and restaurant chains are ones Americans go to at home. At some point, we got a little bored! If you want a change of scenery, check out Culebra island. It's a quiet little island with an amazing beach. We went at the urging of a couple of locals and it was worth the trip in a tiny airplane! It defintely made us feel like we got away from it all. The flights are cheap (100 round trip) and lodging on the island is available for under 100 also. If you go, though, apply bug spray and sunscreen before you get on the airplane (we wish we had).The concierge can set this up.2.) In Old San Juan, if you want good food, go where the locals are eating. In the afternoon, business people and police officers go out for lunch; follow their lead. We found this was the best way to get good local food at reasonable prices. If you want to have a nice meal at an American restaurant, skip Ruth's Chris; the food was not as good as in the States. BLT Steak in the Ritz was fantastic. We ate there twice. The bartenders and sommelier were very good to us.
