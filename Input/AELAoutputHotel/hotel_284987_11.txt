{"text":"Dishonest, Terrible Service This hotel is very beautiful, but the service was the worst I have ever experienced. It took 1 1\/2 hours to check in! Even after this length of time, one of the couples went to their room only to find it preoccupied. Had to go back to the office for another hour to get it straightened out. Next morning check-out took 1 hour. The desk said that we had only paid for two rooms and owed for a third room. We had booked online, but they said they had no record of an online booking. With duplicate paperwork (which they took at check-in) we were able to prove we had paid for 3 rooms. They said they would not charge us for the 3rd room, but When I arrived home from our vacation, they had charged my credit card I had used for incidentals over $700 in unlawful charges. These charges on my credit card were placed without authorization or my signature. I contacted them, and it literally took 3 full days to get it straightened out. Wells Fargo said that these charges were all done illegally because they did not contain a reference number. The hotels explanation was: Someone by a name similar to yours came and checked in a week later, and we accidently charged the wrong credit card. The funny thing is...they didn't have my credit card at all when supposedly this other couple checked in. I had to cancel my credit card because I was afraid they would keep charging it. What a scary Situation. We will NEVER stay there again! We feel they are disgusting and dishonest in everyway. ","annotations":[]}
