{"text":"PCP The Place to be--Judi fron NJ Returned home May 5 from the Punta Cana Princess-- What can i say, It was a very nice, relaxing and fun vacation. The resort is very nice, totally clean at all times and very, very friendly. I am from New Jersey and very hard to please--but I have really NO complaints. Arrived on sat 4\/29 at 1pm and was able to check in right away. Went with the VIP plan--which was worth the extra $$. The 20 minute free massage alone covered the extra cost. The beach is absolutely gorgeous-and extremly clean. There are sun beds for VIP only and let me say that made my vacation-they are clean and comfortable and enough for all. The pool area is well equipped with chairs and shade huts. Many other reviews that I read complained about the food-Myself and friends thought that the food was good-of course there were a few things that we did not enjoy, but there was always something else to eat. Dinners at the restaurants were very good, my favorite was the italian restaurant at the PCP. Chicken Parm excellent!!The staff could not be more accomadating, always friendly and and sweet!! The best bar is in the lobby with Emilio, he works the 3pm to 11pm shift, great personality and lots of fun.The only thing i would have liked to see was alittle more music in english-mostly spanish playing all the time-but you do get used to it. The animation crew really tries to bring entertainment to you all day and night, but to no avail-not there fault-most people want to just relax.I would reccomened this hotel to anyone-LOVED IT -will return!!p.s. if you can try and fit a noodle or a blow up float in your suitcase(deflated of course)do so, good to have for both the pool and ocean.
