{"text":"Lovely Stay at Hotel Alessandra My husband and I stayed at Hotel Alessandra for two evenings at the end of September. We can only rave about the hotel staff and their ability to answer all of questions and make our stay in Florence memorable. The front desk staff spoke English very well, which helped since we do not speak Italian. Monte, one of the hotel staff, was so funny and made every encounter a pleasure.Our room was very spacious. We had a bathroom inside the room, which had both a shower and a bath. The bathroom was a good size. We had a TV available for catching up on news. Breakfast was offered every morning. There was a nice array of rolls, fruits, cereals, and coffee. The hotel has internet access available for a small fee. The hotel is in a very convenient location on a side street. We would have rated the hotel a 5; however, we did have some problems with the noise. Our room was located on the same floor as the front desk. So, in the morning (around 5 am) when the staff were beginning to prepare for breakfast, we heard a lot of noise. We also were at points disturbed by the noise outside by cars and people on the street outside the hotel. We would recommend bringing ear plugs (just in case). Despite the noise we were able to fall asleep, but it was noticeable. We did not bring this issue up to the hotel staff as we were able to fall asleep. It is just something we think people should be aware of.Given the cleanliness of the room, the friendly hotel staff, and the convenient location, we definitely recommend this hotel. However, do bring ear plugs (just in case).
