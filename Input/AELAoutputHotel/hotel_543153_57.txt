{"text":"Funky, Finesse, Fabulous Stayed at this funky little hotel in September 2007. Casa Camper has very own unique character and from this extends a cool culture that is unforgettable. The Hotel is fantastically located just off the main Ramblas in a small street - somehow Taxis manage to get you right to the door and that's where the staff come into their own. I have stayed at hundreds of hotels over the years both for business and pleasure, but I have yet to find a more personal, attentive and professional team than those at Casa Camper. These guys seem to enjoy every moment of their work and they treat every customer as an individual. The hotel is quirky both in its rooms and in its set up. I managed to book a suite which was excellent with a good sized bathroom, a large bedroom and a leisure area\/come lounge with a LCD TV and Hammock etc. I checked out the normal rooms too and they were just as cool. The difference between the two being that you have a lounge room across the corridor from your bedroom in the standard rooms.Casa Campers quirkiness extends to snacks 24\/7 and for me the coolest branding feature which were the Camper styled bicycles. We rented these wooden (yes wooden) bikes and cycled the whole length of the promenade along the beach. Too say it made people stare was an understatement, but what a way to get around Barcelona.In some respect these bicycles summed up the whole Casa Camper experience for me. Reliable, eye-catching, unforgettable, quirky, quality and fun in a city that is lovely. I heard we can expect a Casa Camper in Berlin next.
