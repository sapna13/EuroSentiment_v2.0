{"text":"Great Experience at the Park Hyatt I stayed at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo for 6 nights with my boyfriend in the middle of April. Our room was on the 48th floor and had gorgeous views out over Shinjuku. The room was VERY large, and the bathroom was true decadence. The toilets (I know they've been mentioned in reviews before!) were soooo cool, and the shower was on of the 2 best we had in the country.( The other runner-up was at the Hyatt Regency in Kyoto, so go figure!) The staff bent over backward to assist us in any way they could, from extra towels to strawberries, from hangers to a Korean Barbeque grill-it yourself hibachi style recommendations. The location from Shinjuku Station was a little bit of a hike (I know this has been mentioned before as well), but the shuttle van driver was so funny at the Park Hyatt we rather enjoyed having him take us the short jaunt down to the L-tower. When we did walk to East Shinjuku, it was easy enough. Tocho-Mae Station is a bit closer to the hotel, and when we'd come home on the subway, we'd sometimes exit at Nishi-Shinjuku, too. That cut off a few minutes from the walk as well.We ate at the New York Grill our first night, and although I enjoyed my steak and caesar salad, I don't necessarily thing they were worth the extravagant prices. My boyfriend ordered a side of the duck fat french fries which were the highlight of the meal. The pool was fantastic, with great views and complimentary goggles - they're open until 10pm, so it's good to go later at night when no one else is there except the attendant.All in all, this was a wonderful experience. We enjoyed the Park Hyatt immensely and if ever in Tokyo again, would DEFINITELY stay there again.
