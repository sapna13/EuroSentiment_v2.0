{"text":"What a great hotel....Loved it. We are making a regular thing of going to Germany to visit the Christmas Markets. Last year, Cologne, this year Berlin. We love the whole gluhwein, street entertainment, Christmassy ideas, so duly booked we arrived in Berlin on 24\/11\/06.Yes, we got it wrong!! The markets in Berlin did not officially start until 27\/11\/06 so we were a bit bothered that Berlin would have little to offer us for the 3 day duration. How wrong we were. Berlin is fantastic, so too is the Hilton Berlin hotel. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left we all agree that we felt very welcome and that nothing was too much trouble. We were very happy with our rooms overlooking the Gendarmenmarkt - indeed we could see the Christmas market being set up- we thought the bathrooms were spot on and although the rooms themselves could do with a tiny bit of a makeover they were very comfortable and spotless.Breakfast was too die for. We sat for 2 hours enjoying the food and the company. On the Sunday we were treated to speciality coffees by a management trainee who seemed very eager to please us (Or everyone)The situation of the hotel is perfect. We walked everywhere but appreciated that if we need to go further afield the u-bahn station was right outside the door.Berlin is brill! Loads to see. The Reichstag building is stunning (and free). History surrounds you and you cannot help but become immersed in it - that surprised me, I learnt more in one weekend than any number of history lessons at school.To go back after a long day of sight seeing, good eating and drinking to the Hilton Berlin was the icing on the cake...Great.
