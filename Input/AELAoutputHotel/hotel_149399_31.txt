{"text":"Royal Service is excellent, but off season is a little dull We stayed at the Melia Caribe from the 9th-23rd October for our honeymoon. We had booked the Royal Service (an extra √ä√£¬¢500 each on top of the √ä√£¬¢900 standard cost, so a total of √ä√£¬¢2800) and I definately recommend it.The RS rooms are amazing. Massive with two TV's, a stereo, free internet connection for your laptop, large freezer which is restocked every day with juice, 7up, pepsi, water and beer(!), a luxery shower and massive jacuzzi right next to your bed which could sit four people at a push!The Gabi club (Royal Service) restaurant was great and the private pool area is great too. The staff are all fantastic and service was second to none. In fact, I don't think you could fault R.S on anything.Being out of season the hotel was very quiet, and a number of restaurants and a couple of the bars were closed which was a bit annoying, but nothing major. The evenings were a but dull too as the entertainment consisted of a show lasting about 20-30 minutes of variable quality depending on the night, and there is usually someone playing live music in the lobby bar area. Besides that, not a lot. The onsite disco was dead. However once a week there is a party on the beach (ask at reception for the day, usually Wednesday or Thursday) which was pretty fun.Overall, we found food in the RS very good indeed, and the a-la cartes were OK (the French restaurant especially had good food) but I would advise staying away from the chicken, as I became ill on our second day, and numerous people we met (including leesgal below!) also had stomach complaints while we were there.Also, you WILL get harassed by staff onsite trying to sell you the Sol Melia Vacation Club. If you go to their presentation (which lasts a couple hours) you will get a voucher for $50 to use in the hotel shop\/casino or at the local mall. It was nice to get the voucher, but unless you have a lot of money the presentation will be a waste of time, and you'll get harassed until you go.Overall, the resort is very good for the price. We went to Seyona Island, Santo Domingo and went on the Caribbean Festival which are all great. In season, I imagine the hotel to be a great and lively place, but out of season its very quiet, which is fine if you like that sort of thing, but my wife and I are around 30 and enjoy a bit of nightlife! Aside from that and the slight issue about food, it's a great place.I'm compiling a couple videos this week of clips from the hotel, so check my videos (I am uphoriak on youtube.com if you search for my username) and you will be able to see more.
