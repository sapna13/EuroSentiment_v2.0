{"text":"Great Resort! My wife and I visited the Excellence Punta Cana 5\/4\/08 - 5\/11\/08 for our 6th year anniversary.From the initial booking of the trip to the very end we were very impressed with the level of service and hospitality that all of the employees showed to us.When we arrived at the Punta Cana airport we were greeted by our taxi driver. Our taxi was actually an upscale Toyota Hylander which was a great vehicle to travel in especially since the roads are so bumpy. Just like other reviews stated, you do go through some pretty poor areas but nothing like I have seen in the Congo and Rwanda in Africa.We felt that the food was great. I have seen a lot of reviews that stated otherwise but after futher investigation of these reviews I realized that most of them were from people that lived in New York City. Granted, the food is not New York City grade but its amazing food.Our room was lovely. They knew that it was our anniversary so one day when we got back to the room the bathtub was full of rose pettles and bubble bath. Our room was a swim up room which was really nice.Most days we just slept around the pool on the king size beds that were available or on the beach. The beds by the pool we thought were best because you are protected from the wind that the beach exposes you to.All in all, it was a great resort and we would go back again! ","annotations":[]}
