{"text":"TRULY BEAUTIFUL - EXCELLENT TIME We have just returned from a trip to the GP Punta Cana booked through First Choice Holidays.Few pointers before I waffle on about the Hotel.1.Dont pay for Premier Seats - book extra leg room you get more than them up front and at √ä√£¬¢30 pp bargain. Yes you pay for coffee, snacks etc - but for an extra √ä√£¬¢300 pp not worth it. 2. Jnr Suite through First Choice states sea view - our rep told us it was not guaranteed and not in this yrs brochure ( I had copy of last yrs) It is in this yrs and we complained when we had rm allocated over the pool. Max was excellent and we were moved to proper Jnr Suite with sea view, if you dont ask you dont get.3.You have to play the towel game - sad but very true -we never thought we would resort to it but my husband got up early every day to put the towels out and get a shade by the pool. Even heard that guests were paying pool guy with $ and beer to reserve them and also we saw lots of towels out late at night.It is sad but its true.4.Take US Dollars one of our friends was advised local currency and his exchange rate once there was awful - better to start with dollars in the beginning as the rate for us is good at the moment.So the hotel.GROUNDS\/POOLSBeautiful grounds kept immaculately tidy and very clean everywhere. Pools lovely few floating mossies but nothing to worry about. Beach is superb and very windy so watch the sunburn - we preferred the pool set in the middle of the villas.FOODAll very good - we have a la carte in Bambu - excellent, Steakhouse - not so good, Italian - good service and food.Buffets - ate mostly in these as the choice and quality was brilliant - lovely salads, grills and pasta stations. Cathedral Buffet has most choice but we found it large and no atmosphere.Saw a few fights over tables - people not turning over the card to red and 8 o'clockish a little bit of a hunt for a table - but we tended to eat earlier so it wasnt a problem.Grill on the beach was cold and burgers had been sat there for half an hour - go to the buffet instead for fresher food.ROOMRm 2132 jnr Suite on end of Block 2000 overlooking sea from 2 windows. Good quality of fittings- kept very clean- we tipped every day as mentioned by other reviewers. Balcony overlooked the pathway and toilet block\/La Uva restaurant and didnt get much sun - but we were outside most of the time. BBC America disappeared halfway through holiday and with no english papers available felt we werent in touch but it didnt matter too much. STAFFOn the whole excellent - pool bar staff great fun and good service. Restaurant staff hit and miss but not in anyway awful - they just seemed a bit fed up some days. They work very hard and generally we found them good in all the a la cartes.Breakfast seemed the worst time for them - and with the lack of coffee cups and all the relaying of tables - some infact were really quite rude to us. EXCURSIONS\/EXTRASHelidosa trip over the hotel and down the coast $109 pp for 20 mins - absolutely excellent.Saona Island $90 pp very long day - at least 2 and half hours on coach but once we were on the water - very good. Catamaran there and speedboat back, chap videoed all day and laughed like a madman started to drive us a bit mad ourselves $30 for video but we didnt bother.Spa Massage - on beach $55 excellent hour of relaxation. Visited the new building but only went inside on 2nd to last day. Lovely really swish and good prices - still finishing building it but most of it up and running - beautiful.ENTERTAINMENTPretty basic to say the least. Went to one show and didnt bother again - lots of light music around the lobby and bars during the evening which was nice. Markets stalls with jewellery and art some evenings - a bit pressurising but OK. Casino most nights playing slots for an hour after dinner- staff very good and pleasant.BAD BITSI didnt realise it was so Hispanic - not a problem - but I had been dreaming of steel drums for 6 months only to find merengue pumping out of every speaker !!! Not really a negativeOVERALLExcellent holiday - value for money brilliant and we would go again. Possibly same area but try another hotel - I will have to start checking the reviews !!!!!Happy to answer any questions - photos to follow.
