{"text":"Loved this hotel! We stayed at the Hotel Duquesne from June 8-16, 2007 and we couldn't have been happier. Julie, Amandine, Allain and the rest of the staff were so friendly and helpful. The superior room we booked (Room 44) was very spacious, clean and comfortable. We enjoyed opening up the wonderful french door-style windows and gazing out at the Eiffel Tower from our room. We also enjoyed sitting at the cafe tables outside the hotel watching the ET sparkle every evening. We changed our money at the hotel for a good rate and no fee. The staff booked tours and airport shuttle for us, answered every question we had and the large bathroom with tub and shower as well as fresh towels and face cloths each day were a luxury that not all European hotels provide. Wifi internet worked smoothly on my laptop and they also have a computer in the lobby for patrons to use. Many cafes, restaurants (Thai nextdoor was excellent!), boulangeries, Shopi grocery store, fruit stands, Invalides gardens (perfect place to eat strawberry tarts and eclairs chocolat for breakfast in the mornings) are all within a couple of blocks from the hotel. We also enjoyed the breakfast downstairs in a lovely setting and even tho some commented that it was expensive, it was far and above your usual continental breakfast since they served buffet style scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, all types of breads, croissants, pastries, jams, yogurt, cereals, coffee, tea, juices, et. We will definitely return and stay at this hotel again! (soon hopefully!)
