{"text":"Good Place, with suggestions This is a quiet, very comfortable place to stay in a notoriously expensive and noisy city. Best rates are on the hotel's website (we prepaid $159 per night for bed and breakfast, plus an additional $19.22 per night in taxes), and we would stay there again in a flash. The hotel is soundproof and the location is perfect, only steps away from the Bush\/Powell intersection and an easy jaunt to all of downtown. The California street Cable Car line is two blocks up Nob Hill; Market Street is five short blocks south. We didn't have a car, but the hotel offers in-and-out valet parking for $38 per night, a pretty good rate considering you are in the heart of The City.Dinner in the hotel's restaurant, Daffodil's, was only so-so however; husband's flatiron steak was superb, but my pork tenderloin entree was dry and tasteless, very overcooked. The waitress said the chef prefers to serve the pork rare, probably because he has never heard of trichinosis and has no idea how easy it is to cook a pork tenderloin to non-pink, tender perfection. Whatever, I suggest you select something else from what seemed to be a relatively limited, somewhat precocious menu. Be aware that there are tiny, easily overlooked coupons at the far end of the reception desk that knock $20 off your dinner bill. The restaurant didn't seem very busy on any of the three nights we were in residence; perhaps the management should put one of those $20 coupons in with the room key at check-in. The European-style breakfast buffet was more than adequate and included juices, cold cuts, cheese, tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, assorted cereals (with yogurt available), a variety of fruit, delicious croissants and muffins, bread and bagels for toasting, teas, coffee, and so on. Hot breakfasts were available at an extra charge.We had the San Francisco Chronicle outside our door every morning, and both USA Today and the Wall Street Journal were also complimentary at the front desk.The room had free wireless, and the bathroom was large and well appointed with good linens. Shower\/Tub was clean with excellent water pressure. Little noise transferred from adjacent rooms. The in-room coffee was not memorable. Elevators were prompt and swift.The beds are cloud-like, almost too much so. After an uncomfortably hot first night alternating between the too hot duvet and too cold sheet as a cover, we requested a regular blanket rather than the fluffy duvet -- problem solved. The huge pillows are deep and fluffy, nice if that's want you like but miserable if you prefer something smaller and firmer. A selection of pillows amid the six on the bed would have been much appreciated.The decor is very tailored with extremely nice furnishings, and the staff was highly professional and pleasant. All in all, the Orchard proved to be ideal for our all-too-short stay in SF.
