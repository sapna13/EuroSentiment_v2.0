{"text":"Great Time! But tainted holiday! My friend  I stayed here 22 Jan til 5 Feb. The resort is lovely, room excellent, food ok, beach lovely, weather fantastic 85 degrees every day!We only had one problem with our room one day where the toilet flush handle broke, we told reception before breakfast and when we got back to the room it was all repaired. Buffet food is good the first week and then it does get repetitive. We ate at the Italian quite a few times, best pizza I've ever tasted!! At the Chinese the service was so slow that we only had our starter and looking around most people had left their main courses so we left and finished off at the buffet.The beach is lovely and we spent nearly all day there every day. The sea is lovely and clear, when its not too choppy - but great fun going out on the kyaks in the waves!!The shacks at either end of the beach where you can buy souvenirs are quite pricey even when they pester you to come in if you walk past.....cheapy cheapy I give you good price....but not cheap enough!!The only thing that has tainted this holiday for both of us is that we picked up an intestinal parasite while there. We both had two bouts of diahorrea for four days at a time and since being back have both been off sick from work for two weeks with really bad sickness and diahorrea - I even ended up in hospital I was so bad. Environmental Health Officers say with the incubation period that we caught it as soon as we got to the resort. This parasite apparently is the hardest to get rid of and will stay with us for years and years with reoccurences. So a nice reminder of our holiday in the years to come!!! Just beware if you do go to this resort.
