{"text":"Aweful - Terrible Beds Caused me Severe Back Pain, Ruined My Tirp to Florence I have bad back problems, so I tend to stay in higher class hotels to be assured I will receive an adequate bed. Seeing the Hotel Aprile was a 4-star hotel, was rather expensive, and got good reviews we thought it was a safe bet. WRONG.The beds sagged in the middle and were terribly lumpy. Worse, we could actually feel bits of metal poking through the top of the mattress. I was afraid I would need a tetanus shot after sleeping there. I asked to change rooms, but the clerk told us that was not allowed.Neither of us slept at all that night. The next morning, I felt like I had been beaten with rocks. My lower back was injured as a result of the saggy mattress and I was unable to stand upright. As such, I couldn't go to any museums or walk around and see Florence. This hotel literally ruined my trip to Florence as we had to leave early. To make matters worse, we were also charged for the extra night.The hotel itself was OK. It was kind of cute, but for $200USD\/night I expected a lot more. No internet in the room either. It was clean. The staff was terribly unhelpful. Aweful. On top of the $400 in room fees, I will probably have to pay many hundreds more to the chiropractor and physical therapist to undo the damage this rotten place caused. AVOID. ","annotations":[]}
