{"text":"Paradise Arrived at the Bambu and was amazed at how beautiful it is...fantastic gardens, beautiful buildings and great pools. It is in an ideal location of being right on the Punta Cana beach.I really rate this hotel if you are looking for luxury, a romantic holiday, relaxation yet the opportunity to do water sports snorkelling etc. (All included! :o) )Everyone seems to complain about the food yet you are in the Carribean- it is the third world!! There was always plenty to choose from in the buffet- some of the food may seem a bit manky but there is always plenty to choose from. The best thing about the food is that they do theme nights. Mexican night was fab. The staff were dressed up- fruit displays were fab and the food was delicious.We didnt manage to book into the restaurants which was a shame as we left it too late but they looked great. We did plenty of trips which arent cheap but are well worth it. Eg- Monster truck, dolphin encounter, etc. If you dont do the trips there is plenty to do by the pool, eg aerobics and sports.The pool bar was fab. Amazing smoothies. The entertainment was good. Lots of shows and games.During our stay, I got very sick for a few days. This could be down to the tap water- such as brushing teeth. So do be careful! The illness completely wiped me out and I was on the toilet alot! I recovered though! The rooms are lovely and luxiourious so it was ok place to be ill in. The mini-bar was fantastic as it got replenished. The bottles of REAL coke were a highlight as I needed a sugar rush when I was ill as I felt so dizzy and wiped out.Staff were very motivating and so incredibly hardworking.Overall a brilliant trip. Remember you're in the third world when it comes to water and food. Beautiful beaches!!! Have an amazing trip and remember that life is for living xxx ","annotations":[{"endOffset":931,"mention":"Monster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Monster_Energy"],"startOffset":924},{"endOffset":1497,"mention":"coke","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola"],"startOffset":1493}]}
