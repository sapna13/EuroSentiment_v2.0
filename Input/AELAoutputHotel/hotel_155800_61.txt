{"text":"Better than expected Hotel selected by my organization for a convention. I had read reviews that rated the hotel from great to terrible. I was pleased to find that my stay, even though the weather wasn't the best was enjoyable. My room was clean, light and airy, a little stark, think they were going for a beachy thing, some of my fellow attendees didn't like the fact that there was no carpet on the floor, the pools and beach were beautiful, there is a downside however, the hotel hosts many parties and the night club goes all night, friends who had rooms over the lobby and bar area had trouble sleeping because of the loud music, they have earplugs in the room. I was in an area where I did not hear the music at night, but guests tend to return to their rooms at 6:00 am. I traavel a lot and was disapointed that there were no coffee pots in the rooms also I am a smoker so I had to walk to the beach in the morning to smoke as it is not allowed on the grounds, the beach is public. The bar and resturants prices are high, 7.00 for a beer 12 for a cocktail the little Italian restuant is the cheapest or the pool bar, however there are places close by that are good and more moderatly priced, we spent time at Lupis and the Metropol, both an easy walk hotel staff were very helpful in answering questions about places to go ,very friendly .
