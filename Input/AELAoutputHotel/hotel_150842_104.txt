{"text":"Very Impressed After visiting Mexico for 7 straight years, our group (11 this year) decided to venture into the Dominican Republic. Nine of us stayed the the Dominicana, two stayed the the Punta Cana Iberostar. Even though were were in two different hotels, you couldn't tell the difference, the grounds connected and were close enough that we didn't have any difficulty whatsoever finding each other. All of us were impressed with Iberostar, the, grounds, food, beach and the staff. Nothing to complain about at all, lots to recommend. There was a good variety of food and we didn't have many problems making reservations at the sit down resturants. The Mexican speciality restaurant and Japanese were by far the best.There was only one night where the steak house could not accomidate all of us at once, no big deal we split up and experienced two different restrauants that night.The beach was perfect.... Beach bar close by, buffet and ice cream stand right there on the beach(loved the rum  raisin ice cream), and occasionally they cooked on the beach. It was a little piece of Paridise! The casion was small but fun, don't plan on winning, just look at it as entertainmentDrawback. After taking a shuttle from the airport to the hotel we all decided that we didn't think it was a very good idea to venture out into the community. It was a very depressed, and depressing, area. No traffic control devices, dirty with litter all around, and overall not a place were we would feel comfortable, and we are a pretty ventursome group that normally visits and shops in the communities we are visiting. Oh well, at least we came home well rested for a change :) However, I am glad we tried something different and have no regrets.
