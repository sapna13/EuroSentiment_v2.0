{"text":"Handy location, nice staff...celebrity spotting :-) My husband and I, along with our 2 neices and 2 children stayed in this hotel for 6 nights as part of our family trip to California, we had been at the Disneyland Hotel for 6 nights prior to arriving in Hollywood...see seperate review.We booked an executive king and a standard room with 2 doubles and requested connecting rooms and a roll away bed. All of our requests were met. The hotel is located atop of the Highland center with an array of shops, cafes, cinemas and restaurants to explore....fabulous spot.We were checked in efficiently and with a smile and told about the concierge floor offering breakfast for a $30 charge per room extra. We thought this great value and accepted this offer. Breakfast varied each day but there was cereal, fruit and some offering of either bacon, sausage and eggs each morning. They also had a variety of juices and starbucks coffee in the lounge. There were also breads and pastries on offer. In the evening there were snacks and during the day you counld pop up and grab a softdrink or water if you wanted also some pieces of fruit.Our rooms were very nice and clean, our executive king was also handicap accessable, so we had a huge bathroom and plenty of extra space. The room with the doubles had a smaller bathroom, but both rooms had mini bar, amoir and a large closet.We found the location to be perfect and used the train system which is located right in the Highland Complex, to get down to the Staples Center one night when we went to the basketball. It is a fast, safe and inexpensive way to get about, without the hassles of parking and LA traffic to contend with. An all day ticket is only $5 per person, and can be used on the trains or buses. When we finished with our passes at the end of each day we handed them on to some less fortunate folk, (which seem to frequent the Hollywood area)...who made use of them to get to where they were going.We booked tours through starline, which are just on the street in a kiosk at the bottom of the Highland center on Sunset. They will heavily discount for a family group...just ask, smile and be patient...we saved just under $100 for a family of 6. We did tons of walking and sightseeing around Hollywood and at all times felt safe. One day we walked from the hotel to the Beverly Center....we walked down Highland, onto Melrose and all the way to La Cienega and to the Mall....it took us 3 and a half hours...with stops for shopping, drinks and icecreams along the way...what a fabulous walk that was, enjoying Hollywood by foot is really something.....I digress...back to the Hotel...we found the staff very friendly, the rooms spotless, the food delicious...even room service was very fast and arrived hot and fresh at very reasonable prices...so we took advantage of this a lot with snacks in bed while watching tv for everyone, almost nightly.The manager told me, when we were checking out that the rooms are due for a refurbishment, and that they were going to be fabulous, with flat screen tvs, new linens (nice already) and new pillows (which need changing), carpeting etc. The refurb is due to start early 2008. The spa is being built now too. Whilst there we saw, Judith Light in the lobby, we saw Tom DeLong from Angels and Airwaves checking in, we saw Jack Nicholson and Lindsay Lohan at the basketball, we saw the guy from Supersize Me...pushing his child in a stroller along Melrose and my husband saw one of the Baldwin brothers driving down Hollywood Blvd...but wasnt sure which one it was...so if you are into celebrity spotting....they really do get out and about in Los Angeles...we saw some and were kind of excited lol.We felt this hotel offered exceptional value for money, a wonderful location and very nice, helpful staff. The congierge is very good, we had several packages delivered to the hotel that my husband ordered online and all of them arrived in one piece and on time. Overall we had a wonderful time in Hollywood at the Renaissance. I would recommend this hotel to family, friends and fellow travellers.
