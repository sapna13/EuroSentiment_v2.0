{"text":"Great Location - Small Room - Don't go with flyglobespan! Stayed for three nights for a short mid-week break and first visit toBarca. The hotel is on the Pla√ã√©?a Catalunya so the location is ideal.You get the A1 airport bus to the square and you are right at the hotel. Flights were from Glasgow with flyglobespan and 5 hours late.This seemed to be the case on a daily basis. On the return leg, a flight to Edinburgh with the same airline due to depart 13.35 was scheduled to leave at 20:00. Avoid them!Check-in was fine with a little gift of some biscuits on arrival in the room. The room (210) was the smallest I have ever stayed in. Looking at the floor plan on the emergency exit I think I was unluckyas it looked the smallest on floor 2. Try to avoid this room if you can. Really not room to swing a cat! It was very clean and well fitted out. Not worth140 euros per night BB.Breakfast was good with a wide selection of cereals, cakes and pastries, cheeses and meats, little sandwiches, juices etc. The cooked selection was average but you might be a little unhappy if you like your british fry up. Disappointing bangers which were more like hot dog sausages and the bacon was really more like the waffer ham you get at the supermarket. There is free wi-fi in all the rooms and if you don't take your laptop there are also two PCs with internet access which can be used for FREE. Only one was working during my stay so you often had to wait or come back.In the afternoon the hotel served FREE sandwiches and cakes\/pastries in the lounge area. Also served was coffee\/tea and if you wanted it Cava. A really nice touch. The hotel staff were helpful and curteous.Check-out was a bit drawn out as the sole receptionist was keener on answering the telephone than dealing with the queue of departing guests and took about 20 minutes. If you are paying with a Credit Card beware of how they charge you. I was charged in √ä√£¬¢ sterling with a 2% surcharge for conversion rather than in euros when my card issuer would not have charged this. They are supposed to ask you if you want to pay in euros and sterling so if you have a card which doesn't charge a foreign currency fee (eg Nationwide) make sure you pay in euros.All in all a good hotel which on a good day will be excellent. The location alone is reason to stay here.
