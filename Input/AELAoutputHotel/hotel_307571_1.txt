{"text":"The best hotel we've ever stayed at too! What's there not to like about this place? We were somewhat apprehensive as cost to stay here is VERY expensive (well, at least for us).But this hotel carried many features\/service like the Four Seasons, Hualailai. Excellent, friendly service, a welcome drink, a golf cart ride to our room.And our room. For those travelers who never leave their room, this is the perfect place! A platter of gourmet desserts and a fresh bath with frangipanis awaited us. Each villa has its own infiniti pool, own outside dining area, both indoor  outdoor showers. Plenty, plenty of space: high celings, huge master suite  bath! And immaculately kept, we could eat off the floor!We also had the buffet along the beach at night. Balinese dancing was also provided. Food was delicious! Even location was very convenient: we were able to walk to and from the many seafood warung along the beach! But also situated far away enough from too much noise and crowd, hence a resort.Even better was the spa. I was expecting to pay a Four Seasons price. But the cost wasn't too bad at all, 100USD each for a 60 minute massage and a 60 minute facial.If I was to give any minuses about the Four Seasons is that the workers at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel nearby were more sharply, traditionally dressed! But otherwise, I vow to come back. Whenever I think of Bali, the first thing that comes to mind is the Four Seasons, Jimbaran Bay!!!
