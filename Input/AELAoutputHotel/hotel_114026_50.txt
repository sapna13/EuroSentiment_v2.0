{"text":"Nice Modern Hotel I booked a package deal through Travelocity. I won't use Travelocity again. Be sure to read their terms and conditions. We had a mixup at the airport, and I called travelocity several times for their assistance, and the representatives I spoke with were completely useless. Travelocity apparently outsources their help lines and it was just a nightmare. As for the Waikiki Parc Hotel, it's a nice hotel right next to the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel and Royal Hawaiian. The hotel has been renovated and has a unique modern feel. The rooms are clean and comfortable. However, if you get a standard room, you are in for a surprise. The hotel that is directly south of the Waikiki Parc has a fan located at the edge of one of their top floors (I think it was 18th). We were on the 22nd and it was approximately a few stories below us. In any event, it was loud. We could not leave our balcony door open at night. It had to be kept closed and we used the air conditioning in the room (which worked great). But my wife and I like fresh air, but the noise of the fan from the other hotel was so loud, we couldn't sleep. I addressed this issue, but I didn't get the feel that management at the Waikiki hotel cared. They offered us a mountain view, which was still close to the fan. They could have offered us an ocean view, which would have put us away from the horrendous noise, but we had to pay extra. I was not about to pay more. The concierge service is excellent. They are very helpful.The extra charge for internet usage is just retarded. It's basic bad management.The Lotus cars the hotel rents are awesome. It's a great ride except everyone on the island looks are you. So don't rent it if you don't like attention.The porter service is great also. Overall, our experience was great with the exception of some of the workers at the reception desk who didn't seem to care if you were content with your stay.
