{"text":"Absolutely Wonderful Hotel We stayed over in Amsterdam for four nights en route to Prague -- my mother, my sister  I. We all had a fabulous time at the Hotel Estherea -- and agreed it was one of the nicest places ever. The hotel is in a perfect location on a quiet  lovely canal within easy walking distance of many major sites (Dam Square\/Anne Frank House); a tram stop is just a block or so behind the hotel. There are many excellent  reasonably priced restaurants very close by. The staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful and made excellent suggestions for restaurants, tours, etc.. Best of all, the hotel is gorgeously decorated in old-fashioned Dutch style. It's a very atmospheric canal house, but with all of the modern comforts -- and then some. Coffee, a large assortment of teas, cocoa or ice water (with mint  lemon) are always available for guests to enjoy; in the afternoons  at night savories and\/or sweets (e.g. gingerbread, pastries, olives etc.) are also set out. As Amsterdam was still cold in early April (though the hotel was always warm), we got into the habit of enjoying tea in the afternoon  camomile tea with cake at night while watching the interesting tropical fish tank in the beautiful livingroom\/lobby before heading up to bed. Our room for 3 was large and very beautiful; the bathroom was large and well-equiped. All and all, a wonderful treat. I''d love to go back -- anytime!!
