{"text":"Mixed experience I have very mixed feelings about this hotel. One thing that I can say is that if you decide to stay here, definitely get a club-level room. The views will be much nicer and the breakfast, snacks, and desserts make the price difference well worth it. The breakfast - while basic - is more than adequate for a couple day's stay. The snack were pretty decent, and the desserts were quite good - although varied day-to-day and sometimes limited in selection. There are also water and soft drinks available throughout the day, which was convenient. However, don't count on the club during the weekend - from what I remember from the sign, it closes before noon on Friday and only re-opens Sunday night. The lounge also lacks a high number of comfy seats and also lacks internet facilities for guests (although staff seem more than determined to do high quantity surfing at their one desk while guests must ask for more food etc). The lounge was also strange in that many guests just came and grabbed stuff and took it to their room (presumably one reason is the lack of comfy-ness in the lounge). In other club lounges that I have been in, guests would relax and even mingle. In this lounge, that was totally non-existent.The room was fine. It was clean and I loved the natural light of the big windows. The decor was OK, but a bit busy and a bit non-functional (except the comfy chair) in my opinion. The bathroom was OK, but I hate the bomb-shelter feel that the heavy, self-closing door gives it. I also hated the big brother fridge - where you cannot put your own stuff in as it is completely slots... luckily at the club level, you can get free cold drinks until 10pm.There are a lot of wannabes staying and hanging around this hotel - this was a bit unpleasant, but maybe it does give you an insight into some people around La-La land.The staff are highly varied at this hotel. Some are quite good. Quite a few unfortunately cannot be bothered by guests apparently. Some of this is probably due to these kids having their heads in their star-life dreams.... things like bell-boys chatting about this-and-that while fully blocking the door for my wife who had to walk all the way around them and club lounge attendants surfing IMDB for endless hours while guest wonder if that is all the food there is. I also think that it must be due to poor training - this particular hotel seems so concerned about looking good that it gives the employees prepared things to say (e.g., saying delighted at the end of a conversation with guests) without concerning itself with whether the staff actually means it. I was subjected to so many fake canned statements that I wanted to puke...... I would say that it is La-La land, but we stayed at another hotel of the same brand and had such a different experience....maybe it is just Hollywood.
