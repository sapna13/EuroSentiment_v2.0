{"text":"Old S.F. Charm, Modern Amenities, Great Location I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ just finishing up a contract here in San Francisco that had me flying in on Mondays and home on Fridays. I wanted a small hotel with the flavor of old San Francisco, not a generic national chain hotel. I spotted the Orchard on the internet but was unable to book it my first week. I ended up at one of the many older, small hotels that populate the area and the very first night challenged my preconceptions. I got a dinky room that looked into a 6 foot wide alleyway separating my hotel from the next building; the restroom was so small, I had to go outside to turn around; my air conditioner was an open window.I had already booked the following week at the Orchard and decided to pay an inspection visit just in case I needed to revisit the chain hotel option. I was delighted by the large rooms, new furniture, huge bathrooms, and comfy pillow-top beds. Each room is equipped with a DVD system and the front desk maintains a DVD library. The hotel building is new with all the safety features and amenities that includes; the visual elevation, however, is designed to fit in with the rest of the neighborhood. I immediately booked several more weeks and now I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ finishing up twenty weeks at the Orchard. The on-site restaurant, Daffodil, is first rate so on-site dining is rewarding if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e not in the mood to go out. The staff is great: friendly and knowledgeable about the area; attentive to my routine. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been pleased with my decision to stay at the Orchard from a comfort, safety, and cultural standpoint. The Orchard has just the flavor to complement that special San Francisco √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√®e ne sais quoi√à√\u2020\u2022?without cramping my need for modern accommodations.Located on Bush Street, the Orchard is two blocks away from Union Square. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ located in a city residential area that has both fine and everyday restaurants, stores, salons, an art school, Cathedral, and the like. The Orchard is just steps away from the cable-car line on cross-street Powell. Union Square, just down Powell, is bustling with all the well known shopping, eateries, and hotels competing for your attention. Chinatown√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Pine Street parallels Bush just one block further away from Union Square, while the main entrance on Grant Street is just two blocks down Bush. The location is √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√∂DEAL.√à√\u2020\u2022?Plenty of attractions and amenities are within an easy walk, but the noise and congestion of the commercial area isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ in your lap. Transportation to the wharf, Market Street, North Beach, and the rest that San Francisco offers is at your door.Put it this way, after twenty-one weeks, the Orchard remains my hotel-of-choice in San Francisco. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ happy with my choice and I will be back.
