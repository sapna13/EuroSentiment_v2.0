{"text":"Enjoyed every moment! Me and my husband stayed at Le Meridien in October for our honeymoon. We also took our 18 month old child. This hotel was fantastic. We were treated like Royalty the entire time, they couldn't do enough for us. The prices in the pub\/restaurants\/pool bar were similar to prices we pay in the UK, so very expensive by Balinese standards. The food wasn't anything special either! The room was amazing. The hotel was spotless. We saw one man in the pool cleaning the tiles with a toothbrush!! We were always welcomed back from our day trips with cool flannels and drinks. They put a fresh piece of fruit in the room for you every day.I would strongly recommend the local restaurant named 'Restaurant on a cliff' - Aptly named!!! They serve freshly caught fish - Muscles and lobster included. This was the nicest meal we had whilst in Bali. The hotel can drop you off and pick you up for free. The kids club was super. Unfortunately our daughter was too young to be left, however the same staff that are at thePenguin club do childminding services too. Again a service that we didn't use, however it was highly recommended by other hotel visitors. The pools at the hotel were amazing. The staff exceptionally friendly. We had a spectacular time and are looking forward to returning there next year!!! There isn't any night life at all. It is very quiet indeed. We usually brought beers from the local shops and took them back to the hotel to drink, they were 4x as expensive at the hotel. We also got taxi's to local areas. It cost less getting a taxi there and back with food etc than what it cost a meal at the restaurant. I could keep writing about our wonderful holiday for hours!!
