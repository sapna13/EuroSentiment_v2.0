{"text":"At best: OK The restaurant food was very good, the housekeeping staff was friendly and polite, and the masseuse was also friendly and I left my treatment satisfied and relaxed. The room decor was tasteful and the bed quite comfortable. But, given the Biltmore name, I was disappointed by the perfunctory service I saw at the front desk and from the spa staff. I expected consistent, superior service and I didn't see it. The major complaint was when I was unexpectedly billed for bellman services that I didn't use and the comment was let me explain why we have this charge. But, there were other areas where I saw a lack of attention to detail:a) Definitely the mosquitoes. I would expect that most visitors would not expect mosquitoes in the desert. Despite that, the hotel manager response was something along the lines of the property ground ponds are breeding areas for the mosquitoes. On top of this, when there is a late afternoon\/early evening lawn event, you'd think the hotel would have the forethought to provide repellent (esp if mosquitofish cannot survive the desert heat).b) In the spa, I asked the attendant if there were any hair bands. The response was that they were out. How is it that a spa at a Biltmore property could be out of hair bands?c) The ability to hear one another within the conference room was dreadful due to the air conditioner drone.d) Broadband access from within the room. The tech support person was efficient and knowledgeable. I liked that the resort fee covered the broadband access. But, you have got to be kidding that the only two outlets by the desk are both in use (thus, I unplugged the wrong appliance which resulted in the phone call to the tech support person).I truly cannot recommend this hotel if the goal is a restful, pampered stay at a top notch establishment.
