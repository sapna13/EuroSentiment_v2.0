{"text":"An excellent hotel! We have just returned from our second stay at this great city hotel. Situated next to the main Sants station in Barcelona we think the Torre Catalunya must have a great recruitment programme for it's staff are a major strength. Nothing is too much trouble and everyone makes you feel like a valued guest from the Reception to the cleaning staff, from the Lounge Bar to the lovely top floor restaurant. Pay the extra 9 Euros per night for an executive room and you get a wonderful view of the city, a spacious room with all the frills - robes, slippers, large TV and CD player and a bathroom that is clean and fitted with every amenity you could wish for. Breakfast is one of those occasions that could last all morning which is probably why they finish at 10 on a weekday and 11 at the weekend. The top floor restaurant gives you the views and provides an imaginative menu. It is expensive and if you stay for several days it may be a last night treat. The bar provides a cheaper option with pizza, pasta and a really good burger on offer. Being a city centre hotel there is no outside space to relax in but there is a park next to the hotel. Also the structure features a lot of glass and the strong sun can make the room hot as the air con is not brilliant. Parking is underground but you do not need a car in Barcelona as the public transport is brilliant. A T10 card will give you ten journeys by Metro, bus, local train or tram for less than 1 Euro per journey. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will return.
