{"text":"Good business hotel As a single traveller on budget but going to Hong Kong for a short conference on my own, this hotel is value for money. Perhaps for a single traveller, the room I was given, was a room for the disabled. Hence the room size was much bigger (think of wheelchairs rolling around). So the bathroon is big enough for a wheel chair to be in it. Likes: compl. english newspaper, friendly and attentive staff, internet access at lobby, free shuttle bus to shopping and main areas (especially Admiralty and HKCEC), good breakfast buffet range with city view, near MTR and Times Square and wan chai late nite shopping area (8mins walk). Shuttle bus picks up hotel guests from Hong Kong station which is good for Airport express travellers. Lifts are adequate (there are 3) though not very big. The room is clean with a mini fridge which is useful for keeping food I bought. There's hairdryer. For longer stay, the hotel website offers discounts for min. stay nites, which is the promotion I took on. Otherwise, this hotel is quite expensive without the promotional rate.Dislikes: it's next to a cementery which I didn't mind as long as I don't see it from my window (I got it frosted). cable TV channels could include MTV or channel V as it's mostly business channels like BBC, CNN which can be so boring. There's an underground subway which you need to use it if you want to walk to MTR. It can be rather too quiet for a single female traveller especially late at night after doing the late night shopping and bcoz the shuttle bus ends at 9.15pm last timing. There's a homeless man sleeping there for nites. I took the buffet breakfast on alternative days. Hong Kong is famous for food and food is available very early in the morning so it's such a waste to have the same buffet breakfast every morning. I'm glad my hotel stay didn't include daily breakfast.Overall, a good hotel for a budget biz trip ","annotations":[]}
