{"text":"Great Vacation Definitly a 4 Star Hello allWe went to the Grand Paradise on November 28th and returned on December 5th. There were 14 of us in our group. We got a great deal and were beginning to wonder about some of the bad reviews. So we went wondering what our trip would be like. We had a fantastic time. We stayed in the Select section which is in the middle of the resort and is the newest part. I must admit the SELECT front lobby was a little disapointing compared to the other resorts we had dropped people off at, but we were never there so that was okay. Our room was clean, we had 2 double beds, flat screen t.v, nice washroom. It was more than adequate. We were in building 9 facing the pool. We had everything we needed. The room was clean , the pools were big and never crowded, the beach is AMAZING. BUT there is not a resort along that stretch of the beach who cannot brag about the Beach. Bavaro is a special place. There was lots of food though it was not always the best ( not bad just not great) It lacked a good salad bar, more fish and more fruit . I have been to resorts with better food. But I always found something to eat so that was no problem. The bread is amazing. The drinks were plentiful. The staff at the resort were really nice and were helpful. We are good tippers so I think that really helped. Remember these people make very little money so tipping them is a huge deal. It also helped our service. There is a trolly running throughout the resort. It is always going so that was easy to take. We walked a lot and never seemed to mind doing that. The walk was 5 mins at most. After all the food and booze it was welcomed. All in all for $616 taxes in. I cannot complain. Our group had a great time and enjoyed our week away from the snow. The cold sure hit us as we landed in Toronto late in the morning. It has not stopped snowing since we got home. I miss Punta Cana.So if you booked this resort. Enjoy.Katie ","annotations":[{"endOffset":629,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":625},{"endOffset":1039,"mention":"salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":1034},{"endOffset":1182,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1177},{"endOffset":1182,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1177},{"endOffset":1182,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1177},{"endOffset":1774,"mention":"snow","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Snow_cream"],"startOffset":1770}]}
