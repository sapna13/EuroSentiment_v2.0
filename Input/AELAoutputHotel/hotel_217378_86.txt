{"text":"Nice Hotel We stayed at the hotel for five nights at the end of July and the first couple of days in August. Check in was simple, they did mess up by giving me too few breakfast coupons, which they corrected the next day. The room was nice, we had a partial water view room, but the view was great. We could see the ocean and the intercoastal waterway. The salt water pool was nice and my daughter enjoyed the baby pool as well. The ocean was clear and the beach was nice. We did eat the breakfast buffett everyday, because it was included in our stay, otherwise I wouldn't have paid $24 per person including 17% gratuity for it. Valet parking was $22 a day, which was also included in my package. For 5 nights I only paid a little over $600 including breakfast and parking so it was a great deal. The negatives for this hotel is that its location is at least a mile from the nearest business (Walgreens, Subway, and Burger King). It was about 3 miles from South Beach, but we took the bus which was quite nice and only cost $1.50 per person. It wasn't easy using a stroller coming into or out of the hotel because of the steps in front, they did some old looking lift for wheelchairs, but we didn't use it. Overall it was a good hotel and a great value, but I probably wouldn't go back, not because of the hotel, just because there are many other places in the world that I would like to visit before visiting Miami for a second time.
