{"text":"Cheapy Cheapy Winey Winey...but lots of fun! First of all we booked through Sunwing and cannot say one bad thing about it. Transfers were great to and from the airport and flight was good...pack lightly or you will get charged. Rooms:Upon arriving we were told to wait until 3 to check in which we had seen in other reviews. We went back at 2:30 and slipped the gentleman at the guest services outside the door $50 to find us an ocean view room. He did give us an Oceanview villa however not facing the ocean. It was not a bad room at all but we wanted ocean view and waited two days to recieve this in Block 6 for no additional charge. Once we moved we found our room fantastic...view was great, if you are not in block 6 bring your own iron!Service:Friendly and on the ball, language barrier...brush up on your spanish, just the basicsFood:Breakfast at main buffet good, same selection each day, not really a variety but still good. Lunch was similar...there was pizza so people that said there was not they lied! Big thing: reservations are required so you need to get at the booth in the main buffet before 8:00 to guantantee you a good reservation time, otherwise you can always eat at 9:30 at any of the restaurants, but we found that the service was better at around 8:00! Mexican, fair, good soup, Italian very good, Bahia...fair at best, Japanese Great fun and food, and we did not attend the Spanish out of fear of the menu! Cafe was great, they make a really good frozen drink!Drinks:Okay Wine was awful...undrinkable...we bought a bottle of wine every night. You just have to request a wine list from any of the restaurants and you can charge it to your room! Beach and Pool:Beach was okay, obviously beautiful, but there was some seaweed and a very calm surf~ The pools were good, put your stuff down before breakfast to guarantee a good spot...pool by the Bahia restaurant has a great breeze off the ocean!Party Pointers:Beach party is alot of fun...make sure you go! Lobby bartenders at night are a blast as well as the pool bar at night!Overall a good time, you get what you paid for...do not expect something like sandals!
