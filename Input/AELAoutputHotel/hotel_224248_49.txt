{"text":"Great Pre-Post Cruise Hotel!!! This is a great hotel for pre and post cruisers or for anyone for that matter. We drove to Miami from DC and checked in the night before our cruise. We had booked a King Suite, Room 700.The Suite is like an apartment. It comes with a separate living room with pullout sofa, kitchen with stove, microwave, fridge, free popcorn, etc. The kitchen table was set and ready for dinner.There are pots and pans -- everything but the food. A dishwasher is there for you as well. The separate bedroom had a second television and king bed. Very nice accomodations for a larger family or travelers who need their space.The hotel is clean, staff friendly and as noted in other reviews, located across the street from a Publix Supermarket, Walgreens, etc. so you can go out and buy that food and prepare what you want.We actually bought food across the street and made our dinner and then watched tv.Shortly after checking in we wanted to use the safe in the room. It was electronic and not getting power. We called down to the desk. They sent someone up in about 2 minutes to fix it. I was impressed with how fast they responded.The technician was unable to fix the safe that night but sought us out at the pool to tell us he had already arranged with the front desk to move us to a new room. We thanked him but declined -- we were so happy with what we had. We thought that showed great initiative!!!The pool is on a rooftop patio about three floors up. It is nice and has a jacuzi. The sign said open dawn to dusk but we were there past dusk and thankfully, no one kicked us out. As one previous reviewer noted, you do need your room key card to access the secure gated parking and the elevators. Unlike the other reviewer, however, I see that as a positive and not a negative! This hotel is interested in security, your security and that is fine by me as a guest!! I did not feel threatened in that neighborhood but did not walk around there. We drove to the store. I am sure anyone concerned about the neighborhood could get a review from the desk.The hotel is a short 15 minute drive to the port. The desk will glady give you a printout of driving directions. Breakfast is included in the room, the buffet was quite good -- a varied assortment of bagels, pre-made omlets, sausage, etc.The hotel is very clean. I met the hotel manager on Saturday morning overseeing operations in the lobby and told her so! I said I could see why this hotel is so highly rated on Trip Advisor. Thanks Trip Advisor for another great stay!
