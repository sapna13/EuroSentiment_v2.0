{"text":"Ready to go back!!! My two friends  I spent a week (Jan 15-Jan22) at the Riu Naiboa Resort and absolutely loved it! At first we were a little worried that the room wouldn't be big enough for the three of us, but as we got used to it after the second day, it really wasn't a big deal considering we didn't spend too much time up there. When we first arrived, the staff at the front desk were very friendly and greeted us with a glass of juice while we waited for our room to be checked. After we got situated in, we decided to walk to the beach which was about a 5 minute walk down Carribean St. The walk to the beach wasn't a major issue.On the second day we booked two excursions; we went snorkeling with sharks  sting rays, and we went on a Jeep Safari. After booking those we decided to walk to the straw markets. If you don't like to walk long distances, I wouldn't recommend walking to the markets. It was probably about a 20-30 minute walk down the beach, and it really wasn't worth it. The food was excellent! The dessert wasn't great, didn't have much taste at all but it really didn't matter. Every night we would go to the shows they put on, which were great! The guys from the entertainment team were extremely friendly. Mandela, Maximo, Johnny Bravo  Eddie Murphy were always walking around making sure everything was okay, and during the day they were playing games by the pool. The pool was absolutely beautiful, as was the beach! We couldn't thank the staff enough for all they did! Some spoke very little english, but there was always someone around who could translate for them. I'm definately looking forward to going back. My friend  I have already decided we're going back for two weeks at the end of December. If you're looking to go on a nice, relaxing vacation, I'd recommend this hotel 100%!
