{"text":"great cheap get-away with the best beach This was the first time we stayed in an all-inclusive hotel. We just wanted to relax on a beautiful beach with enough options for shade (bringing a newborn), expansive enough for long walks, and safe for running at 6 am. Our stay at Barcelo Palace offered all that and more. The hotel is simple but stylish and fits in with the surroundings. In that respect much better than what I've seen in Cancun, Jamaica, etc. Food is so-so, but once you know how to 'work the restaurants' it is not so bad. Fresh pasta station and the grill (lovely filet mignon) are good in the buffet restaurant. We loved the Dominican place (excellent service, very romantic) for dinner and the beach bar for lunch. The fact that there is an option to choose from so many restaurants (all of the Barcelo resorts) is a plus. The complimentary wine is undrinkable (to be expected) but you can order bottles for $10-$20 which will make dinners so much more enjoyable. We brought a mosquito net which was really useful. Didn't use the crib they provide, as it doesn't meet US safety standards. The personnel is very friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful and very relaxing stay. We've done hours and hours of walking on the beach and checked out some of the other hotels. This one seems to be the best kept, with nice grounds, and most shade (palm trees) on the beach. If you want peace  quiet, ask for a room in building 1, 5 or 6. Some negatives (easy to overcome): The gym is a joke. Massage on the beach a rip-off. Noise pollution (Party boats with blaring merengue and screaming drunks. Helicopter tours. The party games near the pool. The evening 'entertainment'). AC is difficult to adjust (on = too cold, or off = too warm). Please note: upon arrival every person (including infants) entering the DR will have to pay $10 cash. Stroller will not be returned when coming off the plane but instead show up on luggage carrousel.
