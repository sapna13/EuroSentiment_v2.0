{"text":"Absolutely Perfect We stayed at the Luxembourg Parc in the second half of our European vacation. This hotel was simply the best.The front desk was courteous and helpful. A man at the front desk even mapped out different restaurants for us to try in the area and each night we tried a new one. They were all wonderful! Our favorite meals were in Paris!! The front desk spoke perfect English and helped us as we tried to learn the customs and the language. The hotel was in a perfect spot. Right by the metro - walking distance to downtown St. Germain. We walked as much as we could - but the location was wonderful with all the metros. Across the street is the beautiful Luxembourg Gardens. We spent an afternoon walking around and had a mini picnic. Just wonderful. The room itself was small - but beautifully decorated and the bed - good, Lord, the bed ... it was so comfortable! We slept like babies!! The bathroom was a perfect size with great toilettries. The shower was just heavenly! Our room was decorated in Napolean style - very pretty. The hotel was quiet and in a great location. We didn't do the breakfast - it wasn't really worth the price. There are plenty of other places to try right up the street or further in St. Germain. The fitness area was also great! We did alittle work out here and there. Free water bottles! And free internet. We bought football tickets for a game in London before we left Paris. We would definitely stay here again. It was just perfect! ","annotations":[]}
