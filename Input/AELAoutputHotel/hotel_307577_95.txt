{"text":"Fantastic and magical A fantastic hotel, it's really big, like a small village but it's kept spotless and unique. We stayed in the Club and it felt like it was our own private hotel, there is a brilliant breakfast choice with freshly cooked food available to suit everyone. The staff are brilliant and helpful. We had a misunderstanding about our afternoon tea provision and were awarded with an aromatherapy massage for the two of us gratis as way of an apology. The best restaurant for good food both balinese and international and we created our own prawn dish J.J. prawns while there - is Donalds- out on to the beach and right and 2nd restaurant in. The Puri Santrian has another restaurant apart from thr 3 in the hotel called the Village - it's approx 1km away and boasts to be the finest Italian food. I am forced to disagree- it's overpriced and after 2 off bottles of wine were served to me and my supposedly well done steak bled all over my dinner, I retreated back to Donalds. Thje Mezzanine restaurant within the Puri Santrian serves fantastic food at excellent prices with the same finesse as any top 5* U.K. restaurant. The facility of pool towels was great as no need to pack. Make sure that you take travel plugs - round 2pin as they are V. Expensive to buy and the hotel charge you for supply. We had no problems with our room, it was fantastic and spacious with loads of storage space, take a few coat hangers though. There are many traders on the short walk along the beach to the restaurants and they can be very persistent and get very offended and naggy if you promise to go back another day and don't, they will keep on. I found it best to say would visit on my last day if I could and stick to that as once you have bought from one they all usher you into their shops and it can take up quite a lot of your hard earned holiday trying to get out! - so you buy yet another T shirt or Batik item just to get away. Hope this helps, we had a fantastic holiday and would definitely go there again and most definitely stay in the Club part as the extras as well worth it ","annotations":[{"endOffset":135,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":131},{"endOffset":360,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":357},{"endOffset":360,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":357},{"endOffset":360,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":357},{"endOffset":360,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":357},{"endOffset":2052,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2048}]}
