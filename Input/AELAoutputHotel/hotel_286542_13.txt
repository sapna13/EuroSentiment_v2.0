{"text":"Loved Marriott Canyon Villas We traded through II into this property. We stayed from April 26th to May 3rd. The weather was perfect - high 80s to high 90s during the day and at night you needed a light sweater. We didn't see one cloud the entire week. The villas are only 20 minutes from the airport - very easy access to the highways. We checked in around 5 pm and the staff were very friendly. We were in unit 2959 (the third floor). The units are very nice and comfortable. The bed was great. We had a walk in shower and jacuzzi tub. The balcony was small .. had a table and 4 chairs, but it was a squeeze. The resort offered a few activities as well as activities at the JW Marriott, where you would walk to or take a shuttle. The shuttle also went to the Desert Ridge Marketplace - plenty of shopping and restaurants as well as an 18 screen movie theatre and a supermarket. They are building a new shopping area (right next to the Marketplace) called City Place that will open in the next few years. It will be a more upscale shopping center with Nordstrom and Bloomingdales. I've been told it will be similar to Kierland Commons (near the Westin Resort). We ate dinner at Kierland Commons twice .. once an italian restaurant called North and at a french bistro called Zinc. Zinc had a nice courtyard room where the roof retracts in nice weather. Both had very good food. We went to the Chart House for dinner one night and had a great meal. Their chocolate soufle was wonderful! We also had dinner at Roys over at the Marriott Hotel - very nice. We had dinner on the patio - it was lit with Tiki Torches and they have a firepit. If you dine there on Friday and Saturday nights, you can hear the music from the band that plays outside on the Marriott patio. The pool areas at both the resort and villas was very nice and kept very clean. My husband golfed every day. He loved that he could get out very early in the morning - just after 6 am. We bought the par n'pamper pass for $500 which entitled us to 5 rounds of golf, 5 spa treatments or a combination of the two. Good deal - especially in the high season months! The spa was the nicest I have seen. It had it's own pool with a jacuzzi and very plush lounge chairs. The spa has it's own restaurant and the two services I received were WONDERFUL! I can't wait to go back. Feel free to email me with any questions.
