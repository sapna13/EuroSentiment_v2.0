{"text":"Size does matter The Negatives: Bigger isn't always better as this resort clearly demonstrates. Bavaro Princess is huge and when we were there (28 Jul - 11 Aug) it was fully booked. As a result service was hit and miss (in spite of generous tipping), the pool was constantly busy, palapas on the beach were difficult to obtain and during peak times hot water shower pressure was almost non-existent. The air-conditioning was barely adequate. The √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºwimming√à√\u2020\u2022?pools aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really swimming pools but more like wading pools and totally inadequate to cope with a full house. Trying to get a drink at the swim up bar was difficult and very time consuming, a result of too many people, inadequate facilities and inadequate staff. As we arrived late on our first day, we ate our first evening meal at the main buffet (which we never repeated over the following 13 nights) not because the food was bad but because of the feeding frenzy and lack of courtesy exhibited by the diners. This leads me to my next point, one that you couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ blame the resort for √à√\u2020\u2022?and that is the lack of decorum of some of the guests. There were guests who had no idea of what standing in a queue meant √à√\u2020\u2022?they would barge a line as though others didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ exist, they would pile food on their plates as if it was their last supper (and would leave half of it); there were people who would whistle and yell at the top of their voices across the room to get the attention of an acquaintance√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√®n the restaurant by the beach, guests (old overweight men and women) would show up for their breakfast and lunch buffet in skimpy Speedos and bikinis with no cover √à√\u2020\u2022?enough to put anyone off their food √à√\u2020\u2022?and yet nothing was said or done about any of it. I have seen better mannered people with a sense of decorum in far more inexpensive resorts than this√à√\u2020\u2022?folks, this is most certainly not a five star. The Positives: Platinum Service: We travelled Air Canada, which gave us √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ülatinum√à√\u2020\u2022?Service, which given the overall √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√áusyness√à√\u2020\u2022?of the place, was well worth it. Platinum service allowed for a quick check in\/out, quick reservations to all the restaurants not only at Bavaro Princess but also at the two adjoining sister properties (where the service was superb). The private lounch with drinks, TV, snacks and internet service was a plus.Restaurants: Other than the buffets, all the restaurants were good. Our favourites were the Japanese, Chopin, and Liccy. At the Punta Cana Princess we really enjoyed Le Fondue and IL Baccio. At the Caribe Princess, the local Dominican restaurant √à√\u2020\u2022?can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ remember the name √à√\u2020\u2022?was also very good. The service in the √à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022?star sister hotels was far better than at the √à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022?star Bavaro Princess.The Beach: Very nice beach but I had to be up early enough to ensure a decent front row palapa away from the madding crowd. Entertainment: Most of the shows were very good - some of the entertainers were brought in and were professional. No complaints here. Booze: Most times we got the premium brands (perhaps because I tipped and had the Platinum wrist band). I learnt to tip the same bar tender (and the same waitress) every night and that was the only way we were ensured quick service and only at the main bar\/lobby. No complaints here. The Grounds: Superb with peacocks, ducks, birds, and flamingoes. Well looked after.Shuttle Service: Reasonably good for the amount of guests - got to where we had to get to when we had to get there. Overall Verdict: We enjoyed our stay but it would have been far better had there been less people or had the hotel had the staff and facilities to cope with their number of guests. I would give this resort a lukewarm recommendation...nonetheless, we had a nice and relaxing two weeks.
