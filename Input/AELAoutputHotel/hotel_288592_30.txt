{"text":"Conrad is 'hit or miss' The Conrad chain strives for a four star, Ritz-Carlton-level reputation, but this property falls short. First, I had stayed in the Conrad in Chicago; it was a superior experience, with respect to price, service, room quality, etc. I expected the same in Miami. We typically stay in South Beach, but decided to give downtown a try.I got a great rate on their website by booking over the internet and prepaying the room. I paid about $270 a night for a bay view room, which was closer to $330 on other websites. (Its not a clear bay view since there is an apartment building in the way. But you do see water.)The problems started before we checked in. There was a convention in the hotel, but they did not have enough valets to park the cars. We were told to park the car at the end of the block. Not good. But, on the plus side, they did have our bags in our room within 10 minutes of check in.Once we settled in, I called the concierge to see about a restaurant reservation. We asked about Azul, a great restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental (highly recommend Azul, by the way). The concierge said he would try, but could not guarantee given the hour. Fair enough. We also talked about top restaurants in South Beach. When I asked about other options in downtown, he mentioned there was a PF Changs up the street. Now why, if I choose Azul as my first choice, would he suggest PF Changs as a second choice? That made no sense.The elevators . . . what can I say. We saw the same gum wrapper on the floor Monday morning at check out that we saw Saturday night at check in. There was a broken glass panel in the other elevator. I just can't imagine that broken panel would be tolerated all weekend at the Ritz, the Four Seasons, or the Delano. Then there was the room. It was OK, but a bit noisy from the air conditioner and the elevator motors. The worst part was the daily wake up call by the housekeeping staff. Er . . . folks? If I call the front desk for a 10:30 wake up, that does not mean I want a knock on my door at 8:30! The oddest part: as I stood near the window and looked up near the valance, I could see exposed insulation and unfinished drywall. This could be a real problem for people with allergies, of course.I communicated all these issues to the hotel when I received an on-line survey e-mail. A few days later, I received an e-mailed letter apologizing for all the problems EXCEPT the exposed drywall. That, supposedly, is the way it was supposed to be . . . whatever . . . .A week later, I received the same letter at my house. But with the letter was a voucher for two free days in a king room! This was a pleasant surprise, of course, which I will take advantage of.In all, the hotel was, as a Brit we met in the bar put it, hit or miss. They do care, but they just don't quite have it all together. That is a management and understaffing issue, I think.
