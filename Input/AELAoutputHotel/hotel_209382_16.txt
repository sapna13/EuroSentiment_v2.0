{"text":"Very nice, especially if you get a good price Stayed two nights on a hotwire price of $175 which was better than the price of most 2* hotels in NYC. Check-in was pleasant and fast. We were originally given a room with two twin beds but they quickly switched us to a room with a queen bed (#3310) when we asked for something more romantic. The room was a good size for NY standards and very clean. The decor was modern, the bed comfortable, the view very nice, although this particular room only had one small window. The only drawbacks were minor: the hall carpeting had seen better days and really should be replaced, the internet access in the hotel business center was pretty pricey ($10 for 20 minutes), as was the charge for local calls from the room ($3.10 for two calls) as we couldn't get cell phone reception there; the shower water pressure was pretty weak and the position of the shower head was too close to the wall so you had to either use the hand-held head or stand right up in the corner to rinse under it; and there was no mirror in the room itself, although a full wall one in the bath - but I found it irksome not to be able to put my make-up on in the room when my partner was in the bath. All-in-all though, it was a very nice ambiance and we would stay there again, especially at such a good price.
