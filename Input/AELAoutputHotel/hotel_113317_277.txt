{"text":"Best hotel in New York Just back from a stay in this wonderful hotel. I have been to New York 8 times now and this was my first time to stay here. Have stayed in the likes of the Plaza on 5th ave before and have to say that i found this hotel the best of the lot. I can not recommend this place enough. the friendliest staff you will ever find anywhere. The hotel itself is very clean. I though the room was a fine size considering what i have read. the bathroom was also fine. Only problem was I would have liked it to have air con as when opening the window the smell from the Italian next door was not to pleasant. Rik's cafe was fantastic. Great breakfast and great wine! When we checked out i couldn't believe it when we were told to make full use of the cafe until we had to get the flight. We were also told that if we had a late flight the make sure we came back for the wine and cheese later, even though we were checked out! They were truly amazing. Cant fault anything, location, cleanliness, friendliness, food, everything was great. Try Tony's next door for the best Italian food ever (and apple martinis!) Jimmy's Cornor around the block is an experience. A dive but a fantastic dive! Owned by a professional boxer who serves behind the bar this place has so much atmosphere. Want to meet true New Yorkers well here is the place to go. Also try St. Andrews 2 doors up. ","annotations":[]}
