{"text":"Nice place! Clean and quiet, free internet The airport La Quinta is a really nice hotel! I am a budget traveler and usually stay at the Red Roof Inn or the Motel 6, so that gives you an idea of my expectations and standards. We splurged on a Monday night at the La Quinta because we needed internet access and the Red Roof was full. I'm so glad we got to spend the night in comparative luxury. The La Quinta was renovated about two years ago and everything is new and shiny, from the tile in the bathroom to the paint in the hallways. Either it was deserted or the walls are thick, because we didn't hear evidence of another guest the whole time in our room. We heard airplanes in the morning, which is to be expected since the hotel is right next to the airport, but they sounded much quieter than they do from the Red Roof or Motel 6. High-speed internet was furnished via in-room cable and worked great with no passwords or connection fees required. The room was ultra clean. There was a blow dryer, shampoo, and a coffee maker in the room, as well as a desk, but no fridge or microwave--those would have been the icing on the cake. The front desk staff was friendly and solicitous--they even called when we'd been in our room a few minutes to make sure everything was satisfactory. There was plenty of parking and this hotel really is right next to the airport, though a few blocks' drive from the airport entrance. One small problem is that the wheelchair\/stroller entrance is only on the airport-facing side of the lobby, so if you need to enter on wheels (or wheel your luggage in) you have to drive around to that side of the hotel, and it's not obvious that this would be necessary from the parking lot.The hotel is situated on the hotel strip just next to the airport, and there are several restaurants nearby. The closest stores include a Jack-In-The-Box, a Taco Bell, two gas stations, and a 7-Eleven, but I also saw a bunch of sit-down restaurants further down the street toward the airport. We didn't have a chance to check out the continental breakfast or the pool.Overall, from a no-frills, budget-traveler perspective, this place was extraordinarily clean and quiet for an airport hotel and I would recommend it to anyone.
