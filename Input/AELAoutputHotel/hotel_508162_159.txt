{"text":"Great time had by all Stayed at Dreams from the 14th to 28th of July and had a fantastic time. Don't believe the negative reviews this place is fantatsic, do your homeowrk a bit before you go and you will know what to expect from the likes of the journey to the hotel etc...As well as this the Dreams management team do read TA reviews and forward them onto their staff via e-mail, they do act upon negative reviews ( Thanks Ricardo in the Preferred club for showing me this).We upgraded to the Preferred club and stayed in two honeymoon suites which were immaculate and well kept throughout our stay. A big hi to Vanessa, Ricardo and George in the Preferred club, you guys rock and George your Smirnoff n Coke's are eh, how do I say it.... Put some coke in next time mate, cheers...LOL. Particularly liked the beach area for preferred guests with better sunloungers and beach towels without the need for a card etc...Loved to chill out at night in the hot-tub with a few beers....Heaven.The beach itself is beautiful, but there are rocks in the Ocean so be careful when entering. We swam in a horseshoe shaped area to the right hand side of the beach in front of the vendors hut. The water is lovely and refreshing and is like swimming in a lukewarm bath.One of our highlights at the resort was seeing 70 black people having a pre-wedding party on the beach, man do you guys know how to party or what, everyone was up dancing to some cool tunes being played by the DJ and to make it even better they invited us to join in, which we did and had a great time. Hope verything is going well in your married life.Food is outstanding at this resort, we ate at 4 venues: The Mexican, The Seaside Grill, The Italian and the Buffet and food was good at all of them. We liked the buffet best as the choice at dinner was excellent and allowed all of our party to have something they wanted. Worthy of praise are the waiting staff at all restuarants but again at the World Cafe ( buffet) the service here was faultless and you felt staff really enjoyed their work.A big thanks to Josie and Angel at the Core Zone area. This area is fantastic for all the family as it has pool, table tennis, air hockey as well as an X-Box, Wii and Playstation for those who maybe suffering from withdrawal symptons. Some good activities are held here i.e. Air rifle shooting, Archery, Darts along with Basketball and Tennis.Entertainment at the resort is good and runs on a weekly basis so if you are there for two weeks you will see the same shows twice. Some may see this as a problem but we certainly didn't as it allowed us to enjoy other activities within the resort i.e. Core Zone, Movies on Beach etc... I absolutely loved sitting out in the Plaza Square watching movies at night with a cocktail in hand, the atmosphere is just fantastic.I had two Hot Stone Massages at the SPA and they were fantastic, the resort offers discounts of 15% on certain days which are well worth looking out for and taking advantage of. The facilities are excellent in the SPA and you get to use the water areas prior to any massage or treatments. Try the ICE PLUNGE POOL it's lovely......LOL. Upstairs from the SPA is the Gym and what can I say except I wish I had bought some of my gear with me so I could have used it, it is incredible and if you use a gym back home bring your gear with you and use this gym, you won't be disappointed.The pool is superb and runs the length of the resort, water is only 3 foot deep throughout the length and we had no problems finding sunbeds at any time during the day. One thing I did dislike about the resort is the Vendors who come on site 3 times a week, they can be very pushy. The situate themselves so it is impossible to miss them when you are walking around the resort. Perhaps a better idea would be to move them to a specific area within the resort, where drinks could be on offer and music playing in the background etc..., then if guests wish to go shopping they can go there and have a nice shopping experience rather than feeling intimidated.I'm not a person that likes to go to the same place twice so for that reason I perhaps will not return to Punta Cana, however, I enjoyed the Dreams experience and will definently use Dreams Resorts again in the future.
