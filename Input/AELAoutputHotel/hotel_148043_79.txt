{"text":"Luxury Old World Charm November 2007Hotel El Convento, Old San Juan, Puerto RicoFabulous small luxury hotel. This former 17th century convent has certainly done an extroadinary job of keeping all of the old charm with luxury you would expect in the finest hotels. The staff was very courteous, excellent food in the 3 restaurants, beautifully decorated rooms,pool, fitness center and hot tub. We stayed for 6 nights and everything we asked for was done immediately. We used WHATAHOTEL for our reservation. We got a great room rate of $205 a night. The staff cannot do enough for you. Robes were in our room for use at the pool and hot tub.The hotel is right in the heart of Old San Juan. Perfect for walking, sightseeing, and discount shopping on the same street. Turn down service at night with a lovely note, chocolates and our Bose radio turned on to soothing classical music when we walked into our room. If the beach is what you are interested in the hotel does have complimentary passes for a beach about 10 minutes away with the use of a pool also. We will definitely return to the Hotel El Convento and look forward to using WHATAHOTEL again to insure a great price. The hotel also has complimentary wine and cheese every night at 6 pm. A large selection of wines and they will even make a special drink for you to try for free. Complimentary coffee and tea all day and night. Free internet in each room which is very important for us when we travel to keep in touch with business e-mails. Excellent way to meet and talk to other guests.The only way to get onto the guest floors is witha hotel key.Fillis  Byron SamuelMount laure, New Jersey ","annotations":[{"endOffset":821,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":811}]}
