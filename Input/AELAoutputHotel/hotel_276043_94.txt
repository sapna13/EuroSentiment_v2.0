{"text":"Be aware , its good really good !! The Marriott Berlin is indeed a better Marriott hotel. I`ve stayed at lots of Marriott`s to compare it too. Its no JW Marriott and also I have been in better Renaissance Marriott`s but this one is certainly a flagship for the Marriott brand.The lobby is beautiful , very large and comfy , the frontdesk and concierge are helpfull and do seem to like their work.The rooms are great, I stayed at the 5th floor and had booked 2 rooms 570 and 571 both were excellent. Al the amenities you come to expect from a 5 star hotel. But the rooms had that 5 star feel to it, which I call the Hotel x-factor. Sometimes a hotel has all the right things for a 5 star property but it lacks the feel of a five star property, not this one from arrivel until check out it was 5 star al the way. Don`t expect people running after you with an umbrella or jumping from behind every colum to greet you by name. Like I said its no Ritz or 4 seasons or even a JW marriott. But these places tend to go at much higher rates.The breakfast buffet was outstanding, fresh smoothies for the fruit lover, cooking station for a fresh and hot omelett. Nice and good selection of food.I loved the cooking station, very good !!!Friendly people al the way.The place of the Hotel just behind the Ritz Carlton at Potzdamer Platz. 3 minutes from the U bahn and 3 minutes from the Sony Centre, which has great restaurants and ding options. Also a great Imax theatre and lotts of other things to do. Also a nice shopping centre next to it.Brandenbur Tor and Unter den Linden within 10 to 15 minutes reach. Al in al the place is great, I like it much better then Kurfurstendam.
