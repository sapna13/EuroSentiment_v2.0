{"text":"Very, Very Nice Resort We stay at the Bahia Prinicipe the week of April 12 thru April 19 with 3 other couples from our area. It is a very nice resort. We requested for all couples to be place in the same villas but needless to say 3 couples stayed in Villa 15 and we were stuck in Villa 11. They told us just a short walk, we believed them, but did not realize just how big this resort was. They were pool side and we were Kids club side. Not that big a deal but did request prior to leaving the states and when we arrived at the resort. This resort is very clean...I am a neat freak and the resort passes my high standards. Someone is always cleaning or polishing something. The food was OK...when you are serving that many people...it seems like repeats of main things. We had 3 al carte restaurants but managed to sneak 2 other meals because of cancellations. Check with guest services sometimes people cancel and you can get their spots!! The main buffet has a smell as soon as you walk thru the door that almost turns your stomache. By the 6th day my husband refused to eat in the buffet. The al carte are a nice change of pace and a wonderful way to end the day. Very relaxing and we never felt rushed.Beach just a past reviews states very wonderful!!We did two excursions the Samona Island - the most beautiful place I believe in the Carribean. The ride there and the big star fish were unbelievable. We also did the Outback Safari...also a nice trip for the money around 80.00 a piece. We would definetly return to this resort !!
