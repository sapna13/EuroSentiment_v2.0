{"text":"Excellence is just Ok My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel 8\/11 -815. It was my first time staying an all inclusive, adults only resort. It was a peaceful relaxing vacation. The property was clean and the staff was friendly. You should brush up on your Spanish, otherwise you will have a problem communicating with the staff. The beach was absolutely beautiful. Utopia!!We highly recommend taking a helicoptor to and from the airport. It took us an hour and a half to get to the hotel and 2 hours to get back to airport on the bus, because of the tropical storm that came in the last day, and there were a LOT of pot holes on most of the roads to the hotel.The food was just ok, you have to ask for premium alcohol or you will get the cheap stuff in all of your drinks. Bring or buy bug spray. We both got eaten alive. We LOVED the Saxaphone player, that played in the Lobby in the evening. He played Jazz music that was so romantic. We liked his music so much, that we bought 2 CD's from him for $20.00. We got them home and tried to play them in both of CD players and they wouldn't work. I have sent emails to Domingo and the hotel concierge. Our Travel Agent also called the hotel. We were told that he would mail us a new cd. That was weeks ago. All in all it was a nice vacation.
