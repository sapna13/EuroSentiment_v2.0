{"text":"Fantastic staff - Great for a few nights We stayed here for a couple of nights , 1 pre and one post-cruise. The hotel is dated, as some guests have stated, this is particularly evident in the bedrooms eg single-glazed windows, doors showing some wear and tear and the location isn't ideal to be right on top of the actionHowever, the rooms were large and clean and adequately furnished and it's right on the beach with a man-made breakwater providing an ideal swimming area. The public rooms and pool area are all kept in excellent condition and the breakfast buffet was particularly good (and included in the price). The free WiFi in the lobby was a useful extra for those with their own laptops.Our pre-night cruise was spent in a room on the side with single-glazed window which meant that noise from the street was evident and I would think that those rooms facing onto Collins may have a problem. For our post-cruise night we requested a beach front room with balcony and were lucky to get a corner room with windows on 2 walls and a very spacious balcony (at no extra cost).The boardwalk between the hotel and the beach provided a nice stroll down to Lincoln (where we found lots of bars and restaurants) - around 20 mins walk. Whilst the area around the hotel is a little run down, many of the hotels around the area are currently undergoing refurb and within a year or two I expect the area will be very stylish, much like the area further south.What particularly struck me about this place was the friendliness of the staff - without exception every one of them provided excellent, caring service. Interestingly enough, most of the clientele seemed to be European, perhaps because the hotel is owned by a European company.I would definitely stay here again if I could guarantee a beach-view room.
