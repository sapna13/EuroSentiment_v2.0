{"text":"This place really is hell in Waikiki This is an inside joke between my girlfriend and I to this day, everytime I say out loud; Hell in Waikiki.I remember the day I was in the elevator, and I said out loud the word terrible. The person next to me right away assumed I was referring to the beds. I told him I was referring to the entire room.This place sucks. Do not stay here. Sleep in your rental car. The beds are all rock hard, so you are probably better off.There is really no soundproofing. You can hear 3 different toilets flushing at once. Nice to know someone just went to the bathroom in what feels like inches away from you. It also sucks when the garbage men come to empty the dumpsters, which are conveinantly placed right next to the hotel.When I first got to the hotel, they said our room might be dirty. It was, so back down the elevator I went. For traveling conveinance, you need to use your room key to use the elevator. Kinda sucks when you have 4 people and they only give you 2 keys. So they gave us a new room which was a little cleaner, although we had to contact someone to clean the urine off the toilet. When the person arrived, he said what's wrong with the toilet? apparently not seeing the yellow urine on the toilet seat. Sorry, I'm not sitting on someone elses urine.So I got used to our new rooom where we spent the next 3 days. We also had awkward feelings around the people who worked there. We asked them NOT to come to a room for room service. Not that we didn't trust them...but no, we really didn't trust them at all.So that's it, my back was sore and I felt like a grimeball for 3 days. Never again.
