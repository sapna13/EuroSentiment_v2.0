{"text":"Barcelo Beach - Would not go back Spent an all enclusive week at the Barcelo Beach Resort in Punta Cana - Feb 11th to Feb 18th.The vacation didn't get off on a good start. After a 6.5 hr flight and transfered to the hotel only to find out the entire resort facility is booked out. Meaning no rooms for any guests arriving that night. After some confusion and little information, they transfered us to another hotel. Complete hassel when you only have 1 week there. Then arriving at the second hotel, having to go through the check in process and was informed that we had to check out the next morning by noon. Barcelo would have rooms ready by 3pm the next day. We later realized that the hotel was fully booked every night, therefore all new guests arriving daily would have to go through this hassel. We got our room at 3pm as promised the next day, beach front which was very nice. Only problem is daily (loud) construction on the suites behind our room. Complex block 1. Daily from about 9am - 8pm. We couldn't get a room change because there wasn't another room available.The hotel was also advertised as a 4 star, but infact in their brochures it was advertised as a 3.5. But in reality, more like a 3. The rooms are older and dated. Not much choice in dinning options. Can not dine at the Barcelo Palace. What we did like was the long stretch of beach front at this property. And a beach front room was nice despite the noise. The sands, white coral, can't beat that. Do we plan on returning. Probably not. For the price of this property, you should pay alittle more for a better choice. Happy travelsBWJT ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1310,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":1304},{"endOffset":1328,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":1324},{"endOffset":1450,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1445},{"endOffset":1450,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1445},{"endOffset":1450,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1445},{"endOffset":1450,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1445}]}
