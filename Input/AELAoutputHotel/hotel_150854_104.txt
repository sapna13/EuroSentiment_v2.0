{"text":"Loved the Riu Palace Macao Myself and some from friends (6 in total) wanted to travel to have a Girls Vacation. We booked our trip through American Express travel, our agent was on top of everything down to the last minute when we were scheduled to take off. The shuttle service was on time and waiting to pick us up . the ride was air conditioned and relaxing from the airport to the hotel. When we arrived to the hotel we were greeted with punch and roses. The bellman, was helpful and so was the front desk. So far everyone we encountered spoke very good english and was very very helpfull getting us situated. All were very pleasant and accommodating. The food was EXCELLENT !!!! We had so many choices, we tried to venture out and try different things but we loved what were served everyday within the hotel they seemed to have had the best servings daily. The japanese restaurant was secluded the servings were small. But to each his own. The breakfast was delicicous serving omlettes, pancakes, sausage fruit, and some traditional domican foods. The service was phenominal!!! Although we did not have to tip because our vacation was all inclusive we could not help but to do so, such great service. Lunch and dinner were the same. The food was delicious and there were all types of foods for everyones liking whether vegetarian or no beef \/ pork eaters. The entertainment and performances were extraordinary and funny, but had a very bad impressionist of James Brown! The night life was exciting and fun, the Bachata was the club, that was right oustide of the hotel grounds. which 4 other hotels surrounded. I think the theatre within the hotel was very smokey was not a non smoking area, with a damp feel and smell.... the pool closed early and there was only one major pool with a jacuzzi. I think there could have been more pools. The Fitness center needs to be upgraded tremendously, out of the 4 machines they had 2 were not working. The Fitness center is a walk within the hotel grounds. The rooms were clean, the bathroom and rooms were newly furnished, and the service was excellent but the room had a damp smell to it. Tv's need to be upgraded, satellite dish went out a couple of times. Most of the channels were snowy and not clear. One person in our party was celebrating her birthday while we were there and the hotel was totally accomodating, decoarted the room with balloons and flowers gave a complimentry bottle of rum and champagne, with a birthday cake and a live band during dinner. The weather was beautiful very humid, leaving the room going to the beach the camera lens would fogg up. I would suggest everyone to take the safari, that was very interesting and told about the country and how the Dominicans live, Overall it is a good hotel the service is excellent, there needs to be some upgrades, i would stay here again!!!! Had a great tine and Loved it............
