{"text":"Pretty goo The good: great balcony with a scenic view, clean rooms with a modern feel, soft  cushy bed, honor bar, and clean pools. Breakfasts were large and free. The fruit included with breakfast wasn't the freshest (dry papaya and pineapple), but still better than most free breakfasts. Dinner was great (not free), and the chef took time to chat with the diners. They gave us a free bottle of good red wine after we told them it was our honeymoon. Satellite TV is nice when you are tired at the end of the day. Oh, and the AC works great. Comes with a yoga mat, even though we didn't use it. Beach towels and beach chairs are free to use for the day, but the snorkle equipment is not free ($15). The rooms also come with an iPod docking station (iHome) that puts out pretty decent sound.The bad: white blinds that don't keep sun out, shower that has varying water temp (but the shower itself is nice), mosquito net that came down on us as we slept (imagine a giant spider web), and it is pricey. The beach is rocky, but not gross (dead things, trash). There are animal noises, such as roosters and dogs, but only the latter was noticed by me and only on one of our 3 nights. Oh, and parking is an issue; there will be double parking unless you park alongside the road. Esperanza looked like a better town to be near (closer to beach, not so crowded).We had heard about the staff not being friendly, but they seemed nice to us. The manager was pretty standoffish, but friendly enough. Overall, a good hotel, but there may be better deals on Vieques. ","annotations":[]}
