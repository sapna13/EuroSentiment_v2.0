{"text":"Great place to stay My family and I stayed at the Golden Landmark for 5 days in July this year. Had a fantastic time. The hotel was actually better than we thought - had read a few reviews and was slightly worried at what we would find. The rooms were very spacious and had organised a interconnecting room for the teenage kids. Their first trip abroad. We booked directly with the hotel on line and after reading reviews ensured that we took our booking confirmation with us. This came in handy when trying to check out - as they were trying to get us to pay the changed rate - stuck to our guns and paid what we had booked for - but only because we had our confirmation paperwork when booked online through the hotel. The bathrooms were ok, after giving them a bit of a wash (something my husband does every where we stay), we had no problems. No complaints from the kids (which is where any would have come from). If you are planning on having the breakfast _ DO NOT BOOK AS PART OF HOTEL\/ROOM PACKAGE. We were umming and ahhing about what to do and eventually decided to wait until we got there. When we asked about breakfast at the restaurant it worked out cheaper to pay cash directly to them $12 singaporean, compared to $22 when booking. Found the restaurant to be not too bad however the food from the local hawker centres was much much better and tastier. Just across the road (when go out the raffles hospital door) was a little lane way called Bali Lane. there is is restaurant type bar with out door seating - food was absolutely delicious - most of them cost about $8 singaporean. Found the tiger beer to be a bit expensive here, but averaged about $5-6 in the hawker centres. The rooms have tv - with movie channels in English and local sub titles - kids thought this was great and funny as they were not used to it. The people were lovely, The Bugis MRT is only 5 mins away, Bugis street night markets are a definite must for bargain hunting. Found Sim Lim square to be great for electronics - however MAKE SURE YOU COMPARE PRICES - before you buy and ensure that they are turned on before you leave. We got caught out with a couple of things. Didn't expect anything fancy - all wanted was larger room. Rooms had safes which we used and had no problems. No robes - but were never expected. However they did have slippers - didn't use. The pool was good and relaxing after running around all day. Wondered about the mosque across the road in regards to prayers (early mornings) didn't hear a thing. The only time we heard any prayers was in the afternoon when we were in the pool. Defintely can't wait to go back to Singapore and would definitely stay at the Golden Landmark again. Close to everything that we wanted and good for teenagers as well.
