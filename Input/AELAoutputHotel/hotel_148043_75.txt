{"text":"Still Beautiful, traditional and Unique But in Need of Repairs Just finished a late Dec. stay at the El Convento and it is still beautiful (stayed there before). Interior Courtyard is truly gorgeous and such a restful place to sit and have coffee. However, the rooms and hotel common areas are certainly in need of repair. The hotel hot tub has a thick layer of mold around the top and is completly cracked and broken. The wall above the pool is also cracked and in need of paint. While our room had a lovely balcony and was the standard unique el convento style -- our sheets had holes in them and the tub was stain and cracked and in need of repair.In addition, the staff is very friendly but quite inadept with directions and recommendations. Three times we got wrong directions\/addresses (for locations as close as three blocks away), reservations were made but we were never informed (they forgot) and information on major attractions such as the Bio Bay and the Bacardi Distillery were faulty if they had any information at all.That said, the location is the best in town, much rather stay in Old San Juan for the food and entertainment and walking proximity to the fort and piers etc. There is a great flamenco restaurant across the little square outside the hotel and La Bombombera can't be beat for any meal especially breakfast.We paid less than $200 to stay and that made it worth is but as the price of El Convento creeps up they must really make more of an effort to ensure the little things are kept up as well (holes in sheets are just unacceptable) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":246,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":240}]}
