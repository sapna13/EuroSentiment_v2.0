{"text":"not rated right!!!!! Hi my husband and I stayed at the Grand Paradise Bavaro from nov. 3 till the 10 th.Let me start by telling you we brought our 4 year old with us. When we first get off the plane don't worry about getting help ,the porters run after you ,but I don't blame them they are a third world country.We get at the hotel and it was nice ,they gave us drinks upon arrival.As for booking club gardenview, please take my advice Don't book gardenview even though they say club,they put you at the front of the hotel basically it's like it's not even part of the resort, the main resort is further down . If you reserve oceanview doesn't mean you will get an oceanview it just means you will be closer up front where the beach is at.If you get gardenview you will need to take a little train everytime you want to head to the beach, or to the buffet restarants, most restaurants are in the oceanview side.We were upgraded to oceanview, but my husband had to grease the manager a 50.00 us.It wasn't long before they gave us what we wanted. To save money you can book gardenview and when you get down here you can upgrade, some people got lucky and just greased the manager a 20.00us and were upgraded.As for our room it was huge and very comfy.The FOOD:Breakfast was great we loved it they had scabbled eggs you can have an omelette made as you like, they have pancakes french toast,potatoes,ham, sausage, crepes they were delicious,great pasteries etc.For luch it was also great if you are not picky you will be fine, and as for supper they have a theme every night,example mexican night,french, italian and ofcourse their night dominican night which is the best night .I do have to say that their meal especially lunch repeats.I loved the coffee domicans do have the best coffee.As for the BEACH:beautiful beach white sands.As for the SERVICE:My husband hated the service, we asked for water when we first got there and didn;t get any till the very next day, my husband only drinks diet coke and I think diet coke there is like gold cause they don;t carry much and refill the when they feel like it. We did tip well but the service didn;t get better.We ask the maid for towels for the beach and got them 2 days later they always say 10 min and just forget.We actually tipped in advance and my husband had to go with the bar guys to get water and soda in their storage room.It was a nice vacation ,had better but we will return to the domincan but not this Hotel.We prefer theBavaro Princess now that was an amazing hotel just look at the reviews!!!!
