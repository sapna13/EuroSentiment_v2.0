{"text":"Incredibly luxurious, unsurpassed service, but at a price I have just returned from a short trip to Paris, which as usual was wonderful. I stayed at the super-luxurious Four Seasons George V Hotel. This place simply oozes luxury - our basic (if you can call it basic!) twin room was extremely comfortable and spacious, with a huge marble bathroom, a small lounge area and a mini bar which was more like an entire store! The hotel lounge is sumptuous - take afternoon tea with cakes from the trolley, the cakes look like jewels and taste of heaven - and the atmosphere is very relaxed and friendly. The bar is fantastic - quite masculine but very cosy and comfortable. The restaurant is extremely beautiful - very formal but not stuffy; the food was super-rich and beautifully cooked and presented - it's not to my taste but if you like the Michelin 3-star style you'll love it, although maybe not the prices: some main courses were 250 euros each. I know you wouldn't usually think about flower displays when considering which hotel to stay in but at the George V they're an art form. They ship in 15000 blooms a week and have a team of florists refreshing vases on an hourly basis - nothing's done half-heartedly at the George V. The best thing about the hotel though is the staff - they are welcoming, friendly and unstuffy, but the service is superb and they are not over-familiar or intrusive; for me they made the hotel. I'm not loaded and this was a special treat, but despite the hotel being stuffed to the gills with the uber-rich, I never felt uncomfortable or out of place. If I had one critiscm it's that this fabulous hotel is very, very popular with the very rich and corporates so it was very busy - a couple of times we couldn't get a seat in the lounge or bar - of course the staff soon sorted that out for us. If money's no object then go to the George V; if it's for a special occasion and you don't mind splashing out then go there; if you like to get value for money then go elsewhere!
