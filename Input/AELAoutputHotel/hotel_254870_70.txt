{"text":"Excellent Hotel  My husband and I stayed at this hotel during our honeymoon while we were visiting Barcelona. We were looking for an affordable hotel in a really central location. We loved this hotel!The room we had was pretty tiny, but it was modern and very clean. The bed was comfortable, but not as comfy as some others we've stayed in. However, it was fine and we were able to rest and sleep well. The AC worked pretty well for us. We did not have any issues. We also were able to open our window and look out onto the little side street below. It was pretty cool.The hotel was really wonderful. It was modern and felt hip and cool.The breakfast selection was great and we felt it was totally worth it to get the breakfast. It has an awesome rooftop terrace with greatviews of the city. The jacuzzi was a little bit disappointing in that it didn't seem hot enough for us to enjoy. The water tempuraturefelt more like a heated swimming pool rather than a jacuzzi. That said, we didn't travel to Barcelona to sit in a jacuzzi all day! We went there to see the city and this hotel is in a great location! There is a metro stop just outside the hotel across the street. Also, there are tons of restaurants and shops in the surrounding blocks. We could get to anywhere we needed to get to from this hotel. Most everything is within walking distance.The staff was very friendly and helped us out a lot. They warned us of the pick-pocketing that goes on in Barcelona, which was very nice of them to do. Overall, we were totally happy with our stay at the H10 Montcada. We loved it and had a great experience here. It was not too stuffy, but felt like much more than it's 2 star rating on TripAdvisor.
