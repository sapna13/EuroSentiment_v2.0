{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!! My husband and I spent three nights in Barcelona after our cruise and we chose to stay at the Hotel Continental on Las Ramblas due to the location and price. WORD OF ADVICE.....DON'T!!!! First the positive....Honestly the only positive things I can say about the hotel are the fact that you get free soft drinks, water and beer while you are there and the location is a plus.The reality....-The rooms were tiny-The rooms were worn and out-dated-The furniture pieces were plastic rubbermaid organizers with a metal sheet on top to create a table. -The bathroom was a little moldy and the cold water was not coming into the shower on the first night. The bathroom itself is bad enough, but the fact that I had to bathe in boiling water is ridiculous.-There were two small towels and two bath towels. No hand towels, tub mat, washcloth or anything of the sort. -Couldn't turn off the heater, so we opted for regulating the temperature with the amount of air coming in from the window-The bed was hard as a rock-The pigeons outside our window would not let us sleep-Getting the toilet to flush toilet paper was a 1\/2 hour ordeal-The key was attached to a ruler, so everyone would leave their keys at the front desk in order not to have to carry the thing all day-The maid smelled so bad you could smell her all the way down the hall and around the corner.Word of advice....pay a little more so you can rest and enjoy your stay in Barcelona.
