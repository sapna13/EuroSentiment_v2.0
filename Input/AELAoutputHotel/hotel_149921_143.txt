{"text":"Arrived with low expectations, and left impressed. After reading the reviews on this site, I was extremely disappointed when I found out my friend arranged for us to stay at the Caribe Hilton. I arrived at the hotel with very low expectations, expecting a has been hotel with old, dirty rooms. To my surprise and delight, my stay at the Caribe was absolutely wonderful! While the hotel was not as polished as other hotels I have stayed in, what it lacked, it made up for in atmosphere. The hotel has a very carribbean\/tropical feel as the hotel's buildings blend with the outdoors. In fact, the lobby and many parts of the hotel are partially outdoors. We booked one of the cheaper ones, but upon arrival asked to stay in the new, renovated Honors Towers that I'd read so much about. The towers feel like their own hotel as they have their own separate lobby\/check-in area. The room was very, very nice for the price. Room was extremely clean, nicely furnished, with a large marble bathroom (with rain head shower). There was a balcony overlooking Old San Juan and a partial view of the beach and ocean. We were told they could only give us a city view, so we were pleasantly surprised. The room included a flat screen tv hanging on the wall, a desk, and an extra chair. There was also a small fridge. The room was of decent size, but I thought the closet was too small, even for only 2 people. We didn't pay for access to the executive lounge, but we were able to gain access since we were staying in the Honors Tower. We had a continental breakfast which consisted of a small selection of pastries, fruit, sandwiches, cereal, and drinks. What I loved about the hotel was how it blended with nature. The hotel grounds are large and nicely designed. Yes, it's true that the hotel grounds have seen better days (when we were there, they were in the process of building\/updating the circular deck that jets out into the ocean), but honestly, the little bit of chipped paint, a few weeds, etc did not detract from the overall beauty of the hotel. When you step outside from the lobby and bar, the first thing you see is a little pond leading to a large pool, and then the ocean behind it. It looks as if you are just a step away from the ocean even when you are still in the lobby. Very picturesque. There is also a garden with a koi pond with lots of fish, some bridges, and a gazebo. I even saw a few swans in the water. There's another smaller pool by the garden as well. The man-made beach is clean, but somewhat small. However, we had no problems finding chaises, and there weren't that many people even on a weekend. Getting a drink on the beach was somewhat slow though. Our waiter took over 40 minutes to come back with our drinks. Other than that, since it's a man-made beach, the current is somewhat blocked off by the wall so the water is much calmer thant the beaches in Condado. Also, there is a hammock area, but I only saw 1 hammock. We didn't try any of the restaurants as we ate in Old San Juan, but the bar in the lobby was pretty good at night (lots of people). There is also a Starbucks in the lobby. The hotel's location isn't the greatest (far from San Juan, and other parts of the island), but it is very close to Old San Juan, which is about a 10-12 minute drive away (it's basically just down the street), and the main Condado area, which is literally a 3 minute drive away. Overall, I had a wonderful stay at the Caribe Hilton and would definitely come back if I'm in San Juan. I also had the pleasure of staying at the Marriott Stellaris in Condado and I can honestly say that while I loved the Marriott, I would choose the Caribe Hilton as it had a more resort feel, which I prefer.
