{"text":"Best Service in MIami I just spent a week at the Mandarin with my partner and my family and we had a terrific time. The rooms are quite luxurious, the service is divine, and the food always brought a smile to our faces.Room--Very comfortable and spacious with a terrific balcony. I especially liked the marble bathrooms! The beds were very easy on the back and the sheets and linens have thread count galore.Maid Service--One of the best parts of the hotel. Rooms are cleaned in a timely fashion and requests can be made with ease for both daily housekeeping and turn-down service. Who can resist the little orchid bud they leave on your bed each night?Restaurants--Quite tasty. Good Asian fusion and we like how grams of protein and calories are listed for several of the choices. Azul is quite upscale, but the cafe downstairs is simple and consistent.Public Spaces--I loved going down for coffee each morning at the coffee bar across from the front desk. The lobby is filled with light and the faint scent of something delicious always hung in the air. The tranquil music was also a good touch.Service--Yes, yes and yes! Miami is not known for its excellent service, but the Mandarin delivers here. Everyone is gracious and willing to work with you to get it done.Price--A bit tricky here. The hotel isn't cheap and the constant add-ons--from the morning coffee to the expensive lunches--added up fast, but it was worth it....Interesting Side-Trip--Check out the Casa Casuarina, which was the Versace Mansion on South Beach. Now it is a private club and hotel. For $175 a person you can spend the day there through an agreement they have with the Mandarin. Yes, a bit pricey, but when else will you be able to swim in Versace's pool replete with gold tiles? Tacky, sure! But what fun!Overall--A great hotel. Two weeks prior to this trip I stayed at the Four Seasons in Miami. The verdict: stay at the Mandarin.
