{"text":"Lousy, Filthy, Smelly. Obstinant and Arrogant Staff. I stayed for 1 month in this hotel. From the onset the place smelled terrible and my sinuses were enflamed by the mildew and mold in the place.The lobby is nicely done for sure but the rooms are shabby, old and small. I was apalled at the condintion of the place. I was so reviled by the filth that I would not let my feet touch the carpet.The mildew smell was unbearable, the rooms and halls have this very old AC with registers dripping condensated moisture all over the hallway floors. I had to buy a fragrant candle and turn off the AC just to have a chance of sleeping.The staff are obstinate, rude and unhelpful. They were unable to coordinate my statement with the arraingments made by their sales staff. I tried 5 times to settle my account according to the agreements made by their sales staff and was still not able to do so. I feel like I was caught in between their own petty internal fight.The restaurants were a complete rip off. I was charged $22 Sing for a bowl of cereal. The staff thought nothing of it. The in house dinner restaurant food was basically inedible, despite some positive comments from collegues and fellow travellers, there is nothing I can recommend there.One thing there is good to say about this place, is the location. But, one can find at least 3 or 4 hotels in the same place and I heartily suggest they do.Do not stay here. ","annotations":[]}
