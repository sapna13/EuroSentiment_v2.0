{"text":"Great for a city break This is a great hotel for a short city break and is an ideal base for exploring Madrid.Due to the central location, we managed to avoid all public transport (a welcome relief!) and were able to get to all the main sites on foot.The hotel is undergoing renovation work (it's not at all intrusive) and so, some rooms are more modern than others. Upon arrival we were allocated a room at the back of the hotel (420) and were really disappointed.. views of a brick wall, shabby carpets and bed linen and the world's smallest shower.We asked to be moved and were given the next available room the following morning. Room 207 was in the freshly renovated part of the hotel and was lovely- all wooden floors, voile curtains, proper views of the street and a decent sized bathroom to boot!(It has to be said that the showers in both of the rooms were excellent... very powerful! ... And that the beds were rubbish! No plush pillows  mattresses here!)Despite having a room that overlooked the street, we weren't really bothered by the noise outside... we heard the rubbish being collected and the odd noisy person but it wasn't intrusive... I'm sure that if staying in summer, sleeping with the windows open would be dreadful.Tea  coffee making facilities aren't immediately available in the room but ask for a coffee kit and you'll be provided with a kettle and all you need. (We went to the bar and asked for fresh milk too...)The communal areas of the hotel are quite charming and well appointed. Breakfast is good - standard cold buffet European fayre on offer. The hotel has a bar but we didn't make use of it; there are lots of fantastic bars and restaurants nearby... Internet access is free (the computer is in the bar\/lounge\/breakfast area). This is a great touch as it makes online check-in possible.. you don't have to pay for the printer and there are no restrictions regarding usage.The staff were friendly and efficient and we were really happy with the service we received. You can book an airport transfer from the hotel for √à√\u2020√ü?0 but they only come on the hour with the minibus doing pick-ups from the other Best Western hotels in Madrid... we decided not to bother and booked a taxi.We looked at lots of hotels before plumping for this one and, after wandering around and seeing most of them, were really glad with our choice.We're going back to Madrid later this year and we'll be making a beeline for this hotel... it's great!
