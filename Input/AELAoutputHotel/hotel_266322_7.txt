{"text":"Motel, NOT hotel This hotel is NOT what its website would have you believe, and it does NOT deserve its star rating.The d√ã√\u2022√ñcor is hideous √à√\u2020\u2022?the walls were painted a dark blue\/red\/purple, and the furniture was shabby. Instead of achieving the mod feeling that they were so obviously trying to achieve, it just looked ugly and dated. The crappy carpet squares didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ fit correctly against the walls, and felt sticky underfoot. The shower was not clean and the water was lukewarm to cool. The toilet basin was not properly attached, and slammed into the wall every time you flushed. The air conditioning didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ work very well at all (kept our room at about 80 degrees when on High), and blew hot air directly at the head of the bed. Additionally, the AC controls were on the ceiling, so you had to pull up a chair to adjust them (not that it did you any good). The bed linens were nice, and the mattress was fairly comfortable. BUT, rather than paying for a duvet cover for the comforter, they simply wrapped it up in two sheets. The sheets, of course, didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stay on the comforter well at all during the night. The end result was that you were sleeping with 3 bunched sheets and one dirty comforter √à√\u2020\u2022?not at all pleasant.The Clarendon Hotel is, quite obviously, a gay hotel. Not a gay-friendly hotel, which we would have welcomed. Instead, we were made to feel very uncomfortable as the only heterosexual couple in the hotel. It didn't help that I am 5 months pregnant, and had to endure God, I HATE breeders! and like comments in the elevator and lobby. The clientele was obviously on the prowl for a one-night stand.The neighborhood is sketchy. There are two doors from the parking area that ought to be locked at all times, but were always open and unlocked during our 5 day stay here, leaving the hotel totally unsecure. When we checked out at 4:00 am, there were 5 different men wandering the halls. One of them even followed us out to our car. Were they guests? People off the street? Who knows? It was very, very creepy.When we got to the front desk to check out, no one was there. We ended up waiting more than 25 minutes for the front desk attendant to arrive, which made us late to the airport. So much for customer service.Do yourself a favor, stay somewhere else. This hotel ruined my romantic vacation.
