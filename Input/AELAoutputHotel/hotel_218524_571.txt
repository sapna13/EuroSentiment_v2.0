{"text":"Excellent without a doubt We arrived at night and were concerned with check in.As we got off the bus we were greeted with a glass of champagne.The front desk was very prompt to get us to our rooms.(Ibar and Hector). As we arrived in our suites they were spotless.Our luggage arrived 5 minutes later. We travelled in a group of 11.Our son's room was at the opposite end of the resort but in the morning he was able to change to the floor below us.We were starving and were able to get pizza at the restaurant until 2:00am.Room service was available 24\/7 and was very quick.The restaurants were very good.If you liked to eat around 6:30 the longest wait was 10 minutes.If you ate at 8:00pm the wait was longer.Every morning the breakfast buffet was in the Toscana restaurant with everything from omelets to pancakes, fresh fruit,beef,chicken,smoothies and champagne.Service was quite good.Lunch was also a buffet in the Toscana,The Grill or Lobster house.The latter two were outdoor restaurants next to the pool.Lunch was again a wide variety and also they had takeout pizza.Breakfast and lunch was casual dress .There was no buffet for dinner but you had the choice of 7 fine restaurants. No reservations required.The Grill and Lobster House were casual dress including shorts for the guys. The Grill was a steak grill and choices were from filet to rib eye,new york strips and a mixture platter with a little everything.Very good. The Lobster House was ok. The appetizers and soup were great but the lobster was a bit soggy.The other restaurants were dressier with long pants being required.The best was the French Chez Isabelle.Food and service was excellent.Toscana and Spice were also very good with a wide variety to choose from.We never got to the Agave or Barcelona.There were bars everywhere and service was top shelf.Polite staff and quick service. Premium liquor and beer.Showtime at night was very entertaining with dance troups,magicians,impersonaters,singers and folklore very professionally done.The pool was probably the highlight. It didn't seem busy as it was more of a winding river. You had to get out early for prime spots but there were plenty of chairs,beds and towels.The swimup bar had excellent service with good seats.The entertainment staff of whom I'll mention( Carlos,Joel,EnisJuan Carlos,Julio,Alexandra,Rosemary,Muriel,Franklin )were the friendliest and most accomodating always helping making your stay an event to remember.Oscar night and the outdoor dinner on the beach was first class.We had homemade soup,pork a roasted hip of beef over fire,salds, desserts ,drinks and great weather.If there was anything to knock it would be the beach as every day the water was very rough great for boogie boarding.The side trips biking, ATV's,Snorkelling and scuba diving were very good and not expensive.We found out that a little tip here and there went a long way. The employee's work hard and put in alot of hours so don't be afarid to tip them.This vacation was a great time for our families and I would return tomorrow.
