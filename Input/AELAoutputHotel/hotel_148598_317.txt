{"text":"Don't waste your time and money Take every bad thing you've read on here about this hotel and put it all together and that would equal the week I just spent at the Westin Rio Mar with my family. Yes we had read the reviews, but because the hotel was free (we were orginally staying at the Hyatt but because it's being renovated they paid for us to stay here, we should have just stayed home) we decided to go through with it. Bad idea. The beach \/pool is nice and well kept, as well as the rooms. However, 4 of 7 days we didn't have maid service before 5pm and had to call for it. I understand that this was their busiest week of the year, but it's not like it's the first time it's been the busiest week of the year. We had called in advance for Christmas Eve and Christmas dinner reservations, not being told that we needed to book for the rest of the week, we were out of luck at eating at the resort because everything was booked. We were sent to Don Pepe's one night...DONT GO. Not only was the service and food awful, the place is a dump, and to top it off we were attacked by dogs and ally cats on the way out.The hotel staff while at first seems helpful, they will stop mid conversation and begin to go do something else before finishing up with you. The weather last week wasn't great, which is obviously not anything that can be controlled, but I believe because of where it is on the island that is why we experienced so much rain. We met a young man on the plane on the way home who had actually stayed at the Hyatt Villas and said they had 1 hour of rain the whole week,I've traveled all over Europe, the Carribean, and the US and this is the one place I can say I will NEVER return. The hotel is not the equivalent of many Westins I have stayed in, mediocre at best. Please feel free to contact me if you'd like specific questions answered before booking this hotel.
