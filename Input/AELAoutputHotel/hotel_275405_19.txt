{"text":"Hotel V - Please Read This Before Booking - Honest Review We have just returned from a New Years break in Amsterdam.As we always use TripAdvisor before we go away - we wanted to make sure that this hotel got an honest review.The only reason we even contemplated this hotel was due to it being a recommended hotel on the Supperclub website - this was a special restaurant\/club that we had booked into over new year and it advertised the Hotel V as a chic, young hotel not far from the centre of Amsterdam.I checked for reviews on Trip advisor and the majority seemed fine - so we went ahead with the booking.I then re-checked the Trip Advisor website a couple of days before going to find several quite bad reviews so we set ourselves up to be disappointed with the hotel.In fact the Hotel was as described and shown on the photo's on the website.I would just consider a few things before booking:There is no elevator in the hotel - we were lucky to be only on the second floor, but if you were unfortunate enough to be on the forth floor - pack light!!!!!The hotel - looks very IKEA-Esque very cool - but very tired!!!!It is quite a distance from the centre (i.e. 15 minute tram journey) so if you want to be right in the thick of the city I wouldn't book this hotel. The Number 25 tram from the stop to the right of the hotel will get you into the centre (dam square, central station etc...).The hotel has very thin walls so can be extremely noisy (i.e. you can hear someone peeing in the next room).The breakfast is an extremely basic continental - but nice that it is included in the price.There are NO tea\/coffee making facilities in the room at all.As the hotel is located in a residential area there is not an awful lot to do on an evening nearby - however there are two places that you must go to:If you love Thai food (as we do) then you must go to the local Thai Restaurant called Krua Buppha, Van Woustraat 241 (turn left out of the hotel, follow the road until the main crossroads, turn left down the hight street and the restaurant is about 5mins walk on the right hand side) - the staff are wonderful, the food was to die for and the locals eat there which is always a good sign!!!!!Also if you fancy a drink (as we all do) then you must visit the little pub not far from the hotel (unfortunately I cannot remember the name of it) We walked past it on New Years Day evening on our way to the above restaurant and could hear lots of people singing and dancing inside and thought that it sounded friendly - so on our way back to the hotel we paid it a visit - wot amazing people - it is obviously a bar for the local residents - us two brits walked in and it didn't go silent like a western with tumble weed whistling round our feet like it would in the UK, we were welcomed with open arms and even given our first round on the house (company rule!!!) and given nibbles and snacks from the New Years buffet - it is for this reason you must pay them a visit the people couldn't have been more hospitable. Now in order to find this bar - turn left out of the hotel, go towards the crossroads, turn left again onto the highstreet, then turn left as soon as you can along the canalside, it is the bar on the corner with the Amstel sign above it - amazing........ send them our regards!!!!!!I hope you find this useful ","annotations":[]}
