{"text":"What a Treasure! The Davanzati is a every bit as good as its reputation suggests. It is ideally situated, with close walking proximity to Ponte Vecchio, Republic Square and the many fine restaurants and shopping boutiques characteristic of the locale. It is not easy to find, but worth every bit of effort to do so.The rooms are clean and comfortable, and the in-room laptops are an excellent innovation. The laneways outside can be a bit noisy, but that is part of the attraction and authenticity of the property. The breakfast\/evening drinks room is quite small, but then so is the hotel. What makes the property a standout is the service; my wife and I travel extensively, and have never stayed in a hotel where the proprietors willingly and expertly deliver so much to their guests. We booked restaurants and trains through the front desk, as well as a walking tour of the principal attractions...nothing new in that, except that this was done by the owners, who also manage the front desk and back-of-house, provide porterage and guidance services, and still have time to chat, and take a genuine interest in their gusests. Fabrizzio and his team are rightly accorded legendary status in the business; the service just cannot be faulted.We would go back to Florence just to stay in the hotel , though of course there is much to see and do in this great city. Thank you Fabrizzio and Tomasso for delivering an experience beyond expectation...one of simple values and execution, all too often overlooked in larger and more ostentatious properties.
