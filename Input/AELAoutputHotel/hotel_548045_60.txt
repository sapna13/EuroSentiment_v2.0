{"text":"Excellent location and good quality Stayed here on business for 8 nights in Feb 2007. This hotel is in a fantastic location, right next to the IFC mall, near the escalators to the mid-levels, and next to the Star Ferry and hydrofoil to Macau. It is not a very touristy hotel, it caters mostly to business travelers. The room was spacious and the bed comfortable. The shower and bathroom were also large and of excellent quality. As with all of the 4S that I have stayed in, the room was equipped with flat screen TV, DVD player, and large desk. The concierge was very helpful, booking us on a Chinese New Years excursion and also giving us directions and help as necessary. All of the staff were extremely well trained and friendly. From day to day, the doormen would remember our prior day's excursions and inquire as to how we enjoyed them.The service in the room was very good, but obtrusive. The doorbell rang consistently, everything from simply asking how we were to refilling the fruit in the bowl to turndown, etc. I should have put on the do not disturb but have honestly never been disrupted as often as I was at any hotel. The reason that this hotel receives a 4 instead of a 5 is room service. The service was wonderful but the food was lacking in variety and quality and was extremely pricey. Traveling on business, I use room service far more frequently than when leisure traveling so this was a concern for me.
