{"text":"Excellent Hotel and Location We have just returned from our first visit to Barcelona. Like others I was concerned to read some of the reviews of the hotel but on arrival our fears were quickly allayed. We were welcomed by very friendly reception staff and were delighted with our room on the sixth floor - a really good sized room with double bed, small sitting area, mini bar with reasonably priced drinks, large marble tiled bathroom with shower and - best of all - a spacious terrace with seating which overlooked the rooftops. The room was also air-conditioned. The hotel is ideally situated just yards from Placa Catalunya and the top of La Rambla - all the tour buses leave from here and the nearest metro station is a couple of minutes walk. Despite being close to all the action the hotel is really quiet - very few cars pass by on street outside - it is really only for taxis dropping off and picking up - and so we had four nights of very peaceful sleep. Breakfasts were wonderful - an excellent range of hot and cold dishes and the most wonderful little pastries which were baked on the premises. The staff were so friendly and helpful and constantly ensured that there were sufficient supplies of everything and also walked round topping up coffees. A lovely light dining area with quiet music in the background ensured that we had a really nice start to the day - plus a little glass of the cava that was available was also a nice little luxury! We made use of the bar on a couple of the evenings and the barman was delightful - couldn't have been more helpful and was so friendly. Also on the day of our departure the reception staff were really helpful - storing our luggage while we had a last walk before leaving for our flight - and then calling a taxi and taking our luggage out - special thanks to the really friendly bellboy. I could not recommend this hotel more highly - it really contributed so much to our first visit to Barcelona - and I would have no hesitation in returning there.
