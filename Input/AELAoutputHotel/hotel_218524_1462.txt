{"text":"In a nutshell... avoid avoid avoid For my 15th wedding anniversary, I wanted something very nice. I read the reveiws here and other places. It looked like a solid choice. I'm an international airline pilot, so I think I can be fair here. Our 60 minute ride from Punta Cana Airport was gut churning, as our driver dodged the minefield of potholes (as other drivers passed him). We were happy to arrive in one piece and thought we'd grab a nice lunch. How about a hotdog or pizza (the other 7 restaurants were closed until dinner). I paid $300 per night. Not too impressive. If you're not into tatoos, budweiser, and poor service you may want to take a pass on this one... To the room... there were parts strewn across the floor from the broken jacuzzi under repair. tin meenutes senior.. OK no sweat... 30 minutes later they had it buttoned up. After getting a short nap, we jumped into the jacuzzi... bam bam bam at the door. We need to fix. Water is pouring in downstairs on a guest... The food was, well... awful, with the lone exception of the Bordeaux Restaurant, wich was very good. If the Bordeaux was an 8 (out of 10), the other restaurants were a 2 (and that's generous). Ah, but we're there for the sun and fun... Let's go horseback riding. Sorry amigo, the next 3 days are already full (I thought this was the off season). OK, let's go take the catamaran out. What? Only one available.. but not today. Go to Sunscapes by cab and you can rent one there... ahh wasn't this supposed to be an all-inclusive? Another couple we met suggested we lower our expectations early and it won't be too bad. Another couple, an Army West Pointer and his wife on their honeymoon were as underwhelmed  as we were. Another guest we befriended made a trip to the doctor for food poisoning. Me, well, I'm on my 4th dose of Immodium as I try to recover from the food. Yep, my wife is in the same boat. Over the course of our 4 day stay, I let the managers (Raphael  Daniel) know how terrible the service was. Daniel said he disagreed... What can you say.. Only laugh and pass it on to you folks here. In fairness, they did comp a massage and the phone charges... But that's about it. If you enjoy a good drink, be sure to bring one along. The liquor was bottom shelf (good stuff extra) and the add a lot of water to them. I read some of the glowing reveiws here, but my experience is what it was. The beach is beautiful. The locals are very nice. Still for the money, I would not go back. I have heard that other parts of the island (like Romana) are wonderful. I'd look there instread of Punta Cana. My view. FWIW.
