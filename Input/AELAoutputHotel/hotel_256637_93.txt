{"text":"Wonderful Stay at the Sheraton! Booked our rooms via the hotel's website. We had a Romantic Package, so had an upgrade to a Hype Park View room, which was absolutely fantastic!! The BED is as awesome as the hotel claims to be!! Super-comfortable, made it a bit difficult to wake up in the mornings! We also had a gift of wine  cheese sent to our room (I did request no blue cheese, but my request was ignored, still- it was a gift, so I'm not too bothered).Room was excellent: spacious, clean, and it felt very luxurious. There's a small walk-in closet which was a nice touch, and the black marble bathroom (separate bath  shower) was great!! There's also a little seating  working area which gave the room that extra oomph. We had breakfast at the hotel cafe, my hubby really enjoyed it, but I'm not much of a breakfast person, although I did try the order-to-cook omelette which was very nice!! Check-in was handled efficiently, and the concierge was very happy to store our luggage for us. One thing that I'll point out- the concierge don't seem to have the latest tourist info leaflets, so make sure you stop by a Tourist Information centre. The night staff was a bit clueless, and whilst polite, wasn't very helpful.Location is fantastic!! Smack bang in the centre of the city, easy access to all public transportation. Although all shopping areas  Darling Harbour is only a close walk away. Overall an excellent experience at Sheraton on the Park!! Will have to try the Four Points by Sheraton on our next trip only because we are absolutely in love with Darling Harbour!
