{"text":"We put Sweden on the map in best hotel in New York. We decide to visit New York and saw an article about Hotel QT in a swedish magazine. It sounds like a good choise. We made reservation on the hotels website. It did work very well. We printed out the reservation and took it with us in cause of any trouble. We alsow did a calculation on the tax, so we knew how much the final bill would end up. No surprices could destroy our trip. We came to the hotel friday afternoon and the check in was very easy, they were very friendly. We stayed there for six nights. We have heard that the rooms was small. We have been traveling in europe a lot and to us it was not a problem. We have been staying in smaller room than his. If your in New York, how much time are you gonna spend in the room? I think most of us are there for another reason than stay in a room.Our room was very nice, we hade choosen alternitve E. It had all we could ever ask for. Our small window was in the direction of roofs and another building. Breakfast was better then we expected. It was served bagels, yoghurt , jam, fruits, egg, juice, milk, coffee or tea.Our cleaning lady was very friendly. If she saw us on our way out in the mornings she asked if she could clean and always wished us a nice day.The bar downstairs was very crowed sometimes and loud but we on the eight floor didn't hear a thing. Downstair the also had an ATM machine and two computors with internet access.The location was the best. A few steps from Times Square. In the centre of all but at the same time not. When we came from the airport Newark. We ended up at the station at Port Authority with the airport bus. From their we had to walk five blocks to the hotel. It's not a problem not even when we on our way home had to walk to the bus with a lot more stuff we had bought.Summary. I can highly recomend this hotel to anyone on their way to New York. It is clean and freash.
