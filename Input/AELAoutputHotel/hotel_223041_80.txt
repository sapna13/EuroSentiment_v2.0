{"text":"3-star hotel in a 5-star location Stayed 9 nights in Elan early December with my husband as a post-surgery recovery stay before flying back home. Rooms = small, but the bed is great and large. Decoration is very simple and modern. Walls are too thin as usual, so you end up hearing your neighbor's conversation. Hopefully we were on the top floor. One big problem is the central air-conditionning system = it is very loud and noisy and you cannot switch it off in your room. So we had to change room and bought some tape and cartoon to fix it in front of the air opening.Value = I won't say the breakfast is free as advertised by the hotel as for sure they factored the cost into the room price. For information, we went to the Sofitel nearby and asked for the room price and it comes only USD 60 more expensive per night but you have a truly 5-star hotel service and amenities. So good value if you take the location into consideration.Extra = mandatory valet parking (by the way check your bill carefully as we rented a car for the 1st day only and they charged us valet parking = USD 15 for our entire 9 nights stay although we had no car anymore), a small but convenient gym with a TV and a PC free to use for hotel guests.Location = great location as we did not have a car. Walking distance of Beverly Center, Beverly Connection, Cedars Sinai Hospital, Farmers Market. I also took the buses to go around the area (Getty Center, Warner Studio Tour) and it was no problem at all. But don't count on the hotel to provide you this information as they won't have any idea.
