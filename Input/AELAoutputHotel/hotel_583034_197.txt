{"text":"Very dissapointing... My husband and I were spending our Anniversary and my 50th Birthday for 9 days at the Paradisus Palma Real. We really looked forward to this trip, the Hotel Website made it look wonderful. It was so far from that. The Hotel, the grounds, pools and ocean were lovely. The problem was the staff, management and then some. No one had a clue. We booked a Master Suite with the Royal Service, including a Butler, private beach area, pool, etc. When we arrived there, they said there was no such thing. I showed them the paperwork we received from them booking exactly that. They told us it was a mistake. Well, I was not a happy camper. We had a choice of one or the other. So we took the suite on the opposite end of the resort without the butler service. When we arrived at our room, the fans didn't work, the internet service never worked and was never fixed as promised the whole 9 days we were there, and my husband had to work through his cell phone to connect, costing us well over $1,000. dollars. The restaurants were ok, food was edible., we've had better at other all-inclusives. Most of the slot machines in the casino were broken, the table dealers were so fast, you could not even see what was going on, they watched you like a hawk and everyone lost money, it was not fun and they made you feel very uncomfortable. It's very sad that such a lovely place can be run so poorly. And.....they didn't care. They knew you were already there and couldn't leave to go anywhere else, so it was your tough luck. The Spa was awful. The Staff was rude, it was expensive and you did not get what you were payed for. No one there had a clue. I went to there to have my hair done and cried when I walked out. I could write more about mishaps, but it could take quite awhile. I would NOT recommend this resort. The best time I had was boarding a plane home back to the states. Try Secrets\/Excellance in Mexico....Much, much, better! ","annotations":[]}
