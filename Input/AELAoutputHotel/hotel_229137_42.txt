{"text":"Great Neighborhood, Good Hotel My first impression of this hotel was very positive. The hotel was walkable from the train station, about 10-15 minutes and is a great way to immediately get a sense of the neighborhood in which you will be staying. The staff checked us in promptly and the bellman took our bags up to the second floor. I didn't see an elevator during our stay and we were always using the stairs, so not sure if there is one. Both desk agent and bellman were friendly and helpful, so no issues here.Room #115 was at the back of the hotel. They call this the quiet side of the hotel. Which is really just a way of saying there is no view, unless you count the skylight of the kitchen below, a view. The room was decorated nicely with nice deep red colors and fluffy down comforters. It looked a bit like a brothel, which I thought was kind of interesting, considering the city we were in. It felt cozy, very small, but cozy. I have stayed at a variety of hotels in Europe and this one is smaller than most. I wondered why there was so much furniture in the room, (bed, 2 chairs, desk, 2 nightstands and table), which only made it seem smaller. Maybe if it was cleared out a bit it would have felt larger. The bathroom was a great size, with plenty of room and all the normal amenities to keep you from bringing your entire bathroom. My favorite feature in the room was the coffee maker. This might seem a bit trivial, but, as an American travelling to Europe, one of the things I really enjoy is great coffe almost everywhere you go and it was nice to have a proper coffee maker in the room. It was a Nespresso machine that could brew you espresso, coffees and teas. Easy to use with a lot of selections!Breakfast was ok, very standard fare for a European Hotel. Pastries, juices, meats and cheeses. Although the chef\/cook, did come out to each table to ask if there was anything additional or special he could prepare, that was not already out on the buffet. The hotel staff were friendly enough, although I get a feeling they were not completely happy with Americans. I am very sensitive to this subject, as it comes up often enough, lately, while travelling in Europe, so I am careful to be, almost over courteous, and still felt a bit affected by the overall attitude. The best reason to stay at this hotel is the location. Situated outside the city center, you are close enough to walk to all attractions, but still able to enjoy the quietness and local feel to the area. There are a few Dutch restaurants on the hotels, recommendation list and found two of them to be outstanding. The De Reiger and Clais Claisz, hope I am remembering these correctly, were outstanding, with De Reiger being the better of the two.All in all, I think the hotel is, just a bit overpriced, but would stay here again.
