{"text":"Mixed feelings A good location, as others have said, direct on the U-Bahn, and it is easy to walk to the attractions, especially all of the Christmas Markets (our favourite was on the Operplatz on Unter den Linden)A good room, not massive, but plenty enough. Only one disturbance, with a particularly fretful child one morning, but we did not consider this to be a problem.The breakfasts were OK, except of course for the tea. Germans cannot do tea. They think they can, they have fancy packets that they put into fancy tea pots - but it's awful. Drink the coffee, it is at least passable.I think that the real problem we had was with the staff. They were smart, they tried, they did their best. One girl at breakfast was brilliant, but when we asked for cooked ham (and we both speak German) the waiter came out with raw ham, we said never mind. He went back with it and in earshot, he got shouted at by the women in the kitchen, who told him he should have confirmed whether it was cooked or raw ham. We felt sorry for him.On the staff side again, they were friendly, in their own way, but not knowledgeable. We wanted a Catholic Church, they did not know, and we ended up getting advice from a guard at the Berliner Dom (a protestant church) and a policeman in the area of the St Hedwig Kirche, which turned out be be quite close to the hotel.All in all, we would go back again, based on location and price, and would recommend it, as the area is quiet and safe.
