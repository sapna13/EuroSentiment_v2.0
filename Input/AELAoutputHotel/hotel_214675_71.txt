{"text":"Very Pleased This hotel is an excellent value. After reading some of these reviews I was somewhat apprehensive about our travel agents choice but must admit she new what she was talking about. The room was clean, quiet and air conditioned with a view of Waikiki, the beach and Diamond Head. Our room had a kitchenette with a small fridge, microwave and sink and was stocked with a coffee maker, plates, cups  silverware.We found the service to be excellent. The staff was professional and kind. Upon arrival we noticed the fridge wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ cold so called the front desk, left for the day and returned to a cold fridge and a note telling us of the service call. Never experienced more than a 3-4 minute wait for the elevators. You must use your room key to operate the elevator and there was a bit of confusion among guests figuring out how to do that their first time.The location is excellent. Bus stops are close with most buses running up and down Kuhio. The Food Pantry (grocery store) is a short bus ride away and there you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l find fresh mangoes and anything else you need for meals in your room. There is a car rental 1 block away. The beach is a lovely stroll across a park which takes you past the post office so why not mail your post cards on the way.For those with Military affiliation the Hale Koa Hotel is a block away making it convenient to use the gym, the exchange (best prices on souvenirs and groceries) and enjoy the restaurants but you are required to show proof of military eligibility.We would stay here again without hesitation.
