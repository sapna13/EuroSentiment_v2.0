{"text":"In the middle of a lot of people in Times Square! We ended our trip from Washington DC to Philadelphia to NYC at Times Square for 2 nights. The Hilton was a very nice stay with a great view of the city! The staff were very friendly the moment we arrived. The baggage attendant was very helpful with directions and advice on which subway route to take to the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. Whenever we would go to the main lobby, we were greeted by staff. The hotel was very clean, had fun sculptures and art, and was decorated very modern. The room was spacious, quiet, clean, and the bed was super comfortable. Depending on which room you stay in, you can see into other people's room next to you. Make sure if you do not want to be seen to close your curtain (we noticed we could see into our neighbor's room very easily if we were standing in our room in a certain spot). Depending on your cell phone provider, if you are on a top floor, you may not get good reception (that is what the front desk told us). There was a refrigerator in the room fully stocked...anytime you took something out it would automatically keep track and charge the item to the room. If you didn't want the items from the minibar, there was a Pax across the street with lots of good food (I suggest getting a pizza late at night and taking it back up to your room for a snack!). We had no problem getting cabs, the attendants would have one ready by the time you got down to the street. The hotel is very convenient to any show, walking distance. However, if you stay in the Times Square area expect a lot of people. You are shoulder-to-shoulder on the street and it makes walking around a little difficult. Granted, NYC is full of people, but Times Square is crammed with people! I'm glad we stayed in Times Square, but once is enough for me. The Hilton is a great place to stay if you choose to stay in this area!
