{"text":"A little gem We stayed at the Rendezvous for 8 nights in mid-September as part of a group of about 14 who went up to Singapore to celebrate a 50th birthday! (Don't ask!)From photos on the Internet, I was dubious about the hotel (a little) but reassured by the comments here. I needn't have worried. We have stayed in hotels worth 6 or 7 times as much per night, and NOT enjoyed them the way we enjoyed the Rendezvous.LOCATIONCouldn't be better if you tried. At the end of Orchard Road, on the corner of Bras Basah and Bencoolen. Easy walking distance to Orchard Road shops, Bugis Street markets, the Raffles, even Clarke and Boat Quays, Arab Street and Canning Park (you must see the Battle Box museum!). we only caught taxis to Mustafa's in Little India. Despite the humidity, we walked up to 7 hours a day!!! (And we're no spring chickens!) Just over the road is an Asian-style food hall called Kopitiam (coffee time -- get it?), which sells fresh, tasty, filling and authentic meals -- from Vietnamese to Thai to Chinese to Indian and even Italian! -- for an average of about $4.00 Sing. a meal. The banana split is a favourite -- 3 scoops ice-cream, a banana, whipped cream, nuts, cherries and syrup -- for Sing. $3.80! A large bottle of beer (Heineken) is just $5.60 Sing.FACILITIESMeals -- breakfast included on our trip was quite outstanding. Buffet-style, it included scrambled eggs, chicken chipolatas, waffles\/pancakes\/French toast, one daily special (chili con carne, baked beans, beef hash), bacon; then a fresh section where the chefs cooked eggs to your request (omelettes, fried etc.); Indonesian noodles or rice; Singapore noodles; fresh fruit; juices; iced milk; cold meats and cheeses; salad; tomatoes; sweet pastries of all types; miso soup; congee; toast; tea and coffee. Not bad, huh.There's a pool and spa outdoors; a gym with good (underused) exercise facilities; a sauna; and a pool seating area with room service.Power adaptors in your room let you plug in most voltage-compatible appliances (like our mobile phones).The bar is staffed by a lovely young lady (when we were there) and drinks are two-for-one during happy hour (which is about 11.30 am to 8.00 pm). They're still expensive though -- but that's endemic to Singapore! (Our friends paid $108 for a bottle of WA wine in a restaurant that we can buy here -- in Perth -- for AUD$12.95 on special at Liquorland!)THE ROOMClean, clean, clean. It looked nice, felt nice and smelled nice! We were on the third floor (Storey three according to the talking lift :-)), a non-smoking floor. Our room overlooked Bencoolen Street. It isn't flash, or the most modern, but it is comfortable. EXCEPT that the bed was hard -- and I mean hard. However, after two nights our bodies adjusted and we slept the sleep of the righteous after that! The bathroom was clean, the water hot and plentiful and, as usual, the bar ridge ridiculously small :-) Just throw out their stuff and stock it with your own. The TV is quite small, but in keeping with the room (which is not huge by any standards) and the cable TV stations available for free are reasonable rather than lavish. If you like sport, you're well catered for!SERVICEThis was the pub's highlight. The people are genuinely lovely, especially the cleaning staff. They are also very efficient. We would go down to breakfast, then go back up to find our room totally serviced, cleaned, bed turned down, deodorised and ready to go. Wonderful stuff. Curiously, though, keep an eye on your toilet tissue. It must be expensive because it isn't renewed until both rolls (there are two) are almost gone. However, they always made it in time :-)RANDOM TIPSThe coffee shop in the atrium\/courtyard is expensive. You can do MUCH better than $6.00 a cup of coffee!The money changer in the same location will negotiate on price, depending on how much you want to change. Don't take the exchange board at face value!The 7\/11 over the road in Bencoolen Street is very convenient -- but hideously expensive! Ask for directions to a Cold Storage or Carrefours store; there are two within 10 minutes' walking time from the hotel. Munchies, drinks etc. are much cheaper.Taxis are cheap and very well airconditioned. Strongly recommended.Well, that's about it.Would I go back to the Rendezvous? You bet -- in a heartbeat.(BTW, the taxi drivers don't say it in the French way Ron-day-voo; they say it the way it looks! Ren-dez-voos won't get you any blank looks! :-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":607,"mention":"Raffles","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Raffles_Hotel"],"startOffset":600},{"endOffset":913,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":907},{"endOffset":913,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":907},{"endOffset":1023,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1016},{"endOffset":1115,"mention":"banana split","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Banana_split"],"startOffset":1103},{"endOffset":1152,"mention":"ice-cream","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ice_cream"],"startOffset":1143},{"endOffset":1256,"mention":"Heineken","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Heineken_Premium_Light","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Heineken"],"startOffset":1248},{"endOffset":1441,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1436},{"endOffset":1477,"mention":"chili con carne","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chili_con_carne"],"startOffset":1462},{"endOffset":1673,"mention":"iced","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Iced_bun"],"startOffset":1669},{"endOffset":1709,"mention":"salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":1704},{"endOffset":1735,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":1727},{"endOffset":1759,"mention":"miso soup","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Miso_soup"],"startOffset":1750},{"endOffset":1767,"mention":"congee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Congee"],"startOffset":1761},{"endOffset":1774,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1769},{"endOffset":1779,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1776},{"endOffset":1790,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1784},{"endOffset":3675,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":3669}]}
