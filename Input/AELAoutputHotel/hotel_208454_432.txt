{"text":"Mixed feelings, My expectations where too high. I have stayed at other Sofitels before, and the Chicago Sofitel many times. My expectations were very high because T.A. ranked the New York Sofitel best luxury hotel in America and #12 in the world, which it definetly is not. I think that is why I was disappointed. The New York Sofitel was nice, but not as nice as other Sofitels. No comparison to the Chicago Sofitel. We booked through expedia and did get a very good rate, so maybe they gave us one of their worst rooms. Our very old T.V didn't work very well, but they came up quickly to try and fix it. They offered to move us to another room, but the TV wasn't that important to us. We were told they will be updating the rooms soon, which needs to be done. On the plus side, I would stay at the NY Sofitel again and recommend it, but only if the price was right. The beds were very comfortable just like all Sofitel beds. Very clean rooms. The service was very good and quick. The staff was above average for Sofitel. This is just by comparison. In my experience some of the Sofitels front desk staff, (usually the staff from France) can be abrupt, but that is part of the French feel right. Well not in New York. Everyone was very nice, friendly and helpful. Another big plus was having The Red Flame restaurant so close. We were able to get coffee and breakfast to go to bring back to the hotel for the slowpokes. Saved us lots of time and $$$.
