{"text":"Something Different! On a recent trip from Sydney to Amsterdam, we decided to have a one night stop-over in Singapore to break the trip. Having done the same thing last year we wanted to do something a little different and as we only had the one night  not particularly interested in shopping, we chose to stay near the Airport.Changi Village is just that. Small, mostly outdoor restaurants  small shops plus a giant food hall  markets. Very different to downtown Singapore.The Changi Village Hotel was fine. We did not hear planes flying overhead at all. We had asked for a quiet room  that is what we got. The hotel is not 5 star but more than adequate. The room was a good size, clean  overlooked the golf course. We ate a buffet breakfast in the hotel and there was a good selection to choose from. We also organised a late check out (6pm) as we did not fly out till after 11pm. This cost us an extra $S80 but well worthwhile. During our day in Changi we took a bum boat to the nearby island of Pulau Ubin. Not a lot there but you can hire bikes or just walk around the island which is not a bad idea given that you know you are going to spend 12 hours sitting on a plane after already sitting for 8 hours the previous day!We ate at one of the outdoor restaurants. It was fine. There are a few up-market places if you prefer.All in all a good place to stop off if you are looking for something a little bit different. ","annotations":[]}
