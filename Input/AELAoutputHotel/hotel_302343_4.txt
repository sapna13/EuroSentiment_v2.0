{"text":"Love their service and enviroment Me and my boyfriend, my younger sis and her hubby first time going to a trip together. We stay at the hotel for 3 nights, the hotel enviroment was very nice with very tight security, staff was very polite. The swimming pool was really big, But one thing that we wasn't happy was that w arrived there in the morning as its too early so we can't check in to the hotel. So we waited at the lobby hopefully they can help us to do a early check in and indeed the reception staff was very good she give us 1 room first so that we can check in to rest for a while and get changed. Nearby the hotel has a lot of shops for us to do shopping, Please don't go to the shop just 2 steps away from the kentucky fried chicken restaurant. i think the shop is called Rusty or Volcom. when i was about to pay for a tshirt that i really like, I found some stain on the collar and so I ask the staff to get me a new piece and she wasn't very happy and use indonesian language to talk to her collegue saiding something bad about me. My boyfriend saw it and wasn't happy so my boyfriend drag me out of the shop and said don't buy since they not happy getting a new piece for me. The staff there is really very rude, please don't go to that shop to have the same bad experience like me. For massage you can go to the one next to a coffeehouse just another few steps away from kentucky fried chicken restaurant. their massage is good and cheap service also good. At night after all the shop is closed nothing for you to do you can go to their central stage to have a drink and listen to the songs that the liveband sang, the liveband is really good. I really like the hotel and place will go back there again.
