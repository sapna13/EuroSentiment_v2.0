{"text":"Beautiful grounds, shabby rooms Stayed in Nusa Dua for 4 days. Upon arriving at the hotel we were told our room would be ready in half an hour and given a welcome drink in the lobby. After 30 mins we were told it would be another 30 mins. This continued for 1.5 hours until we became frustrated and asked to be told exactly when we could check-in rather than waiting around like lemons.We were then taken to a room past building work that was going on. Our room was dirty, the bathroom had not been cleaned properly and it smelt a bit funny. We complained and were moved to another room which was an improvement but was not as nice as a 3* place we had just come from in Legian (for half the price)!Despite this initial frustration, the grounds are beautiful and the pools are very nice. The water is very clear on the beach but you cannot swim out very far. The gym is well equipped and the tennis courts were available for a small fee (you can even pay for a partner if your spouse is busy sunbathing!).The hotel is completely self-contained with various restuarants on-site all serving good food at reasonable western prices (though not like prices in Legian restaurants). There are outdoor shows on twice a week with an amazing buffet dinner. We went to the Balinese theatre show and both the food and the entertainment were first class.If it weren't for the poor service and the rooms which were not up to standard this hotel would have been rated 4 or 5, just expected better for the money we paid out.
