{"text":"The Library - A Delightful Find We stayed at The Library Hotel for 4 nights in early October 2007 on our one-year anniversary trip. It was perfect, absolutely perfect. We would definitely stay at The Library on our next visit to NYC. The hotel is located on the corner of Madison and 41st, a block away from Grand Central Station and a block (maybe 2) away from the New York Public Library. We walked to and from Times Square, Murray Hill, and more, and never needed to catch a cab. We used the subway, when necessary.The lobby area of The Library was clean and never felt crowded. We thought the front desk staff and concierges were exceptional. They never steered us in the wrong direction in recommending places to go and sites to see. They were friendly and always available - a big help.Our room was located on the 6th Floor, with a medical theme. It was small, as you'll read in other reviews that the rooms are small, but the hotel website gives clear descriptions of the different room options available. We chose a smaller room, because we figured we wouldn't be spending much time there. (We were right.) The room was clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated. In other words, it was everything we expected. The hotel provides robes, slippers, and bathroom accesories to include a hair dryer, Q-tips and cotton balls - all nice touches. At night, there is turn-down service. We hardly heard any noise or goings about on the street, even on Sunday morning when there was a parade nearby.Other positives about The Library: there was continental breakfast on the 2nd floor every morning with breads, pastries, cereal, fresh fruits, juices, and coffee. Every afternoon, in the same room, the hotel puts on a wine and cheese hour. Just a few feet away, it has 2 computers with Internet access for checking e-mail, online flight check-in, etc. The rooftop bar attracts a younger crowd, mostly locals, it seems. It was very trendy. All in all, The Library was a delight. In the past, I've stayed at the Waldorf Astoria. While I'd never knock the Waldorf, The Library is in the same league, as far as I'm concerned. I really enjoyed the boutique experience.
