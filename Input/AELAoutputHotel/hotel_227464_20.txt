{"text":"balcony adventures and beautiful people We arrived in Catalunya on the Sunday evening of my birthday and I was immediately impressed with the Hotel location. Whilst central and very close to La Ramblas, the Regina enjoys the quiet luxury of being on a street slightly off the main thoroughfare and is therefore not too full on when you don't want it to be.A one minute walk away is the tour bus stop, from where you can gain access to the wondrous cultural and historic sights of Barca. I'd never been on a tour bus but trust me, in Barcelona it is so nice to just tour and jump off at a place you fancy.The room itself was spacious, very clean and well maintained and stylish. Personally I really enjoyed the balcony. Standing there at bedtime or in the morning before heading out and consuming the sights and sounds of such a brilliant place, the different characters and local people just going about their daily business was fascinating.Thinking about it now, I really am not sure if I have ever slept in a more comfy bed. Such good sleep, it was real proper comfort.I also received cake and Cava on my birthday, which was an unexpected surprise and a lovely gesture. The staff at the Regina were great. My lasting impression is of a quiet confidence and professionalism. I was highly impressed on our check out day. I mean OK, most hotels (good ones) have a luggage room but on our check out day I did not feel hassled at all. There was no rush and we were still being treated as guests. We had a small issue with our flight and the super people at reception let us use the hotel phone and generally cared and concerned that we were OK. Bear in mind that this was AFTER we had stopped being paying customers. Now that's how the hotel world should be.
