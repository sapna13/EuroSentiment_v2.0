{"text":"Honestly, I loved it Some people wrote bad reviews, and I don't really understand why. It was beautiful. I walked down the beach for an hour, and, honestly, we had the best resort (at least in that direction). The other resorts' beach (down that way) had murky water, a lot more seaweed and even pine needles all over the sand. So we had a good spot.The beach buffet was wonderful -- so much selection and an amazing view of the beach. The palm trees, the tiki huts, the music, the entertainment team that never stopped, it was an amazing vibe! This IS the reason I love the Caribbean -- the ambiance -- and this resort definitely had it. The other resorts (that I saw) were deserted.The dinner buffet was good, but I didn't try everything. Honestly, I just like to stick to chicken, or steak, salad and mangos! They had amazing crepes and the omlettes were good too. I didn't do the a la carte restaurant -- except the Brazilian -- which was very good too. Make room for the beef (at the end) -- it was the BEST part.The club Mangu was fun. Main floor was mainly locals playing salsa, merengue, bachata and reggaeton. The top floor was more tourists (from Occidental and other resorts) and played house. It was a good time. Try to request building 12, 13 or 25, 26 -- I think those are the renovated ones. Maybe people who complained had unnrenovated rooms. Ask for the top floor -- I liked it because of the high ceiling.I loved this resort. I wish I was still there. I went there for paradise, and it truly was.
