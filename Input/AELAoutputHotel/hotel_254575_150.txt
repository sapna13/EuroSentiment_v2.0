{"text":"Ideal Location for touring London We just got back from a three night stay here in Late October. Once again I trusted TripAdvisor, and I wasn't disappointed. We flew to London into Gatwick Airport, took the Gatwick Express from the airport (which is simple and very efficient) and arrived at Victoria Station in 30 minutes. My wife and I had luggage but we still decided to walk from the train station to the hotel, reading other reviews that said it would take 10 minutes. The hotel was very easy to find and it only took 10 minutes as promised. Upon arrival at 10:30 AM, our room was ready and we were allowed to check-in. The hotel is in a quiet, residential neighborhood. We asked for a room on a lower floor, due to the fact there is no elevator and we got it. The room wasn't very big, but it was very clean and we didn't plan on spending too much time in the room so it worked out great. There is no air-conditioning, but we didn't need it in October. Wireless internet is available, but it's not free, unless you can get a signal from a nearby establishment, which we could!! There is, however, a computer for all guests to use on the first floor, but you may have to wait for it. Breakfast was served from 7-8:30 everyday in the downstairs dining room and it was very good, and it was included with your room. If you are in town to tour London, this is a great location. There are two Underground (Subway) stations within a 10 minute walk (Pimlico and Victoria). From Victoria you can get anywhere in the city quickly. The Underground is very easy to use and very clean, I recommend you buy and Oyster Card when you arrive, put 20 Pounds on it and use it on every trip. The Oyster completely refunds any unused funds on you card when your stay in London ends. If you are American, you know the dollar is getting killed against the pound, so anyway to save a bit is key. This hotel was 85 pounds a night, which is really good for central London. I have absolutely no complaints and would stay here again.
