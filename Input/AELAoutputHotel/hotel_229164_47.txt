{"text":"Took a chance on the D I stayed at the Ambassade on my last trip to A'dam and liked it fine, but was unwilling to pay the much higher rates there now. The location of the Dikker  Thijs just a block from the Leidesplein was a big plus, and their rates were much more favorable--AND included breakfast which the other hotel did not, AND included a free ticket to either the Van Gogh or the Rijksmuseum (my choice). Decided to try it. Glad I did.  I requested a non-smoking room, preferably on a high floor overlooking the canal. As usual, they couldn't guarantee it but would try. I said the high floor over a canal was negotiable but the non-smoking room was not, that I would look elsewhere if they wouldn't guarantee it. After two e-mail exchanges, the nice reservations mgr promised to block off a non-smoking room for me. And she did.I also got a great room--504--on the top floor except for the penthouse. Very big. (I'd only asked for a single.) It had a balcony with a great view over the rooftops and canals. My one Dutch friend came over and checked it out and was impressed. What's the catch, you're wondering? There's only one. It wasn't air conditioned. I understand some of the rooms are; this one wasn't. It was unseasonably balmy in A'dam (global warming), but nights were breezy and cool, and I kept the door to the balcony open, so it was fine. And there was also a tall, rotating fan in the room which I turned on but pointed away from the bed, as I don't like wind blowing on me.Breakfast was plentiful and good. It didn't vary, but as I was there for only 3 nights, that didn't matter. The staff was courteous. It's an old fashioned hotel in that they want the key turned into them whenever you leave the hotel, but I had no problem with that. They were prompt with their wake-up call and in calling a taxi for me on my last morning. I have no complaints about this hotel. I would stay there again, although if it were in the dead of summer, I'd want an air conditioned room more than a room with a view.
