{"text":"Wonderful stay I had high expectations of Le Meurice given the cost but I can confirm these were exceeded in every way.We booked 2 de luxe adjoining rooms for 3 nights for me, my wife and children (13 and 11). These were courtyard rooms as I wanted peace at night and they were indeed very quiet. The rooms were well appointed, very comfortable and spacious. The bathrooms were opulent and spacious as well.The welcome was most unParisian-warm and helpful-nothing was too much trouble. There was always plenty of staff to deal with every query we had.The concierge staff were truly outstanding-we had a long list of things we needed and they were equal to the tasks in every way. Their restaurant recommendations were particularly good.We ate a number of excellent meals in the hotel including one dinner in the 3 star restaurant. The cost of dinner is eye watering particularly if you choose a decent wine but it is worth every penny. I've had a large number of meals in many top class restaurants but this has to be in my top 3 ever. My 11 yo son is still telling people his langoustines were the nicest thing he has ever tasted. Finally, the location is second to none-everything you need to see is within walking distance if the weather is ok.If Le Meurice can maintain these standards there really is nowhere else to stay in Paris-and I've been to the George V.One other point which you may find useful-don't bother with Angelina's next door. Despite allegedly having the best cakes and hot chocolate in Paris, it failed again (I'd had lunch there with clients last time I was in Paris) - noisy, poor quality cakes, awful service and expensive. We had Le Meurice's afternoon tea which was everything it should have been though pricey but worth it.
