{"text":"Good yes, but #1 in NOLA, no way! Location: Not too far off the Quarter but still have to cross Canal St to get there and a easy walk. Close to Harrahs Casino and a great hole in the wall restaurant, Mothers, that is a must eat, and right around the corner. Try Lil Dizzy's for lunch... you will like. Good and cheap. Of course, Commanders Palace is a must do if you've never been...pace yourself.Hotel\/Service: Lobby very pleasant, free wi-fi and plenty of rest areas. Front Desk staff very cordial. Small bar but warm and welcoming bartender-Thanks Jimmy for the Swamp Water. Pool area is nice for relaxing but pool itself is small (9'x13'), shallow (4') and described as a relaxation pool (get in, get out). Valet's were courteous and helpful in loading\/unloading the cars. Don't bother with the free continental breakfast--get yourself to Mothers! Lots of Historic vibe with quaint exposed beams, pipes, and old machinery. Great use of skylights throughout. Very small work out area.Room: #341. Horrible smoking smell even though the room was Non Smoking. We had a king size bed and you could touch the wall from either side so yes it was a small room. Two small pillows per bed...nothing heavenly here. Walls were scuffed at odd places and needed a new coat of paint. TV was a big honking 27 inch CRT type. Havent seen one of those in awhile. The AC worked great and kept the room as cold as we wanted. Bathroom small, functional but very basic...remember this is a Country Inn like you see off the interstates. The curtains could not 100% block out the LIGHT whether it was Sun or fluorescent and this was not contributing to a restful sleep. Lastly, there was a loud and pulsating noise that did not abate for the entire night...we could not figure it out.. were we next to some sort of factory? or located next to the elevator shaft or AC\/HVAC system? Unbelievable droning. I kept apologizing to my wife for for bringing here on the basis of a #1 of 154 Hotels in New Orleans.
