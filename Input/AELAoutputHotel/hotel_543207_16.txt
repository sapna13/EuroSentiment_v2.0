{"text":"Great location and Excellent Staff! We looked and looked for a BB and finally decided on Giada. The hotel is in a great location. Everything is in short walking distance (even though it looks far on a map - it is truly very very close). Statue of David is 4 blocks away, Duomo is 2 blocks, train station is 2 - 3 blocks, Ponte Vecchio is a 7 minute walk approx (much to see and shop along the way). The staff are wonderful! They helped me set up my laptop, which I am not savvy on at all. Oh yes, did I mention the free WI FI and use of their lobby computer. The room is what I expected and the continental breakfast is perfect. Options of croissants, buns, cereal, ham\/cheese panini and coffees (cappuccinos, espresso, regular coffee, etc.) They have affordable beverages on hand in the breakfast room. If it rains, which it has on our stay, complimentary umbrellas.The bathroom is what I expect in Europe. It is smaller than what we would get in the States and it does the job. :)Also, it is secure and quiet. The double paned windows work great. I know some have mentioned the noise from the market, but I look at it like this, if you don't plan on sleeping in beyond 8:30am - 9:00am, you will be fine. It won't be the noise from the market necessarily waking you, it would be the church bells at this time.Take advise on the recommended restaurants from the staff!I would highly recommend staying here.
