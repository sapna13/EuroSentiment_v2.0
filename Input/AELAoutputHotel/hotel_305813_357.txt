{"text":"Loved the Chuan Spa Centre Langham Place Hotel Mongkok . 2nd April, 2003 . Three women shopping in Hong Kong, we had a ball. I choose the hotel and did my research on this site. We were not disappointed! It was everything we wanted. The location was perfect with the MTR very close the markets. The Hotel being attached to a large shopping centre and food hall. We stayed six nights, were greeted with warm towels to freshen our hands. Our check in did seem to take quite sometime we checked in at 7.30pm but our room was not yet ready? That took about 20 30mins which seemed odd. But our room was perfect, three single beds as requested. That was our only delay. The staff throughout the Hotel were excellent and most helpful. The buffet food was very good and a great start to the day with a very big selection. We enjoyed chatting to the head chef Lorraine nearly everyday as she did a walk through the restaurant. That chocolate fondue for dipping the donuts in was awesome. We enjoyed happy hour in the bar which also included nibbles. Late into the evening we met gigi the Candian singer who was delightful. We enjoyed a treatment in the Chuan day spa, where the staff are so friendly and curteous. The facilities in the sauna area are so nice you will not want to leave.As for the pool the view is amazing! Our room was cleanededspotlessly every day and a comp. water bottle by the bed and slippers. The comp. shampoos etc...were a beautiful quality. All in all I could not speak more highly of this Hotel. The staff and management are to be congratulated on a wonderful team effort. I look forward to returning again and I would recommend this Hotel to any-one.
