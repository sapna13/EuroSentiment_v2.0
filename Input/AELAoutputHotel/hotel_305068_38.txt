{"text":"I never wanted to leave this hotel We spent three nights at the Intercontinental in HK. We were four in two harbor view rooms with club access. This hotel is fabulous in every way. The views from the rooms are so incredible you just want to sit and gaze out your window. You feel almost as if you are on a ship, the harbor is so close. The rooms are plush with every possible amenity, including Bulgari bath products, lovely.The club lounge has wonderful views and the food is incredible. Great breakfasts, (fruit smoothies in shot glasses, poached eggs on toast, really good croissants!) great snacks, great wine selection (lots of champagne), wonderful hors d'oeuvres. Staff were wonderful as well. This club lounge has a good variety of seating (club chairs, tables, sofas) and TV's in several areas. When Barack Obama was making a speech at breakfast time, we asked to have breakfast in front of a TV to hear him, and we were warmly accomodated.The rooms are incredibly comfortable, with a huge king bed and Bose Ipod docking station, good size desk, an International Herald Tribune delivered every day, and push button drapes. The pool area is amazingly beautiful, overlooking the harbor, with a spa area with infinity pools, a bar area, and a large pool with seating around it, all beautifully landscaped and decorated. The hotel is located next to a large mall that includes a supermarket and drugsore as well as more upscale offerings. It is an easy stroll to the Star Ferry pier, and an easy cab ride up Nathan Road to the Ladie's Market and other cheap shopping. The Steak House restaurant was excellent but the Lobby Lounge (again, that view, and the laser light show every night!)became our favorite for dinner and drinks afterward, with its live jazz and awesome Caesar salads.This hotel was the last stop of a three week odyssey in China. We were exhausted, exhilarated, heads spinning with more information than we could absorb, baffled, tired from hard beds, stomachs a bit jumbly. The Intercontinental soothed us, pampered us, comforted us, in the heart of a fabulous city, with a view to die for. It may be the best hotel I have ever stayed in. As we left, my husband commented, Maybe we should add a club room to our house. Amen.
