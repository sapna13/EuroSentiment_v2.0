{"text":"Very Nice Vacation Just got back from two weks at this resort. First of all, the cleaning staff are amongst the hardest working I have ever seen at an all-inclusive (I've been to four now). They are always sweeping, cleaning and maintaining the grounds. I stayed from Jan 25 to feb 08, 2007. My room was 1180, and it was very nice. I had no problems with the air conditioning, I did have a problem getting a remote for my tv the first couple of days, but after getting Jennifer (the AirTransat rep )involved, this was quickly fixed. The hot water was iffy from time to time, but when it did work it worked just great. The food was very good the first week, but after the staff turnover in the second week, it fell off just a tad. I didn't hear of anybody getting sick, and many told me they were eating the salads as well. The wait staff at the bars need more language training as a rule, but if you just show up with a smile, and Hola Amigo, you should do just fine. I personally don't like the beach animation stuff, and if you don't either, if you turn to your right when you get to the beach, and walk past the Barcelo wharf for about another ten minutes, there is a beautiful area that is open to all the resorts, that is hardly used at all, very quiet, the waves are a lot softer and the beach is a lot cleaner, I higly recommend this area for those wanting a little romance during their vacation. The beach at the resort is very, very busy. Lots of motorboats, and all other types of beach fun, for a cost of course. There are a lot of sales people at the beach all day long. They aren't very forceful at the resorts area, but if you go past the resort area, they tend to be more forceful and pesky. All in all I loved my stay, the AirTransat reps were very good. I would definetly go back again.
