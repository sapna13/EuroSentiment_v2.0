{"text":"great vacation at ccp Let me begin by saying my wife and I have been to europe ,south america, over half the caribbean islands and more than 30 states so we are not new to travel.Our trip began on 6Nov 06 at phl airport on USA3000. Nice flight we even got in early. Transfer to the resort went smoothly. Once at the resort we were told our room would be ready in 1\/2 hr as were we very early. We went and got a bite to eat. Upon returning to the front desk we were given our room key. We went to our room and were pleasantly surprised at the size of it and the location. We were on the first floor with a view of both the pool and the ocean. The room was very clean and very cool as the AC worked great. All week long trhe room was cool and clean. The staff at the resort couldn't have been any nicer when ever there was a communication problem they would try and find someone who could speak English. The food was good the only complait was that the choices at the buffet got old after a week. They did try though. The beach was always clean as were the grounds.We booked the VIP package and it was well worth it. I n all it was a very pleasant vacation the only thing I saw that was wrong was my fellow americans yelling at some of the workers because they didn't speak english well it is their country try spanish or stay home. If we ever return to Punta Cana it would be at the Caribe Club Princess.
