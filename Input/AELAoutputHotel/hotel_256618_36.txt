{"text":"Good and Bad In Quick Succession The Park Hyatt was our landing point in Australia and also where we returned for one night after a trip to the Blue Mountains and it was almost very good indeed.We first arrived late and tired after 24 hours travelling from the UK and were efficiently and courteously welcomed and shown to our room. Opening the curtains after dark showed why the Hyatt charges a premium, even for Sydney. We had a Opera King and right there in front of us was the floodlit Opera House, a fantastic view.The Hotel is well situated for most things you would want in Sydney and has all the right facilities - free internet (for first 30 mins although no one seemed to be checking) business like staff, a decent restaurant with great views etc, and the rooms are good sized and pretty well equipped.We ate there one night and the meal was pretty good, although there was a bit of a wait between courses. To the staff's credit they picked this up and offered us complementary wine. The buffet breakfast is a little thin for the price - we headed for the Gum Nut Cafe on the second day - much better!We left thinking it was close to a 5. However, when we returned, things were not so great.As we were only staying one night and had an early start we only booked a City\/Harbour view room, but were horrified to find ourselves in a room at the far end of the hotel with a view of a tree and a cafe kitchen. We expressed our views to the reception person who said she would look into it. We felt that for a hotel that trades on views the lack of any view from this one should have attracted some reduction.After 20 minutes of no response we headed back to reception to try and track her down - and ended up being handled by the overall Room Director as the original receptionist seemed to have disappeared. He arranged for us to move to a more central room with a view of Circular Quay and admitted that the room we had originally been allocated was often heavily discounted and complained about. However, the service did not really improve as the original girl re-appeared and asked if we would be moving our own bags along - no offer of a bell boy.With hindsight (and denied by the Room Director) we believe we got the duff room as we were checking out very early (6.30 for a flight to Uluru) after just one night and it was also the Bridge Birthday weekend, but the room we were given certainly could not really be called a room with a view.Overall, the Hyatt has got a great location, good facilities, some good staff and a high level of style. However, it was all rather impersonal and business orientated which for a hotel right on Sydney Harbour was slightly at odds with the location etc.If you want the best views in Sydney, and go for a minimum of an Opera view room - you will be fine, if poor! But don't expect a very intimate hotel.
