{"text":"Nice hotel I stayed here on the recommendation of the firm I was working with in Amsterdam. I liked this hotel from the minute I arrived. The front desk staff were very friendly and spoke impeccable English - they arranged for an early check-in and stored our luggage securely for a few hours (we arrived very early). The upgraded room, Business room, was clean and reasonably sized such that I could open my small suitcase on the floor. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean with lots of hot water, and the TV had lots of English-language channels. I can't say enough about the front desk staff- they even remembered my name and I got the feeling they were very committed to customer care. The hotel is nicely situated about 250 meters from both the van Gogh and Rijksmuseum, and maybe 1 km from the Heineken experience (great fun!). It backs onto an exclusive boutique shopping street. The only drawbacks were that the breakfast was very expensive for what you get, and the area was a bit noisy. Still, I'd stay there again for sure. NB: There was a good breakfast place maybe 250 m from the hotel called Beans and Bagels (make a right out of the hotel, walk to the main road and then look slightly to the left on the opposite side of the street); the hotel was a 35 Euro cab ride from Schipol airport, although it's also accessible from the Centraal Station by trams 2 or 5.
