{"text":"Less than desirable We booked our hotel and was quite excited to be able to stay in Manhattan, at a four-star hotel at a Hilton hotel. Prior to check-in we had requested a king size smoking room both on the internet and by the phone. When we finally moved our way through closed streets and quite a bit of construction and got our car parked ($48.00 a day - no in and out), they did have us in a king size room but it was a non-smoking room. Supposedly they did not have a smoking room available but the gentleman at the front desk left us for a few minutes and voila! A smoking room was suddenly available. We got to our room and my husband and I were really excited to see what type of view we would have. We were able to see the Hudson and some of the skyscrapers on the financial district but the main eye-catching site was that of ground zero. It was quite depressing and bone-chilling to look out our window. Wireless internet is available at the hotel. When using the lounge near the front desk, it's $5.95 AN HOUR. In your room, it ranges from $5.95 to $9.95 for a 24 hour period. I have noticed no difference between the $5.95 and the $9.95 service so don't waste your money on the $9.95 option.The room itself is nice. The beds at their sister hotel, Hampton Inn, are a lot more comfortable. The beds have a duvet that covers it with no duvet cover. The plasma television is nice but not that big of a deal. Breakfast is not provided by the restaurant but you are able to order a continental breakfast for $18.00 plus a 15% gratuity and a $4.00 in-room dining charge. There are also no soda vending machines on any floor but you are able to purchase a fountain drink in the lounge for $3.75. It is in a good subway location. There are two subway entrances right across the street and are easily accessible. Beware of walking up Fulton Street towards Broadway or you'll get accousted by all the street vendors selling knock-off merchandise.Overall, I'm not impressed with this 4-star hotel at all. Give me the 2 1\/2 star ones any day.
