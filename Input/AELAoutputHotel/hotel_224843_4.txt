{"text":"Just right We stayed at this property on Friday September 5th and again on Friday September 12th, 2008. On our first night we had a room facing south on the 6th floor. We actually had a decent view of Mt. Rainier. On our second visit we had a group of 7 adults and shared three double bed rooms, all located off the lobby area on the ground level. On both visits all of our rooms were clean, quiet, and equipped with all the standard amenities. The rooms were a little small but we had space for our things and there is a desk and two chairs, good for any work you would need to do. Check in was quick and easy with two staff members available to assisting us in getting our group settled. There is a computer and printer with internet available in the lobby. The front desk was able to help us with several fax and other business related needs. There is a free breakfast with both hot and cold selections available, not a large selection but certainly adequate. For my needs it was a great location. Located close enough to SEA-TAC to walk but they have a shuttle that runs from 4:30 AM until 11PM. We used both extremes and each time it was quick and hassle free. From the airport just pick up the courtesy phone and call the hotels code. There is an added bonus for those renting cars from Enterprise. Pickup and return is one block south of the hotel on International. ","annotations":[]}
