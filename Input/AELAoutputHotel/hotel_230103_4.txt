{"text":"Never again - not a pleasant stay I stayed at this hotel during a recent conference in Amsterdam. The hotels near the conference centre were full and this hotel was suggested by the travel agent.The hotel has a free shuttle bus to\/from Schipol airport every half an hour. However, thats as good as it gets. The check-in process was painful and the staff unhelpful. For instance, my room had been booked by the travel agent with costs to be charged back to the travel agents credit card. However the hotel claimed that they did not have any record of this. I therefore produced some paperwork to confirm the arrangement and then the lady at check-in said that they do not have anything from the travel agent and then stubbornly refused to check me in without my credit card. I gave my credit card and asked if she could confirm with the travel agent about the charges and once again she refused saying that it was not her job to do that. I phoned the travel agent up myself and they arranged to call the hotel to clear the issue up, which they did the following day.The room was basic and smelly. The bathroom had a dirty toilet and the sealant was black and looked disgusting. The room had a safe on the floor, which meant that you had to get on your hands and knees to add or remove contents - hardly very convenient if you have a disability.There are no tea\/coffee facilities or hairdryer in the room. The TV is okay but only a limited selection of english channels.Breakfast cost √à√\u2020√ü?0 and was average with poor service from the staff there. You are even expected to clear your own tray away - what kind of hotel is this!I am not likely to stay here ever again even though I travel on business to Amsterdam fairly regularly.
