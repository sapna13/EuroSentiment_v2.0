{"text":"Overall Great Resort And Great Value! We just had a great 8-night stay here in September. We were greeted by a friendly front desk staff, when we arrived about two hours early, and throughout our stay, we found almost everything to our liking.We paid $185\/Entertainment Rate for a city-view room but were upgraded to partial ocean-view, I think, because we were celebrating an anniversary. Our room #1208, had a generous view of the ocean so we were very pleased!The room was very pretty, and we enjoyed our lanai, especially at night, listening to the sounds of Waikiki and watching the lights come on. We had free internet, safe, local  long-distance calls, fridge, coin-operated laundry , coffeemaker\/coffee ... Outrigger gives you a lot for your money! Housekeeping was superb ... friendly and quick to supply any extra towels, etc. The walls can seem a bit thin if you get someone very noisy next door, but in eight days, we were only bothered for an hour or so twice. It certainly was no big deal, and I would have asked for a move had it been.Seattle's Best, in the lobby, was very convenient for picking up morning coffee, and the three restaurants are all top-notch ... Hula Grill, Duke's and Chuck's Steakhouse. All oceanside, with wonderful views and usually live music at night, and very convenient when you don't want to stray far for dinner. I loved that it is next door to the Sheraton Moana Surfrider and it's Beach Bar under the Banyan Tree, where you can get the best Mai Tai in Waikiki!The pool was very clean, always enough chairs, and a pleasant pool staff. You could get drinks\/foods from Duke's or a sandwich\/shave ice stand near the hotel laundry area. There were good shops in the hotel, as well as other great shopping all around you in that location. The location there could not be better, dead center of everything you might want to do in Waikiki! I will definitely stay there when we go back to Waikiki!
