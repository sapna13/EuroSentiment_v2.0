{"text":"Not perfect, but darn close... It is rare that my husband and two sons and I all agree on a hotel. But this hotel is really exceptional and we all loved it. The rooms (and we had two) are magnificently equipped and furnished in a modern, sleek style. I have never seen so many useful little items in a hotel room: pajamas, hairbrush, rubber bands for hair, oil blotting papers for the face, toothbrush and paste, beautiful pens. The bathroom toiletries were all in a very substantial size too, instead of the tiny little bottles you usually get. The beds were sublimely comfortable. We loved the room.Other nice features of the hotel are a fabulously equipped gym, and free internet access for guests. Granted, there is only one computer available for use, but we never found getting online to be a problem. The location of the hotel is great. It's an easy walk to the Ginza for shopping, and the hotel is right next to Tokyo Station. In fact, many of the rooms at the hotel have a view of the bullet trains as they go in and out of Tokyo Station. We loved watching the trains - but our room was not overlooking them too closely...We had breakfast included with our rooms. The restaurant is really beautifully decorated, and is a relaxing place to dine. We didn't find the breakfast menu to be too inspiring, however. We coudn't really find anything that we enjoyed eating. The American breakfast was sub-standard - bacon and sausage were not tasty, and the eggs so-so. One day my son ordered waffles, and it consisted of one tiny waffle cut in half...We are not huge eaters, but the portions were quite small. The lattes were tasty, but quite weak. So, while we usually enjoy breakfast in our hotel, this was definitely not one of our favorites.Generally, we were very pleased with the service. The staff could not have been friendlier or more gracious. We did have a small problem with the concierge. They booked tickets for us on the bullet train to Kyoto. We were told the tickets would cost about $400 - but the concierge didn't mention that this was EACH WAY. So, it was a bit of a surprise when we finally got the bill for $800. Well, no place is perfect, but this hotel is really quite close...We would definitely return...
