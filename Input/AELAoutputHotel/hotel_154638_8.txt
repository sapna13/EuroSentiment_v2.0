{"text":"Definitely Stay Again I have recently returned from a four week holiday travelling all around Mexico with my husband. Our trip started with a three night stay in Mexico City and I must say, for all the people who tried to convince us not to include Mexico City in our itinerary, I am really glad that we didn't listen to you.After reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, like many of the other hotels, you often wonder if everyone has actually stayed in the same hotel.Briefly:* Yes, the beds were a little hard, but we still found them very comfortable.* The rooms were a good size.* As far as the major highway goes, we didn't even know it was there. As soon as we were dropped off at the hotel late in the evening, we were told, that when you leave the hotel, ALWAYS turn right and never left. I guess this is why we didn't notice the highway.* I really appreciated that you could access the internet for free from the lobby.* We didn't have much to do with the staff in general, but when we did, we found them helpful.* We loved the location and found it very easy to get around and not once, did we ever feel uneasy when walking in the area.* The restaurant was pretty average in our opinion and we thought that breakfast was ordinary and over priced for what it was. There are so many other options for eating and drinking in the area.* FYI: You might like to know, that yes it is in a gay area with nightclubs and bars.Would we stay here again - most definitely.
