{"text":"Magical but expensive!! We booked this 4 day New Years trip back in August when there was less talk of a Credit Crunch and the Pound was alot stronger than its current position!!We had a disastrous start to the trip with Euro-Star not contacting us (and 100 other travellers) about moving the Disney Train time 2 hours earlier than scheduled, and so consequently had missed the train!!!We were eventually put on another crossing that went directly from St Pancras to Paris and then had to wait a couple of hours for a further hours coach trip to get us to Disney. We were dumped at a bus station and had to then try and get two young children, three cases and my disabled father in law to the hotel. Eleven hours of travelling from the Midlands and we had arrived in the hotel lobby!!! Thanks EuroStar.The hotel lobby was stunning, check in easy and relativeley quick. We were on the 3rd floor on the opposite side of the hotel from the lobby, so a long hike using two sets of lifts and walking the entire length of the hotel with a disabled pensioner was hard work? We didnt ask to be moved so can't blame the hotel for this?The room was large enough for two adults and two children and we had an adjoining room for the in-laws so we were all pleased with the Disneyland Hotel.We had booked our eveining meal at the Inventions restaurant prior to going and so walked straight in a 7:00 which was good as there was already a queue forming. The childrens faces when Goofy, Minnie, Tigger and many other charachters walked in and came up to them during dinner was a picture and we were really pleased we had paid the extra money to stay at the DL Hotel. The cost to eat in Inventions for four adults and two children with a couple of bottles of the cheapest wine and a couple of beers was about 400Euros (√ä√£¬¢400 at the moment). To eat in the piano bar with a few sandwiches, pot of tea and a couple of beers, approx 90 euros (√ä√£¬¢90).Spent a fantastic New Years Eve at Buffalo Bills Wild West show with adequate food, great show and unlimited beers included within the price we paid (approx 65 euros per adult).Drinks within the park were very slightly cheaper than the hotel with a coffee costing 5 euros, coke 5 euros, pint of beer costing approx 8 Euros, glass of mulled wine 8 euros and champagne 10 euros per glass!! Fast Food was very expensive and not very fast!!!Overall we had a fantastic time in Disneyland, it was cold so go prepared, it was very expensive so be very prepared.DisneyLand Hotel is a great location, excellent food and service, fantastic experience for kids and adults with the charachters but it comes at a cost.Would like to say we had a good Eurostar trip home, but we didnt!!
