{"text":"Great Hotel, great Location This hotel is very easy to find with several trains running direct from the airports. The hotel reception is nice and modern looking and the rooms are a good size, the only problem was that our room didn't have air conditioning which may be a problem for travellers in the summer months. Staff are friendly and were always willing to help whenever we needed it.The great thing about the location of this hotel is that its right next to the shopping district (Kurfuerstendamm) and all the transport you need to get around this huge city are right on your doorstep.  There's something for everyone at breakfast, if you can get breakfast included in the price it's very good value for money.Finding the hotel;* Getting to the hotel from Schonefiled Airport is easy. The train Station is easy to reach ( Look out for S-bahn signs) once you get there buy a ticket from the ticket machines (validate ticket before you get on the train) get the train to theZoologischer Garten station, the hotel is a 5 minute walk away from this station.Tips;* Just around the corner to the left of the hotel is a tourist information. If you're going to be travelling around the whole city we'd reccommend that you buy a transport ticket that can be used on buses, trains or on the U-bahn, at around 17euros for 2 days this is great value for money (remember and validate your ticket)*Plenty of restaurants around, the HardRock cafe is a two minute walk down the street right in front of the hotel (ask the hotel staff for directions if unsure) and there's plenty of other restaurants to choose from.*If you're looking for a food store or supermarket the nearest one is about a 5 minute walk away from the hotel (Kaiser's).*If you're looking to visit the olympic stadium make sure there's not a football game on first as you'll not get to do the tour. *To see the best stretch of the Berlin wall (about 1.5km) get the train to the Ostbahnhof station and you're right there.Overall we had a great stay and thought the hotel was really good value for money.
