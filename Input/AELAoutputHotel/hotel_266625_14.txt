{"text":"Brilliant My partner and I have just returned from a two week stay at the Cocotal. The flight was great (I can highly recommend upgrade) and check in process was very efficient and quick. Rooms are fine - a little tired perhaps but that doesn't bother us as we only ever plan to sleep and shower there. Beach: the beach is fabulous - we are not poolside people and the beach offered enough peace and quiet for us, the ents staff tried to persuade us to take part in the activities (which we did a couple of times) but weren't forceful or persistent at all. There are people selling quad biking, horseriding etc but again, they don't pester you and generally leave you alone.Food: we were given two reservations per week at the ALC facilities - we ate at the Steakhouse (ok), Italian (not really our cup of tea), Mexican (nice, and great waiter), and Jade (best one IMHO). If you go to the customer relations desk and ask for a further reservation over and above the ones you are allocated they will generally help you out. The big buffet restaurant has something for everyone - I am quite picky and never went hungry. There is also a beach BBQ at lunchtimes, and a bigger buffet restaurant also at lunchtimes - both are fine, ideal for something light at that time of day.Bars: the beach bar is ideal for lazy days - you can get whatever you want from here, and staff are always friendly and helpful. In the evenings we generally went to the main bar rather than the ents area - the guys there were fantastic and really made our holiday. They are very friendly and helpful - if you meet Felix, Christian and Felippe you are very lucky!!!! Couldn't have wished for a nicer group of guys.Trips: We did 3 excursions. Jungle safari was first - it rained that day and we still had a fab time with our guide Sammy. Then we did Tropical Storm - despite the apalling roads (stop building hotels and start building some roads!!), we had a great day with Paddy and his crew, and can highly recommend this trip. Finally we did the Isla Catalina trip - we started to become a little despondent as we were on the coach for ages, but when we got to catalina - WOW - this is the perfect place for snorkelling, great food also - we really didn't want to leave.All in all a fantastic holiday, the Dominican people are really friendly and we couldn't have hoped for anything more. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. Take loads of mossy repellant with you and you'll be fine.
