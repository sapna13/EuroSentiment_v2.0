{"text":"Great Hotel and Location! We arrived late afternoon with two rooms booked. I decided to pay vs using points. Both rooms were on the 10th floor on the executive levels. The renovation is done and the rooms are nice. Big flat screen TV, good lights, nice desk and a very modern bathroom. The lounge is on the 9th floor and gets very busy. Breakfast is good open 6am to 10am weekdays and 7am to 10am weekends. Cocktails hour is from 530pm to 930pm with food served. They have two computers in the lounge for free. Overall a good lounge with great finger food at night. The gym open 24 hours is not bad for a hotel. They have 10 or so lifestyle tread mills\/bikes. A full free weight area with at least 10 workout machines. One large rack in the middle of the floor. They offer water and towels plus a locker room. I used the gym everyday and was never super busy. The location of the Marriott is very good. As with any hotel in Amsterdam, walking to anything is not that far. What I liked is it was quite. Our rooms faced the backside of the hotel not a sound could be heard. They do have rooms that face the main street. I would not want one of those. Not saying it would be bad but why take the chance. Ask for a room not facing the street. We walked the city 3 times from the Marriott it was easy. Overall I am very happy with our choice of the Marriott. While it is rather expensive you get what you pay for. We did eat here once and the food was excellent. No complaints here at all!
