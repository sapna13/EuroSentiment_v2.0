{"text":"Out of this world! I have never had a better hotel stay than I had at the Hotel Misc over Thanksgiving Weekend, 2007. It was nothing short of spectacular.  My travel mate, Allison, and I stayed in the Rembrant Room, which overlooks the lovely Kloveniersburgwal canal -- right in the heart of the city. The room was spacious, clean and charmingly decorated with beautiful wooden furniture and framed Rembrant and Vermeer prints on the walls. It was quiet, save for the church bells ringing periodically in the distance. The room was perfect for resting or reading by the large windows after a busy day of sightseeing. It instantly felt like home. My favorite part of our stay was definitely the superb breakfast lovingly prepared for us each morning. In addition to freshly baked breads, homemade jams, fresh fruit, coffee and tea, guests are treated to an assortment of excellent cheeses and ham. Bacon and free-range eggs are made to order and served with the flakiest, most buttery croussants imaginable. Oh, and I forgot to mention the freshly squeezed orange juice. It was the perfect way to start the day -- truly heavenly. The minibar in our room was tuly complimentary. The delicious goodies inside (chocolates, cookies, sodas, water, potato chips) were restocked daily and, best of all, included in the cost of the room! I could not believe it. The minibar was very much appreciated when the late night munchies struck (a very common occurrance in Amsterdam)! The best part of our stay, however, had to be the warmth and hospitality with which we were welcomed by Rachel and Pepin. It is so clear that they love what they do. That love was evident in every aspect of our stay at the Hotel Misc. This was not my last time in Amsterdam, nor will it my last stay at the incredible Hotel MIsc!
