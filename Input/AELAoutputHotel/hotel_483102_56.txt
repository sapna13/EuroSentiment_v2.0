{"text":"A bit disappointed with Barcelona... Where to begin??....we had some issues with H10 Universitat, not necessarily the fault of the hotel staff, but things were not as we expected. Having a rental car we approached the hotel on the street and found there to be nowhere to park our car and unload our luggage, except for the very busy Taxi\/Bus lane. After a record unload time of 1 minute, my husband drove around looking for a parking garage while I checked in. Luckily, there was a garage relatively close, but not associated with the hotel.The hotel accomodated my request of being on the 4th floor or higher, as I have read on Trip Advisor. We were given room 608 which was a middle room - where the window look into some type of elevator shaft-ish opening. We were not offered any cava or snacks like the previous reviewers upon check in. The room was so small, we had to keep one of our suitcases in the bathroom and the other in the bedroom. The closet was really of no use as it was so tiny. We wondered why the bathroom was so humongous at the expense of the living area where they jammed in a king size bed. The bed pillow spanned the entire width of the bed, and there was only one...this I named the siamese pillow as we both tried to get the proper placement for sleeping. That was something I'd never experienced. The mattress was also quite hard. The water pressure in the shower was excellent (we did not have a tub) and as the other reviewers stated, the bathroom was in the room separated by a wall of frosted glass.The A\/C was lacking power and one of the vents had some very disturbing looking black mold\/soot\/etc....that made you wonder if it was toxic. The one highlight was the wonderful breakfast buffet that was included in our room rate. One of the best buffets we have ever seen - and everything very tasty. Service was excellent as well.Also, the free internet access in the business center was most appreciated.We chose H10 Universitat for it's close proximity to Las Ramblas, which is definitely true, and also to the Metro at Plaza Catalunya. Compared to our experiences at other Spain hotels, this one just didn't measure up.
