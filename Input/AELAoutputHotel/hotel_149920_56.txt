{"text":"Good Experience at the Marriott Just came back from a 2 night stay at the Marriott. We didn't take advantage of too many of the facilities but everything we saw was nice and well maintained. We were upgraded to a corner room; one balcony faced the ocean and the other faced the bay (just yucky buildings). I am so glad for the upgrade because that view of the ocean was the most relaxing part of the stay. The room itself was large and nice with an updated bathroom and decent closets.The pools were lovely and even the larger one was shallow so its perfect for kids. We came without our kids but there was a daily activity list for children which made this place seem very kid friendly (scavenger hunts; water volleyball etc.). We tried to walk on the beach in the evening, but the security guard didn't let us get on because they were locking up the entry. I realized that it was for security issues, but it would be nice if you can stay on the beach to watch the sun set.Service was great overall. The guest services personnel were accomodating and nice. Valet always came quickly. I've stayed at other 4 and 5 star resorts where waited for valet for 15 minutes to an hour and that was with a call requesting the car before we came down.The casino was fine. Obviously small by most standards but they had a little bit of everything. Slots of all ranges (1 cent to $1 or more), blackjack tables, craps, roulette etc.The salsa dancing in the lobby at night was unbelievably loud, but once you walk away from that area, it was bearable.
