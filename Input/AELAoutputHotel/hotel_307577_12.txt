{"text":"shell game won't have enough space to give full review, but the brief review is... nothing like what you see online. we arrived in bali full of excitement - and this hotel managed to fully ruin our vacation. first, we asked for a beach wing room, on the ground floor with early check-in. when we arrived, they said no rooms in the beach wing were available, so we would be upgraded to the club, but must wait til 1pm for check-in. After waiting 4 hours in the lobby and having my daughter get stung by a bee, and our requests for water ignored... the front desk finally assigned us a room = 2 level of beach wing. so, not only did we not get what was promised, but they put us in the worst room available. this is waht you get for waiting and being patient. our room had inadequate ac, a broken toilet, and low water pressure. we had to use the first floor lobby restroom for 2 of our 3 days stay. we needed a hair dryer - so several hours later they deliver this very old hair dryer and make us sign for it - 25 usd if broken or fail to return. real value of device = 25 cents at a garage sale. my wife wanted to use the spa morning noon and night, but her first trip in and they made her wait 25 minutes in the lobby. no water, no hand\/face wash towel. Meanwhile, another couple arrived to lavish attention with all of the amenities provided. my wife had booked the most expepensive package and was treated worse than a criminal in jail, who would at least be offered water. also, while we waitied for check-in we went to the hotel's beach restaurant - slim pickings and extra charges if you want certain things. i can't tell you the disspaointment we felt in the hotel - they managed to ruin our vacation completely; this difficult to do as we kept trying to look positively on our trip. the biggest failure was upgrading us, putting the room number on our passport then pulling the old shell game by then putting us in a worse room and telling us it was better. this was a deliberate and direct, bold faced lie. they bell hop actually tried to sell us that the room we were getting was better than the club room we were promised for our patiently waiting. lesson is this = when you get there, demand your room immediately and do not go away from the front desk until they give you the key. better yet, try the hotel sanur beach or bali hyatt both close to this one.
