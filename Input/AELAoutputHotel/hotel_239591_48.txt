{"text":"Great location for main sights. We arrived late in the early hours after 5 hour delay to flight. Hotel is not set in very pretty surroundings but inside the hotel lobby is bright and welcoming.We received prompt attention from english speaking staff on the desk.I had requested a no smoking room both via Hotel website and on website of 3rd party company we booked through (Last Minute . com).However while walking to our room we could smell that this clearly wasnt a no smoking part of hotel. On entering our room it had no traces of smoke and as we were so tired we went straight to bed rather than demand another room.The room turned out to be a good one (130) as it was tucked away from lift, doorways or other noisy thorouhfares in the hotel. It also overlooked the front with a balcony (not used as weather too cold) which was a mixed blessing....you could hear the binmen emptying the recycling bins just below room at night.Noise was NOT an issue on the whole...is there any hotel near Las Ramblas which doesnt have some degree of noise? If you stay in the centre of any city you must surely expect some noise.Breakfast was fine (we had read some previous comments on Trip Advisor which had not been favourable but we found it adequate and handy to use before a day's sightseeing !! )Room was very comfortable with new features. Just what we wanted to rest in between walking round sights.Lift was small and NO access to stairs which was annoying as it meant wasting time waiting for lift to go 1 floor.The hotel's LOCATION is the key. Great value for money and close to Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya where tourist bus departs from (recommended).You can walk around centre of town easily from hotel so perfect location.
