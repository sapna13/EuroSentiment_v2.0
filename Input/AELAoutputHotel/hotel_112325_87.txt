{"text":"OK stay at the Cartwright I stayed at the Cartwright for 3 nights in late November. The hotel is centrally located and was great for shopping at Westfield, Macys and all that Union Square has to offer. I liked the free internet and 24\/7 coffee. The room (as expected) was small. The bathroom had louvre windows which seemed to allow the street noise into the room. I expected the area to be noisy however the room was loud. One thing that I was aware of before I stayed at the hotel is that they use real keys. I didn't expect it to be a problem however in hindsight it would be a major factor in me considering another hotel on my next visit. If you are not careful you can inadvertently leave your room open (you have to lock the door with the key when leaving). I was also constantly worried about losing the key when out of the hotel. You are able to leave the key at reception, however they were often busy which meant waiting for the key everytime I returned to the hotel. I much prefer the card system and feel that a hotel of this standard should update. It is also possible to be locked in your room. Be careful not to lock your partner in the room. If you leave individually do not lock the door with the key - it is not possible to open the door from the inside when it is locked from the outside. All in all, the stay was ok, however I would probably experiment with another nearby hotel on my next visit.
