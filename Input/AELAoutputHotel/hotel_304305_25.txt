{"text":"Great hotel overall Stayed here for 6 nights with my wife and 10-month old in a non-smoking Plaza Premier room. Room type affects your experience in a hotel like this so keep that in mind when evaluating.PROS:* Big room* Great room appointments -- flat screen TV, stylish furniture* Nice bathroom -- Shower with water temperature setting, toilet with washlet\/bidet seat* Super clean, high standard of cleanliness by their maid staff* Great bathroom amenities (L'Occitane brand)* Choice of Japanese or American breakfast (both served buffet style) if it's included in your rate* Located in Shinjuku, which generally is a great place to be* Provided a baby crib at no charge* Hotel is a stop on the limousine bus, which makes it easy for first-timers to get here from the airport.* Great service greeting us at the door when we got off the airport limousine bus, taking our bags to our room* Great view from our 38th floor room facing the station.CONS:- Smoke. Our room was non-smoking but you still smell it in the hallways and in the elevator sometimes. Hotels in Japan (not just this one) have that Vegas casino feel to them when you walk in. I've lived in an area that has not allowed smoking in buildings for many years, so I'm not used to this. - The 10 minute walk to Shinjuku station gets old after you do it over and over again. There are hotels closer to the station that are also highly rated (See Century Southern Tower).- Station is on the west side of Shinjuku which is the less lively side (this could be a pro depending on our point of view). It seemed that all the restaurants we wanted to visit were on the other side of the station. It's a huge station, and quite crowded, so the side of the station is not an insignificant issue.- Hotel doesn't point out that there's a covered passage way from the hotel to Shinjuku station. We walked in the rain back from the station twice before figuring this out. Some signage would be nice.- No diaper trash was provided, which made left us in the awkward position of putting diapers in plastic bags and tying them up for the cleaning staff. The trash cans are tiny so there really isn't enough bin space to throw away diapers or even a take-out dinner box.- Lounge is in the South Tower, but the Plaza Premier rooms are in the Main Tower. It's pretty inconvenient to go down 38 floors walk across the building and then up 35 floors just to get some free beverages and packaged snacks.Overall I would definitely stay here again, but I would also consider another highly rated hotel that is closer to Shinjuku station.Others have complained about the fact that this hotel serves large tour groups. I didn't find that to be a problem. We didn't spend much time hanging out in the lobby, nor did we use the concierge much.
