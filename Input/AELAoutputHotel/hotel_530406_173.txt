{"text":"Dont pay extra for 5* Ocean Sands - not worth it We stayed at Ocean Sands 17-24 December, traveling Signature Tours \/ Skyservice. We have previously stayed in 3.5-4 star hotels in Mexico, Venezuela, and Columbia but were talked into paying over $1000 more for a 5* hotel compared to other Dominican resorts. Favourable Trip Advisor reviews played a big part in this decision. I won't repeat items reported by others except to say that the property is huge, new, appears clean, and the beach is very nice. Area seemed very safe, we did not hear about anyone having problems.US dollars only needed in DR. No need to obtain pesos, no shopping opportunities in Punta Cana except T shirts, shells, rum, beach jewellery, paintings. All low quality trinkets. Vendors moderately aggressive, salespeople selling Ocean Resort Timeshares extremely aggressive outside Cana buffet.Upon arrival, room safe was not working. We waited over 3 hours for repairman. Then we walked around property, falling into 45 cm deep hole beside pool where grating was broken resulting in cuts, bruises and sprained ankle. It took an hour for doctor to arrive, who immediately demanded payment. No apologies or condolences were offered by hotel.Signature rep Debra's orientation was not too helpful. Debra talked to hotel management who said they would send a basket and apology to room following accident, and this never arrived. Management at this hotel do not understand customer service at all.We went on Jeep Safari to typical home, typical farm, typical plantation, typical beach, all staged areas. At beach, 100 guests were kept on 100 ' stretch of surf, guide blew shrill whistle constantly if group spead out. Very annoying. Food on Jeep Safari not very good and no selection offered. Guides were very funny, lunatics all around. Cost $80 US pp. Not really a jeep trip, 3 ton trucks with cattle boxes would be better description and we were never off roads.We also went to Catalina Island, again guides made day worthwhile and food was a little better with a little selection. We expected a beach BBQ, as at other destinations, but food appeared to have been prepared, packed in and reheated. This was a long day involving 2 hr bus drive each way on poor roads $110 US including scuba, $ 90 without.Resort restaurants mediocre. All la carte restaurants had some good dishes but main dish was either cold, or side dishes were. Buffets were surprisingly better. No coffee available until after 9AM and restaurants do not open until even later. As day trips depart before 9AM, you are hungry and cannot get coffee.We were talked into prepaying $100 US for lobster \/ seafood combination platter at Lagostino del Caribe Restaurant. They treated us like cattle. Place was empty, yet did not want to give us a nice table, we were given a cabbage salad, no dressing, lobster and cold fries. They did not want to give us a second round of drinks, insisting on giving us coffee. Waiter did not talk to us except to say drinks and cafe? but we later saw him speaking english to other guests who arrived, and they were allowed to pick their lobster from the tank and were served a real nice looking seafood platter. Finally, we asked if our taxi driver Pedro could be called and they put us into their preferred taxi instead. We prebooked using spanish speaking rep at hotel who specified grilled lobster, mixed fish, shrimp platter and unlimited drinks. In complaining to rep later, we were simply told they can charge $180 US for a meal, so we got a deal.(?)Padi scuba shop on resort was excellent, operators very safety conscious, personable, good value for dollar. Horseback riding excellent experience.Final insult at resort was paying $50 US for one 10 minute call to Canada. Dont loose the beach towels or they will charge $20 for a $4 Walmart towel. We arrived at airport 3.5 hours before flight and requested seating together at emergency exit for extra legroom. Booking rep insisted we were at emergency exit and we were not. We paid over $1000 US for additional recreation, should have just gone to a 3* resort. We will not return to any Ocean Resort property .
