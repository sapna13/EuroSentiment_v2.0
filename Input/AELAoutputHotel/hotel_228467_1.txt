{"text":"Would stay again and recommend to friends My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights (Sat  Sun night) while on our honeymoon. We loved that El Corte Ingles is literally right next door and the metro stop is at the end of the block. A few blocks away is the Plaza de Espana - a great place to relax, cuddle, and eat some Jamon Iberico. The cafe next door was started by some guys from San Sebastian and is actually a really good cafe. The area also has a few Michelin star restaurants in the area although they were all closed since we were there on a Sunday night. The hotel staff were nice and helped us with directions and the like. Not overly friendly as typical with Spanish culture but nice enough that we didn't feel like we offensive.This neighborhood is much more of a locals area rather than a touristy area so keep in mind that you will not be in the heart of the tourist district. There are no tourist souvenier shops in this area. If you want to experience Madrid as it is experienced by Madrillenos then this is a good pick. If you do want to do tourist stuff you're just a few subway stops away. I believe the Royal Palace is within walking distance too but we didn't make it that far so I can't be certain.The only drawback I can think of if that the internet was 17E a day. I had to do a bit of work via internet while I was there and I didn't like having to pay an extra $50 for internet access. The bed was also a typical Spanish style bed that is really 2 twin beds pushed together. We requested a honeymoon suite but apparently it didn't exist or it didn't matter. This was awkward for us but we realize that this is not unusual in Spanish hotels since we've experienced this many other places.Overall, I was happy with this hotel and I would go back if ever in Madrid.
