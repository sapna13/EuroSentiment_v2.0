{"text":"Honeymoon Haven I was probably there the same week as the last two travelers. Being that I had been to five star in Jamaica, I had great expectations. Once we landed o the plane, we were immediately escorted to our Expedia respresentative which quickly got us on a bus to take us to the htel, there were only two other people with us, so we only stopped once. If it was a busy season we could have been on the bus all day since we were the last stop. Once we arrived our bags were taken, towels and champagne handed to us, and we only waited about 15 minutes for our room. Since it was out Honeymoon we went with the Excellence package ( Not sure if we needed it though, it seems everyone gets the same room an services, aside from the excellence club, but the is food everywhere, an we brought out laptop to access internet in our room. They quickly learned our name and never forgot it. The room was nice, and the minibar was awesome with full bottles of beefeaters, stoli, jim beam, and rum, nut this could have been an excellence upgrade. We didnt really drink them, because I would go to the bar to have my drinks made for me. There were not a lot of peple there, which I believe made it better.Pros:Basically the beach is great there , big with plenty of chairs, excellent service, different activites everyday, 10 top shelf liquor bars, 7 pretty decent restaurants, 2 awesome pools, grand buffets out on the beach several nights, beautiful grounds and more.The food was ok, but nothing to die for. The maid would come in and make the bed, but never refilled shampoo and soap and our sandy sheets were not washed until almost our last night. I shouldnt have to ask for ever little thing that is expected. There were too many salesmen on the beach trying to get you to take excursions. ONe guy approached us 3 time a day all week! I guess he couldnt remember what we looked like. It was our honey moon, we wanted to relax, not be bothered, not take excursions, but they couldnt let up. There are cleary peopl in the hotel to help you book a trip if you want it, and they did also bother you at the pool. Again, didnt want to complain, just wanted to relax. The spa was aveage, and one of our services was in a room with the door open, and we were sweating to death. I had to ask for cold towels. Overall they really tried to please you and make the whole experince fun filled and relaxing, I believe they did that, and it is definately a couples resort, you can mingle if you like with other people, expecially at the swim up bar, or just be alone. Expedia also contacted us with all of our return information and got us swiftly to the airport on time and explained exactly where to go and what to do. You dont have to tip, but we wanted to because we were impressed with the service. Give it a try, you wont be disappointed.
