{"text":"NOT a five star hotel--no way NOT a five star by any stretch of the imagination. A two or three at most. Overpriced to the nth degree. Do NOT believe good reviews about this place, really truly. I can't imagine why anybody would stay here at these prices. I am used to five star places and love that level of service. When in Phoenix, stay anywhere but here.PROS: The golf course was ok. The architecture of the main building is really interesting, especially at night. Worth a trip if your'e into that.However... The service on the links was awful. The architecture is not Frank Lloyd Wright, however. It's just inspried by him. Worse yet, everything except the lobby and the main common areas have been gutted beyond recognition, like by the worst common denominator 70s Hilton type mediocrity. The pools are nice, but badly updated. Even the rooms have tacky arts and crafts knock off fake furniture you'd see at an Embassy Suites. So if you want to stay here for the architecture, forget it. Stop by and have a drink at the bar, walk around for ten minutes, but stay somewhere else. They took the soul out of this 1929 resort. Having said that, if only the Four Seasons or somebody would restore it to look original 1929 and take over management, it could be a special place, like the many upscale mid-century places in Palm Srings.CONS: During my stay, a partial list: They mow the lawn at 7:30 am with really loud mowers. The tv stations didn't work. No internet in the room, and the business center charged $40 per hour!! EVERYTHING is overpriced as to be a joke!! The porno cost $15 per movie. Sheesh! The honor bar was higway robbery: The teeny little water bottle was $5. This is the desert for heaven's sake--no complimentary water?? The teeny little half coke bottle was $5.50. The thing of cashews, all 23 of them, cost $11. There are flourescent lights in the rooms. I love the environment and all, but flourescent lighting is the worst cheapskate thing in a nice hotel. The gifts shops had tacky tacky 1980 preppie stuff. The food was HORRIFIC. At the Grill, at the Wrights dining room--it's as if the cook saw a picture of a fancy restaurant in NYC or San Francisco, and made the food look like the picture, but the tastes are truly gruesome. Bad tomatoes, broken recipes. The shrimp was yellow, the fish and chips frozen. The staff do not respect the do not distirb signs--we're talking three or four knocks late at night kind of thing. The staff is rather ignorant--they mean well, but they don't have the hotel to back it up.This is really not a good place to spend money. The list of activities is a joke, and everything costs a fortune to do it.
