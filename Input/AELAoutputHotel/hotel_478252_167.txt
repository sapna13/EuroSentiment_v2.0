{"text":"LOVED IT!! We stayed from May 9th -16th 2008. There are 2 hotels that are just alike gran bahia principe punta cana and the Bavaro.Thw weather there was excellent. Nice and warm and the humidity wasnt bad at all. We always use Apple Vacations for our travel they have always done a excellent job. We have been to Mexico 5 times and decided to try a new area and very glad we did. We traveled with a group of 8. No one got sick.O.k. I could go on and on.Food:buffets were good could find something to always eat. But after a week it seems to get old. Al A Carte we booked the BBQ it was average, Gormet (french rest) was very good. The Italian it was very good as well. We were not able to book the steak house due to lack of space. Beach  Pools:THere are very nice. Pools are keeped very clean. Swim up Bars are excellent!!!!Rooms:We seen no bugs in our room. The rooms are very nice and kept very clean. We stayed in 20112. Ceck in was very fast and easy My friend was put in the 2nd floor and due to a recent hip replacement needed to change her room to a first level floor. Was not a problem they fixed the problem in 10 minutes.Staff: Was very friendly and kind. We never had to wait for nothing the service was very good. Iris in the main buffet is the BEST!Tours:We went to Santo damingo was nice but a 4 hour bus ride there plus the 4 hour trip back was not worth the trip.Saona Island- very nice and fun!Safari Outback- our tour guide was Eddie. Very nice trip got to see how the people live there.buffet they severed was the best food we ate on the trip! And they served lots of drinks!!!!!I have read many Bad reviews on this hotel that were getting me worried before we went on vacaction. But some people would complain if they were hung with a new rope. Remember you are on VACATION ENJOY IT!!!!
