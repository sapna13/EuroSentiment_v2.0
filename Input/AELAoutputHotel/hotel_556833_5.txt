{"text":"Not bad... Stayed at the SAS Radisson from October 6th-10th, 2008 and overall it was a nice stay.The bed was comfortable and there was a menu of 12 different pillows on order. However, there is a distinct lack of wardrobe and drawer space, which is not a problem for 1 night, but for 4 nights it's an inconvenience!!!There's a laptop safe, mini bar and a tray with a kettle, tea and coffee, sugar etc.The bathroom is decorated with red rose wallpaper!!! The shower had good water pressure. For some reason, there is a window from the bathroom to the bedroom!!! Fortunately, there were blinds to block this window. Rather annoyingly, the bathroom has a speaker so you can listen to the TV - great in the morning, not so great late at night. This speaker has no volume control unlike the TV!!!There is a LCD TV - though only CNN and BBC World for English speakers. Also, there is internet access via free WiFi or broadband cable.The breakfast was pretty expensive at √à√\u2020√ü?6 even though it's an all you can eat buffet. A much cheaper option is to go to the coffee bar opposite reception - a latte and croissant is √à√\u2020√ü?.Gaia is the main hotel restaurant. All in all, the waiting staff are completely multi-lingual and very friendly and helpful. However, their time keeping leaves a lot to be desired. It took 45 mins from ordering drinks to ordering food (despite prompts). When ordered, the food arrived very quickly.A cheaper and quicker option is to order bar food at the Wunder Bar. The choice of malt whiskeys has to be seen to be believed!!! Also, the bar does great cocktails, that are reasonably priced from √à√\u2020√ü? to √à√\u2020√ü?1 respectively.The gym is fine for this sort of hotel. The swimming pool has great views across the city, but is rather small!!! The sauna and steam room are excellent.
