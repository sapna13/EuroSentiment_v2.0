{"text":"This is a great resort! After years of wanting to go to Bali, I finally made it!When planning the trip, the hotels choices were between the Intercontinental and the Ritz Carlton. In the end, I chose the Intercontinental based on the value for the money.We booked the King Club room. As expected, we were met at the airport by the hotel staff and after about 30 minutes in the lounge, we were transported to the hotel for check in.At the hotel check in, there was a little pomp and circumstance with our arrival (hey, this is Asia after all, service is a little better!) and we were shown to our club room.Our room was fine. Not great and not bad -- just average. As we got in at night, we waited until the morning to explore. When we did explore, we couldn't believe how beautiful the property was!! It was incredible!My only complaint was that as part of the Club room, we were supposed to have access to the Club Pool but it was closed for renovations.My advice if you're thinking of staying at the property: Don't get the Club rooms. The perks that you get at the club level don't meet the extra cost. The only perk we ended up using was the Club restaurant where you can get free meals. We paid $270\/nt and the non-club rooms were $140\/nt. It just doesn't add up. No matter which way you slice and dice it, the meals don't add up to the difference. Save your money and get the normal room. We thought the butler would be a nice touch but we never used their services!! The club rooms are the same as non-club rooms; only in a different wing.Final thought: Whatever you do, you MUST visit Bali!!! Incredible!
