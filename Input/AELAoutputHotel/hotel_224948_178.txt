{"text":"Elegant hotel and amazing steak restaurant! We stopped here for three nights as part of our honeymoon. The hotel looks very elegant and the front desk staff are extremely welcoming. They are very happy to offer you advice about 'the sights' and will make every effort to make you feel a valued customer. The price, which is not excessive, was justified in the quality. I'd told them that it was our honeymoon when I booked the room. When we arrived we had been upgraded to a beautiful room on the 16th (out of 17) floor. When we got to the room we were greeted with huge strawberries dipped in dark chocolate, chilled sparkling wine, red wine, fresh fruit, mineral water all dressed with orchid heads and a hand written note congratulating us. It was really wonderful.The room was a very good size, bathroom fantastic - Molton Brown products. Bed was extremely comfortable with very good quality linen. The whole hotel was very clean and the housekeeping staff clearly took pride in their work. There was even a note welcoming us to the hotel from the member of staff responsible for our room- very nice touch.We had breakfast and dinner in Bob's Steakhouse. The breakfast was nice but nothing outstanding. Service on both occasions was good. The steak however was simply the best either of us have ever tasted! We both had the fillet mignon, it was cooked perfectly to our request. Fabulous.I would definitely recommend this hotel and I will happily book hotels within this chain again.
