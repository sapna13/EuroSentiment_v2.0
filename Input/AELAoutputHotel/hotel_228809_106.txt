{"text":"Wonderful Spent two nights at the Royal Magda and had a wonderful time. The hotel is well-situated just off the CDG Etoile and is very near the Metro stop of the same name and also the AIr France airport bus stop.I arrived early in the afternoon and was able to check in right away, and from the very beginning the staff were warm, friendly and welcoming. My single room included a double bed, bathroom with shower, LCD TV, free broadband internet, and a desk. Everything was spotlessly clean and the bathroom had huge, fluffy towels.Breakfast was not included in the room price and was offered as either a buffet in the lobby or a tray delivered to the room. As the charge was the same for either option (12 Euros), I had a tray in my room and it was the perfect way to start my day: cafe au lait, fresh squeezed orange juice, yogurt, baguette, croissant, pain au chocolat, cheese, butter, and jam. I decided to order breakfast at the last minute and it was brought up less than 10 minutes after I called. It's also available until noon should you want to really sleep in.The only thing less than perfect was the soundproofing of the room. I could hear every word spoken by the couple in the next room, and whenever they would leave or return, it sounded like they were opening and closing my door. And, although perfectly adequate, an upgrade in the bedding wouldn't be a bad idea.For the location, price and service quality, though, the Royal Magda is a gem. I can't wait to return.
