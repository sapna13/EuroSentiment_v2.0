{"text":"Wonderful Experience We just returned from a week at the Melia Caribe, Royal Service. We have been to many all-inclusives in several countries, but by far, this was the best.As soon as we arrived and identifiied ourselves as RS we were taken immediately to the RS check in where it took less than 15 minutes for 8 of us to be checked in with drinks and hourdourves. We were then taken to our rooms by tram. Our first night we ate dinner at the Gabi and met Wandie who would become our friend and care taker for the next week. Even when we went to the different restaurants, Wandie always had desert and drinks layed out for us when we returned. The location is lovely and is very spread out. That suited us as we like to play tennis and get a lot of physical activity along with all the food and drink on a vacation. There was always a tram to jump on if you didn't want to walk.The rooms were well equipped and the fridge was always stocked with beer, fruit juice and water. The Gabi seemed like it was open for business 24 hours a day and hourdourves were served around the RS pool mid-morning. as well as at the RS beach.If you are thinking of going, the only way to go is Royal Service. There were never more than 25 to 30 people in the private RS pool. You always felt special and waited on at all times.Only one person in our party had any gastric problems and that was the night before we left so it wasn't a big problem and he felt better by the next morning. You should be prepared with Immodium and Pepto just in case. They really do have a pillow menu and we all had great fun ordering new ones each day. Getting reservations for any of the specialty restaurants was a phone call to RS and it was taken care of. It was an excellent vacation and though we have never returned to the same all-inclusive I believe we will be returning here. ","annotations":[]}
