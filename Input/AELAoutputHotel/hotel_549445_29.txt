{"text":"Not luxury, but clean and adequate I was in Boston for a dental convention, not for visitng. I needed a room near the Hynes just to sleep. I didn't need anything fancy. I got a geat price of $99\/night for a Thursday and Friday night. That is incredibly cheap foe Boston. Parking was $18\/night in the adjacent public garage. The room was small. Somewhat of a cross between a twin and a double bed. This bed would be a tight squeeze for two people. The room was small, but clean. The bathroom was small but clean. The showerhead was in a peculiar position. It faced the shower door so you had to open the door, get soaked when turning the water on and then jump in the shower stall. The floor got soaked. There was a hair dryer, and ironing board. There wasn't much of anthing that can be described as a closet, just some hooks. This is definitely NOT the place for extravagence. It would be cramped for two people. The location is great, right in the heart of Back Bay. Easily accessible by train or MBTA. You are right in the middle of Copley Square. Tons of restaurants nearby in the Westin\/Marriott\/Sheraton complex and on Newbury St. There is a spartan cafeteria downstairs open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A continental breakfast of one hot drinK, one cold drink and a pastry is included in the room fee. A full breakfast is served if you wish, along the lines of a Denny's. Prices are very reasonable. Food was waht would be expected from a cafeteria. The staff was very helpful and attentive. No bellman or anything like that. There is a computer room on the 6th floor with free use of the computer, printer and internet. A very small fitness room is there, but only 2 or 3 pieces of equipment. The hotel is a renovated YWCA so the configuration is a bit peculiar. This ain't the RItz, but the place is clean and convenient. I would definitely stay there again under the same conditions. This place is not for a wife and kids.
