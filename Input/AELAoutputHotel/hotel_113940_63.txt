{"text":"A Lovely and Warm Place To be My husband and I stayed here for our holiday in San Francisco. The hotel was so pretty inside. Our room was close to the front desk, but there was not any noise all the time we were there. The bed was big, nice and comfortable; they even put a RUSS teddy bear on the bed (Not for guest, it is only for decoration). Although the room was quite small, we did not find it a problem at all. The bathroom was nicely decorated, in French-countryside style. We had a shower room - and the water that comes out of it was so, so powerful, it almost skinned us! It was a GREAT shower with very high pressured water. The thing we need after a long walk around the city.On the basement was the breakfast and wine room. (Wine room meaning; the hotel serves cheese and wine in the afternoon). The breakfast was always quiche, plus a lot of fruit and maybe some sausages. I would rather have an English breakfast, but the breakfasts we had there were good.Coffee and tea 'flow' all day, all we have to do is to go to the basement. They also put some apples and cookies for guests.There is a small library at the basement, where there were few sofas and coffee tables. Also there was a fire place, so it made the room cozy.The staff at the front desk were very pleasant all throughout our stay. They give good directions and recommendation to places. The car park fee is USD32 a day, and when we were checking into the hotel, there was a car park right in front of the steps of the hotel,and we unloaded our stuff. Apparently, a car is allowed to park at that spot for several minutes, just enough time to take the things out of the car and checking in. Once we were finished with the front desk and got our room, the staff took our car to their car park, some 30 minutes away around the city.It is recommended that you ask the staff 1 hour before you actually need to depart or go somewhere. Having said that, we did not encounter any difficulties in getting our car. (At times, when we just got back from touring out of San Francisco city, our car was parked for more than an hour at that spot and the staff did not seem to worry to much about getting the car parked at their allocated car park area.)I like the hotel, because it is close to anywhere we wanted to go by foot. It is close to Chinatown, Fishermen's wraft, financial district and shopping centres.We plan to go to SF angain soon, and we will stay at Petite Auberge. It is such a lovely place to stay.Well recommended for everyone.
