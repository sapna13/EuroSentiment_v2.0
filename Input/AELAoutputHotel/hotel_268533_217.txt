{"text":"What a friendly place! This hotel is so friendly. it's a real home from home. the staff were so nice and helpful, this was one of the best hotels i have stayed in. myself and my husband stayed in the argonaut for one week during our honeymoon. san francisco is a beautiful city and the argonaut is a great location. it's in a nice quiet area of fishermans wharf, ie not too close to the buzz of pier 39 but close enough to go for a wander up there. the rooms area really nicely decorated and very large. the bed was so comfortable i slept so well every night! the bathroom was perhaps a bit small compared to the size of the bedroom but it was very nice and well decorated. the shower was lovely, nice and powerful! a lovely touch we thought (coming from europe where this isnt standard) was the coffee machine and sachets of starbucks coffee  teas. that got us well started each morning. the restaurant in the hotel is very nice and well worth a visit. the breakfasts are lovely if a bit pricey. note there's a nice cheap diner just at the back of the hotel and across the street, that does lovely breakfasts for half the price and they are so friendly, it's well worth a visit. i can't remember the name. there's also a lovely bar next to the argonaut called 'jacks'. the bar staff here are really nice and we ended up in there, propping up the bar and chatting with the staff. it was very laid back - typical SF place. I just loved the whole time i spent in the argonaut and would recommend it to anyone who wants a really laid back comfortable holiday.
