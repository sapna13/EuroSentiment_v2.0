{"text":"Great for the business traveler This is my second stay at The Eliot. The first was my honeymoon in September 2001. Then, we chose The Eliot because it had always supported the public interest organization at my law school by donating vouchers for our annual auction. Based on how much my husband and I enjoyed the 2001 stay, I returned for a four-day business and personal trip five years later. During the interval, The Eliot only got better. For a city hotel, the rooms are spacious and inviting, with a pleasant, comfortable, but sophisticated mix of traditional and contemporary furnishings. The color scheme trends toward the browns and golds, with touches of blue and lovely, clean white in the bathroom. A particular plus is the walk-in closet, which is easily four times the size of the closet you would find in any other hotel. At $265\/night, The Eliot is an exceptional value. I appreciated the superb customer service that I received not only from the hotel staff--delivery of business FedExes and faxes was lightning-swift--but also from the cordial and highly professional wait staff in Clio. I dined alone there on a Wednesday night and felt particularly well cared for and well-fed. The wireless internet access in the office area of the room was hampered initially by interference, but the front desk promptly had the service provider contact me, and the provider assured that front desk staff brought me a bridge, readily solving the problem. I had four highly productive days at The Eliot, punctuated by enjoyable exchanges with friendly, competent, diverse staff and pleasant short walks around the lovely Back Bay. Based on two experiences over five years as both a leisure and a business traveler, I would recommend The Eliot without hesitation, and plan to treat this exceptional small hotel as my first choice for all future travel to Boston.
