{"text":"Amazing, Amazing at the Gran Bahia Principe Bavaro We just returned (sept 03-10) from the Gran Bahia Principe Bavaro resort in Punta Cana (hotel is about 2yrs old). I travelled from Montreal, Canada with my husband  2yr old daughter.....this hotel is just so beautiful and huge. We booked a Sunquest vacations\/Diamond Club package which is a grade lower than the Golden club, but not much of a difference between the two. To start off, we checked in on the bus on our way to the Hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel, our luggages were right away delivered to our room....love this kind of check-in.DIAMOND CLUB ROOM, was spacious, clean and all ceramic on the floor. The bathroom was large with a jacuzzi bathtub. Our room was slightly far from the beach  pool, but I didn't mind the walk. Every night we got fresh pool towels  chocolate..RESORT GROUNDS, this resort is huge. There is also the Bahia Principe Punta Cana on the other side. We were on the Bavaro side. There is a mini-bus that always passes and takes you from one pool to the next and one restaurant to the next. There is a casino on sight with all little shops which is great to pass your time at night. The front lobby was very nice  big, which is great in the evening to have a drink.POOLS, so many. We stayed everyday at the pool by the beach (close to the Golden club rooms). There was music, very big, clean with kidddy pools. Lots of pool chairs. There were daily activities in the pool so you are never board. As for the other pools, don't know if there were activities or music. BEACH, not exactly white sand, but was nice. The waves were a little rough and had sea weed. We still prefer the ocean in Cuba.LANGUAGE, the people there do not speak much English. We didn't mind it much, we enjoy speaking Spanish. Same for the tourists, lots of Europeans (topless!!!) from Chile, Spain, Portugal, England, etc.....RESTAUANTS, the food at this resort was very good. As for the buffet  A La Carte (Japonese, steakhouse  Seafood). my favorite meal was breakfast. Thomas made me my omlets  I had chololate dipped FRESH\/MELT IN YOUR MOUTH CROISANTS.ENTERTAIMENT, was a bit bland. The shows are nothing great, but as formy dughter she had a blast dancing with the clown during the kiddy show (8:00-9:00pm). the nimaiontem is great, and are always on time for the daily activities.OVERALL, we had a very nice time. We had beautiful sunny weather which made our vacation all worth while. Like I said, the hotel is very big so you may love it or hate it. Food was very good  large variety (lots of fish  sea food), so if you are a picky eater, you may love it or hate it.
