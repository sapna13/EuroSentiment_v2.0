{"text":"The Truth !!! Well my husband and i came here for our honeymoon. The ride to the resort was about a hour. It was not as bad as everyone said it was going to be. There was no AC on the ride to the resort but, on the way back there was so it is a hit or miss with that. We get to Dreams nobody welcomed us but, it may be different for everyone. It is very open and has a beautiful lobby. We check in and we booked a ocean view room through are agent but, when we recieved our keys and info we saw we didn't have a ocean view room. The front desk argued with us and said we did not book that suit. We called are agent and they even told the resort we paid for that room but, they said no and we didn't end up with what we paid for. We are taking that up with are agent now.  We get to our suit it was very nice but we were on the 3rd floor and the AC sucked. We had no problems with bugs like you may read. The beds are hard but not bad. The room does have water,soda and beer but it is luke warm. The pool was beautiful but very warm you can't cool down in it but we also were there in July.  The food was ok i am a meat and potato's girl and it's only my opinion but the meat is not the same as it is here in the US. So when you see chicken and beef it taste different. We had stomach issues the whole week. Take tums pepto or what ever else works for you TRUST me on this one. The Cafe was where we ate most can't go wrong with pasta,bread,fruit and salad. We did room service it came up cold everytime but oh well it is what it is. The beach was pretty alot of seaweed but it's a beach...There is lunch on the beach everyday burgers,hotdogs and nachos. They do show movies at night and the bars are open till 5 at the pool at between 10 and 11 at other locations. We did go to the club  Disco it was ok very hot seems like no AC is in there. The service is a lil slow so when we ordered drinks there we would get 2-3 at a time. We did notice that if you did or didn't tip our service was the same. I used to bartend so i was tipping good but was not treated any different so i left money after that here and there. LOL now the CASINO it has about 6 tables and 20 slots. It is true what they say watch the dealers. They do not know how to count that great. I changed in 100 for chips she gave me 50 back. My husband said wait we just gave you 100 and then the  pit boss  came said whatever in spanish then the dealer was slamming chips back at us. That did not go over to well with my Husband. Also count your cards before they take them. The dealer would have 18 and take cards that people had 20 with. The resort is beautiful all the staff seemed happy and nice we met great people there ( love ya Gaelyn and Adam) and tried to make the best of the trip. I dont think i would go there again but it's only my opinion I am a Vegas girl so i think i will just stick with that. One more thing when you leave they tell you to make sure you see your bags go on the bus. We were the first on the bus and saw are bags go on. When i looked out the window are bags were against the wall so we had to get off to make sure they were put back on. Have fun enjoy your trip. I realized no matter how many of these reviews you read your experience will be what you make it!!!
