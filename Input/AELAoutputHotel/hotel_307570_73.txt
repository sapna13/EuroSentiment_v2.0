{"text":"Good, but didnt knock my socks off We stayed here on honeymoon in Jan 07 for 6 nights. Its a nice hotel, in a nice setting, but really have got to agree with the comment that this is a hotel which will take your money for any reason imaginable. In Bali generally, tourists are cash-cows, the more the beat you, the more you pay! We were charged for 30 mins internet access (regardless of whether we used 5 mins or 30 mins). The service was very slow, especially then we changed travellers cheques, but the staff are very friendly and always great you with a smile and ask how you are - yes, you would expect that from any hotel, but the Balianese smile is very warm.This is a 5 star hotel with 5 star prices, so if you eat or drink in the hotel expect to pay....a lot!!!!! but right outside the hotel door is the Bali Collection (a collection of 8-10 resteraunts and 10-12 shops and a supermarket) which is far more reasonably priced. If you are expecting Bali to be cheap, think again. If you eat in Nusa Dua, expect to pay more for food and drink. Yes it is cheaper then UK prices, but when you are there (and you dont convert prices back to your own currency) it feels like you are paying over the odds, and you are! Its a resort full of 5 star hotels and they know it. Therefore everything in Nusa Dua costs more than anywhere else in Bali. My strongest recommendation is to venture out of Nusa Dua as much as possible. Jimboran Bay is VERY nice for food (mainly seafood though) and you can eat on the beach with the ocean crawling up the sand just meters from your table.Its a nice hotel with a nice beach, nice pool and nice settings. But is you want something more than nice, choose somewhere else!
