{"text":"Amazing wedding destination!!! My now wife and I travelled to the Iberostar Bavaro in April 2005 to be married and we haven't come down off the cloud since! Our wedding went off without a hitch thanks to our wonderful wedding coordinator Yadilis and Ricky the photographer! I have to say that we had our reservations intially because we were uncertain how the wedding would be without extensive planning. Trust me, there's no need to worry because everything is covered -- not to mention you can change half the things when you arrive anyhow! We got married in the garden for a more private, less breezy ceremony (you can always take pictures on the beach!) There were 12 of us all together and we were all satisfied. Quite the opposite of stuffy church\/hall weddings back home, we were in the ocean within 20 minutes of finishing our pictures! Later that evening we had a lovely dinner at the specialty restaurant where we received our beautiful wedding cake and service second to none! The rooms are clean and spacious and are tended to and stocked to a T every day. Please bring some American ones ($) when you go to tip the staff -- a little goes a long way! We also brought toys and other inexpensive gifts (toiletries) for the maids who certainly accepted them for their families. Speaking of money, we left a portfolio at the restaurant the night before our wedding. it contained our wedding documents, return tickets to Halifax, and a substantial sum of money. As if our nerves weren't shot enough already! Despite a slight language barrier when we called guest services (our fault, we're in their country!) the portfolio was taken by restaurant staff the night before and waited for us at guest services -- with every cent accounted for. Food was great, absolutely no complaints. Specialty restaurants are all worth the booking and minimal effort. Beach is Beautiful, never seen anything like it! Poolside was a nice break from the beach (and closer to the drinks!) Check-in was a breeze and I find it hilarious that some find it excrutiating to have to wait for their room (which is still ready by the required time) at the pool\/beach with a Bahama-Mama in their hand! My wife loved the Spa and we had a fun-filled night at the Casino. So much more good things to say than I have space for.
