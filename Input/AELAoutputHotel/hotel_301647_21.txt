{"text":"Interesting hotel, but with downsides This resort had been highly recommended by a couple of small tour operators but at first sight we were terribly disappointed. We had come from a villa hotel with private pool and the room at the Chedi was very small with tiny bathroom. The hotel has no beach so all sunbeds were in lines around the pool. That was all such a disappointment and so much so that we arranged to cut our stay from 5 nights to 4. However, after night we soon realised the charm of the place. The staff all went out of their way to have a chat with us and particularly to tell us about the East coast and the lifestyle there. The exec chef is new, was trained at the Savoy and is excellent. She was very keen to get feedback. There are lots of little surprises such as afternoon tea, excellent turn down service with hand made biscuits and a great spa with treatments that used products made locally and smelt good enough to eat. There was also a long list of possible trips, most of which were eco type and supported the local community. We went into Padang Bai during the days for diving, but I think we might have been a bit bored staying by the pool all day - grounds are gorgeous but small so no walking around and no long beach. Food and drink wise, the hotel was expensive - it was on a par with the deluxe Oberoi Lombok where we went to afterwards.Would we go back? Well, despite cutting out stay short, yes. Again, we would go for no more than four nights unless we could get a suite. However, we would have to book early as there are only two suites so these are popular. We certainly could not get one when we tried to upgrade.
