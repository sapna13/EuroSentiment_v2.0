{"text":"Won't be staying here again We stayed here for one night, all our first choices being booked up.The location is fantastic - a stone's throw from the Ladies Market and a few minutes from public transport. Everything else about the hotel is pretty average.The rooms are very small, like much of the rest of Hong Kong. A Superior Double is not big enough for two people to walk around in at the same time. Do they really have an Inferior Double?We had asked for a non-smoking room. We didn't get one. On calling down to reception, we were told that all the other rooms were taken. No explanation, no apology. Tough luck. The aircon had been turned off, presumably because it was irritatingly loud when turned on. There was no view, but it was clean enough and the shower was ok, if not as powerful as US travellers might expect.We could not get a late checkout. Fair enough - you can't expect that. But the hotel also has no changing facilities once you have checked out. For those people on late flights to Europe, America or Australia (i.e., nearly everyone), this is hugely inconvenient.They do agree to store your bags. Sort of. In fact, they are left all day in the main lobby, tied to each other with a cable that might withstand kitchen scissors on a good day.Room allocation issues aside, service was reasonably efficient, if frosty.Overall, the stay was tolerable as it was only for one night. But we would not choose to stay here again. There are better places for your money in HK, especially if you can book early. ","annotations":[]}
