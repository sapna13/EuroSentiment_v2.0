{"text":"Good value, good hotel We chose this hotel for its proximity to the Ritz-Carlton where I had a conference, and due to glowing reviews on TripAdvisor. The reviews were right!This hotel is well-located, close to Union Square shopping but on a quieter street part way up to Nob Hill. We didn't notice traffic noise at night. We had several requests -- early check-in, lower floor, facing the street instead of the alley, not close to elevator, and mattress pad. (a previous reveiwer wrote about hard mattresses but with the pad the bed was fine) They were all accommodated easily, and we were able to check in a couple of hours early. We were on the 2nd floor which is where the very little exercise room is but few people use it so it wasn't disturbing. The standard rooms are a generous size.The complimentary breakfast is good, with cut up fruit (including strawberries!) as well as the usual toast, croissants etc. Servers bring juice and coffee so we tipped $5\/day. Tomato slices were a nice touch.High-speed internet access is free and they will provide a cable if you forget one. There is also a free DVD library with an excellent selection. Aveda toiletries were really nice.This is a newer hotel, all non-smoking which is great. It's not high-end or luxurious but perfectly adequate and very good value for money. We booked the AAA rate off the internet and seemed to get a decent rate, as we were there for Fleet Week and many hotels were full.Staff were all helpful and friendly, and the doorman even walked to the corner to get us a cab once. There's also a house car to take people to the airport, $45 flat rate plus tip which is a nice alternative to a regular cab.Because the windows don't open the air can be dry. This was partly negated by the fact that there was no extractor fan in the bathroom so it got a bit steamy after a shower. As the bathroom was quite large, it wasn't too much of a problem. A bit strange for a new hotel, though.Overall we were impressed and will stay here for any future trips to San Francisco.
