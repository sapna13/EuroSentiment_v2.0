{"text":"Wow!!! Well, I was a little afraid of some of the reviews about the El Con, but the pics were so nice, I just decided to think positive and hope for the best. I was definitely pleased with the property of the hotel. The buildings and landscaping were AWESOME. The resort is extremely large, and there are different sections, so I can speak for them all. I think we were in the Las Brisas section, which had ocean views. The rooms were clean and up to date, so I'm not sure what some of the reviewers mean by outdated and dirty. The beds were a little hard, i have to admit, and my husband and I think we have been bitten by bedbugs, but it could possibly be mosquitos. Overall, the resort is beautiful. There is the private beach which is a short ferry ride away. The one complaint I have about that is the cable car that goes to the marina. There are supposed to be 2, but only one was working, so the wait was a little inconvenient. So besides the beds and the cable cars, I give the resort itself an A+On the negative side, we felt that they tried to squeeze as much money as possible out of us. It was ridiculous. Internet service was 15.00 a day! Not 15 bucks for the duration of the stay, which still would have been a lot, but each 24 hr period, was $15. Ridiculous. There was a bakery\/internet cafe, that had only 2 computers, which for the size of the resort was clearly insufficient.The restaurants were ridiculously overpriced, a single scoop ice cream cone was $5. A hamburger was $13. The bottled water in our room was $7. Come on. We didnt eat a single thing at the resort. We also rented a car for our stay and the parking was $15-20 per day.The front desk was kind enough to tell us to use our cell phones because the phone usage was like 9 dollars a minute. It was a great place to stay, I would stay again, but I would remain mindful of what I was willing to spend. The grounds and private beach were superior, but I think we made out well and beat the crowd by coming days after hurricane dean.
