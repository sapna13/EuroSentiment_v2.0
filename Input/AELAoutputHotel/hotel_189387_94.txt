{"text":"We loved this hotel We just spent 5 nights at Hotel Pulitzer in the heart of Amsterdam and want to share our experience. This is a great place. The hotel staff provided excellent service. They could not have been nicer. Our every request was met and at times I felt guilty about being alittle too needy. We asked for museum tickets to avoid lines and they were immediately available. We asked for food not on the room service menu (picky aren't we) and it showed up with a smile and a no problem attitude. We asked for a more limited breakfast in the breakfast room and again it was no problem. They would not let us touch our bags from the moment the taxi dropped us off. All service was very personalized and made me feel like we were staying with friends. They let us use their internet business center including printer for no charge.This hotel has alot of old world charm with a great exercise facility, bar and breakfast room and garden with seating areas.The hotel itself is in a great location allowing you to walk everywhere. It is about 3 minutes to the Anne Frank house right in the heart of canals. Our room was on the ground floor and opened onto a garden area where we could enjoy an afternnon rest and bottle of wine we bought for 5 euro's at the grocery store right around the corner. We used the hotel for morning coffee and breakfast, but some mornings just had coffee and ate breakfast at some of the not to be missed pancake places nearby. I think you might want to request a garden room. We did not request a canal view (as others suggested) and my wife and I were very pleased with the room. They provide slippers and robes. The bed was comfortable but not to the level of a Westin heavenly bed. The bathroom was marble and great. The room itself was alittle on the small side by American standards, but for a European hotel spack in the center of Amsterdam it was large. Walk around the grounds: the whole place is just charming.Make frequent use of the concierge desk. They can help you set up a day. We were there for Queen's day and make frequent use of the garden area to rest from the party.Stay here.
