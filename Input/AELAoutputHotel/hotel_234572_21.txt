{"text":"5 Day Get Away we have just had a five day stay in this hotel u232 hotel barcelona, we have had an experience and wouldnt stay here again, i would rate this hotel as a *** three star, The check in was pleasant and we was sent to room 203 on the second floor, when we first arrived in the room we thought it was great we had 2 bathrooms and twin beds just what we expected apart from the 2 bathrooms, we later realised the 2nd bathroom was a disabled bathrooom and was much larger with enough space for a wheel chair. The bath has a large shower head for a full shower (minus a shower screen) and a hose also connected to taps for washing your hair in the bath, the only problem with this was, that we then relised both baths and sinks in both bathrooms have no plugs?? Where have they gone???The 1st bathroom was tiny, with not enough space to swing a cat, but had a large hairdryer built in and a shower with a glass shower screen. The only problem with this was the shower was either too hot or freezing cold to use. whats happened to temperature controll?? (ever heard of a thermostat)The air conditioning didint go down to any temperature below 19 degrees and the room was constantly hot the small window in the disabled bathroom opened into what is thought to be a boiler cupboard with no boiler just a big brick wall with an empty space.!.also one of the blinds was broken and wouldn√à?√¨t open up so we could open the window to let air into the room. also the radio sound system which plays music in the bathrooms and main room didnt work.The swimming pool is 50 metres away in which direction? anybodys guess???The sauna gym and steam room are all non existant! The staff were pleasant but didnt understand english too wellOverall we liked barcelona but wouldnt stay in this hotel again... ","annotations":[]}
