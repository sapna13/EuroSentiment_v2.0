{"text":"Fantastic oasis in the most central location This hotel is located very central at all day long lively La Rambla, close to Plaza Catalunya. Therefore one is always in the middle of everything and can reach shopping, sightseeing, city tour busses, plenty of restaurants and even the waterfront in short walking distance. Travelling to the airport can be done very easily via the airport bus (costs ca. 4 EUR pp) which goes to Plaza Catalunya - then ca. 5 min. walk to the hotel.The hotel itself is fantastic. Great service, extremely clean (it seems they are cleening all day long) and it offers a fantastic roof terrace with pool and bar. The terrace is the perfect place to escape a bit from the vibrating city life - you can just relax at the pool or lay in one of the roof terrace couches and enjoy some drinks or food. The pool bar is open late night and they also offer breakfast up there but one has to pre-order that the day before. - That seemed a bit odd and they were not flexible if you just wanted to take the breakfast there in the morning without preordering. Another advice: as you stay so central there is always cabs going along outside the hotel you don't need to order that via the hotel - some cab drivers charge up to 6.20 EUR for coming to the hotel after being called - even though they just drive around the corner ... So, just stop a cab at the street, works all the time. ","annotations":[]}
