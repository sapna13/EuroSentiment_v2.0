{"text":"Star staff member was the Sikh doorman, Panni ! Just returned from a six night stay at the Harbour Plaza Hong Kong with my two daughters 12 and 16. First impressions were good, luxurious feel about the place, crystal chandeliers, beautiful harbourfront location, extensive use of marble etc. On arrival, we were shown to our room which was supposed to be a deluxe harbour view room on club level with three beds. We found a very cramped corner room with only two beds and a slight glimpse of water between two buildings and no extra bed nor room to put one in there. Three people would have been very cramped in this room ! I immediately returned to reception to complain (coincidentally, I had seen mention of this practice on previous reviews of this hotel of them trying to palm people off with inferior rooms so, I was already alerted to this possibility)After lengthy argument with the staff who insisted we had the correct room for our booking we were finally shown to the room we should have had in the first place which was a fairly spacious room (by HK standards) on the 16th floor with a third bed already in place. The view was fabulous with a spectacular view of Victoria Harbour.My second daughter was to sleep on a rollaway bed and after one night she complained of back pain. The bed was very uncomfortable and the springs were poking through onto the mattress. We decided to ask for this bed to be removed in order to provide more floor space in the room and she would share a king single bed with me which was not entirely satisfactory but better than suffering from back pain. So, after paying extra for a rollaway bed my daughter and I had to share the king single which was also actually quite uncomfortable with lumpy parts and springs evident in some places. Not what one would expect from a 5 Star hotel. We were also challenged twice on why we had asked for the rollaway bed to be removed and told that we would still have to pay for it as it had been requested by us. All unecessary stress and hassle I could have done without. Also ,despite displaying the 'do not disturb' sign on our door the room maids still knocked and asked us if we needed our room making up that day or not.Overall, I liked the hotel and its facilites and location, some of the staff were great, especially concierge and door staff but, I don't know whether it was the five star experience I expected and it certainly wasn't hassle free ! I would have second thoughts about staying there again.
