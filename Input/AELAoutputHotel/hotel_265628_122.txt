{"text":"Not for Picky City People The staff are very personable and friendly. But it does take a long time for tables to be cleared if you eat poolside. As well, there are some minor language barriers. The rooms are decent, I sugest you bring your own pillow and pillowcase, if you dont like your face rubbing on a rough sham  pseudo pillow. The food is average, I wish they would make more local fare, as the Dominican food was pretty good. As well, the fresh omelette bar in the mornings  pasta bar at lunch is a relief if you like to know how your food is handled. From the a la carte restaurants, a lot of our group liked the vegetarian restaurant (funny thing,, none of us was vegetarian). The drinks are average as well, but not by average Canadian standards. Do not expect amazing international hard liquour, ie. if you ask for a rum\/coke, make sure to ask for bacardi\/coke, canadian club\/ginger ale etc. If you ask, you shall receive. But they don't even have smirnoff vodka....?!?!PLEASE READ: drinks end at midnight, after that you pay $$.Overall, if you're travelling with children, not picky with what you eat, fluent in spanish, you just want to sit on a beautiful beach (that does have lots of dead coral reefs), and swim in the pool, this place is for you. If you are a big drinker, clubber, foodie, enjoy fine arts\/shows, enjoy scoring good shopping deals in a foreign city, and into modern music, this place is NOT for you.Some said this was a 4-star resort, but maybe by punta cana standards. I would give it a 3-star. But since this trip was paid by my parents, this was still a great resort to me ;)Cheers! PS. We named it Punta Canada since we met TONS of Canadians!
