{"text":"Great Time The staff are great, very friendly and happy. The rooms are basic but clean. The food was OK, you can always find something to eat. The pizza and chicken at the snack bar was brilliant. Also the ice cream was a treat. We were 8 people (4 adults and 4 teenagers). The entertainment was horrible (usual lip sinking). And right there near the bar so cant get away from it. The main restaurant was NOT air conditioned but it was OK for us as it wasn't that hot. BE careful going here in the HOT months though. The teenagers had a good time but did get a bit bored at night as the nightclub always played way too much spanish music. The pool area isnt a place we would hang out but on real windy days it was too cool to be on the beach and the noise around the pool was too much for the older folks! The beach at least is quiet and lovely. The grounds are the prettiest we have seen and well cared for. We had a lot of stormy weather and a lot of rain especially in the evenings. The pathways got flooded which was a pain if your wearing good shoes. All in all though I would say that this trip was good value for money. We probably wouldnt go back though unless we had kids with us as it was too loud and not that romantic for a couple looking for some luxury.
