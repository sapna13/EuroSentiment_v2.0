{"text":"Great stay, just shy of the 5-star mark Sheraton on the Park has a prime location (as the name would suggest) on Elizabeth St right next to Hyde Park, and a short walk from most major businesses and Sydney attractions. The rooms were very well furnished and comfortable, and the bathroom was gigantic and gorgeous (separate shower and tub). My only hesitance, and why it's not five stars in my book, was that there was slight evidence of wear in my guest room. The desk chair looked a bit used, and there were a couple chips in the bathroom vanity and toilet. It may sound very nit-picky to call those out, but when everything else is so superb, you do notice the little blemishes.I enjoyed the fact that turndown service was available but not mandatory - as I often find as a business traveler that it occurs at times when I'm actually in the room. The concierge staff was quite nice, and directed me well on all occasions. Staff members were always pleasant and helpful without being overbearing. If you do go in the summer - I would recommend the rooftop pool - the view overlooking Hyde Park is gorgeous (and it wasn't even a nice day when I went). Room service is a bit overpriced, but there is a Starbucks right around the corder, along with a Food Court in Sydney Tower down the block if you want to grab food instead. Overall, a great hotel that I would solidly recommend - based on their reputation, I am confident that if brought to their attention, the blemishes would be quickly fixed.
