{"text":"Natura Park - don't believe all you read before trying this hotel We just returned from Natura Park April 11-18.We are still trying to figure out the comments on the seaweed. The beach was raked twice a day - and the water had little seaweed.Chairs were not a problem -- and we saw no one removing towels.The food was fine - I mean come on - you aren't in the states but in the dominican - of course the food will be different.Grounds are beautiful and the beach was wonderful. Lots of ducks and pink flamingos and they just walk around like they own the place -- and I guess actually they do.Spa was wonderful - you need to try it.Do the ATV outing - two hours on the ATV and what a thrill.Minor negatives - the refrigerator could have been a colder but it was okay. An exhaust fan in the bathroom would have been nice.Could have had blenders at the bars - frozen drinks were not available. Shows were okay.We didn't know about the steps leading from the lobby to the bar\/restaurant. When we checked in our bags were carried but not so when we checked out. A little tough lugging the bags up 20 steps. One person at the airport when we were leaving referred to the resort as a hell hole Come on - you are on vacation - the sun is beaming - the water is blue - and you don't have to cook any of your meals. Glad that I can appreciate the value of life.One more thing - French are ignorant and obnoxious. Not a whole lot of folks from the USA - some from Canada and very friendly. Would we stay again - absolutely.If you go, enjoy your trip. You won't be disappointed.Trish B. ","annotations":[]}
