{"text":"El Conquistador was NOT a vacation! Very disappointed in El Conquistador, if you are planning a quiet relaxing vacation, do not go to this hotel, doors slamming and paper thin walls you can hear the person in the other room using the restroom. we stayed in the 3440 section, there were ants on the nightstand, bathroom was just remodeled but it looked like they just glued the new tile to the old, you could see the old mildew and old tub! long long walks to get to one place, NO golf cart transportation. Service by the hotel staff was poor, the only great service we received was from Fernando in Bella Vista, he did an outstanding job, the rest of the staff acted as they if we were doing them a favor. They all of sudden became alive when it was tip time. Hotel Hot tub near the Bella vista had a Kotex Max pad sitting on the side, the grounds are NOT kept there is cigarette bud, cups, napkins junk on the floor, there is NEVER anyone picking up or sweeping the property. THe lobby restrooms were flity and old. They need a serious paint job and chaulking the bathrooms! The food was very over priced, and the drinks were weak. The only place that had discent food or drinks wa the bella vista, the pizza was yummy. Forget about asking for assistance on tours or places to go, every time you called the concierge, they never knew anything or told us to call back. We did enjoy our $300 dinner at the strip house, it was delicious. I felt that I never got a good night sleep, there were doors and staff walking by talking on their radios, it was loud all night, and one night the wind was blowing so hard that we had to push the furniture up on the glass to stop the howling or the glass from vibrating! We did move rooms one from 3200 section to the 3440 but it was all the same LOUD! Bring your ear plugs, and be prepare to see trash every were you go. the beach was okay, my son enjoyed the boat ride, but there was trash all over the beach, and sea weed every where, it would be nice if they could of just invested a few hundred dollars to pay a cleaning staff to keep the properyt clean! A tip for Palamino beach, hire someone to rake the seaweed! Next time I will go back to Mexico!
