{"text":"Loved it! My husband and I stayed for about four nights last summer. At the time, the hotel wasn't rated as highly as it is now. We thought we were getting a great deal, especially considering that it was pretty much at the height of the season. Once we arrived, we knew we got a great deal. The hotel has a clean contemporary style. Service was impeccable - professional without being stuffy. The room was spotless, and we thought quite spacious. There were only two negatives: The first afternoon (after a very long flight, and suffering from jet lag) we were rudely awoke by a VERY loud and long chiming. There is a church bell tower about 15 feet away from the room and every afternoon it chimes for quite a bit. Normally, not an issue, but a pain that first day. Second issue was location. Most of the big attractions are quite a bit west of the hotel. The tube was close so it wasn't that big - but if you're looking for a neighborhood with a lot of places to explore this isn't it. There were a few large hotels, the tower and london bridge nearby, lots of places for lunch - but otherwise it was primarily businesses. Nonetheless, if we got a good enough deal, we'd stay there again. The staff was flawless, hotel was spotlessly clean, bed and bedding was comfortable (and I'm a bedding snob!), and design was good. The two negatives noted were insubstantial enough that this was probably one of the best trips we've had. ","annotations":[]}
