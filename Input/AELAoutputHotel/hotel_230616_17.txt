{"text":"Somewhere special My partner and I booked a last minute stay at the Banks Mansion and from the moment the reservation was made, the staff proved how important it is to make the customer feel special. We had a problem with the credit card when booking and the following day the hotel made contact, by telephone as well as email, and ensured that the reservation was made without worrying about taking a deposit. We arrived pretty early on our first day and intended to drop our bags and run, but the lovely Nena told us the room was nearly ready and showed us down to the breakfast room and offered us complimentary breakfast while we waited. How often does that happen....??! The room was a large room on the ground floor, facing the road, when we enquired about moving Nena was only too happy to look at the other rooms and quickly moved us up to the 2nd floor, overlooking the canal. The room was small and the art deco style might not be to everyones taste but it was very clean, comfortable and with the lovely bathroom and huge shower with rainfall head it was perfect. A well stocked, complimentary(!!), minibar with additional decanters of spirits, robes and flipflop slippers were the icing on the cake.The 'living room' area in reception offers complimentary wines, beers, spirirts and hot drinks along with snacks and newspapers so you can chill out after a long day exploring this fantastic city.The staff were excellent throughout our 2 night stay and nothing was too much trouble for them. As we had an early morning flight home, Nena organised cereals, milk and fruit to be left in our room the night before. Again, nothing proved to be too much trouble and the staff were genuinely happy to help. We will definitely stay here again when we next visit Amsterdam, which might not be too far away.....
