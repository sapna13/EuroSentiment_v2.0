{"text":"Awesome hotel Ninezero is one of the best hotel experiences I've had in recent memory. It's got a fantastic location near Boston Common and Downtown Crossing, with easy access to both the green line (e.g: back bay) and blue line (e.g: airport). The hotel is tastefully decorated, and everywhere from the lobby, elevator, room and bathroom were well lit and arranged. It even smelled nice and fresh.The staff was excellent and friendly, eager to help and provided very useful information. They all seemed to carry a genuine smile and happy to do their job. For example, I asked where to find the boston Duck Tour (highly recommended btw), and I was immediately informed of the two closest locations around the hotel, but she referred me to the concierge desk to book the tour in advance just in case. The gentleman at the concierge was equally friendly, and offered concise directions on where to locate the duck tour at the Prudential center. Furthermore, we were fortunate to find out in advance that the Saturday tour was already fully booked, and we quickly snatched a preferred time on the next day. All of this was done by the Hotel concierge desk without extra charge. In addition, he recommended that at the end of the Freedom Trail we could ride a ferry from Charlestown back to Long Wharf. That's valuable information I didn't have, and was glad to save a bunch of walking time.I just have two minor criticisms: (1) could use a little more towel hanging space in the bathroom, and (2) the air conditioner was very cold, and the room remained pretty cold even after I turned it off, but it's manageable.I will definitely return to this hotel in the future. Great location, great room and great service all at a good price. Highly recommended.
