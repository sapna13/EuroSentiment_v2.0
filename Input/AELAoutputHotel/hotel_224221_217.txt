{"text":"Great Sanctuary in Otherwise Crazy Town Where do I start? First and foremost, I FOUND the place as a result of Tripadvisor. The property is exactly as the comments indicate. YES it's a great small boutique hotel, so if you like those 18 elevator lobby hotels that double as rent-a-car facilities, this isn't your place; YES this place has great staff, in fact, they helped me with a very early check in, which was most appreciated; YES this place has a very wide assortment of DVDs to watch (that is, if you really get bored and have nothing else to do, which is really hard in a city like NYC); YES the rooms are small, but who cares? I'm not buying the place; the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms spotless. Added perks: (1) continental breakfast; (2) excellent espresso machine, juice, filtered water, juice, milk, baked goods, cookies, and fruit 24 hours a day; (3) great wine and cheese event every night; (4) folks, the windows in the room open all the way (5) the hotel lies on madison, but only a few rooms actually face it, that said, the hotel is on an otherwise quiet street (relative term for new york, but still quiet) (6) a very popular upstair open-air rooftop bar is a hit with the locals, and for good reason. You know what else is cool? THEY READ THESE. Hey guys!!! So, they care about all of this - which is a step in the right direction, I say. That said, thanks for a great stay.
