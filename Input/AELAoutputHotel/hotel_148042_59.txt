{"text":"Don't be fooled by the brand-name! This hotel is like paying for a BMW and driving a Hyundai (no offense to the Korean car lovers!). If you have ever stayed at other RC properties you will immediately notice the difference. This hotel will still give you a nice room with an exceptionally comfortable bed, but the ridiculously long front desk line and lack of service and security will make the 17 dollar Mojitos and 30 dollar breakfast buffet hard to enjoy.  Let√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ start with the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Øissing√à√\u2020\u2022?cell phone that disappeared from the surf shop counter in 2 minutes and the complete lack of cooperation or assistance from the hotel management. I believe that the unusual circumstances of the loss of the cell phone (Almost a witnessed theft), and RC being in such a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≤ame√à√\u2020\u2022?resort would prompt some action by the management to maybe smooth over the actions of a certain employee or at least to make some gesture to appease two very irate guests who lost their only mobile source of communication with their 15 month old in NY. But unfortunately we got shifted through all the different levels of management to leave with a 50 dollar credit to our room√à√\u2020\u2022?or two and a half Mojitos! Our mini bar was raided by the previous occupants of the room who left us a half-eaten Snickers bar and Vodka and Gin bottles that were opened and refilled with water √à√\u2020\u2022?real classy! Despite our repeated phone calls to the front desk we checked out 4 days later with the same bottles in the mini bar and a late discovered $3.75 charge for the chocolate bar! The beach is very nice, but the water is very shallow with lots of rocks and coral that make swimming a bit challenging. The casino is elegant but small. Only half of the tables games are staffed even on the busiest nights and the tables can go from a $5 dollar minimum to $25 in 15 minutes. Brings lots of cash and patience. Overall it was an OK experience, but you can have a better experience at the Marriott in Condado for √à√¥√ú the price.
