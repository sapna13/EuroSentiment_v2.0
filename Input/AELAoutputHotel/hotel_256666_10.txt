{"text":"Pleasantly Surprised I have to say we were pleasantly surprised when we opened the apartment door. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the tower was built in the 1970s and has a hideous, boring brown colour reminiscent of many of the high-rise buildings of that time. Secondly, we had seen a couple of bad reviews on TripAdvisor and we were sceptical about the place. We had booked the two bedroom apartment in the Deluxe Category for a decent price, considering it was the Australia Day long weekend. Upon entering the room, we found that it had been fully renovated and all of the appliances and furnishings were quite new. The apartment was spacious and tastefully decorated, with clean bathrooms and large balconies. This was a positive start. Another good point about this hotel was that with each apartment you book, you receive a free, secure undercover parking space. The car park is tight and somewhat confusing (because of the RESERVED signs that are placed in front of 90% of the spaces), but for a free spot so close to Circular Quay we can't complain. While the York is close to the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, it is at least a 20-30 minute walk to Darling Harbour and the Aquarium. Because we have already seen all of the major attractions in Darling Harbour, and because we normally drive to Sydney, I would most probably stay here again. For an overseas tourist however, they may consider staying somewhere more Central (ie somewhere in between Circular Quay and Darling Harbour). ","annotations":[]}
