{"text":"Embassy Suites ruined our vacation!!  We have stayed at the Embassy Suites, Scottsdale-Phoenix, every year for spring training, but our last visit will be our final visit!! When we first arrived, we were promised a Perfect 10 visit - what a joke!!! The first day, we received no housekeeping - not a big deal!! But, the second day, when we received no housekeeping it was a problem. So, we had to beg the staff for towels. Still, no big deal. (Hey, we're paying $300 a night, what do you expect!!) Then, we were double charged for internet service - oh well. Now, here's the kicker - the third day, we went out to the parking lot and all the passenger windows on our Expedition were smashed in, and my son's school books, dvd\/cd player were gone. The staff admitted that the parking lot had no security and that this had happened before. They offered absolultely no assistance!!! The alleged managers Paul and John were pathetic. The purported real manager Carol could not be contacted, but we were promised a call from Carol immediately when she returned - it's been two weeks - no contact from Carol, yet!! We had to spend the entire day dealing with police, rental car companies, insurance companies, and glass companies. This was susposed to be a vacation - it turned into the biggest headache and hassle. The hotel managers' attitude was To bad for you; you trusted us! When we reminded them that they promised us a Perfect 10 visit, they just looked at us like we were crazy. They offered no transportation to the rental car place, no assistance dealing with the police... Their lack of concern, help, etc... was shocking and appalling!!!! We will never stay at Embassy Suites again!!! And recommend that if you do stay at this hotel, don't expect anything, but hassles, poor service, and no security!! ","annotations":[]}
