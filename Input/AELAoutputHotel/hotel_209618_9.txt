{"text":"Just poor! This was my second time in this hotel, another 2-week stay. Unfortunately that one was not up to the price paid. I had requested a golf-view room; I got one, nice although overlooking the two huge air conditioning hotel fans which are constantly working and particularly noisy. So I requested another one and was granted a room on the 3rd floor right above the ballroom. Extremely bad location, and unfortunately no other room available! Parties were going on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday etc. with music playing until very late in the night, in fact early in the morning. Terrible when you are there for business. Neighbours in adjacent rooms were particularly noisy, which demonstrates poor room insulation. It was almost impossible to enjoy the pool which did not open until 8am (it was supposed to open as soon as 7am) and would be instantly crowded by hordes of bawling kids. In addition, the internet connection never worked in my room and was never fixed although raised to the hotel staff; and you get to pay for it every day! Breakfast quality is hardly average, and personnel at front desk were overall not really caring. Also, avoid using the laundry service, as my shirts were delivered with damaged buttons! Finally, the food in the restaurant appears to be overpriced; and so is parking. Is that because mid-May was just a bad period? I'm really unsure and was overall quite disappointed. It is unlikely I will stay there a third time, although the hotel location is great. ","annotations":[]}
