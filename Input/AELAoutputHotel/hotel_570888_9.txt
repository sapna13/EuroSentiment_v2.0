{"text":"good, clean, simple Some of the reviews here make this place sound like a bit of a dump but I'm glad I took more notice of the latest reviews which have been positive. My stay for 2 nights over the Chinese New Year weekend resulted in a good experience as long as you're not expecting too much.The only downside was that the rooms don't have any method of room heating (air con in each room gives you cold air or fan-only) and in Hong Kong in early February with outside temperatures of about 5C at night this meant the rooms were cold. A pair of pyjama-type bottoms (which I don't usually wear in bed) resulted in a good night's sleep but don't expect a cosy warm apartment if it's cold outside. At least the hot water in the shower meant that my morning shower wasn't chilly.The apartment was very clean, the bed was firm but comfortable, the bed sheets, pillows and duvet were good and clean and the towels were clean. I'm very tall (6'7 \/ 2.02m) but I didn't notice the bed being particularly shorter than any other regular-sized bed I've slept in. With the cold weather I did make sure I wore my socks to bed though!Overall, the apartment is basic but comfortable and does what you need if you want a cheap base for exploring HK. The MTR (subway\/metro\/tube) system is less than 10 minutes' walk away and only a few stops from the main sightseeing action. There was always someone on the front desk that spoke English and was able to answer my questions, whether it was 10am, 10pm or even 3am. Although the in-room hourly internet access rate of HK$30 isn't fantastic, the daily rate for broadband access from your room (assuming you have a laptop with you of course) was a reasonable HK$60. There's also a cheaper-again 3-day option but I can't recollect the price. I didn't use the internet access so can't comment on its quality but the LAN cable was sitting in my room waiting to be plugged in and used. The 'business suite' is just a single computer and the prices weren't fantastic sounding but if you don't have a laptop with you then it could be useful. The free gym is a small glass-walled room with a stair stepper, treadmill and bike... and an air-con unit! Simple and basic but does the job.For getting to the hotel from the airport I discovered there's no train\/tube-based option out of the airport other than the Airport Express, which is relatively expensive compared to the cheap HK tube system. Not wanting to pay for a taxi ride all the way to the hotel (estimated at about $280 judging by a sign I saw at the airport) I used the Airport Express train to the first possible stop of Tsing Yi (HK$110 return) and then got a taxi from Tsing Yi to the hotel. The taxi ride cost HK$70 on clear roads. On the way back I decided to try the MTR from the close-by Sham Shui Po station to Tsing Yi which cost about HK$6 and then caught the Airport Express train back to the airport with the remainder of my return ticket bought 2 days before. Using the MTR back did mean dragging my suitcase to the MTR station but it's not that far. Lifts at all MTR stations mean there's no great hardship having a suitcase with you for getting in\/out of the station or changing trains.
