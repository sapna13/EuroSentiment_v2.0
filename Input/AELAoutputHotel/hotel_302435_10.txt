{"text":"Outstanding service! The service is the key that differentiates this hotel from others who are in the same price range. I have to admit that I am a complain and picky type of person. I have also been spoiled by living in Thailand where the service is always very good. The Imperial has impressed me big time with the attentive service.The room was nice and correct. It is not very big but has enough space for two to stay in comfortably. Bed was comfortable, features pillows and duvet. We were in a room that has been redecorated. So the room was new and not dated as in some reviews. They also had free internet (but not wireless). The shower was nice with seperate bath and shower and lots of amenities (but no body lotion - although I am sure if you ask, they can provide). The gym had good machines i.e. treadmill, cross-trainers etc. The in-door pool was nice and warm. I also liked their shower room at the gym.... the Japanese style shower area was nice. The hotel is located in good location with Hibiya tube station in front and 5 mins walk to Ginza area. There are also lots of restaurants around. So we did not try any restaurants in the hotel. They looked popular among the Japanese though.The only problem we had was that the staff didn't understand English very well. I called them to ask for some cotton pads but had to explained for a while. At the end, they sent some Shisedo moisturizer to my room (which was nice!). The day after, someone must have told them what 'cotton pad' was. So the maid put lots of them in my room and kept refiling them everyday (and also refilled the Shisedo!). All their staff was very attentive and extremely polite. So the English problem became minor and we were patient enough to repeat our sentences few times until they understood.In short, I really like this hotel and will definitely go back!
