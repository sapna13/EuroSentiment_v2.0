{"text":"Poor service, but a good hotel Just came back from a three nigh stay at Arts. The room are excellent and I love the bathrooms. My only complaint in the room was the tea and coffee making service. There were no prices listed on the minibar list and I thought that it was complimentary (and I was not the only one to think this) - it's not! So be careful as they will charge you and it is not that great and not worth the charge.The pool area is amazing and they have new furniture for the summer. A great spot to hang on, but lots of 'suits' walking around and lots of messing about with moving pool furniture around. The hotel is now managed by Ritz Carlton and I think the big boys in suits spend far to much time strutting around and getting in the way of the staff. The result - poor service levels as the team seems more worried about pleasing the managers and this means they spend less time on looking after those of us that pay.Lunch by the pool was awful. My starter and main arrived at the same time. My guest did not get her starter and then it arrived with her main! They only had one bottle of olive oil and balsalmic so they kept moving it from table to table - very poor for a five star hotel.Even in the restaurant the service was slow - 30 minutes for a starter.The spa is great. It was wonderful views and is worth a visit, BUT too many female staff keep coming in to the male area and this is very off putting for most male guests.Front Desk staff are very nice, but when I asked to leave my bags to have them put in the car (which, by the way, I ordered the Merc to collect me from the airport and take me back, so I was certainly spending the money!), they said I had to take it downstairs myself to the Bell team. I thought this was five star Ritz Carlton - I guess it is going down the four star route.I would return, but they need to improve their service for the prices they hope to command and if they want to have the Ritz Carlton service. Overall I am disappointed as there is nothing like Arts in Barcelona and they could do so much better.
