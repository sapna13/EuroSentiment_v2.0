{"text":"Great hotel! We stayed in Florence prior to Christmas and chose Hotel Savoy because we heard the concierge services were excellent - which they were! Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a corner room because we had requested for a room with a balcony facing the piazza and a shower in the bathroom. Prior to arrival, we used the concierge to book our restaurants and museum tickets. This was done quickly and efficiently - response by email within a day! The hotel was great, clean and the decor is very stylish - 7 out of 10. The location is good too, round the corner from the Duomo and within walking distance of Tournabuoni etc. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends travelling to Florence. We had breakfast in the hotel most days (note: the pastry shop opposite sells delicious cakes and pastries, it is always packed with locals), whilst not exactly value for money, it was pretty well above average and the service there is excellent. However we had dinner at the restaurant one night - despite being in the Luxe guide, it is definitely not worth it, not as good as the other restaurants you can try in Florence. Overall it was a great trip. BUT I do have to say one thing. The bedlinen and towels are in DESPERATE need of a change- rough and greyish, this is surprising for a high-end hotel.... The staff at Savoy are wonderful - they gave us a bottle of olive oil as a parting present upon check out.
