{"text":"Inexpensive, quiet, perfect If you don't need or want the expense of fancy lobbies, huge chandeliers, etc., then this is perfect. I stayed there with my four kids (ages 10 - 17) for a week. It's a small hotel; the lobby is about the size of a bedroom and the dining room is even smaller. But it's right around the corner from the terrific Musee Rodin (sculptor of The Thinker, The Kiss, etc.), and within walking distance of Les Invalides, the Eiffel Tower, and the Rue Cler. My kids and I also walked from the hotel to places like St. Germain des Pres, St Michel (Notre Dame area), Place de la Concorde, Champs-Elysees...pretty much all the main tourist attractions are within a half-hour of walking, which is not much by Parisian standards.Comfort-wise the main things are that it has good air-conditioning in the bedrooms, the bathrooms are clean and updated and have great smooth Corian sinks (I wanted to take one home!). Like most European hotel rooms, the ones at the Hotel de Varenne are small by American standards, but the 5 of us were perfectly comfortable in two rooms. The staff is helpful and pleasant. A woman named Beatrix was particularly nice to me and my kids and gave us suggestions on where to go. The morning breakfast is included in the room rate and is the typical delicious hotel continental breakfast fare. I got very used to hot chocolate and croissants being served to me on pretty yellow and blue-flowered china.I would definitely recommend this place.
