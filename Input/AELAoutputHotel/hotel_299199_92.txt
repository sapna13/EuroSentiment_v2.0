{"text":"Good but could be better My wife  I have just returned from a 5 week vacation including the last 3 days in Singapore. We made our reservation on the Hotel web site and paid around $S330 per night including taxes etc.The hotel is well located and is convenient to the Bugis MRT (underground access) and the grocery store below. All staff are very friendly and helpful but there are a couple of things that for a modern '5' Star hotel should be better. We were located in the older section on the lower floors. Room size was good, as was the bathroom but things are getting 'tired' and need some freshening up.Breakfast is the usual 'buffet' but it really was no better than a '3' Star hotel in terms of variety, imagination or 'something special'.Had to use the business centre briefly for internet access and was surprised to learn this is available at a cost (small but my experience is that this is usually free). Walking through the lobby indicated that porterage was often stretched .......... our experience particularly on checkout and later when returning to collect our luggage to go to the airport. A similar experience was found when we were seeking some pretty basic tourist information from the Concierge.One evening around 8:30pm we waited in the hotel taxi queue for about 45mins. Locals around us (and behind us in the queue) began making telephone bookings and were then leaving well before us. The porters did little to explain options or arrange an improved service .......... there are over 22,000 taxis in Singapore.For similar monies (slightly higher or lower) I suspect there may be some better options right now in Singapore ","annotations":[]}
