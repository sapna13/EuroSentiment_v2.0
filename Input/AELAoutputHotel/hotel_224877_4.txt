{"text":"Disappointing I recently stayed 4 nights at the Mandarin Oriental in Miami and to be honest I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ glad it was only 4 nights. True the hotel is a spectacular building in a fabulous location however the moment you enter you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ help but feel that something is missing. The entrance lobby is has floor to ceiling glazing which offers fantastic views across the bay but little else. The large open space doubles as the hotel bar which lacks any kind of atmosphere, that been said, the rooms are large and very comfortable with fantastic bathrooms and great views from the balcony. The pool area is small and the pool (almost an infinity pool) is not heated and is consequently pretty cold. Incidentally the comments from other tripadvisor reports is unfortunately inaccurate, the service around the pool area is not just poor its pretty much non-existent. On all but one occasion I had to make up my own sun lounger and get my own drinks from the bar, my only comfort was the fact that this was the case for most pool users, unless they happened to look like a movie star or a model.With the exception of a couple of the valet parking guys I would best describe the Mandarin√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ staff as being aloof and unhelpful. There are on two restaurants plus pool caf√ã√\u2022√ñ at the Mandarin which given the fact that it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ located on an island and a good walk 10 min walk from alternatives, means that choice is strictly limited. Despite this fact the food is very good, expensive but very good. I would strongly advise making a reservation at the Azul restaurant as this does get very busy especially over the weekend. A great alternative to the hotel restaurants is the Island Market Place, a small super market \/ deli that serve good coffee and hot food as well as some fantastic sandwiches. The Island market place is a short walk form the hotel towards the centre of Brickell Key √à√\u2020\u2022?I would urge you to try it.On a number of occasions I found myself being disappointed by the Mandarin. These disappointments largely relating to the fact that I felt I was being exploited. For example;√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Ø√∂here are no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms or complimentary drinks in the lobby which means if you fancy a drink you have to pay $7 for a coffee from the restaurant.√à√\u2020\u2022?Distilled water was placed in the rooms however if you wanted spring water it was in the mini bar and was chargeable √à√\u2020\u2022?penny pinching!√à√\u2020\u2022?Internet access was charged at $15 a day.I would expect the above to be complimentary in any half-descent hotel, but for some reason the Mandarin considers itself to be far too superior to offer these amenities to its guests. The Mandarin Oriental Miami could be a fantastic hotel it has a great location and has good rooms however the attitude of the hotel staff really lets this place down. If I go back to Miami I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be staying elsewhere.
