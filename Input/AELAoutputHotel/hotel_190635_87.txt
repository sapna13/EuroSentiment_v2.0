{"text":"AMAZING Spent 5 nights on our 22nd wedding anniversary in September 2006.Booked through AMEX an Executive Suite with club lounge access as under their programme you may get a room upgrade on arrival. Sure enough as the hotel knew it was our anniversary we were upgraded to the Japanese Suite on the 30th floor. This suite is fantastic, it is the complete length of the hotel with views over the sea, 1760sq feet. It has Japanese-inspired contemporary design, Spacious lounge area with built-in bar, Dining room with adjacent kitchen, Large marble bathroom, King-size bedroom located on the corner with views overlooking the Mediterranean with floor to ceiling windows. Bang  Olufsen TV's and stereo.My wife and I were 'blown away'. The staff were the best I have ever seen and the few assigned to the Club lounge always remembered your name. The Club lounge situated on the 33rd floor was fantastic with their many 'food presentations' per day and unlimited drinks. The early evening chocolate dipped strawberries went down very well with the wine!!The pool area was very good with excellent attentive staff placing your towels out for you and ice cold (free) bottled water. Several times the pool bar staff brought around free cocktails to try - a nice touch. We did have lunch at the poolside on one occasion which was very good.We only ate once in the restaurant, (as the food in the club lounge was adequate for our needs....and included!!) the quality and service was excellent.There is plenty of night life opposite the hotel with plenty of bars and restaurants. The Hard Rock Cafe is a must and much cheaper than London's!We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and if you can manage the extra cost of a club room you will not be disappointed with the food  drink on offer.Have a great time ","annotations":[{"endOffset":121,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":117},{"endOffset":121,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":117},{"endOffset":805,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":801},{"endOffset":805,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":801},{"endOffset":850,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":846},{"endOffset":850,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":846},{"endOffset":993,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":984},{"endOffset":1253,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1249},{"endOffset":1391,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1387},{"endOffset":1391,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1387},{"endOffset":1391,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1387},{"endOffset":1582,"mention":"Rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rock_candy"],"startOffset":1578}]}
