{"text":"Top Shelf This hotel's accomodations and ameniteis were awesome, as was the service, scenery and most of the food. The staff had it all working. Customer service at its best. Played both courses, all good. Friends ate at the steakhouse on property and said it ws excellent. Also ate at the Italian restaurant on property and it was OK and expensive. Breakfast buffett is expansive and expensive. Be prepared to have money fly out of your wallet for everything, but this is a high end, luxary resort in the desert and that is to be expected. The resort is big, 400 plus rooms so know that before you go. Also, it is located way out in n\/e Phoenix on the border of north Scottsdale. Everything in this area is spread out. If you don't have a rental car, be prepared for a car service or taxi ride to Old Town Scottsdale costing between 50 and 60 dollars one way, plus tip. There are great bars and restaurants between the resort and downtown Scottsdale. Both Devil's Martini Bars were great. Dos Gringos was casual and fun and for a high end steakhouse (really high end), but absolutely fabulous for the food, decor and bar and people scene, try Drinkwater's City Hall Steakhouse in Old Town. From there you can walk to just about all the other bars and nighclubs. It was all good. Personally, I would have liked my resort to be about half the size of this one and half the distance to Old Town Scottsdale, but I was part of a golf group and it was not my call. But this place is all good, with great service. Definately 5 stars. ","annotations":[]}
