{"text":"A fading resort past its prime I have read the recent reviews from disappointed guests, but most of them focus on situations that were particular to their staty (e.g. the front desk messed up with their reservation, etc.)My disappointment is more about the actual hotel itself. I was expecting a beautiful, world class resort, but this was a shabby property that at one time may have been nice, but now is just worn out and tired. Everywhere I looked were signs of delayed maintenance. The overall look of the hotel is of an institutional compound with cement grey walls. There was nothing beautiful about it. The carpets were dirty, the landscaping in poor condition, the swimming pools were murky and cloudy, the pool side furniture faded, worn out, rusting.It was sad walking through the grounds and seeing areas where children are supposed to play ping pong, or on playgrounds, but there was overflowing garbage cans right there ruining any nice effect. At the spa, the showers had mildew growing in them, the towels were worn out and faded, and it had an overall cheap quality about it...not luxurious in the least.Parking is very poorly designed. There is only one self-parking lot at one end of the huge complex, and to get to my room I had to drag my luggage through back alley ways full of garbage and junk. The main restaurant is closed for renovations, so I ate at the casual cafe, where cocktails were $12. What a joke! All the food in this place is double or triple what it should be. I would expect this in some opulent, beautiful resort, but not this place.It was a HUGE disappointment. I would not recommend this place, especially for a special, romantic getaway. You will be VERY disappointed.
