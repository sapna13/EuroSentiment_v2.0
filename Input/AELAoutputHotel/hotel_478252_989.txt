{"text":"Great experience with a few minor complaints Overall, my wife and I were very happy with our stay at this hotel. The pluses definitely outweigh the minuses and here they are:What I liked:- the service in this hotel is 5 star in restaurants and buffet- the beach is amazing, white sand, clear water, pleasant breeze- plenty of beatiful AND topless women on the premises- huge, clean suite with good AC- resort was spotless, cleaned all the time- good selection of food in restaurants and buffet- French and Seafood restaurants get an A- for taste and presentation - large pools with convenient access What I disliked: ( I tried to fill in more details for the minuses )- 50% of the shows are boring- nightlife and dancing at Pueblo Principe and Disco start EXTREMELY late, at 11:45PM. If you don't like the only show running from 9:45PM - 11PM you are stuck since there is no other nightlife activities at this time. This is especially sad, since half of the hotel seemed like a young crowd ready to party, instead of being stuck watching the pathetic shows...- all drinks after 11PM, including the Publo Principe and Disco drinks are apperently not included, and the Hotel does NOT warn you about it. I saw a bunch of unpleasantly surprised individuals confronted with bills during the nightlife outings, so beware!- huge size of the resort, it took me 15 minutes to get to the gym!- the meat in the buffet was consistently unchewable. The only good meat I enjoyed was the lamb during the Dominican night. Japanese restaurant gets an A for presentation and a C for taste and variety.
