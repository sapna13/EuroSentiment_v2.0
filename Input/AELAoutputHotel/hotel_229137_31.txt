{"text":"Suited Us To a T! After researching countless hotels on the internet, my wife and I finally chose The Toren for our first-ever visit to Amsterdam. We hoped it would live up to everything we had learned about it online. It did, and more. The Toren and our Amsterdam trip as a whole exceeded the high expectations with which we had arrived. Location, charm, cleanliness, friendliness, uniqueness, hospitality, elegance, comfort √à√\u2020\u2022?The Toren has it all! And to top it off, it's sexy! (Hey, I'm sixty-one, so I'll take whatever help I can get!) We booked a Hot Deal room, knowing full well that we wouldn't be able to cancel should we have to do so. Well, wouldn't you know it? The day we were set to take the train from Paris to Amsterdam, one of those infamous French strikes struck! We had to stay yet another day in Paris. (Yah, like that's a problem?) I emailed The Toren to update them and to say we would arrive on the 21st instead of the 20th. Wendy Vissar said our room remained booked, but if they could resell it, we'd get the refund. We couldn't ask for better than that. As it turned out, Wendy was able to give us that refund and, true to form, did so graciously. So we need to add honesty to that string of honorific nouns provided above. (Recollecting Wendy, let me add beauty, too. If my wife comments on this, I'll swear I'm referring to The Toren's beauty only.) My wife and I will stay at The Toren again if we can. We do not hesitate to recommend it to folks we know. You should do your own research, though. The Toren suited us to a T. I hope you find what suits you, too.
