{"text":"Love\/Hate  The Bali Hyatt is one of our favourite relaxation holiday destinations in the region. Although there are many newer and better appointed places in Bali, the Sanur Hyatt oozes a kind of charm and relaxed atmosphere that's hard to find elsewhere. The hotel itself is not up today's standards, even if it was award winning in its day, but what it lacks in space, modern amenities, chrome and marble it more than makes up for in design character, privacy and peace by being surrounded by an outstanding mature tropical garden and a private beach. The staff are very friendly and will do almost anything for you (small tips go a very long way here). The Regency Club offers good value and is well worth the small price premium. The real downside is the age of the hotel: in truth the place needs renovating with some rooms now being damp (our room had a separate dehumidifier which more than took care of the problem - I'd strongly recommend you are supplied with one of these if you stay). The food is good with Pizza Ria serving surprisingly accomplished Italian food by the beach.I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you are travelling for business, want nightlife or high degrees of luxury but I believe you will enjoy this hotel if you are seeking a relaxing, quiet and peaceful break and\/or are over gleaming edifices and infinity pools. The overall experience is like staying in a small Balinese village with air-con, a gym and room service. It's so relaxing.
