{"text":"Great Location, Great Comfort My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights so he could attend the dental convention at the Moscone Center. This hotel was perfectly located for him to walk to the convention, and for me to walk to public transportation in order to visit all the touristy sights of San Francisco. We loved being in the center of town, and I loved being walking distance to the Tram buses that went to the wharves (including the Ferry Building and Pier 39) and, of course, the Cable Cars. Buy yourself a 3 day pass for the MUNI bus\/tram\/cable car system while you are there for $18. Now for the hotel itself: the staff was extremely kind and helpful. We had breakfast every morning at the hotel restaurant. They are very efficient, and very willing to go out of their way to get you what you want (we shared a breakfast 2 mornings as the portions are generous). The front desk staff greeted me every time I walked back in the door from my touring around. Even the maid stopped to thank me for leaving her a tip. The room itself was large for San Francisco, with 2 queen beds, a couch, desk, etc. Very clean. Bed was extremely comfortable, which for me means, not as hard as a rock. Wanted a view room, but they were packed. Never heard a sound from the rooms on either side of us. Free internet (cable is in a plastic bag hanging in the closet). Overall an excellent experience in San Francisco. If you are planning a visit, go in October. We've been there twice at that time of year and the weather is excellent. Sunny and 70 most of the time we were there. Have fun!
