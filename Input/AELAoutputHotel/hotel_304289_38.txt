{"text":"Executive floor well worth it A home away from home. I spent two weeks here whilst on business and stayed on the newly renovated executive floors.Marvellous. From the breakfast in the morning to the exec club lounge in the evening - a beautiful way to end a hard day. Staff remember your name - not just the Exec staff but also the doormen and concierge. It's nice to come out of a taxi to hear :did you have a good day in the office?. First time I wondered whether they were addressing me.So I've waxed lyrical about the exec floor and the comforts an aged businessman appreciates. Anything else?Positives - the brilliant Japanese bath house down by the gym; the nothing is too much attitude from the staff (even looking after a valuable painting for me when I was called off to Singapore); the quality of the dining and the service.Negatives - if you are in an older room it can be a bit seventies; Shinjuku is an ok location but nothing great (business on one side where the hotel is; sordid on the other) - but for the real Tokyo try the Grand Hyatt in Roppongi Hills; or the Cerrullean Towers in Shibuya. And as much as I like the Hilton, if you want to stay in Shinjuku, just check that the Park Hyatt isn't available first - it, and it's New York Bar and Grill are truely stunning.Don't get me wrong though - it's a great place to stay ","annotations":[{"endOffset":208,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":204}]}
