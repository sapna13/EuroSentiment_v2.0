{"text":"Beautiful resort but 3 out of 6 ended up sick I have used Trip Advisor many times when researching a holiday and decided to post a review of my most recent trip to Punta Cana so that hopefully others can learn from my experience.I travelled with 5 other people, ages 28-62. We stayed in the Golden Club section of the Gran Bahia Principe from January 4th-11th. The resort is huge as mentioned in other reviews but the carts made it very easy to get around. The golden club was great as it was closer to the beach however our room faced the construction that is being done on the Bavaro side. The rooms themselves are beautiful. Huge soaker tub, king size bed, nice sitting area. Only complaint was slamming doors from neighbouring guests. The waves at the beach were awesome! We got boogie boards (with a $20 US deposit) and played in them almost every day. We did notice that a lot of the meat in the buffets is not cooked enough. Beware!!! One person in our group got very sick the second day from eating an undercooked hamburger at the snack bar. Even chicken doesn't seem to be totally cooked. By the fourth day of our trip another person got sick with very bad stomach cramps and by the fifth day yet another in our group was sick with very bad stomach cramps. Not sure what caused this, hard to pinpoint when eating at buffets.Nightly shows aren't really worth watching but we already knew that from past reviews.All in all it was a wonderful holiday but be careful what you eat!
