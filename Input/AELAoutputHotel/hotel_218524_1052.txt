{"text":"Love Excellence! This was our 2nd time at this resort and because of the change in ownership I was a little bit worried but the resort is BETTER than EVER! It is the best kept secret in the Caribbean! Excellent rooms, food, drinks and entertainment! The resort is beautiful and the staff is wonderful, so warm and friendly, they really make you feel pampered. Having been there the year before many of the staff remembered us and were really happy to see us! We spent most of the 1st day getting hugs from all our favorite staff members (love them all); it was great! This year our closest friends went with us and they both said it was the best vacation they had ever been on! The food was so good that we all gained weight but, it was worth it! And our friends were amazed that so many of the staff seemed like old friends; it felt like a really wonderful family reunion! We had a cruise booked for this November that we were really looking forward to, Eastern Caribbean on our favorite cruise line (went on 4 last year). When we got back from Excellence, we checked it out for November, and cancelled our cruise and booked Excellence for that week instead! After we booked the Nov. trip, our friends were so jealous that they booked it too! Really an EXCELLENT experience! Excellence Punta Cana really lives up to their name! We can't wait to go back and will have a difficult time ever going anywhere else!! We will have to go back at least twice a year from now on! ","annotations":[]}
