{"text":"Best Bed EVER! We stayed at the Duquesne for 5 nights to start off our European honeymoon. The staff were very courteous at the front desk and showed us to the room. Everything in the hotel is small. The lobby is small, the elevator is tiny and the hallways are tight but that's Paris for you. The Room: The room was TINY!!! It was room 10 and it was basically a bed with about 6 inches on either side. The bathroom was tiny as well as only one person could stand at it at a time. There was no real storage in the hotel room either but that being said, it was the most comfortable bed ever and we slept well into the first morning there. The next day we requested an upgrade and were immediately shown a deluxe room that was still small by North American standards but was much more appropriate. The Staff: For the most part we were very pleased with them. They all spoke good english and were able to help us with any problem. They were having a computer problem while we were there so our upgrade took some time but as we ended up with what we wanted, we arent' going to complain.The Location: Great location, close to metro and the Eiffel tower. No complaints there.Food: The breakfast there is not included and at 11 euros, I would suggest grabbing a croissant or baguette at the patisserie on up the road. The thai place next door is indeed really good.All in all, while it was not the nicest hotel we stayed in on our honeymoon, it was a very comfortable stay and we would recommend it, although only the upgraded room. We also stayed at the Plaza Tour Eiffel which has a higher trip advisor rating and I would stay in the Duquesne over it.
