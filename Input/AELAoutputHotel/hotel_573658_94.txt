{"text":"Good hotel and location We spent 3 nights here in late June. It is a really nice hotel in a very good location. The staff were really friendly and helpful. They arranged a ride in a 50s Cadillac to Union Station for us on departure, completely free. On arriving, we were given a room in the lower part of the building which only had a view of a brick wall but reception were very helpful in switching us to a room on the 34th floor which had excellent views over to Toronto Island. We had to pay a small supplement but it was well worth it. The room was clean and spacious with all the amenities you would want for a short stay. There is a small fitness centre on the roof level of the older part of the building with saunas and a jacuzzi. You can actually go out onto the roof and get some nice photos too. Breakfast at the hotel is a reasonable buffet and proved to be good value and tasty. The serving staff were extremely friendly. Most of the main attractions (CN Tower, Harbourfront and Eaton Centre etc) are within easy walking distance but the Metro system is outside the front door and access to the Path is within the hotel. The building has a history of it's own and it is worth reading about it. Overall, a very enjoyable stay but, if you want a view, make sure you ask for a room that has one as this is quite a busy hotel and an upgrade may not always be available ","annotations":[{"endOffset":80,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":76},{"endOffset":795,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":791},{"endOffset":795,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":791}]}
