{"text":"Delightful Stay at the Country Inn and Suites! The reviews were correct -- the Country Inn and Suites in New Orleans is a delightful gem; a great room in a lovely little hotel that is priced reasonably and located well.We spent three nights in February at this hotel for a combination business\/pleasure trip, just before our four-night stay at the Royal Sonesta in the French Quarter.Although this hotel is not luxurious, it is comfortable and interesting. I loved the architecture--the exposed beams and atrium--and even found the small courtyard and (very) small pool charming. (Hey, my kids enjoyed the pool and that is good enough for me!)The front desk staff was friendly and helpful, and we had no trouble using valet parking for our rental car. As for the location, well, don't be fooled that this place is actually *in* the French Quarter, because it is not. It is technically in the CBD (Central Business District). However, it is conveniently located *near* the Quarter. I lived in New Orleans for 10 years, and I knew just where this hotel was located. It was a great location for us--walking distance to the Convention Center and Children's Museum, as well as the Aquarium.The breakfast was fine for what it was. My kids are always happy to get a warm waffle and I'm happy if I can get them a piece of fruit. We liked our room, the Internet worked, and we were comfortable. And of course, the price was right, which always make the stay more enjoyable! : )I will stay here again ... absolutely!
