{"text":"Love it! Love it! Love it! A very belated review I'm afraid but my husband and I were on our honeymoon. We stayed in a Club room which was just gorgeous with a small kitchenette (with mini bar), lovely bathroom, massive bed and plasma tv and a separate living room with plasma tv. The views over Hong Kong were stunning. Our room was clean, tidy, very comfortable at all times. Being in a Club room meant we had access to the Club lounge where you take your breakfast, can sit and relax (free massage chairs with a huge tropical fish tank you can stare at while you're being massaged!!) and use of the internet is free of charge. Every day, there are special 'hours' in the Club lounge where you can have afternoon tea and snacks and cocktails (made to order) and canapes in the evening and it's all completely free so you can eat and drink to your heart's content. It's all delicious!Our breakfast was absolutely fantastic with a stunning view over Hong Kong as you ate. The staff in the Club area are just gorgeous. So friendly and efficient and nothing is too much trouble for them. Everyone has a smile for you. Downstairs, you have full access to the spa and gym. In the separate changing rooms are small steam rooms and jacuzzi's as well as showers - this area is luxurious, clean and tidy. There is also a beauty salon where I had some treatments done. THe staff are wonderful, friendly, efficient and you can't help leaving with a smile from the experience of it all.For dinner, there are several restaurants to choose from as well as bars. All were always busy and lively. Adjoining the Hotel is the Shopping Mall!! it's wonderful and plentiful and right on your doorstep!This Hotel is fantastic and we've made it a point to stay in more Langham Hotels now. Enjoy!
