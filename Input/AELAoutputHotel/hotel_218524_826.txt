{"text":"Best Place on Earth We stayed at the Excellence for 10 days for our honeymoon. It was amazing. The ride in from the airport was actually a lot of fun and very informative. I did not find it overly bumpy or otherwise not good. Plus, you get to see a great deal of the country. We took a bus that dropped others off at their hotel. Our tour guide was great.The hotel could not be any more beautiful then it is. We arrived one day early due to a cancelled flight. We had booked the honeymoon suite with excellence club but had to stay in a standard room our first night as we had to book it last minute. The next morning my husband went to the Excellence Club to find out when we could check into our suite. That is our first encounter with Roberto who is amazing! He was so upset that we were not booked into our honeymoon suite upon arrival that he upgraded us to the Imperial Suite! WOW! It was gorgeous! Every staff member goes out of their way to make your stay fabulous.We had no problem with room service. In fact, we ordered it every night, got exactly what we ordered and within an hour (at the longest. Usually took about a half hour)I would reccomend the Excellence Club. It is worth the money to have the private assistance of their people. You are treated as #1 and they always promptly attended to anything you requested (my husband requested a birthday cake be sent to our room, they put candles in the room at night...just beautiful little details)We also LOVED our porter CARLOS. You should all ask for him when you get down there and tell him that Big Poppy sent you. We had such a great time with him and he can truly make sure you get everything you need.The food at all the restaurants was fabulous - the pool was so clean and beautiful. We also hired a photographer for the private photo shoot. I would reccomend every spend the extra money to do this. She took the best pictures of us we have ever seen.You would be foolish not to go this resort. We also had a great excursion on the ATV trip - we used the vendor at the end of the beach not one of the ones inside the hotel. It was a blast!Hello to Ish and Nora from Houston and Mark and Mikey from New York!!!! Please email with any questions you have - We will be going back as soon as we can!
