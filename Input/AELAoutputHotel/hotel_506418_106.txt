{"text":"Perfect! Stayed at the Vitale with my husband for 5 nights over the New Year period and loved it! This was my first visit to the city and I found the location of the hotel to be perfect. It's on the Embarcadero opposite the Ferry Building, which has some great restaurants and a Farmers' Market at the weekend. We had a lovely view of the Bay Bridge from our room.For some people the location may be a little quiet as it's not as bustling as the Union Square area etc - transport is easy though. Streetcars and also the Trolley stop right by the hotel.We didn't eat at the hotel (we bought breakfast in the Ferry Building) but did use the bar several times. It's quite lively in the early evening and cocktails are fab!! The staff were all very friendly and helpful as was the concierge. We had a problem with the bathtub and that was fixed promptly. On New Year's Eve a bottle of champagne was put in everyone's room (a nice touch!!). It was also my birthday and there was a cake waiting in the room on arrival! The room we were allocated was fairly small (though this wasn't a problem for us) but the bathroom was large. Tastefully decorated and very clean. Liked the turndown service with the CDs playing when you return to room. All in all, it was a perfect stay and I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone who likes the minimalist style but with professional service. Loved San Francisco too and would recommend the nearby Slanted Door restaurant as well as Asia de Cuba at the Clift hotel.
