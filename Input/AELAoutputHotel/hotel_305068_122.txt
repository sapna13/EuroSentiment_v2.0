{"text":"Glitzy, sleek, lukewarm Stayed here for 2 days Thanksgiving weekend, harbor view room. Really beautifully decorated room, stunning view. Service was professional throughout, but not as warm as Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong or Metropark Causeway Bay Hong Kong. The hotel is very glitzy, glam, with star chef having opened restaurants there or about to...but there's nothing incredible about the hotel besides the lounge (the view! the view!) in the lobby, or the views of the harbor. It's very posh but left me cold. The Lowest Internet Rate Guarantee is misleadingly named; one can find lower rates on the internet, through Web site travel agents (not the instant confirmers like Expedia, etc.). This hotel seems much more geared to charging for everything possible than some local competitors (if you get a locker in the spa, you sign a really charming receipt that says you'll pay 400 HKD if robes and slipper aren't returned. I overheard a waiter in Harbourside restaurant tell a guest who asked for a napkin to carry a couple of small breakfast pastries to finish later that they'd have to charge extra for her carrying out more than one...TACKY!) A tourist class hotel has a business center that allows free Internet usage in bus. ctr.; IC charges $100 HKD for 30 minutes!The room size and decoration was amazing, however, and overall I had a positive experience. But you can get plenty of harbor view if you hang out in the lounge and don't pay the huge extra fees for harbor view; or, stay somewhere else and enjoy a drink in the lounge at night.
