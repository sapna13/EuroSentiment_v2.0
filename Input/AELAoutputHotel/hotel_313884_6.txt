{"text":"Beatiful resort...awful food! My boyfriend and I just returned from an 8-night stay at the Punta Cana Princess, and while we had a nice time, we won't be returning. We had read all of the reviews before going and were prepared for a lot of what we experienced, but not really for how much it would influence our vacation.A couple of really good points...The facility is beautiful; the grounds are immaculate, the room is spacious, and I slept like the dead while we were there. The place is so quiet and dark at night that you can't help but sleep well. A note...you want to be careful when you are getting up to use the restroom in the middle of the night. Get your bearings before you make your way there. It is so dark in the room (which I loved) that you can't see your hand in front of your face. I was a bit fearful of falling down the steps into the sunken living room. I might have brought a small flashlight with me had I know just how dark it was going to be. Also, the lights in the hallways of the building are shut down at night, so if you leave your room while it's still dark in the morning (like we did to get an early pickup for our only excursion to Sanoa Island), be careful! You will have a hard time making it out of the building without some assistance.The beach is gorgeous; the Punta Cana Princess has one of the nicest stretches of beach in the area. The water was a bit chilly, but definitely refreshing and easy to get used to. It is still the Atlantic Ocean, so you will get waves, hence, no snorkeling! The waves were actually pretty intense at times, but I was still able to go out pretty deep. The staff of the resort is very friendly; some speak English, many don't. Learning a little Spanish goes a long way at this resort. Just having a couple of phrases in my repetoire was very helpful and much appreciated. The animacion team was a bit annoying, especially when we were trying to nap on the beach beds. My boyfriend was happily napping one day and was interupted by the shrieks of the animacion team trying to get people to play soccer on the beach). The excursion that we took to Sanoa Island was amazing. This was well worth the extra $100\/person. The boat ride out was great, the time on the beach was great, even the bus ride was amazing.On to the bad stuff...the food. We had read that the food was not good. I had no idea. Like someone else who recently reviewed this place, when we got to the Punta Cana airport and saw Wendy's we stuffed ourselves and I almost cried with how good it was to taste something good. I found myself relying a lot on the pasta station at the buffet (which was mediocre) and I ate a lot of bread. The specialty restaurants were horrible. My boyfriend ordered filet mignon, and it was 90% fat. The loaded baked potato was a joke, and the wine is not good. We both got sick (not sure if was from food at Mare Nostrum or the fact that the bartenders wash out the blenders with water from the tap) on our vacation, and while it didn't ruin the vacation, it put a huge damper on it. We came back from vacation not really feeling de-stressed, because much of our vacation was spent being sick and\/or worrying about being sick. For this, and this alone, I would not return to this resort and would be hesitant to return to the DR at all.
