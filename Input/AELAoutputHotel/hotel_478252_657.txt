{"text":"Awesome Time! - I went to the Bahia Principe the week of May26-June2. We went in a group of 43 for my friends wedding. The bride arranged the package, and I found out later that we were in the Diamond Club. - We recieved excellent service and even did our entire check-in on the bus between the airport and the hotel (room keys, bracelets - everything). As soon as we got off the bus, trams took us to our rooms, and we were at the lobby bar within 15 minutes! - Our villa had an amazing housekeeper who we made sure to tip daily, and she kept our towels and mini fridge over stocked daily. The day of the wedding - we had balloons placed all around our rooms for decoration. As well as the daily flower\/towel art on our bed.- The grounds and villas are amazing. Lush trees and flowers everywhere. There was nothing lacking in our actual room either. Our bathrooms were big and spacious, large closets with plenty of hangers and there were no bugs. Also, small touches like umbrellas were a big help! We chose to not purchase the safe for $30 american...we used personal suitcase locks and had no issues whatsoever. - The food was pretty good for an all inclusive. We had French (very classy and enjoyable), Japanese (fun time, food was average) and the Steak House Grill was where the wedding reception was held (food was fantastic! steak, chicken, salad). The regular buffet was also great on most nights, and the pool side buffet was good for snacks between swims (great chicken, pizza, french fries and fruit).- Being in a large group of 43 - our group became the entertainment at the pool...we were constantly at the beach pool bar, where we had pretty good drinks, and they even tolerated our more rowdy days when we were funnelling beers on the pools edge. The disco was also pretty good for a resort, we had a great time with the bartenders there, and once they realised that we wanted more mainstream music, we had a great time.- the beach is absolutely stunning, never a need to reserve seats, and they keep it nice and clean. The water is more refreshing then the beach pool as well. - we didn't really use any activities on the resort - but our group did do an ATV adventure tour. Now our group booked through the resort for $40 each, however, I'm not 100% sure about the safety of some of these tours. when we arrived, they didn't have enough helmets so some of the guys went without. During the tour, the brides aunt and uncles ATV blew a tire and went out of control - rolling on top of them. Thankfully they had helmets and only had minor injuries, but they were quite shaken up. I would just be cautious if trying any tours off the resort - but all in all everyone had an awesome day visiting another beach and a cave to go swimming.- OVER ALL I would absolutely recommend the Bahia Principe. The staff is warm and welcoming, they tolerated and catered to our every need, the grounds were spectacular, and the food was better than expected.
