{"text":"Great Price\/Performance This was probably the sixth or seventh time my wife and I have stayed at this hotel in the last year and a half. so obviously we are quite comfortable here. However, this is the first time we have stayed since the completion of the recent renovation, and I can say that it really makes a difference. There are still some niggly issues with small details, but the overall experience is extremely positive. The pluses are as follows:1. The rooms are spacious - we have always stayed in corner rooms.2. The bathrooms are in general spacious, and the new arrangement is quite appealing.3. The new room furniture is far more contemporary than the old furniture - now there are flat screen TVs, and the everything is updated.4. The linens - both bath and bed - have been significantly upgraded and can hold their own with any top level hotel.5. We ate at the completely redone Japanese restaurant and had an excellent meal. The waiter knew the menu inside and out. His recommendations hit the spot. The best dishes were dirt cheap.6. This is probably the best hotel to stay in San Francisco, if you have a car and don't want to pay an arm and a leg for parking. We were able to self park within 100 feet of the room elevators at a cost of $15\/night. We were within a mile of downtown without any of the traffic. There was never a wait to get in or out of the lot or any problem of finding a parking space regardless of time of day. Having spent $51\/day at the Mark for parking in the past, this is an absolute bargain. Plus it's centrally located7. As usual, the staff was very friendly.So what are the negatives?1. The Kabuki is not the Four Seasons - the total luxury of a world class hotel is not here - but then neither are the room rates.2. One day our room was not made up until early evening. This was a minor pain, but it should not have happened.3. The rooms could have more lighting.4. The new furniture has less drawer space than the old. This only matters if you are traveling for an extended period of time, which we are frequently doing.All and all, the Kabuki offers a great price\/performance package, so the minor negatives are vastly outweighed by the overall positives cited above.
