{"text":"Enjoyed every minute I booked my trip at the Bahia Principe Aug 18th to the 25th.The resort is wonderful and very well kept. The staff are very friendly but at times we had communication issues as we do not speak spanish and some have trouble understanding english or french but then again, I'm on vacation and for me it's not an issue. I strongly suggest that if you book this resort that you pay the extra money for the Royal Golden treatment as it's a very large resort and most of the action during the day is at the beach and the beach pool. If you book Golden your room will be near this area although there is a shuttle every 3-5 minutes. The food in general was ok to good. We booked at the French, Fish, Italian, Steak and Japanesse. Trust me on this, I enjoy good food and good wine and your best choice is the french and italian resturant. The only one that really irritated me was the Steak resturant. We were 3, we all ordered the surf a turf and in all 3 cases the steak and the porc were burnt ! Not overcooked, but literally burnt ! We ate the shrimp, my wife and I managed to cut a piece of the steak and porc to at least taste it which confirmed that it tasted exactly as how it looked. My son never managed to cut a piece to taste it ! We simply got up and walked out and went to the buffet. We spoke with people who went the next day and they also did not enjoy it. Remember people, what happens one day does not mean that it's always like this. I read reviews from people that mentionned it was the best steak they ever had so obviousely something was different when they went. I just wanted to mention it but lets not generalize. As for the wine, white or red, if you took a couple of drinks before , yo man, no problem, but if you didn't well you can make your own opinion on it . We were lucky we got a room in building 20, the best in my opinion. We were next to the beach and the beach pool and we had 2 snack bars and the fish resturant in which we could have breakfast and lunch therefore we didn't have to go to the main buffet at the other end much. If you want a great vacation I strongly suggest this resort and I would go back tomorrow if I could. Have a nice vacation ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1674,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1669},{"endOffset":1674,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1669}]}
