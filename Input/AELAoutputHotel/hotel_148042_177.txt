{"text":"Great Hotel! The Ritz Carlton Hotel in beautiful Puerto Rico was beautiful, beautifully furnished in a nice sized room. I thought the bathroom was a little small. In my opinion there were not enough towel hooks to hang our swim suits to dry. But bathroom was nice. Hotel Staff - staff was accommodating. Concierge always gave nice recommendations on where to go visit in town and where to go and eat.Location-this hotel is literally on the beach. If you want something beach side then this is the place. You can hang out by their large pool and then walk a few steps to access the beach. It's easy to hang by the pool for a couple of hours and then walk to the beach for a while then go back to pool. My husband and I managed to do this for a couple of days. It does not get old. We were there for RR and thats what we got ! This hotel is not near Old San Juan. You can catch a cab to Old SJ for $20 each way. Hotel Food - the food was good but --be ready for the price. It is expensive. First we ate at an outdoor cafe\/bar. It's near the pool and beach. Our lunch consisted of 2 sodas, a chicken wrap and a hamburger with fries. This totaled about $40 not including tip. We had to remind ourselves this is the Ritz. It was good food though. We also tried room service. This was great. I ordered a pizza for myself (It is enough for 2 people) and it tasted great. Casino- This was always crowded. It had tons of games to play. cha-ching!Spa - We had to try this. My husband and I both had a swedish massage at the spa. This was great. We didn't know it at the time but you can request a couple's massage. Cost $150 PP + tip. Overall-We had a great time at the Ritz. It is pricey but you get what you pay for!!
