{"text":"Great service, nice hotel, mediocre food... My husband and I stayed at Excellence for five nights mid-November. We booked our trip at the very last minute so we weren't able to do a ton of research on the Dominican but the hotel receives high ratings thorughout the web. After the one hour ride from the airport we arrived at the hotel and were greeted by everyone we met. I have to say that the staff at the hotel were very nice and made every effort to learn our names and greet us by name each time they saw us. We opted to upgrade to the Excellence Club and we are still trying to decide if we think it was worth it or not. As part of the Excellence Club, you are ushered to the club's private lobby for check-in but, really, it almost just creates an unneccesary step in the check-in process and adds another person or two you feel like you should tip. The biggest benefits of the Excellence Club for us were the unlimited internet access, beach towels in the room (they were hard to get otherwise), and the beach bag in our room. We did eat breakfast each morning in the Excellence Club which was nice because it was a small buffet and you didn't have to deal with a crowd. The hotel itself was clean, the staff was very friendly, and nothing ever felt crowded. However, the food wasn't great. It wasn't bad - but it wasn't great. I'm not a big eater but I was prepared to indulge on my vacation and there just wasn't anything I was crazy about. The presentation of the food was nice but it was just bland. I think that is the best way to describe it. The pizzas that were delivered to the pool area were good but it was unpredictable because you never knew when they would arrive. We went on two excursions - swimming with the sting-rays\/sharks and the zip-line tour. We loved the zip-line excursion. The staff was great and our bus driver and tour guide were great. It was interesting to visit the sting-rays and swim with the sharks but the reef where we snorkeled was disappointing. The fish were very small and there wasn't much to see. The electricity went out in our room a handful of times, especially when I used the hairdryer. Also, our AC was terrible. They tried to repair it but it just never got cool. Our room was big, though, and clean. We always got housekeeping service twice a day and they refilled our mini-bar daily. In many of the reviews, people said they got sick. Our representative at the hotel (through AAA) warned us that many people think they get sick from the water or the food but they don't realize that having too many drinks with coconut in them will also do it. Coconut is a natural laxative so you need to limit your consumption. I would still pack the Immodium just to be sure. I couldn't decide if I wanted to give this hotel a 3\/5 or a 4\/5 but I decided to go up because of the friendly staff and the cleanliness of our room. I don't think I would go back because of the food but we had a nice time while we were there. We met a lot of great people at the swim up bar!
