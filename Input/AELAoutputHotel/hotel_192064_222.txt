{"text":"Chesterfield Mayfair recommended highly I choose the Chesterfield Mayfair from July 5 √à√\u2020\u2022?July 8 with family during 2.5 week vacation in Europe. The Chesterfield Mayfair is a fine hotel. Rooms are on the small side √à√\u2020\u2022?no surprise. The most important thing for my wife and 2 teenage girls however, is cleanliness and comfort and the C.M. scores high in both categories. We were given rooms across the hall from one another (as requested) and though there was no view it was, at least, very quiet. Besides, we did not choose the hotel for its view.An odd design flaw in the shower, however, is the partial glass enclosure. I would like to meet the designer who put this together; it simply doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ work well and it took careful planning and aim to keep from having large puddles on the floor because of this stupid enclosure! A minor inconvenience when considering the overall quality. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ forget, the English don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ place wash-cloths in their hotels. Pick up a pack at Wal Mart and simply use and discard as you travel. Our Paris hotel did not have these either. Yes in Switzerland.We found the hotel staff to be exceptional without reserve. We were treated like important guests from our arrival with our large bags to our early departure. Though not able to check in at noon as requested, we were able to do so at 1:00. We were always greeted with a smile wherever we saw a staff member. Excellent recommendations for travel about London and finding what we needed locally.There is an internet access point (computer) on the lower level and time can be rented. I took my laptop and my teenagers were able to keep up with friends by the in-room DSL access points (Around 15 GP per 20 hours.) Sullivan√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ market is no more than one block away with access to several small restaurants, pubs a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µost office store,√à√\u2020\u2022?and small pizza place. A few steps further is a Nero√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ coffee shop (like Starbucks) and a small market store where we purchased wine, water  breakfast food including fresh bread each day.We highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair and should we return to London, will likely stay there again.
