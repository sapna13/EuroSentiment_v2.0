{"text":"Chic Madrid Refuge De Las Letras is a cool and peaceful retreat from the mighty beat of the big city. This is exactly the place you want to go to rest and recover during your site-seeing days in Madrid. LOCATION: Easy walk to Puerta del Sol and the Gran Via metro station, except I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° take a cab from the airport (28 E) if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e carrying large bags due to the complicated maneuvers and many stairs. You are close enough to buy snacks and beverages at the Corte Ingles (or other neighborhood groceries) to enjoy in your room. ROOM: Spacious by European standards, quiet, clean, nice lay-out, attractive. We liked the washable duvet covers as they seemed more sanitary than the normal blanket or comforter. Nice extras in bathroom such as razors and toothbrushes. This hotel isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ trying to be cool, it just is cool. We paid 105 E for our two twin bed √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëouble comfort√à√\u2020\u2022?room by booking months ahead of time--a great value for such a nice place. ROOM SERVICE: Good food, fast, fair price, speaketh little English√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√™ur Spanish came in helpful here. Make sure you ask at check-in if you have breakfast included. We did, but didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know it. They probably thought it was funny that we ordered just one breakfast each morning to share, but it was actually enough for the two of us anyway. SERVICES: The Internet in our room was sketchy so we occasionally made use of one of the two free computers in the comfortable basement library; they worked well. BARS: The roof bar was lovely with wonderful views, but one evening we were met at the entrance by staff telling us it was closed for a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µrivate party.√à√\u2020\u2022?The next morning we saw rows of Penelope Cruz√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ new Mango clothing line coming down from the roof bar and wondered if she√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° been there? I couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get any staff to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√πess up. The regular bar on the main floor had a cold vibe with unfriendly staff, and some very strange Spanish tapas. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stick around.FRONT DESK: Professional, not-overly friendly, but efficient. SPA: We got a call that they were backed-up for our appointments and could we come a half hour late? Sure, we said. When we arrived, they told us to leave and wait in the library as they were running even further behind. Maybe there was a language barrier but it felt like we were being scolded and sent to the other room. Finally we got our massages√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√™ne of my strangest ever. My treatment room was like a sauna and I had to get a lot more naked than I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ accustomed. (Maybe it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ an American thing?) My daughter had her massage in a curtained area of the semi-public Jacuzzi area. Half-way through our massages our masseuses switched places--no explanation offered. My massage itself wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ that good, either. (My daughter liked hers fine.)OVERALL: A great value if you book ahead, lovely rooms, good food. Just avoid the spa and the bar and all will be well.
