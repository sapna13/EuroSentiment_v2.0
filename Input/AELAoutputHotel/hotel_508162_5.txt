{"text":"Drop 5 pounds in 7 days Without a doubt this is at best a 2 star Vacation destination. We booked through apple vacations. Some postive examples:1. The overall property and layout is nice, the pools, ocean, spa and resturants are easy to access.2. The weather is awesome, the beaches and waves are very nice.3. The rooms are adequate..4. The staff tries to appease you, and some are helpful.5. If you tip the cleaning lady, she will bring you unlimited bottled drinks for your room.The negative examples include1. Food: overall 4 out of 10. Since this is an important detail I will share our experience. 7 of us arrived healthy on Monday, by thursday, 3 were very ill with food poisoning, by Monday, 6 of 7 people were extremely ill with food poisoning. I was the only one of our group who pretty much escaped. I call it food poisoning because everyone suffered from explosive vomiting and diarrhea without any fever. Each person had this for about 48 hours, one person, got it a second time the night we arrived home. Yes not one person drank the water. Anyhow, I learned, do not eat anything green, do not eat the fruit, do not drink the soda from fountain machines, do not eat any cold food. I found the best thing to do was to eat fried food, ie go to the chinese, japanese, or french (best food, although 6 out of 10) resturant. The cafe, ocean and seaside resturants had food that was 2 out of 10. Get hot soup, sweat and sour pork, etc. Also go to the gift shop and get bottled soft drinks, and gatorade, pringles etc. Bottle bear is fine. Mixed drinks that are entirely bottled are fine. I dont know about the fruit on the side, I stopped having the fruit added after the 3rd day. When we arrived home we went to Wendy's. My 7 year old daughter got a kids meal, and after 3 days of drinking gatorade refused to eat. Suddenly and to the horror of the staff at Wendy's she started pathetically sobbing that she was too scared to eat, that she couldnt stand to vomit anymore. I had to explain to everyone that it was not Wendys but we had just arrived home from punta cana.2. Staff, we had some good staff and indifferent staff. The managment didnt seem to care that there was widespread illness. We talked to many guests who were ill. Only one man reported a fever. When we relayed this to the management, they said we were the only ones, except that 4 seperate people standing behind me in line said that they had all had similiar symptoms and illness. If this had been in the USA or a Cruise line it would have been on CNN.3. The rooms we booked were not available. We had 7 people, we booked, on room with 2 double beds, and one room with a king, and a sofa bed. We got 2 king size beds. After 4 hours on the phone with apple ( who tried to say we were the only ones ) we were moved to 2 new rooms with guess what, 2 king beds! We finally got them to agree to bring a couple of cots. In the end it didnt matter, the king size beds were rock hard, the cots were ok, and the sofa bed in one of the rooms was broken and we placed the mattress on the floor for a weekIn summary, this location is a metaphor for or pretends to be a resort. Its close, but the food is dangerous, and the staff is in denial. They are well trained to smile, appease you verbally and be happy. They are not capable of fixing much. They will give you all the food you can possible eat. If you are going already, take a jar of peanut butter, a box of crackers and gatorade. If you are considering going, try to find somewhere else. If you like to drink in excess or eat in excess and have an iron GI system you will probably be ok avoiding any cold foods.On the positive side, I lost 5 lbs without trying during the week and didnt get sick!
