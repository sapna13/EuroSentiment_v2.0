{"text":"Great Hotel for Family! We (wife and two kids) just got back from Japan (Tokyo) and we stayed at The Royal Park Hotel (RPH) for five nights. We were in Tokyo over the Thanksgiving week. The reviews from this site greatly influenced my decision in picking RPH and I am glad that I did. Every positive thing that was written about RPH is true and then some. After a 13 hour flight from the U.S., we arrived in Narita and took the Airport Limousine Bus from Narita to the T-CAT (Tokyo City Air Terminal). The Terminal is located adjacent to the Royal Park Hotel. I was pleasantlysurprised to see a dedicated phone for RPH as soon as we got out of the bus. Within 3-5 minutes of calling the hotel to inform then of ourarrival, a bell hop who speaks English arrived with a luggage cart to help us back to the hotel. I am starting to feel good about this hotel.We arrived at the hotel, which is connected to the T-CAT, and are promptly led to the executive lounge on the 16th floor to check in. Ah, yes, the executive floors. I took the advice of those that recommended the executive floors and, yes, the extra cost was more than worth it for my family. You can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ beat the convenience of a free buffet breakfast on the 20th floor and snacks and cocktails on the 16th floor executive lounge in the evening. With the price of food anddrinks in Tokyo, the difference in price is more than worth it. Add tothat the pampering and free access to the gym, pool, sauna, wireless internet in the executive lounge, etc√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>Our room was very nice and roomy even by American standards. It was very comfortable and we were able to adjust the thermostat. We had an executive twin suite with two twin beds and an extra bed. We had to pay an additional 5,000 yen ($47 approx) per night for the extra bed. The cost of the extra bed is worth it considering the alternative of having to pay for an additional room. My kids are still very young so it was comfortable for us. The room had a Dell computer with free highspeed internet service. I was also able access the internet with my laptop by connecting it to the Ethernet wire. The kids were able to access their internet games on the Dell computer while the wife and were able to surf the net on the laptop. The bathroom was nice and comfortable. I had mentally prepared myself for a very small bathroom based on some of the previous reviews, but it was okay as long as it was one person in there at a time. The Toto toilet is the bomb. The toilet seat is warm and it comes with a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºhower√à√\u2020\u2022?and bidet. Getting around town is easy from RPH. There is a train line under the hotel and access to the Tokyo rail system is only 5 minutes walk from the hotel. We were able to buy 2 day tourist rail passes at the front desk. The front desk staff is very nice and they were able to give us good directions and tips on using the Tokyo Metro Rail. This is the most economic way to explore Tokyo. The trains run on time and there is a train every 5 minutes or so. We were able to go to Tokyo Disney, Ginza, Roppongi, Ueno, and Akihabara. There are several convenience stores and Japanese restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. There is a McDonalds within 5 minutes walk of the hotel. Overall, this is a very nice hotel for the price. The location is convenient for getting around Tokyo. The staff was very pleasant and nice and most of them speak English. I am recommending this hotel veryhighly and will definitely be staying at the RPH next time I am in Tokyo.
