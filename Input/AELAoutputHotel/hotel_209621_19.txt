{"text":"Skip the Normandie and stay at the Caribe HIlton Stayed at the Normamdie for business with my colleague for a few days. When we arrived they informed us that they wouldn't give us two beds as we had requested initially because they couldn't ensure their availability until the guest arrives. After much discussion they finally gave us another room with two beds but we had to wait over three hours because they couldn't clean the room they had offered us because there was NO RUNNING WATER in the hotel. After graciously informing us that they added that there also wouldn't be running water the following day for several hours due to maintenance reasons. Although the suite was nice and spacious, the service was so poor and the staff so rude that we didn't want to spend much time there. The pool and beach at the Normandie are mediocre to say the least, compared to the Hilton next door. It was also surprising to see that the restaurant and lounge bar were absolutely deserted because we knew the hotel was full. Later we found out that everyone was actually at the Hilton having a fantastic time. We ended up using the facilities over there and had a fabulous time. Unlike the Normandie, they have friendly and helpful staff, an amazing private beach and gorgeous facilities.Really, save yourself the trouble and stay at the Hilton. My other colleagues ended up leaving to another hotel as well as they treated them even worse than us. ","annotations":[]}
