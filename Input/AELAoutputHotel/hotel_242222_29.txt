{"text":"Nothing great but tolerable Just got back from a 5 day stay at ESJ. The place is tolerable when no other options are available. Having stayed there 6 yrs ago I knew what to expect when walking into the lobby. Nothing fancy, just some seriously out dated decor. Unlike my first visit to this hotel (which turned out to be quite pleasent) this stay was barely tolerable. Upon entering our room my family and I were greated with a horriblely unpleasent smell. We tried to leave the same day we checked in but most hotels in the area gave us a hassel about reservations and such. When we mentioned the possibility of leaving the hotel they went ahead and charged us for the entire stay. Back to the description of the room...the carpet was littered with black stains and felt slightly damp. When I looked up at the ceiling I noticed many big black spots, what it was I don't think I really want to know. The furniture and decorations were just as outdated as the lobby. The beds were clean but felt as if I were sleeping on a big block of cement. The vanity area in the bathroom was nice and spacious and seperate from the shower and toilet (a nice feature when traveling with family). The balcony and view from the 14th floor were spectacular (about the only good feature of the room). Overall I would Seriously reconsider staying at this hotel. There are many other hotels in the Isla Verde area (if that is where you wish to stay) and even more thoughout San Juan. I do not think my family and I will stay here ever again.
