{"text":"Had a wonderful time We stayed for four nights at the end of July and absolutely loved the experience. We arrived about 11am but no problems checking in then. Fantastic view from our room on the 29th floor. We requested and got a non smoking room. touches I really liked - ice making machine on each floor, huge plasma tv with free dvd hire, free internet access from the business centre, friendly staff, great roof top pool - and his and hers showers, steam room and sauna. In fact, when we said we had a late night flight, they let us check out at 1pm but suggested using these facilities and the locker room. This meant we had a relaxing time by the pool, a great shower, changed into fresh clothes before going. Yes, the room wasn't gigantic - but the views from the window and the glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom made it seem more spacious. And there is a blind you can pull down for privacy! I loved where it was located. Great shopping mall for the food court and the more up market retaurants on the higher floors. We had many meals at both. Close to the MTR, and close to some great local markets. Warning - tonic water is very difficult to find. I found one place nearby only. And my husband wanted tomato juice, which on the suggestion of the staff we got in the shopping plaza with international food where the big ships come in. I would definitely stay here again.
