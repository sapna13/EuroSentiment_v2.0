{"text":"Disappointing experience We visited Barcelona for a long weekend and booked La Regina after a great deal of research on Tripadvisor. We were looking forward to a spacious, comfortable room and good service.On arriving at the hotel at 1pm on a Saturday we were impressed with the pleasant and quiet reception ( the surrounding area is extremely busy and in retrospect not the place for a relaxing break). However, we were greet by a middle aged male receptionist who was less then helpful or friendly. We were told we could could either have the 4th or 1st floor, on asking which room was nicer he simply shrugged. We took the 4th floor, however on opening the door of room 421 were greeted with a room the size of a matchbox with NO window and right next to the maids room. As this was Saturday and were paying 224 Euros for the night, this was unacceptable and I returned to reception to request the room on the 1st floor. The receptionist was not pleasant about this and grumbled in Spanish to his colleague and waived his hands in the air.The bell boy took us to room 107 and on the way confided that they always had problems with room 421. Room 107 was just as small but did have a window, as we had no choice we took it ( I must comment there was no cava or chocolates either) However, on arriving home late on Sunday night we were overwhelmed by the stench of sewage coming up through the drains in the bathroom. We informed reception who were already aware of the problem but had not tried to contact us. They then moved us to room 202 and we had to pack our things at midnight to switch rooms. Again 202 was a very small room.On the Sunday we had also asked the bell boy for a restaurent recommendation and were recommended Case De Tapes which was nearby, as far as we could tell there were no Spanish eating in this restaurent , only tourists. It was an unpleasant atmosphere, it was overpriced and the food was below average.The only pleasant memory I shall take of La Regina is that it has a lovely bar, it is very soothing after the business of Barcelona and the bar staff were excellent.
