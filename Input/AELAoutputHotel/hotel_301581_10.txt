{"text":"Like stepping back to a shabby 1980s Just checked into Fairmont, Singapore (used to be Raffles Plaza...I think!) and not impressed. Been to Singapore many, many times and this was first visit to this hotel.Booked corporate rate of SGD305 plus local taxes per night through company (preferred hotel) but not worth it. Check in was fine, efficient and friendly. Great location but really shabby decor and very, very dated.Shocked to see graffiti on one of the doors in the hall way on the way to the room. Not typical for Singapore.Room on 7th floor is large, corner room but looks like a scene from a 1980's Dynasty show, all I need is my shoulder pads to really fit in. Dated furniture, dirty marked walls, wall paper is that material like stuff....like wool stuck to wall paper. Lots of gold coloured metal lamps, dated and battered furniture. Air conditioning has no adjustable temperature setting that I can find, still quite hot and humid, not good in Singapore.No wifi and cable link costs SGD28 plus tax per 24 hours.......even though I just needed an hour for work e-mails. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ SGD28 for 24 hours minimum!Booked for 5 days but checking out tomorrow and moving to one of my regular hotels down the street for same price or less.If you get this room for SGD200ish, it's OK. If you are used to decent Singapore hotels, stick to Conrad, Pan Pacific or Mandarin Oriental. I could get the same rate or cheaper and they are more comfortable, modern and better maintained.This booking taught me to stick with my tried and tested favourites......and to check Trip Advisory before I book!Photos to follow!
