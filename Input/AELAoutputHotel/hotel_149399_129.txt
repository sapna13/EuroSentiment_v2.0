{"text":"Beautiful This trip was a graduation present for our daugher and a last trip before she went away to college as a family. I was concerned where I was taking my family and did some research before we left. I was put at ease when we arrived at the resort. It is very laid back. The people all say HOLA and smile! The hotel has beautiful landscaping and the rooms were nice. We only had one visitor on the first day and not to many bugs were out during the day. At night by the water you might bring some bug spray for mosquitos. There wasn't to many but when they found me I had a few bumps. The food was very good. The Dominican resturaunt is a must when you go to visit. Also make sure you tip everyone. You will be treated extra special. And they definitely deserve it. Befriend a bartender and a concierge and your trip will be the most relaxing and stress free. We loved ours!!!! Mateo and Guille R. ;-) The spa was very nice, we did massages and manicures\/pedicures. They are priced the same for the US. My husband said the golfing was nice. There was an extra charge not only for the cart but for the clubs as well. So if you like going to the driving range, they will give you 100 balls and a driver for $12. Always take cash. Don't bring credit cards to use, because they will charge an extra 16 to 20 percent to your purchases. The night shows were entertaining. Every night there is something different . They all started at 10pm and then immediately after, there is dancing. They involve the crowds and it was a blast. Over all, we had an excellent time and recommend it to family's and couples.
