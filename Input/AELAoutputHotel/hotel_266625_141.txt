{"text":"Great Vacation My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sirenis Cocotal from April 4 - 11. We managed to get a deal through Itravel2000.com for $759 per person plus taxes. HOTEL  FACILITY: The hotel rooms were average but clean and well air conditioned. We stayed in the M block. We were both happy that some of the tv channels were English. GROUNDS  BEACH: The grounds were very well maintained and lush. The beach was amazing. I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful spot of sand, sun and crystal blue water. Never had a problem getting loungers at the beach. Didn't spend much time at the pool but it was also very nice and clean.STAFF: I found the maids to be very friendly (especially after I gave them a gift of body lotions, soaps and other toiletries). All of the wait staff was attentive and friendly. FOOD: The one issue we had was with the food but to be honest I'm quite picky and won't eat eggs or milk in poorer countries. If you don't have that issue, I think you would have enjoyed the food much more. There was always plenty of fresh fruit. We tried the Steakhouse, Creperie and Mexican. The Steakhouse required reservations three days in advance, we went there twice and had the steak and the chicken. The chicken was fabulous and the steak was okay. The Mexican was very good and the Creperie was horrible. Probably just not my style. One night the buffet had roast beef and it was great, the gravy was also very good. I would suggest taking some snacks in your luggage as lunch is probably the worst meal of the day. I bought one bag of chips from the resort and it was $6.00 US. All in all this was a great vacation for the amount we paid - under $1000 per person including taxes from Vancouver, BC. I wouldn't have been so happy if we would have paid more but I don't think we could have had a better vacation for the price.
