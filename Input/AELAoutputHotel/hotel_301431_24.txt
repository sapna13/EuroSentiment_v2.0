{"text":"Very Good Second time we have stayed. Last time 2 years ago when we thought it very dated, this time for 3 nights over New Year in a Regency Club room. Value pretty good through a corporate rate. Furnishings are fresher and room (11th floor) of average size and smallish bathroom. Shower is in the bath and a bit of a danger for the not so nimble as no hand rail or non slip surface. Can breakfast in Club or Capers, we used both; plus free happy hour drinks 5-8, and a great plus of free pressing of clothes; as well as free access to internet. Staff service was exemplary at every level. Breakfast more than adequate in Capers (used only once) - Western, indian, Japanese, Chinese, although service chaotic and slow to refill a number of dishes but could have been a hang over of festivities. Breakfast in Club more leisurely and unrushed although selection more limited but offer of more variety re Japanese etc on a menu (no extra cost). We attended the New Year's Eve function in the bar - good music, tapas food and free bar for a reasonable S$95++. Location is a 10 minute walk to nearest MTR at Orchard Rd but a bus stop outside hotel and 1 minute from many other bus routes. Taxi prices recently increased but still very modest to get around town. Overall nice ambiance but still has a slightly dated feel but with great staff who genuinely make you feel welcome. Didn't try any other in-house restaurants. Pool (outside Capers) looked welcoming if rather small.
