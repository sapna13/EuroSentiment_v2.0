{"text":"Nice all-inclusive vacation It's amazing how different some of the reviews are and I was getting a bit nervous before we left that this would be a bad experience. Thank God it wasn't. We visited 8\/5\/08 to 8\/12\/08 and stayed in building 9 on the Tropicale side. We were steps from the pool and beach and a few more to the Torey buffet on the beach that serves breakfast and lunch. Very convenient area if you plan to spend your daytime at the pool and beach. We never had a problem getting lounge chairs at the pool or beach. I did not feel that we would have received any better service through Royal Service. The hotel is very nice and the grounds are beautiful and well-kept.After check-in, we were lucky enough to hook up with Manny (Emmanuel) who drives a golf cart around the property. We gave him a $5 tip and from that point on, he was our personal dinner concierge. We never made one dinner reservation ourself and he picked us up near our building every night to take us to our dinner location. We tipped him $2 each night and $10 at the end. It was well worth it. We never tipped the bartenders and did not experience any problems at any of the bars trying to get service or them expecting tips. We did tip the maid $2 a day and the one day I forgot I did notice a difference in the room (she did not restock the fridge, shampoo, etc.). The maid service was probably our least favorite. No washcloths drove me nuts!The beach was nice. The maintenance men rake up the seaweed each morning and dispose of it with a John Deere. Some do go topless and\/or thong bottoms (and trust me, some that did SHOULD NOT!).The food was good to very good depending on the restaurant. I think it's funny some of the reviews I've read about how horrible the food is. You are at an all-inclusive resort on an island. Just exactly how gourmet do you expect it to be? Our least favorite was probably the Dominican restaurant. There is some language barrier, many do not speak much English. You will find guests of all nationalities there and we found the French to be the rudest of them all. We did book one excursion on ATVs to Macao Beach area. I would not recommend it. While it is not strictly a hotel excursion as the excursion company Rancho works with other hotels, too, we felt it was unorganized and all they want you to do is keep buying things. We did not take money with us since we were going to be driving ATVs but apparently they wanted us to. They were selling bandanas for $4 to put over your face, there was jewelry and artwork that they expected you to look at while you were waiting to start, then they take pictures and video the entire ride and want you to buy them. There was a group of Puerto Ricans and they charged them $20 for a dvd. When it came our turn to order it, they told us it would cost $40. We were told by a nice Dominican woman back at the hotel that when they see Americans, they assume we are all rich and they will try to get as much money as they can from us. Needless to say, we said forget it. The island is beautiful and the weather was great for a tropical vacation. Would we go back? If we were ever to choose to repeat a vacation, yes, I can say we would go back to the Melia in Punta Cana. We liked it better than the Bahamas (we have been to all the Bahama islands and have no desire EVER to return again) BUT our favorite destination still is Bermuda. They have the nicest beach and ocean and you aren't followed around and asked to buy things or have braids put in your hair.
