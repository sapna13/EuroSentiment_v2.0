{"text":"An interesting hotel... I have mixed feelings about this hotel. After spending nearly an hour and a half trying to find it (the directions the hotel offers are ridiculously nondescript,) I ended up pleasantly surprised with the location. On Rusland, right across the street from a fairly famous coffeeshop sharing the same name, the Radisson is right in the middle of central Amsterdam but somehow just tucked away conveniently enough to make you feel as though you are in a much quieter and distant area of the city. The Red Light District is less than a 5 minute walk, Dam Square and the Damrak 10 minutes ... of course, everything is much quicker on bicycle (and there is a perfect place to lock-up right across the street.)As mentioned by another reviewer I had no problems with an extremely early check-in (around 9AM), and although my room was somewhat less than what I've come to expect from the SAS brand, it was still bigger than most in Amsterdam. The beds were extremely comfortable and clean, mini-bar well stocked, and hotel relatively absorbent of noise. There was a great deal of late night traffic throughout the hotel, though.My only complaint would have to be the staff... oozing with faux cordiality to the point where it made you uncomfortable to walk through the lobby. The concierge was a joke and more interested in a tip than actually providing any information of substance. All in all I would definitely consider staying here again, although if you are willing to spend a little more the Hilton Amsterdam is the far superior of the two.
