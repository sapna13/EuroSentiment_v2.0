{"text":"Funky, but far off! The Silken Diagonal is a design hotel in a city that values designer style. However, although the lobby and rooms look beautiful at first sight, all you need to do is look closely to see the poor quality of most fittings. The first room that we checked into had a broken AC - the control unit was just hanging off the wall and all the electronic bits were missing. Although it took over half an hour, we were moved to a room that had functioning AC. Here however, the side lamps were dangling off the headboard! We decided to just live with that and not waste any more time...The Silken is located just next door to the Torre Agbar, a modern landmark which is certainly worth seeing. However, anything else that you might want to see it quite far off. Furthermore, this is a part of the city that is yet to see a lot of regeneration and the view from the panoramic windows is all but beautiful.The reception staff were a bit snotty and seemed annoyed at having to deal with the large number of people checking in. There was a large group there for an event and they seemed to be a room short. All in all, checking in was a rather unpleasant experience.If you are traveling to Barcelona as a tourist, this is probably not your best choice. You'll end up spending a fair amount of money on taxi rides in order to get to the more exciting destinations and you probably won't be able to get any advice from the hotel staff. ","annotations":[]}
