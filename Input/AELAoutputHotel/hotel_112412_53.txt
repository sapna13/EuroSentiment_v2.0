{"text":"Nobody cared. I stayed at the Alexis on a recent trip to Seattle to see some friends. I booked the room on hotwire and was looking forward to the experience. I understand that they have recently completed a 10 million dollar renovation, which is very obvious. The hotel is stunning; contemporary mixed with traditional. The room was fabulous, fantastic d√ã√\u2022√ñcor, great bed and an amazing shower. It was a nice size and very well appointed with marble bathroom and unique artwork. The location is also very convenient; close the market, restaurants and great shopping.All this being said, I feel that perhaps the hotel should invest some of its money training its staff on customer service. Quite frankly, I found the service to be disappointing. No one was rude or unkind; they just seemed completely indifferent. When I arrived, I walked through the front door towards the front desk. Two bellman were walking in the other direction, one said hello without smiling or really looking as though he wanted to say hello. When I arrived at the front desk, no one was there. I waited for a bout 2 minutes when one of the bellmen came by and said, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√∂√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l get her√à√\u2020\u2022? I can understand that there is work to be done behind the front desk, but no bell or any way to call someone out if needed. A girl then came out to the front desk and starting typing on a computer, she did not acknowledge me at all until she asked for my credit card. I asked how she was to which she replied √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√\u2020ood√à√\u2020\u2022? I was not greeted whatsoever. In the end I was handed keys without being directed to an elevator or particular floor. Through the whole check-in process, eye contact was made twice briefly. When I got to my room I called for some ice as my friends were joining me for cocktails before we went out for dinner. No one was available in room service so the call rang to the front desk. The person on the phone had no personality in her voice whatsoever and ended the conversation with √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Ölright then√à√\u2020\u2022? My departure was much the same. I was this time greeted but without a smile and hardly an eye contact. When I stated my room number, she said my last name, like it was a number. Had she put √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢r.√à√\u2020\u2022?in front of it, she would have been addressing me personally. I then stored my bag with the bell desk. Again no greet, just took the bag and was given a ticket. I asked if there was an umbrella I could use and was told, yep, over there and he pointed to one leaning by the door. Some may say that these are picky details. The truth is that I did enjoy my stay; but when it comes to giving an objective review, I feel that all the facts should be stated. This hotel has the potential to be amazing. I did get a good deal on the room but had a paid the full price advertised at $280.00 I would have been a little more upset. I understand that the hotel had a young, hip atmosphere but when it comes to a boutique hotel, I would expect warmer, more personal service.
