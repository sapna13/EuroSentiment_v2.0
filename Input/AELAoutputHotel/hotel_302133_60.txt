{"text":"Excellent Hotel and a great location We stayed at the Kowloon Shangri-la for 3 nights en-route to Thailand in a delux harbour view room, which was really worth the extra - the view from the floor to ceiling window is fantastic. We found the room to be modern, very spacious and very comfortable indeed (not as some have said 'tired') the bath was a good size, very deep and there was a large walk in shower. The mini bar was well stocked and the laundry service also was excellent.Breakfast in the Kool Cafe was fantastic with a huge choice on offer, the Shang Palace is also a must - we did also dine at the top of the Oriental Hotel, which was outstanding, and the bar was very cool, however we were very pleased that we had picked the Shangri-la to stay and not on the island, I found this to be a much better location right on the habour front and you can walk along the promanade to the star ferry with great views of Hong Kong on the way.Although the swimming pool is not that huge and was a little cold (although very refeshing after a late night!) the spa itself is very nice with lots of treatments on offer.The service was outstanding both in the hotel and all the restarurants it was a lovely place to enjoy Hong Kong from. I would definitely go back - can't wait!We booked the limo service from the airport to the hotel, well worth the money to arrive in style, you can contact the hotel direct they are very helpful.
