{"text":"Exceptional service in paradise My husband and our two boys (6 and 12) stayed at the Westin Rio mar from May 11-15 2007. I went on this web site prior to our trip weeklyto check the reviews and I was nervous after reading negative reviewsabout the service, food and cleanliness of the rooms. Let me put everyones minds at ease that this is the most fabulous resort with exceptional service in paradise.When we arrived at the resort we were greeted by two smiling bellmen who helped us with our luggage. Check-in was a breeze 10 minutes at the most. We requested our room to be on the 6th or 7th flloor overlooking the El YunQue rainforest. If you do get a resortview instead of oceanview which I recomend it will save you money and actually it is more impressive than the ocean view, stay on the 6 or 7th floor. Our room was in pristine condtion with two Heavenly beds, terracotta tile floors, the room has a blow-dryer in it that is better than the one I have at home, a safe was in our room as well, along with toiletries from Bath and Body Works, bottled water was given to us daily (San Pelligrino) there was supposed to be a charge for this type of bottled water but our maid gave it to us for free. The beaches here at the resort are to die for. Super clean and smoothsand with turquiose water that is never cold! And the three swimming pools (with one water slide) are amazing. We ate every moring at Marabell's the food was exceptional. They serve a breakfast buffet. The continental buffet was 16 dollars whichconsisted of muffins, donuts, bagels, lox, ham, cheese, fresh fruit(mangoes papaya, berries watermelon, melons) cereals yogur and granolas. The other buffet was eggs sausage bacon omlet bar (made to order) and everything else under the sun this was 23, our 6 yr old's meal was free and our 12yr old was 8dollars. I highly reccomend this buffet and what we did was keep our yogurt on ice and bananas for lunch because we are not big lunch eaters. I do not recommend gettingyour muffins and coffee at the David's coffee place located in the resort. We ended up paying 25 dollars for two juices, 3 muffins, and two coffees when at the buffet we paid apx 50 for all of us to eat and we were stuffed and we had food left over for lunch.For dinner we ate off of the resort at a place at thebottom of Rd968 and Rd 3 called Anojitos where we had a delicious, authentic Puerto Rican meal with excellent service. Ask for Monica to serve you. She'swonderful and very pleasant to speak with. She went out into the backand caught a Coqui frog for our children to see! Do not waste your money on shuttle and Taxi services on the island. Definately, definately rent a car....in the end it's far cheaper and you have access to the entire island. We explored the rainforest in our car, then on foot. It's an experience we will relish forever. We are definately going back to the Rio Mar!
