{"text":"I Love Boston! I used the Marriott website to book our 7-night trip to Boston. I debated between taking this hotel and another Residence Inn in Cambridge but ultimately decided on this one. The location was great because it was within a 10 minute-walk to the North Station metro stop or the water ferry that was also part of the public transportation system (BIG HINT: at the airport buy the weekly pass that gives you unlimited rides, then take the Metro line to the Aquarium, and from there take the water ferry to Charlestown. More interesting than a cab anyday.) The hotel is just off the Freedom Trail, and is walking distance to good restaurants, a supermarket (but it looks a little run down, especially if you are used to the Publix Supermarkets here in Florida), and a small branch of the public library with free internet. It is beside an office park and condos --- not in a typical touristy area but that works for some folks!Don't bother eating at its restaurant because you can get better food at the same price (North End Italian and Todd English's restaurants are walking distance), although the buffet breakfast is okay (comes with the room). The rooms come with a full-size fridge, a cooktop, and a microwave so you can always heat up any leftovers. We had a king-sized bed and a sleeper sofa; comfortable for a couple and a pre-teen but probably cramped if you had 2 kids or an older child. The swimming pool was tiiinnny --- but then who comes to Boston to swim when you're from Florida? We had problems with our shower but the maintenance guy came and fixed it right away. When you ask for your room see if you can get a higher floor facing AWAY from the bridge, so you get a view of the water and don't have to deal with road noise.I wouldn't mind staying here again but would like to suggest that their reception staff get to know the area so that they can give clear, concise directions to guests. Marriott should make it mandatory for all their hotels to have a printed fact sheet on hand with important info (directions using public transportation if available, location of nearby churches, supermarkets, etc.).
