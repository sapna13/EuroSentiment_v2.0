{"text":"Vacation nightmare - toxic rooms 2\/17\/2008To Occidental Grand Flamenco Management:We recently vacationed at Occidental Grand Flamenco in Punta Cana and we booked the Romantic Vacation package from 2\/9 - 2\/16. The purpose of letter is to describe our romantic vacation nightmare on your property. In addition, we want to know how we going to be compensated for the worst vacation we have been on?Upon our arrival on 2\/9, the nightmare vacation began: We waiting on line to register with the hotel and when we finally were able to register, registration could not find our reservation. After many minutes, registration found our reservation and we were told the room was not ready to come back 30 minutes. We waiting on line an addition 2x before our room was ready. We asked for 2 keys and we were told √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022¬µh No√à√\u2020\u2022?we only have 1 key. We asked a bellman to help with the luggage and bring us to the room. And we were told √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022¬µh No√à√\u2020\u2022? which was the beginning of many √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022¬µh No√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂√à√\u2020\u2022? Therefore, we dragged our luggage, found building 22-225, and carried our bags up a flight of stairs to our room. Room 22-225 was a toxic and unhealthy room and I came home from vacation sick. Here are some of the situations that we found with this room: Room was toxic with mildew and moldRoom was not readyNo sheets on the bedNo towels in bathroomToilet brokenRomantic package was not immediately providedNo coffee potNo lock on safeNo remote control for TVI called the front desk and complained and within a few minuets, some one came and put clean sheets and dirty blankets on the bed and floor mats were delivered as towels. When I asked about the coffee pot, they told me it was in the refrigerator. After complaining on the phone and little action was taken, we went to the lobby. Once again had to wait on a line and ask for a manager, his name was Mintz. We gave him a list of our problems and asked if we could be switch to another room and his response was √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022¬µh No√à√\u2020\u2022?you will need to speak to your VIP representative tomorrow morning at 9:30am. We spent our entire first day in the lobby. Day 2 we have to take ice cold shower since there was no hot water and could not flush the toilet. On our way out the door to meet our representative, we walk into a flood in the hallway from the room across the way. We meet Wendy our reprehensive from VIP at 9:30 in the lobby for orientation. We give her a list of problems and she stated they would be fixed by 4pm. If they are not fixed we wanted to be switched to a healthy room or another hotel. After meeting with Wendy we had to get back on line to get a lock for the safe in the room only to be told √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022¬µh No√à√\u2020\u2022?we have none left. Then we had to move to guess services and wait on another line to get vouchers for our Romantic Package. By the time we left the lobby it was close to 12noon. We spend our first day and half of our second day in the lobby.A day or two later it rained in the evening and the room across the way had rain pouring down in their closet. Needless to say, the guests were very upset. Maintenance knocks on our door at 10:30pm to see if your room had rained. This was the beginning scene every night there after, Walkie Talkies screeching, people yelling and moving the vacationers out of the room. And guess what√à√\u2020\u2022?the next day they would put more guests in this room only for it to happen repeatedly. Every night was disrupted with guest being upset because it was raining in there room. There was not one night were we got a good night sleep. On Valentines Day we received our Romantic Massage that was just 30 minutes long. Later on that day the water on the property was turn off from 1pm to 6pm. There was no running water anywhere. This was the day of our Romantic dinner in the Steak restaurant that was another joke. They put us at a table right next to the kitchen, were waiters were coming in and out. What a disappointment. This vacation was very stressful, not to mention the room was toxic. We came back more stressed out then when we left and have sinus infection due to the mold and mildew in the room. We would like to be compensated for this vacation! We would like a monetary refund or another vacation at your expense at a different property.
