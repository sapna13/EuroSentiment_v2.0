{"text":"Not quite a 4 star, but decent enough. Reading the Trip Advisor reviews prior to going helped to set my level of expectation. Most of the reviewers are right on the money. The hotel is not perfect, but for the price, just fine by me. Traveling with my wife and two kids, we had plenty to do and see.Positives: I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Our housekeeper was friendly and kept us supplied with extra towels. Tipped her well my last day. Location is good. $20 bucks via taxi to Old San Juan, great mom and pop restaurant across the street, Mi Casita. Negatives: The cabanas are being reserved at 5:00 in the morning. I'm not kidding. Went down one morning at 6:15 (the Starbucks is at the hotel next door) and all of the cabanas were taken. Be prepared if you want to hang at the pool all day. Speaking of the pool, the water could have been a touch clearer. If you don't have a pool you probably won't notice it. Something that could be readily addressed. Food and drinks around the pool area are offensively priced. 2 drinks, 2 sandwiches, $50 bucks. One other thing, just to be aware of. The hotel casino is open until 4:00 am. That means doors are slamming shut in the hallways around 4:15....everyday. There really not a whole lot that can be done, other than to ask folks to not let it slam shut. Oh well.All in all a pretty decent trip for the buck. Like I said, this is not a 4 star in my opinion.....a high 3 star trying hard to move into the 4 range. I'd go back, if the price was right. So, temper your expectations, read the other reviews, and enjoy yourself, you're on vacation!
