{"text":"I Heart Bryant Park Yes i spent many hours searching for the best hotel deal in NY, what with this being my first time there and all. I was worried about being in the right area especially because I was a female travelling alone. I arrived at the BP late on Thursday night (coming from London) and had pre arranged a massage in my room. Fab! went straight to sleep after and this meant I awoke nice and early and was able to go across to the park and see John Legend play for the summer in the park shows. It was such a great atmosphere. The hotel room was definately big enough (i had a standard room) and the bed was amazingly comfortable. I didnt hear any noise from the bar below (had been worried about this before arriving). Everything i needed was there, and the staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. I could only book 4 nights here and then the other 5 i stayed at the Casablanca, which was also great but i kind of wish i could have stayed at the BP the whole time, as it was probably better for a single 30 yo woman, and the other hotel better for families\/couples. I also loved the Pax food shop on the corner, great for getting breakfast and going to sit in the park! Great experience at this hotel and would love to stay there again. By the way, i paid $295 pl tax per night and at this time of year was good enough compared to some other 4\/5 star hotels. ","annotations":[]}
