{"text":"The Best Views in Paris! This hotel is situated on thr Rue de Rivoli, which is one of the best locations in paris.The views from the rooms are exceptional and the hotel is much cheaper than its neighbours, the Westin, the Lotti and the very very plush Hotel Maurice (which is just a few doors down).Having looked at the other hotels, the Brighton has the BEST views. The rooms are very nice, with large beds, t.v, minibar \/ fridge, desk and chairs, balcony and the bathrooms have extra luxuries and most have both a bath and a shower. The cleaning is very good and the staff are excellent, especially Bernard, who went ot of his way to help us.You can never get tired of waking up and looking out on your balcony to see the beautiful Jardin de Tullieries in front of you, the louvre just to your left, the eifel tower (twinkling at night) ahead of you and the arc de triomphe to your right..It is very central to most locations and whilst, the hotel does not have its own bar \/ restaurant, there are lots and lots to choose from along and behind the Rue de Rivoli, one of the best is the Rivoli Park Cafe, which is just 2 doors down!Plus if it did have its own bar \/ restaurant, it would become over priced like the others and then this little gem would be spoilt.We have stayed here 3 times and would not even look at another location for fear of missing the great views and great location.
