{"text":"Superb Hotel As most reviewers here have noted, this is an absolute gem of a hotel with amenities and facilities that are generally in the almost 5 star hotel class at much less than 5 star prices. The only significant drawback is the smallish room sizes, which also means that there isn't much furniture to sit on in a Club L Room other than the bed. (There is one desk chair and one none-too-comfortable sitting chair, so for two people, watching TV has to be done from bed.) However, the bed is ultra-comfortable and the choice of pillows (which you can select in advance of arrival from a pillow menu) is excellent, easily matching the beds, pillows and linens of the Peninsula or any Four Seasons.Other than the small room sizes, it's a top-notch place, with a friendly and generally helpful staff, a superb club lounge (with free internet access and beverage service 24\/7, and a fine array of snacks put out at various times of day), a heated outdoor pool that is one of the better ones in town, and the advantage, on rainy days, of being connected to a sizable shopping mall. The Club L lounge furnishings are lavish and spacious, and on non-cloudy days, the view from the lounge is special.Breakfast in the lobby level restaurant is comprehensive, with various pastries and breads, an array of cold cuts, both Japanese foods and a small selection of dim sum, a variety of cereals, made to order omelets, bacon, sausages, pancakes, yogurts, and a wonderful choice of fresh fruits and fresh fruit juices, including not just your standards (e.g., organge juice, grapefruit juice, apple juice, etc.), but watermelon juice and others. Most people who indulge a bit at breakfast won't find themselves wanting to have lunch at all.The rooms are cleaned several times a day by a fastidious, truly remarkable staff. If you use their shower cap, they will replace it with a new one. They make sure that the bathroom is spotless, as well.I recommend this place enthusiastically.
