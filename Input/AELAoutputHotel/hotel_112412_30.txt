{"text":"Great Hotel, Great Location The Alexis is in a wonderful location. Close to anything you would possibly want to do in downtown Seattle. Just a few blocks from the water front, pioneer square and pikes place market. The space needle and big shopping areas are a tad bit farther of a walk but absolutely doable. The front door staff was very helpful when asked for directions or opinions on activities and always greeted us as we came and went. They were very quick to call a taxi for you and were just all around great people. The hotel was very clean and quiet. The only noise we heard was one early morning some pounding in the streets from some kind of construction. It was not related to the hotel or the hotels fault. We drove from Kansas (26 hours) so I really wanted to have a massage in our room but wasn't able to locate anyone who had any idea who I needed to contact in order to schedule one. It was listed on the room service menu so I know they existed. The attached salon is apparently not the correct place if you would like a massage in your room. I would have settled for one at the salon but they were completely booked for our entire stay. Oh well, it wasn't too big of a deal. I have only two small complaints. Room service is VERY expensive. All the delivery fee\/service fee on top of the meal prices you will easily drop well over 50 bucks for a small meal\/snack. However the food was very good and fairly timely. One night we ordered cookies and milk for a small dessert. The hotel didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have any baked but said they were putting them in right away and would bring them as soon as they were done. We called about 15 minutes before it was time for room service to shut down for the night. About 45 minutes to an hour later they finally showed up with them. They were very apologetic and gave us a few extra cookies and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ charge us at all for them because they took so long. Not only did they not charge us, but they even stayed late to bake them and deliver them to us. To me that is great service. They didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ wait for us to complain about the long wait, they were proactive in the situation and made sure we were happy. We wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have complained anyway because we are very laid back people but the fact that they went out of their way to do that for us was very personal and heartfelt. The other complaint is when we were leaving we called ahead for our car to be retrieved. We waited the 10 minutes like instructed and then lugged our suitcases to the lobby. No one had any idea who was supposed to have gotten our car. We waited another 10 to 15 minutes for someone the find out who should be getting our car. Like I said these are very small nitpicky thing that happened on an overall wonderful trip. We will definitely stay there again if we should ever go to Seattle again.
