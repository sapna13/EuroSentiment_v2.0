{"text":"Great hotel in good location We have just returned from 7 nights in this hotel and would happily recommend it. Our room was well equipped, very comfortable and clean. Not the usual bland hotel decor. We found staff were very friendly, efficient and helpful and we felt very welcome throughout the whole stay. Our room, on 5th floor, overlooked the square. The metro is handy for getting around and a 7 day travel card allowed us unlimited travel. Only downside was the many steps inside some metro stations, especially coming out of San Bernardo, nearest metro for the hotel. Anyone who cannot carry their case up thirty to forty steps to street level should take taxi from airport. We took taxi back at a cost of 23 euros, booked by the hotel. Buffet breakfast is wonderful. I am vegetarian, my husband is not, which can cause problems in some countries. However, we were both happy with restaurants in Madrid. The Restaurante Corregidor in Plaza Mayor is good and the waitress on the first night there told me about a vegetarian restaurant a short distance away. She also taught me how to say vegetarian properly in Spanish which was a huge help and was good at suggesting dishes which could be made vegetarian. We ended up eating in both several times. The Yerbabuena Restaurante, Calle Bordadores, near Plaza Mayor, serves wonderful vegetarian food, best I have ever had in a restaurant. They have menus with descriptions in English. Even my husband was keen to go there although he has warned me that it doesn't mean he is now vegetarian. You can also get falafel and salad further down Plaza Mayor but seating there is limited to a few stools. Be aware that when bread is brought to your table at the start of a meal, it is not included and a small charge is added to your bill. In Yerbabuena, the bread roll comes with delicious dips. There is also a good pizza restaurant in the square near the hotel.
