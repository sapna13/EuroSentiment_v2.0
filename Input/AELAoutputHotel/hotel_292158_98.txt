{"text":"Awful service at the Grand Palladium Punta Cana My husband and I and two children stayed at the Grand Palladium Punta Cana the 3rd week of April. We have travelled to different countries (mostly in the Carribean) in the past and we like Punta Cana because it's very affordable compared to other places like Barbados, St-Lucia and the Bahamas. By the way, this was our sixth trip to Punta Cana in the last 4 years, so we were able to compare the Palladium with other Punta Cana resorts.In terms of quality of service for the price we paid, the Palladium is a bit more affordable than other 4 and 5 star hotels. BUT, you do get what you pay for. And this was quite obvious starting with our arrival. The reception staff were all very rude and did not seem to care about us at all. At one point, in my best Spanish, I asked the reception supervisor where the washrooms were and he did not even have the decency to acknowledge me but just rudely raised his arm and gestured to his right (I was supposed to guess that the washrooms were at the end of the hallway towards the back of reception.) We also had a few minor problems with our room which could have been easily resolved, but we were disappointed once again with the reception staff's attitude (one staff practically laughed in our face when we asked about changing a light bulb that was burnt).Ok, enough complaining about the reception staff. Now for the rest of the hotel, the accommodation were ok. The rooms were clean but outdated. The bed covers were soiled and we found mold on them, but the sheets were clean. But we did not go to Punta Cana for the rooms, but rather for the beach. The maids seemed to be very nice and always said a cheery Hola or Buenos Dias. This was probably one of the most pleasant part of our vacation! The food at the restaurants was ok for the most part, but we became sick on our last day, despite being careful with what we ate. But I do believe that this can happen anywhere we travel and it may not be entirely a problem with the hotel itself, but rather just our immune and digestive system reacting to the different foods. Also, the service in the restaurants was good on some days, and really bad on others so it was pretty inconsistent, despite the (generous) tips we gave regularly.As for the beach, well, that is the best part! It is totally awesome like the rest of the other Punta Cana resorts' beaches. However, it's not as wide as other resorts' so, as some people have commented before, you have to get up very early to find a good spot or even find a chair. Overall, if I allow myself to compare the Grand Palladium with other Punta Cana resorts where we have stayed (like the Majestic, Iberostar Bavaro, the Excellence and the Riu Palace, all of which I would rate as strong 4 and 5 stars for their service, food, accommodations and beach), the Grand Palladium, however, gets only a 1 star rating. But, we would have given it a good 3 stars if it had not been for the rude and negligent service at the reception.
