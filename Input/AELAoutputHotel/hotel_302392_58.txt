{"text":"Yes, indeed, it's wonderful After web-browsing for places to stay in Seminyak (anyone looking at this site knows the drill ... Will it be like the photos? Does charming mean the same thing in Seminyak as it does in Western real-estate-speak? How much is 1 million rupiah exactly?), I stretched the credit card a little and booked a villa (luxury villa ocean view, no pool to be precise) at the Oberoi. I did this through their website where, for some reason, I could get the villa under some package or another for over USD200 less than the rack rate (although, to be honest, I'm not really sure what rack rate means, probably the price no-one ever pays). Even under the deal, the rate was a little (but not a lot) steeper than I'd wear normally, but my girlfriend and I were in dire need of a holiday, and, for reasons relating to overseas work commitments, Bali, thank god, was the best location for our wee rest.Thank God indeed. We had a wonderfully relaxing 5 days. The Oberoi is right on the beach. It's quiet, except for the waves. The staff are professional, courteous and good at their job. The villas and lanais are older, balinese-style, but are well kept up and fit into the landscape, unlike the brutalist holiday architecture of The Legian, Sofitel etc. The gardens are glorious. The continental breakfasts (part of the deal) included fruit platters  juice, museli\/yoghurt, pastries, coffee\/tea (i.e. something more than a dry croissant and a cup of weak coffee). The bales and reclined chairs around the pool and next to the beach are perfect for lazing, reading, sleeping ... I mostly did the latter. And you get the towels, chilled water, sunscreen, fruit, sorbet, sunglass cleaning, boogie\/surf boards etc that other reviews have noted. And the vibe was relaxed and friendly. In short, the whole place just ... works. It just does what it does extremely well and with a minimum of fuss and we loved it.
