{"text":"Great Madrid Hotel My husband and I and my 8 year old son stayed in the Senator Gran Via on the 4th of July for 5 nights. We could not have asked for a better room then the one we got. We had read previous trip advisor comments and knew to ask for a spacious room withbalcony and we got this and more. The room which I would clasify as a junior suite had 2 rooms one with bed and one with couch which was made up as a bed for my son. Clean lovely modern bathroom with all the little touch bits and bobs ie comb,disposable shaver with tiny tube of shaving cream, a shoe hornand all of the usual other extras such as soap, shampoo, bath gel,body lotion and sewing kit. We had a top floor room with large terrace which had great views over parts of Madrid. 2 sun loungers and a table and 2 chairs which we used in the late afternoons when we would have tea (supplied by the hotel in the room via their little kettle supplied with tea bags, coffee,sugar, milk etc). This was after having our glass of Cava in the receptionon our return of a hard days sight seeing. The soft drinks were free and restocked everyday. At night our beds were turned down and a little chocolate was placed near each pillow. Wardrobe had 2 soft toweling robes and slippers which was lovlely to put ones feet into on return. The staff at reception were very pleasant especially Olga for us. The breakfasts were tasty enough and there was plenty to chose from. The only complaint in regards to breakfast was for me the waiting staff who were quite grumpy every morning and were not in the business of smiling or greeting anybody. The tasty croissants and the smile by the cook who made my omelette every morning more then compensated for this. I cant give this Hotel enough credit as it was all the extra little touches they supplied in this Hotel that made it so memorable.
