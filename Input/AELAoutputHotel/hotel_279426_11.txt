{"text":"Mediocre Stay - Nothing Special My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Adagio from September 8th through September 12th. We booked it on Expedia, and were looking forward to seeing a city that we had never been to before.Location:The location of the hotel is good, but nothing too great. If you go to the right of the hotel a few blocks, you are in Union Square, if you go to the left of the hotel a few blocks, you are in a not-so-nice neighborhood.Hotel Lobby:The hotel lobby was nice, but that is the only thing that was nice about this hotel. One of the girls at the front desk - Marie - was very rude to us when we were checking in. Joel on the other hand, was very sweet and helpful.Rooms:The rooms are DATED. You almost feel like you are in a 70's flick. The pictures on their website give you a false picture of what the room really is like. The bathrooms seemed renovated and clean, however the room was just gloomy. The air conditioning in the room did not work well, and everytime we came back to our room, the AC was off. The bed was uncomfortable. The sheets on the bed were very rough compared to what we are used to. It felt like sandpaper!!!! They have these gross orange pillows on the beds that were filthy, and also there were some dark spots on the actual sheets of the bed. One day we found a big puddle of water in the middle of our bathroom floor. It looks like someone left a bag of ice that melted on the floor of the bathroom. Cortez Restaurant:The restaurant inside the hotel was ok, but expensive. I had a piece of chocolate cake, and it was $12. My husband had a drink (in a very small glass might I add) which was $13. Ridiculous!Joy of Life Club:The Joy of Life club is their points reward system. Apparently they give you points to stay at their locations, and you can redeem them for different amenities. I signed up for this online when i booked the hotel so I could get some free stuff. The website let me choose what I wanted as my free gift when I arrived. I picked the bottle of wine, but let me tell you - I never saw it. It also lets you pick a reason for staying at the Hotel Adagio. We were there for my husband's 30th birthday - but it was never acknowledged by the hotel.All in all, I wouldn't stay at this place again. The website shows a luxurious picture of what this hotel is like. Shame on them. It's all lies.
