{"text":"Great Resort It was a great holiday. I must say I am very choosy and I criticise a lot. This resort is made just for your comfort. Beach is great, staffs are always smiling and polite, rooms are big and very clean, fridge in the room filled everyday. There is no limit for drinks at the bar ( some holiday resorts give up to 2 drinks at once) Bars at the receptions are table service. My wife and I are vegetarians and we loved the food. It was fresh and great variety. There are 3 sister hotels and you have access to all of them at anytime. It is very big and we walked a lot (you need that after the food you eat). There are several pools some of them can be very loud but others are quieter. Always wake up in early in the morning for the sun beds (before the Germans). You DO NOT need beach towels as they provide you one everyday from the huts by the swimming pools. If you want to go to fishing trip check the weather, as you will not have a refund if the weather is not good. Try snorkelling trip it is great. Do not forget to get some bananas for the fish, as they love it. Music in the nightclub is a nightmare. You will see what I mean if you go there. General entertainment is OK. Animation team can be annoying sometime. They were a little pushy. I must say I do not go to same please twice but I will not forget this holiday, as it was great all the way. I chose this resort from the comments in Trip advisor website and it was the best choice. I do not think it is 5 star but it is very close to 5 star :).
