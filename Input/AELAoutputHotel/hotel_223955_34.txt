{"text":"Great stay at the Courtyard San Francisco Downtown My wife and I were attending a conference at the Moscone centre, and this hotel was the cheapest within the region ($250), likely because it is a few blocks away from the real action (Union Square, Westfield Shopping Mall, Moscone centre). However, if you are capable of walking a few blocks (5-10 minutes) you can reach all of the above very easily, and we quite liked the location. We took the BART train from the S.F. airport, and got off at Montgomery St station, which was a four block walk from this hotel. Even with baggage this wasn't bad. I went for a run a couple of times - just headed down Folsom St for a few blocks and was at the Embarcadero which is great for jogging.As mentioned in many previous reviews, we were genuinely impressed with the service offered here. Very helpful staff. We did not eat at the hotel's restaurant at all, because we had other plans. There is a Starbuck's right inside the hotel lobby, which was handy for a quick breakfast.The room was huge - especially for San Fran! The big bathroom was also very much appreciated.In contrast to a previous poster, we did not have any technological gadgets in our room. Just a plain (non-flat screen) TV. The free Internet was nice, and the Ethernet cable is in the closet.Overall, we were impressed with this hotel, and we would return, especially if for another conference at the Moscone Centre. That being said, if shopping is your thing, other hotels are much closer to Union Square. We had to take a cab back to our hotel a couple of times since we had so much stuff! ","annotations":[]}
