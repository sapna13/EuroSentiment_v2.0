{"text":"Scary stairs! Our family of four had the quad room on the fifth floor. The biggest negative for our three night stay at the Hotel Linda was the challenge of getting up the stairs, a tiny circular stairwell with steep small stairs at all four flights and the steepest set of stairs at the top. Carrying luggage is extremely difficult, and ascending and descending feels hazardous. Our fourteen year old son fell down the steep top flight and was rug burned and shook up. The room was decent size and clean with a good view of the street in front and canal. But at night the heat was such that we needed to keep the windows open. With open windows the traffic noise kept us awake. Tough choice - lay awake sweating or hearing the traffic noise.On the positive side, the clerks were friendly and helpful (except about our request to move to a lower floor. ) Breakfast was good and included in the room cost - scrambled eggs, cereal, etc. A computer in the lobby was available for lodgers to use for free- it stayed busy but it was possible to get on. The hotel, on the outskirts of the canal district, was a long walk to the action in the core of city center, but it's an easy bike ride. Rent a bike; it's the best way to get around Amsterdam, for natives and tourists. A car in Amsterdam is bad news. The hotel parking was not availible for us - we found parking on the street right in front of the hotel and put 18.90 Euros in the meter every day (we never drove the car once we arrived in Amsterdam; bikes took us everywhere.Primarily because of the imposing stairs, we would seek a different hotel should we return to Amsterdam.
