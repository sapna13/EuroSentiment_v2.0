{"text":"Loved Secrets After reading several of the reviews prior to leaving, I was pretty nervous about how our vacation would be. It is hard to believe that people had bad experiences and complaints about Secrets. On the contrary, Secrets at Punta Cana was outstanding. We booked through Apple Vacations out of Detroit, Michigan which took care of all of the transfers etc and had reps available at the airport, hotel and tours which was a nice resource. The grounds and rooms are beautiful-we were in building 2 on the third floor which had a high ceiling and nice balcony! The pools were awesome, and never really seemed too crowded. The beach was beautiful and there was always a place available to sit and relax. The food and drinks were very good also. The spa was very relaxing and seemed comprable in price to that you would pay here in the US. The shops on the resort were a bit pricey, so make sure to take along your sunscreen, lotion, aloe etc. We also brought along pepto bismol, tums, and bug spray (which we never had to use). The small stores at the end of the beach were reasonable in price along with the vendors that came in to the resort on many occasions...it was fun to 'haggle' and converse with these vendors. Most importantly, the staff were wonderful. They went out of their way to help you out anyway possible, they were so friendly and they always remembered our names saying hi and calling us by our names as we walked around the resort. The entertainment staff were the best, they made the day enjoyable teaching water aerobics, cocktail classes, fruit carving classes, dance classes etc. These staff were so energetic and enthusiastic! They also frequently joined in conversation teaching us about their culture! Thank you Iseal, Ines, and Rico for making our trip more pleasurable!! We would definetly return to this resort, we did hear rumors that the resort will be changing hands in January...we hope that the services, staff etc will remain the same because things are wonderful!To wrap up, if you are looking for a secluded and relaxing place this is the resort for you!!
