{"text":"Great Stay in a Vibrant area This hotel is a gem in a great area! First off, we arrived by train (Subway\/Metro) and walked for about 2 minutes to get to the hotel. It is right off the Vavin Metro stop. Once arriving, you will be able to tell this is a small and personal hotel. The lobby is small and entirely managed from the front desk. Meaning, the front desk, the small free internet corner, and the breakfast dining area is all within view and management from the front desk. It's modern, beautifully decorated, and in a word - quaint. Check in was easy. We went into the elevator and went up to our room on the fourth floor. Let me tell you about this elevator because it says four persons max allowed. It is the tiniest elevator I have ever seen. We had to go separately up on the first trip because we couldn't fit in there together with our bags. Really funny how small it is. Not a complaint at all, just SMALL. We got up to our room which is small but perfect. It is a cozy, comfortable room with a flat screen TV, safe for valuables, nice bed, enough lighting, free wireless internet, adjustable AC\/heater, great toiletries, nice views, and just great comfort overall. We loved the room! It was great to just chill in the room after a long day sightseeing. The area that this hotel is in is perfect. It is in the area where the Crepe restaurant\/stops are abundant and the best in all of Paris. There is an awesome bar right on the corner next to this hotel. It looks like an Irish pub, but it is one of the coolest, most stylish bars we have ever visited. We walked to the Eiffel Tower from here. We walked to the Tour Maine-Montparnasse which is a 5 minute walk. (Go here to see all of Paris from the rooftop. Tallest building in the city.) The staff at the hotel is great. The location is perfect. Best of all the Metro stop is right there so you can get around with ease. This hotel was perfect and we loved it!
