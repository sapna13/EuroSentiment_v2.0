{"text":"Nice Experience at the Residence Inn Lake Union Just returned home from a week at the Residence Inn where I attended a conference. First impression was that it was a bright, clean and well maintained hotel with a large atrium with kind of a minimalist Asian flair in the decor. Good impressions continued right along for the rest of the stay. Staff were friendly and helpful, and the extra touches were there, 24 hour coffee and tea, warm cookies several times a day at the front desk, popcorn for your in-room microwave, etc. Free hi-speed internet in the rooms, and lots of fluffy pillows on the comfy beds.Nice oversized suites with somewhat small tub\/toilet areas, but sparkling clean and nicely appointed. I was worried about noise or smell from pets as I shared the elevator with some sharp barking dacshaunds, but once they were in their room I couldn't hear them--thank goodness. If I hadn't seen them I wouldn't have known there were pets in the hotel. I did see other well behaved pets later in the week. I had room 509...lake view, didn't pay extra. I enjoyed watching the bustle of the busy lake, and didn't find it noisy unless I opened the sliding glass door to go outside on the balcony. There was road construction, but again, I couldn't hear it unless outside.Terrific breakfast buffet, nice managers reception on Wednesday night, and housekeeping kept my room spotless....even did the dishes I dirtied one night. On the day I left, front desk staff even scrounged me up some tape and a box to ship the conference stuff that wouldn't fit in my suitcase back home. Front desk printed maps for us of the areas we were heading too, and the shuttle driver knew his city and was very informative.Our whole conference was at the hotel, and all services were very nice. We used the shuttle to go to several areas of the city, including Seattle Center, Pioneer Square and Queen Anne. I would definitely stay there again. I do not know the rate that was paid, but having stayed in other Seattle locations, this is an obvious terrific choice.
