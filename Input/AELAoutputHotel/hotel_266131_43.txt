{"text":"How much for a gin and tonic?!?! This was my third trip to Barcelona, (first on my hen weekend, the second at Valentines) and I thought this hotel would be nice. My first mistake was to book a hotel so far away from the centre (silly me) and the second was to book a place so hugely over priced! I had a lovely room with a nice view of the city, a beautiful bathroom and very nice toiletries. A huge plasma TV which seemed to want to fall off the wall! The whole place was lovely, but too far away. We used the free shuttle bus to get into town, but it finished too early for it to be of use to us in the evening. All in all, we spent at least √à√\u2020√ü?0 per day in taxis including the free shuttle service. At the weekend, it was near impossible to get a seat at the times we wanted, and the return journeys were always full, so book ahead if you want to secure a seat.In the evening we had drinks in the bar, the service was better than I had read much to my relief BUT the prices were frightening! On the first night we ate at the restaurant, the starters were lovely, but the mains was too fussy and too many flavours √à√\u2020\u2022?the meal costs us over √à√\u2020√ü?80 for 2 people, no desserts, but 2 expensive riojas (√à√\u2020√ü?25). Needless to say, we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat there again as it was not worth the money.This hotel is suited to couples who want to get away as the whole place is stunning, with views from the pool and bar √à√\u2020\u2022?which incidentally is closed after Sept, so we were very disappointed. The rooms are beautiful and well kitted out with very high ceilings. I loved the place, baulked at the prices and got criticised by my husband for the amount of money and distance we had to go to get decent tapas and some night life! For those that have had enough of the touristy Barcelona (does that happen?) and are not shocked at paying √à√\u2020√ü?5 for a gin and tonic, I think they will enjoy this place.
