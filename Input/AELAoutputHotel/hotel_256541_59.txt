{"text":"Ideal base to explore Sydney The Four Points by Sheraton Darling Harbour has the ideal location for a first time or return visitor to Sydney. It is a few minutes on foot to the Sydney Aquarium, Sydney Wildlife World, Darling Harbour shops\/restaurants\/IMAX\/museums, Cockle Bay Wharf, Chinatown  the CBD.BOOKINGWe made our reservation with the hotel direct and they were always efficient and professional in their correspondence. It was all in order on arrival. ARRIVAL\/DEPATUREOn arriving at Sydney airport we took a taxi to the hotel. It was lunch time and cost around AUD$55 including a toll fee. On departing the hotel to return to the airport for our flight out it was early afternoon and the friendly taxi driver asked us if we wanted to take the fast or slow way, on asking the difference he said 10 minutes extra on the slow. Since we weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ in a rush we took this option and it cost AUD$31.00. So if one isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ in a rush on arriving\/departing for the extra 5 minutes it ended up being it was a good AUD$20.00 saving. It is also possible to arrive by train direct from the airport terminal and no change of train is required. Ideal if there isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a lot of luggage. The train station to alight at is Town Hall and a short 5 minute walk to the hotel.RECEPTIONReception was well staffed and promptly checked us in. We had arrived a few hours before the hotel check in time of 1500 and were given key cards to our room early. Check out is at 1100 and it was extended by a few hours at no additional cost. On their website there is a fee of AUD $15 per hour up until 1800 advertised so it was very lucky we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have this charged as we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know about it until after we had asked to leave the room later for our flight timing. Nothing seemed to be a problem when asking reception and always professional. It was an impressive overall experience with the staff at this hotel.ROOMWe stayed in a Harbour View Room with a fantastic view on the Darling Harbour area with floor to ceiling glass. There was a good small mini bar selection and good basic range of amenities provided in the room. Additional ones were available at a call to housekeeping. The bathroom had a shower combined with the bathtub and it was a good standard but wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ deem the bathroom we had luxurious. It was a very comfortable room, nice and clean. The main feature of the room is the view that made us very pleased with our choice.FACILITIESThere is a tour desk, business centre, concierge desk and a 24 hour gym. Unfortunately there was no swimming pool. This hotel can afford to not have a pool though as a drawcard due to the perfect location it offers. There is an overpass footbridge connecting to the hotel  then some stairs that serves as a short cut to arrive at the Cockle Bay Wharf\/Darling Harbour area. There is a lobby bar, a pub and a restaurant however the immediate area also boasts some great places to go for a drink or have dinner. We only had breakfast at the hotel and dined in the area.AREAThe options are endless on things to do in the area of this hotel. And the wonderful thing for visitors is that a car isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ required. Most can be done on foot or taxis\/buses\/monorails\/ferries and trains as additional options. The ferry stop is a short walk from hotel that goes to the Circular Quay area (the Rocks, Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge). It is about a 15-20 minute walk down to this area or 3 stops away on the subway. The city centre with the Tower is just 5-10 minutes up towards the QVB\/Pitt Street mall and the famous Darling Harbour  Cockle Bay Wharf area with a good selection of bars and restaurants.
