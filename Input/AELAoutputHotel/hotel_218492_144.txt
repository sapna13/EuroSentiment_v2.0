{"text":"Great Place To Stay Me and Wife arrived at this resort on March 21- 29. Check in was speedy and we recieved drinks while waiting for our rooms. The Lobby is beautful and very clean. The room we were given was very spacious and it had a private balcony. There was a bar fridge in our room, that was stocked daily with beer, coke, sprite and lots of water.There is a safe in your room that you can rent for just 18$ for the week. It is a good peace of mind and worth the money.The resort is not overly big which is a plus and the beach is no wheres away.The Staff are very friendly and would go out of there way to please you, we were really impressed with this. Our Maid Angela De Garcia was really nice. She would have swans made out of towels and fresh cut flowers put inroom on a daily basis, she was a darling.We stayed in building 5 and our room was on the ground floor next to the pool and hot tub. There is a bar there and the bartenders name is Nicholas. He was perfect and always aiming to please us. He would make sure our bubbas was always full.The Resort is very well kept up and the gardeners are always seen cleaning up the place and picking up the dead leafs and stuff and always with a smile on there face. Pools are great and the swim up bar is good as well but closes to early in the afternoon. There is a main bar in the middle of the resort and its open till 12 every night then there is the disco and that is open till 2 every night.Be very very cautious about the people who are selling stuff on the resort. There are stores or mini mall there and they are there to rip you off big time, especially the store called TABU . STAY AWAY FROM THERE !!!!! There prices are outragous. The Girl that works there is really pushy and gets really mad once you enter if you don't buy something. We felt very intimidated and unconfrontable. It really disturbed me that the resort would allow this to go on. What you pay there you can buy on the OUTBACK SAFARI for 1\/4 the cost, so be aware.The food was excellent. The resort as 5 a la Cartes and the Windows Buffett. There is also a buffett on the beach and there is pizza,fries,hotdogs,hamburgers and fied chicken when ever you want it.You have to make reservations for the fine dining, so remember to book them once you arrive. Seating is very limited.We did two excursions off the resort and loved both. We had a blast on the KON-TIKI cruise\/snorkiling and we went on the OUTBACK SAFARI. This is where you can buy all the cheap things like RUM,Cigars,Art,souviniers. On this trip we visited a school, please bring supplies with you, they really need it and the kids faces light up like christmas trees. Our guide on this trip was excellent. His name was ALEX . He was very informational and showed us alot of very different things. Overall the resort and the pople that work there are very friendly . This resort is not classified has 5 stars but you get the 5 star treatment, plus the price is right. I would without no hesitation go back there again. Beautiful.
