{"text":"Great location, friendly staff I spent four nights at the Affinia 50 with my husband for our sight-seeing and shopping trip to New York. The hotel's location is excellent: Rockerfeller Plaza is just around the corner, as is Grand Central, and it is not far to walk to 5th Avenue for great shopping or Times Square. We did walk all the way to Macys. which is a fair distance, but plenty of shops and sights along the way so we found it an easy walk.The reception and door staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful, providing suggestions to answer our every query and a welcome greeting and goodbye every time we arrived and left the hotel. Plenty of lifts for the size of the hotel (no long waits).Rooms are small but nicely furnished - ours had two big beds, a desk and two chairs and a chest of drawers with big TV on top. Windows were high up and did not allow any view out (I assume the way we faced was not worth a view), so the room was quite dark. The bathroom was small but nice and modern and sparkly clean. Nice Aveda toiletries replenished daily. Our room was a bit too hot and the air conditioner they'd installed didn't work so it was a bit stuffy, but that's the only complaint of the whole stay.On 2nd floor there is a nice casual lounge room in which to have continental breakfast ($14.95 per person) and afternoon tea\/coffee (free - just drinks no food). As this is just one floor above the lobby, I would not recommend having a room on this floor as we did as it can be a bit noisy when people are checking in late at night.Close to the hotel I recommend Pax (left  left again out the main door) for sandwiches, soup, salad type lunch. And Luncheonette (a couple of doors down) for breakfast\/brunch.Definitely would recommend it and would go back, but would request a high floor and a room with proper size windows.
