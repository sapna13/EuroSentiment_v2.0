{"text":"Amazing Anniversary at the Elysees Regencia My wife and I stayed at the Elysees Regencia for 4 nights from the 21st March 2007. We had an amzing stay here. The staff at the hotel were excellent. They went out of their way to give us a truly romantic experience of Paris (assisting with Lido reservations, dinner cruises, champagne excursions). Location:The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the Metro (at a quick pace). For our purposes, it was very centrally located, close to the Champs-Elysees (and therefore the Lido), the departure for our dinner cruise and the metro station that goes directly to Versailles. Some may prefer to have a Metro on their doorsteps. The hotel is on a one way road and is not noisy at all.Room:We stayed in a suite on the 6th floor and therefore had none of the typical complaints about small Parisian rooms. Rooms were clean, well stocked mini bar, good quality linen. The towels were changed twice a day. The TV channel had a few English channels (Sky, BBC, MTV), but no inhouse movies. The bath and shower were a good size. The bed was comfortable and there was ample cupboard space. The staff don't kick you out early to start cleaning the room - they wait for you to leave before entering the room and you are hardly aware of them. The champagne and note on the ocassion of the anniversary was a nice touch.FoodNice looking piano bar - however, we did not drink here. nor did we eat breakfast at the hotel - which seemed a little steep at the price. The location of the hotel means that there are plenty of bistros and cafes close by. We also did not use the room service.GeneralFree high speed internet was a real bonus. Baggage store was also very useful. Possible cons:- not on top of a metro station (not a problem for us - despite the fact that it was raining whilst we were there)Overall - great value for money!
