{"text":"Tremendous Value The bus ride was about 70 minutes on mostly rough roads, but was air conditioned. The property exceeded expectations. It's a large generally well maintained complex. The fan in our room did not work, but they fixed it. When the sliding door to the patio is open, the air conditioner does not work. They have internet access off the lobby. You can use their computer for $6\/ half hour or $10\/hour or if you bring your own computer with wireless capability, they have a complementory (at least for Apple guest) access code, so it's free, but you have to ask for it. Three pronged USA electrical devices won't work unless you have an adapter. They provided this, but you have to ask. The pools  beach are very nice. Great beach to walk on. The location is very remote. Don't expect to eat off campus or do much shopping. The food is ok. I'd rate it a little below Sandals quality, but the service is much better than Sandals. There is a good variety, so you should find something you like. They don't have sour mash wiskey like Jack Daniels or Wild Turkey. Canadian Club is the closest thing they had, so burbon drinkers beware. The Doninican people are very sweet and they are very appreciative of any tips they may get. Booking the special restuarants early as you can is recommended and make sure you check the print out they give you to ensure its the date and time you wanted. They made a mistake on one of ours and gave us a date after we were to leave. We arived at the restuarant and they were booked. The offer of a tip to the hostess did not get us a table, so we ate at the buffet , which was ok. The pasta bar is very good. As is generally the case in the Carribean, don't expect to get good beef. This was a last minute deal from Apple Vacations and was a great value. Would do this again.
