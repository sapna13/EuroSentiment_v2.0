{"text":"The Savoy Berlin is Charming We chose this hotel based on reviews from this website - which were seemingly excellent. We were pleased with the hotel for the most part and I found the hotel filled with old world charm - which we like. If you are looking for North American type hotels - this one isn't for you. Our room was quite large and quaint and overlooked the outdoor patio. We awoke to birdsongs every morning and it was a lovely start to the day. The beds, although European in style, were quite comfortable. The bathroom was large, but quaint. I don't think the hotel has air conditioning - if it does, it has no obvious temperature controls in the room. Some reviewers compained about noise, but we had our windows open and found the room to be quiet.The hotel guests seemed to be mainly German speaking - so this hotel did not appear to cater to North American tourists per se, but the staff speak English and communication was not an issue. On the other hand, I did not go on vacation to have a North American experience - if we wanted that we would have stayed home. So this hotel fit my needs very well - it was a slice of Europe.Some reviewers have compained about the cigar bar off the lobby and the accompanying cigar odor. We did not find the smell of cigars to be particularily strong or offensive. So it was not an issue. What was shocking was the price of breakfast. Our room rate did not include breakfast (if you stay here - make sure it's included before you eat there) and when the bill came it was 19 Euro per person - my cereal and croissant cost almost $30....But, its Europe and I should have known. For the rest of our stay, we walked half a block to a lovely coffee shop for pastries and deliciously european coffee - under 10 Euro for two.The hotel has a convenient location - it is near many restaurants and small coffee shops, only two blocks from Ku'damm and the upscale shops therein, and within walking distance of many attractions. The area has undergone rennovation and you will find lovely shops, restraurants, bars, and theatres within mere blocks of the hotel. It is less than a half hour from the airport and only blocks to buses and trains.This hotel was a pleasure to stay in and we would do it again.
