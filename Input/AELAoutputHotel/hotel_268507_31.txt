{"text":"The best hotel I ever stayed at! I was traveling to Toronto for business. I always check Tripadvisor before booking any hotel. The reviews were mixed, as you can read. I like the pictures so much I thought I would give it a try. I stay at hotels often from the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton to boutique hotels like Hotel Le Germain. This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at! I have stayed at 5 star hotels in the US, Paris, Rome and Switzerland. I am the ultimate critic, this place surpasses the word, superb. Wow!!Room 611is unbelievable, I assume all the rooms are equal in quality and decor. The bed is huge and comfortable, the bathroom incredible. One wall in the bathroom is glass with wooden blinds so that they can be closed or open. This wall is the the shower wall where you can look directly to the bed from the bathroom. I have never seen a room designed in this manner. It was very cool! I never take a bath in a public tub, this one you could have eaten off of it. The tub was trimmed in black slate, the shower head powerful with multiple settings. One thing I noticed, that towels smelled and looked so clean. I only remember the Four Seasons as having towels that are comparable and not at all Four Seasons. I sometimes travel with my own towels since they never seem to smell clean and I always attriute this to diluted detergent. These towels were clean, soft and fragrant. The details were incomparable to any place I have ever been. Recessed lights, custom furniture. The library has a computer and printer where I printed my color presentation for free. The living rooms downstairs have comfortable white couches with a cozy fireplace. The staff were exceptionally courteous; they went over and above to ensure I had everything. There was an expresso machine for complimentary capaccino, expresso, tea, coffee, etc. in the library and in the breakfast room. The breakfast spread had salmon, black olives, fresh pastries including croissants, jellies, fresh fruit, crepes, everything. You can order any type of coffee you want they make it right there. I felt like I was at Starbucks, but better. Simply superb. I was amazed at the attention to detail. I told my husband that I would return to Toronto just so that he could experience this hotel. I didn't want to leave!Dinner:Dinner at Rodney's oyster bar. I sampled different oysters from various parts of the world. The fish dinner and beer selections fantastic! If you like fresh seafood, you'll love Rodney's. I can't say enough about this hotel. I hope that someday I can return. I wish I could only have shared this experience with a family member or friend. This is how exception Hotel Le Germain really is.
