{"text":"Can't get much better... We stayed at the Hotel Atlantico for three nights just after Christmas and couldn't have been happier. We traveled with a toddler (1 and a half years old), and were pleased at how easy the hotel made everything for us. This hotel couldn't really get much better, especially considering the reasonable price for a 4 star hotel.Our room was quite large, with enough room for a table, desk, two double beds, and a baby crib (a big pack and play that the hotel provided free of charge). It also had a large bathroom and a small balcony with great views of the city. At least for the room we stayed in, it was much bigger than your typical European hotel. Most importantly, the hotel is in the center of the city, with everything that you would want to see a very manageable distance away. We walked everywhere from the hotel, we didn't take a cab, bus or subway our entire time in Madrid - that is how central it is. There also is a large grocery store a block away, for those of you who like to save a bit of money here and there (or need diapers and milk!)I've read a few reviews here which complained about the noise from the street, but as you are staying on one of the most busy streets in one of the busiest capital cities in the world - the noise is expected, and it didn't interrupt our sleep in the slightest.There also is a bar on the top floor, which was a nice place to sit and relax, but we didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, so I can't comment on that.We also took the free shuttle from the airport, and although the driver was a bit late, it worked out well. I believe there is a charge to take the shuttle from the hotel, though.Overall, this was a great hotel. Thanks to the other commenter's who recommended it - The Hotel Atlantico deserves its high ranking.
