{"text":"wow - we were impressed with the wyland waikiki We had a surprisingly lovely stay at the Wyland Waikiki We were getting a deal and didn't expect it to be so luxurious. We were in a two room suite, with a kitchenette. The lobby itself was beautiful and open, and had several wonderful and intimate-feeling rooms, that guests could sit in, read, relax or socialize in. Wyland's art is beautifully shown and integrated into all aspects of the hotel. waterfalls abound, giving such a lush and soothing feeling. Walking onto the premises feels wonderful, and the lobby and rooms live up to and even go beyond what you see in the photos.The room itself was lovely and very accomodating, with comfortable and ample seating, a delicious bed, two large flat screen tv's, lots of window to open to the lanai, lots of storage space (closets, drawers, cubbies) to unpack into, counter space in the roomy bathroom, cabinets, stocked kitchenette (microwave, refrigerator, coffee and tea service) etc. The staff was very welcoming and helpful and immediately available whenever we had a question or concern. We were well serviced and tended to. Even though there are over 400 rooms in the hotel, it felt very personal and intimate.Location is great - easy walk to the heart of Waikiki, bus stop downstairs for transportation to other parts of the island. Pool area is nice, jacuzzi is great, fitness center is good, restaurant and coffee shop on site, and lots of little amenities are available: pixie sticks, otter pops by the pool, daily newspaper, easy access to check email in the business center (I'd love to be able to do my business in this setting on a regular basis!), massage chairs in the chill room, wonderful open-air feeling. Also, seems like only people who are warm and friendly work here - everyone from cleaning to management seemed happy to be working there and shared an ohana spirit with us. This of course spilled over onto the guests - we encountered no idiots in all the people we saw staying there. Seems like only really nice people stay here!
