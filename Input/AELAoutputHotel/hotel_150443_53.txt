{"text":"Nice, clean, expensive Beautiful curbside appeal, check in was a breeze, the room was not on the ocean side so the view looks a little like Brooklyn but the room was very nice...the bathroom is also the closet, coffee station, fridge and safe...so that takes a little getting used to, also it has in wall sliders without locks..so if you have kids, they might take advantage of the big gap in the closed door where if you are trying, the view is enough to poke fun....the room is spotless, and tastefully decorated..nice TV..no problem with that. The beach is small but alright if you have small children or like to snorkel near the reef..it's fine. The pools are spacious and have a lot of room to relax...lots of kids and I'm not sure if all the people there are hotel guests. Now, DON'T buy food here...don't get me wrong, it's very tasty, but ...for my young daughter and myself to have lunch (2 sandwiches, 2 drinks..no alcohol...and a small appetizer...60 bucks) And from then on, we left the hotel for all meals. There are a lot of places on the street the hotel is on with reasonable prices and good food. The people are very nice and friendly. But, if you go too far down the street at night, it gets a tad seedy..all in all, I'd stay here again, it's a nice place to relax after a long day of navigating...but very expensive if you pay beyond just the room...
