{"text":"Don't Even Make Your Worst Enemy Stay Here I booked this hotel through Travelocity and got double charged. Once from Travelocity on my business credit card and then again on my personal credit card. Neither company is easy to work with to get a refund for the double charged amount. The hotel was cool but dirty, in a low-income neighborhood, and nothing worked properly. All the air-conditioners in the rooms were broke (which is what the front desk staff said when I called to tell them my AC was not working properly) resulting in me turning my AC to 55 degrees just to get it to turn on, then running louder than a train wreck all night to spit out a measly amount of cool air on a 100+ degree night. When checking in they gave my reservation away which was a double bed room, and made me stay in a single bed room, with my co-worker - which as a married woman was an extremely awkward situation. And when I bring it up to them today after I called about the double booking charge they first told me that both the King rooms and Double rooms are standard so Travelocity can't tell the difference when making a reservation, and that they did my a favor by upgrading me to a king room. Obviously that's a contradiction (first a king bed and double room are standard, then the king room is an upgrade?), and I still have my Travelocity email confirmation which clearly stated a double room with 2 beds was reserved. + I remember clearly being able to choose which room type I wanted online. I wouldn't recommend staying at this hotel or having to go through this experience to my worst enemy. ","annotations":[]}
