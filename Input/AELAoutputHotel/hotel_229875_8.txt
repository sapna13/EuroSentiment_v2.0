{"text":"Good hote for a few nights stay This hotel was recommended by a friend who'd stayed there previously and it did not disappoint. It was clean and comfortable and the location whist not exactly central was within easy reach of the tube station and just 10 mins stroll from the Sagrada Familia.There was a good choice of buffet breakfast and the staff were helpful and spoke excellent English.If I had to mention the negatives then I think I would say that there wasn't enough light in our room. As we faced the rear of the building (better cus no noise) there was very little natural daylight coming in but the electric lights and lamp hardly gave off any light so putting make up on was not an easy task neither was reading or checking maps.I have stayed in similar hotels in other cities and it is pretty much what you would expect from a 3 * city hotel. I would stay there again if I went to Barcelona in the future.Barcelona is a lovely city and there is plenty to see and do.We were aware of pickpockets and have to report that we were involved in an incident on the underground at about 11.40pm one night when 2 black guys sandwiched my 76 year old father on the up escalator. The one in front of him had dropped a cigarette packet and made out like he was bending to pick it up whilst moving from side to side to prevent my Dad overtaking him. Meanwhile the one behind tried to relieve him of his wallet which was in his back pocket. Luckily my Dad felt what was going on and called out to me so we confronted the 2 guys who made out like they were innocent (seeing as they'd failed to obtain the wallet) but it was a classic trick to be aware of - you can't be too careful.
