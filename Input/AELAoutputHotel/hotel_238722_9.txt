{"text":"Excellent location, good stay. My mother-in-law, wife and myself spent a week at Aparthotel Acacia. Positives:The hotel is in an excellent location on a major street, 50 meters from a metro station for easy access to public transportation (and busses on D'Urgell and the next street can connect you to busses going to places like Parc Montjuic (sp?)), and numerous good restaurants and caf√ã√\u2022√ñs within easy walking distance can take care of any breakfast\/lunch\/dinner needs. We never ate the breakfast the hotel offers so I cannot comment on it. The small kitchen and table for dining were perfect for our needs, and there are a couple of dishes and glasses in the kitchen. Don't plan on doing any serious cooking, but a bowl of cereal, heating a can of soup, etc. is no problem. The staff was, in general, polite and helpful.Nearby restaurants that we particulary enjoyed included Tapas Bar just next to the metro stop - for quick breakfast and good tapas at night. About 2-3 blocks north on the next street over we had an excellent meal at La Cratera.Negatives:We were a little disappointed with the arrangements for a family, like ourselves. The living area and the bedroom area were not sepearated by a true (floor to ceiling) wall, so there was not complete privacy between the two areas. Also, the bath\/shower in the tub was worrisome in that it had a very high edge, with no grab bars, which was difficult to step into and out of for my mother-in-law who is 1) short 2) older. With a tile floor and smooth tub floor, this became very slippery when wet and my wife worried every time her mother showered. If you are interested in watching television while in the room, you may be a little disappointed with the small (13 inch?) television and the 3 button remote (on\/off, channel up\/down, volume up\/down). We were not in the room much watching tv so it was not an issue.Also, the shampoo\/conditioner they offered was a bath gel - more like a soap than anything. If you care about this, bring your own shampoo\/conditioner or buy some in a farmacia. You won't find a 24-hour convenience store in the neighborhood, and the farmacies close about 9 PM I think.OVERALL, for the price this hotel has good amenities and an excellent location. For a couple who would like more space than you can get in a typical hotel (perhaps with children), some friends that don't require that much privacy, etc., I think this would be an excellent hotel. It's not in a typical tourist area, but you can get to them fairly easily if you don't have a problem with the metro or busses (of course, it helps if you can speak and read spanish well). I recommend booking directly on the hotel's website, which allows for on-line reservations.
