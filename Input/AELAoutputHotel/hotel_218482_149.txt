{"text":"Super resort Just returned from a week (Feb 15 - Feb 22) at this great resort. Before leaving, I read the reviews and was a bit apprehensive as to what to expect because of the negative reviews. My suggestion to you - ignore the negative reviews. This resort is great. Remember, you are on Dominican time and 15 minutes can mean an hour. Relax and enjoy your holiday - don't sweat the small stuff.We stayed in Villa 2 which is right on the beach and close to the beach buffet restaurant and pool. The room was very spacious and had 1 king bed, which was very comfortable. We did have problems with the air conditioning and fridge the first day, but both were fixed by the second day. The beach has lots of palm trees and a nice breeze. You can walk for miles. The sea grass on the beach is cleaned up every morning. If you want to reserve a palapa with your towel, you need to be at the beach by 7:00 -7:30 am. People reserve, even though there is a sign on the beach saying this is prohibited. If you walk on the beach to the right of the resort, you will come to some vendor shacks. Make sure you barter - you can usually get what you want for a quarter of what their starting price is. We got the best prices from Alex, who has the last shack.The pool is huge and has lots of lounge chairs, but if you want one under a palapa, you need to be at the pool between 7:00 and 7:30 am with your towel. Martin at the swim up bar makes a great Miami Vice!The animation team always has some activity happening at the beach or pool. The shows in the evening start at 10:00 pm and are very repetitious, but they do try very hard.The food was very good. The main buffet and a la carte restaurants are about a 10 minute walk from the beach  pool, so we usually ate breakfast at the beach buffet and at lunch time, we ate at the pizza  hamburger stand, which also had rotissiere chicken and fries. We ate at all the a la cartes except the Mexican. They were all good, with the Steakhouse being the best. Make sure you try the creperie that is in the Shopping Plaza by the lobby. They serve great banana splits.The Royal side is not worth the extra money from what we could see. They have a very small private beach, which didn't have very many people. They also have a private pool and a la carte restaurants. Looked very stuffy and boring!!All in all, it was a great vacation and I would go back to this resort.If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.
