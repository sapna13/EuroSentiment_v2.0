{"text":"Perfectly Pleased! My husband and I stayed at the PCP for the first two weeks in March and all I can say is that we'd go back again next month if we could! We've travelled extensively all over the Caribbean and have never experienced an all-inclusive and were somewhat apprehensive as to what we'd encounter even though most of the reviews we'd read were positive.First of all, let me say that the hotel staff is the most hospitable, helpful, friendly and accomodating group of people we've ever met. From the moment we arrived (two hours ahead of check-in) until the minute we left it was very obvious that EVERY maid, bartender, waiter, waitress, groundskeeper, maintenance man, guest service representative, etc. had one goal in mind and that was to make sure their guests were satisfied; they did an outstanding job (even when often times faced with a language barrier!)!The food was surprisingly good. Granted, it's not gourmet cuisine but the buffet strived to offer a large variety and the a la carte restaurants were a nice option. The salads and fruits were as fresh as could be and the desserts were amazing. We visited La Cava and Momma Mia's next door and would highly recommend both. Overall, out of the l4 days we were there we were only disappointed in maybe three of our meals (including breakfast and lunch). We never were hungry, we never got sick to our stomach and we never had to ask for a refill for whatever we were drinking; we enjoyed the service immensely!The grounds at the PCP are beautiful and maintained to perfection. The beach is gorgeous, with just enough breeze to make you feel comfortable. The sun beds are awesome and a welcome relief from the chaises; we never had a problem with having to be the first one to the beach to get either - there were plenty for everyone (be careful with those chaises, though; a couple were broken and are probably still there!). If you enjoy walking, I would encourage you to go out on the beach to your left; when you get to the flea market the view is breathtaking and that stretch of beach is magnificent.The rooms at the PCP are spotless, spacious and extremely comfortable. I especially liked the double sinks in the bathroom, as well as the outstanding water pressure. The towels were not the most plush but they were clean and plentiful. Our king-sized bed was super; my husband didn't snore for two weeks! We were also impressed that out mini fridge was replenished daily,along with our coffee; again, the service was superb!The entertainment, better known as the Animacion Team, was certainly not Broadway or even cruise quality. They provided a tremendous amount of fun, however, and encouraged everybody to participate, day or night. If you're looking for a lot of night life, I'd suggest checking out another resort or possibly going to the outside theater next door, the Casino or the Disco.Make sure to experience a massage or two in the Spa or on the beach; you'll want to pack your masseuse in your suitcase! We couldn't believe it was possible to be that relaxed!!Our vacation at PCP was truly one of the most enjoyable ones we've ever had; we met some really neat people from Canada, we had l4 days of perfect weather and the hotel was l00% to our satisfaction - who could ask for more?! !!
