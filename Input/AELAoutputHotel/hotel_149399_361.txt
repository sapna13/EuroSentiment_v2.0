{"text":"Plop Plop Fiz Fiz Just returned from a week july 4th-11th with a group of 11.This is a honest review from a new jersey native.CHECK IN-VERY VERY SLOWArrived at 2pm with nobody on line and it took well over 35 minutes to check in,quickly the line built to over a hour wait with just 5 people in line.I asked for a close room to the beach and was granted.This place is huge so it was a minute walk to the pool,beach,buffet,but a very long walk to the sit down resturants and the lobby where the bars and shows are held.They have a train that comes buy every 15 minutes,but never waited,i walked.THE POOLS- Very large and never crowed.They have 2,one on the tropical side,and one on the caribe side.Getting chairs was never a problem.Getting a unbrella after 10am could be tough though.They have a pool bar at each pool.Never a wait to get a drink.THE BEACH- Very large white sand beach with plenty of chairs,and never crowed.Getting a shade umbrella was tough after 10am.They have all kinds of watersports availble.The only free ones included were the paddleboat and canoes.Get Them early.SEAWEED-Never a problem.Its actually little twiggs that float at different parts of the beach and wash up after a full day.Never a problem with swimming.Its not the green seaweed you think it is.They pick it all up after dark so its clean in the am.THE ROOM- Average sized room with a couch and a little patio.Includes a mini fridge,whichthey stock with water and soda at no charge.Leave the maid a small tip if you would like extra.Room has a small safe also.THE HOTEL- VERY VERY VERY PRETTY,beautifully landscaped grounds eveywhere.Very clean.Peacocks roam free everywhere.THE RESTURANTS- You have a choice of 2 buffet and nine sit down.The buffets serve breakfast and lunch and afternoon snacks.One serves dinner.The nine resturants were all above average with good food.You have to call the night before from 9-11pm to make reservations for the following night,no exceptions.You can were shorts,both men and women.MEN CANNOT wear OPEN TOE SANDLES.They will turn you away.BEWARE the service is extremly slow.ONLY had trouble getting into the japanese resurant whick cooks hibatchi style.On my second to last night i got help from the hotess who got me in for my last night.I tipped her nicely for the help.That is the only place that is hard to get in because of the good food and small amount of space.They open the mexican for late nite snacks.BARS- Plenty of bars all around with good drinks,UNLIMITED BOTTLED WATER FREE OF CHARGE you can order anything you want including wine and shots.Great service from all if you tipped or did not.they will also fill any mugs you may bring along with no problem.LOBBY bars close at 12am,then you have to move to the disco for drinks till 4am.The disco was empty most of the time.Music not that good.ENTERTAINMENT-LACKING--- They have nothing to do during the day,they have a water arobics class for about twenty minutes,and some vollyball on the beach.Thats it.The Kids have a flintstone camp that might keep your little ones happy for a few days.They have nightly shows at 10pm which are pretty good,then some live music till 12am.THE NEGATIVES----- SICK SICK SICK! My whole group of 11 americans got the runs after returning back.Some of us had it mid week for a day or two.Took pepto which quickly stopped it.We all still have gas and the runs 5 days later.ONE OF THE KIDS AGED 15 CAUGHT A VIRAL INFECTION,AND WAS IN THE HOSPITAL WITH A 104 FEVER A DAY AFTER RETURNING.HER FACE IS NUMB ON ONESIDE,AND WILL REMAIN FOR 4-6 WEEKS.DOCTOR SAID IT WAS CAUGHT FROM THE WATER,OR THE FOOD.WE ALL AVOIDED THE SALAD,FRIUT.THOUGH WE DID NOT GET SICK DURING THE TRIP,AND WITH THE MISFORTUNE OF THE CHILD FALLING ILL THE TRIP WAS GOOD.WE ALL NEW AHEAD OF TIME THAT WE COULD GET SICK,WE WENT TO PUNTA CANA FULLY PREPARED.I WOULD NOT RETURN TO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.ANY QUESTIONS FEEL FREE TO ASK.
