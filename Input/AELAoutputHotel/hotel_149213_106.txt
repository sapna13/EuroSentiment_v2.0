{"text":"Wonderful Wedding My new husband and I along with twenty of our family and friends have just returned from two fantastic weeks here.With ages ranging from 11 to nearly 60 it was going to be hard to please everybody but we all had an amazing time.The location is great with all of the rooms having a sea view.The rooms were not the most up to date but were comfortable and spotless (as we were there lots of the rooms were having new furniture and being decorated). The mini bar was restocked daily.The grounds are beautiful with so many staff mowing, snipping and collecting sea weed as soon as it gathers.The beach was white, the sea was crystal clear and there are enough palm trees to get some shade if you need it.We tried all of the pools (except The Golf which is very small) and The Caribe was our favorite.There is no watering down of drinks here-they are STRONG-if you like coke with your rum order an extra mixer or two!!The buffett was really good with lots of choice.The Steak House was mainly lovely but a couple of us has some very chewey beef one night. They do great take away pizzas all day.The Italian was good too.We did have a number of people with stomach upsets so remember to take some tablets out with you!The staff dont speak much English but we dont speak Spanish so we cant complain. It did make things a little difficult at the front desk.A smile and a tip goes along way so look after the staff and they will look after you.The reason for our visit was our wedding and it was fantastic.There was only one other wedding while we were there so it felt very individual and special.Mirtha the wedding coordinator was great and organised all the extras we wanted:-a musical trio, DVD recording, photographer, extra flowers, cocktails, champaigne etc.We had the ceremony in the Gazebo at The Palace hotel which is set in pretty gardens and it was perfect.A holiday is what you make it and we had a great time here.Its really good value for money.
