{"text":"Surprisingly great! I stayed at the Elan Modern Hotel based on the reviews from the tripadvisor.I was extending my conference-stay in L.A. for a couple of days and staying on my own, wanted a good and safe hotel. I booked via booking.com and bought also a 3-day Go LA Card - pays you back twice if you want to see the main touristic attractions and do not have many days for that. When I arrived at the hotel, it was nice and very clean, staff very pleasant. Walking through the corridor I was asking myself why this hotel was rated nr.1 in such a city as L.A. There was nothing wrong, but I was not so much impressed. But then after the porter, who was helping me with my suitcase closed the door, I found myself in a spotlessly elegant room, where every detail was though of! The AC was perfect, fridge full of soft drinks and also some wine and beer, big TV with up to 20 channels plus a VCR, plus a choice of some very good films to get from the reception. For a woman a provided good iron was a must. Great bathroom with a bath-tube, nice toiletries, a bathrobe, thick towels of all sizes. Every evening when I came to the room, a small lamp was on, a few chocolate bonbons with a wish of a good sleep and a weather forecast for the next day on the bed, that was a very nice homely touch. WiFi was included in the price of the room. Breakfast was very good although basic - yoghurt, cereals, fresh bagels, marmalade, boiled eggs, great coffee, some fruits. The concierge was truly amiable and helpful every day with my questions about the best way to get there and there.., they were absolutely amazing. The hotel is very close to the shopping mall - Beverly Center. The area is ok, safe. It is in West Hollywood. Overall I had a perfect stay in the Elan Hotel, for three stars is is exceptional. I would advise it to my friends.
