{"text":"10 year wedding anniversary dream What a dream!!!!!!!! From beginning to end the trip was amazing. My husband and I celebrated our 10th anniversary and could not have asked for a better place to stay. We upgraded to the Excellence Club and thought it was well worth the money. We were swept away as soon as we got there to the private check in and were treated like a King and Queen the entire stay. Everyone was very friendly and more than willing to make sure you are having a good time. We went to relax (having two kids at home) and not have any drama. There are two separate sections of the large pool and we stayed on the quiet side away from the main lobby......peace and quiet as you sit and are served by the wonderful staff. The beach was nice but the waves were a little rough. The best part of the trip...definately having dinner on the beach! They truly cater to you and make the whole experience wonderful. Again, the staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms were spacious, the Excellence club was well worth the money, the pool and the beach were clean and is was wonderful to kick back and get served at the beach and pool side with drinks and pizza. The restaurants were good...every night they had a couple closed because of upgrades to the hotel but there are still enough to choose from (the Japanese one was Excellente!)Would we go back? Most DEFINITELY!
