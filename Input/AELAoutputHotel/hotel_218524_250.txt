{"text":"muy bien excellence We stayed at the Excellence for our 26th anniversary from July 27th untill August 3rd and I didnt want to leave! The room was gorgeous . After reading some reviews I was slighty intimadated if we had made the right choice. Well I am glad we chose the Excellence for our vacation. The food was delicious at every restaurant we dined at. People that have problems with a dress code should eat at ponderosa! Its nice to dress for dinner and have a nice relaxing meal with all of your expectations meet. The wait staff is more than welcome to cater above and beyond your expectations. Hats off to Jenny in the show lounge, Willy at the Lobster House , Domingo hehe ,at the Cascade pool ,Nayres hostess at the Lobster House and more then i could ever mention. We had more fun with the staff than other travelers!!!!! My eagerness to learn a little espanol worked well with with their interest in english. There were many long conversations with all the wait staff that were sooo entertaining. We were so relaxed after a week there I didnt want to leave but had to otherwise I wouldnt have ever had a productive moment haha!! If you are looking for a ultimate vacation where You can do things or simply do nothing ..this is the place.
