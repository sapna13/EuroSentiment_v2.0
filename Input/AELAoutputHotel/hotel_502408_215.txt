{"text":"Welcome home! The Affinia 50 is a truly wonderful place to stay. The rooms are extremely clean and spacious, esp by NY standards. The beds are so comfortable as are the pillows-I loved the pillows that were on my bed, so didn't make use of the much mentioned pillow concierge although I have to admit that paritally sold me-good marketing! There is plenty of closet space, two full length mirrors and a small fridge. The bathroom had enough shelf space. Real hairdryer, and an iron\/full ironing board also. My room was on the 2nd floor, I was originally facing the street but I asked to be moved b\/c I am a light sleeper. The room I ended up in was perfectly quiet, also on the 2nd floor, but might be off-putting to some as it had a basement apt feel b\/c the windows were high up and had no view to speak of but my personal preference was to have quiet compared to views.The staff at the Affinia are what make it such a special place. After a long day of touring or business it was so nice to come back to welcome home and cheers! They learn people's names quickly and use them. From the front desk to the bell people, they seemed to be genuinely interested in our well being. Just a very nice group of people to be around. I also loved the punch at the front desk! The club floor is very comfortable, a nice place to relax, and stop for wine and cheese in the late afternoon. The hotel is located very close to two subway lines, including the 4,5,6 and E,V trains. A couple of room for improvement items-the internet access is $9.95 per day or $49.95\/week- with so many hotel offering this for free, competitively speaking, I would think the Affinia would too. I did not look at the breakfast at $14.95, so I can't say if it was worth it or not, but it said continental and I've never had a continental breakfast worth $14.95. Ess a Bagel has the best bagels ever and is right across the street! One other drawback is there is no bathroom fan. Those were minor drawbacks, however, in comparison to how nice everyone was and how completely comfortable I felt in the room and hotel, especially getting a good night's sleep every night, being warmly greeted upon check -in, and being warmly greeted everytime I came and went. Highly recommended!
