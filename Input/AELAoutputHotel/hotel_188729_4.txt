{"text":"Perfection I am in the hospitality industry and run a luxury hotel company. I recently stayed in Paris for a very special occasion. Without hesitation I chose Le Bristol as its reputation amongst professionals is legendary. I was not disappointed and can even say my expectations were totally exceeded. The staff is absolutely perfect, kind and attentive without the robotic attitude found in other luxury hotels, warm without being familiar . The rooms were just what one would expect of such a place, traditional, exuding old charm but extremely comfortable and grand. We had a suite and my partner just loved it, chintz and opulent french style furniture but with plasma screens in both the lounge and the bedroom and a remarkable small business center. We are both foodies and had reservations in some special places in Paris (Jules Vernes, Robuchon, Lipp) so we only experienced room service but it was perfect, the best onion soup ever and service was extremely fast. We are looking forward to our next stay so we can experience the restaurant.The gardens, the largest in Paris for a hotel, are magic and a great place to have breakfast or lunch and the pool and little tanning terrace are adorable.But what really made the difference were all the delicate and touching attentions.If you are celebrating with a loved one, do not hesitate and book yourself into Le Bristol.I must finish by congratulating the whole team and thanking them for making a special stay so memorable... and I am a very fussy guest :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":936,"mention":"soup","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Soup"],"startOffset":932},{"endOffset":936,"mention":"soup","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Soup"],"startOffset":932}]}
