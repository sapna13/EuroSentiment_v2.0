{"text":"Good location, nice hotel, great price We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our stay in Tuscany. The location is a few blocks from the Santa Maria Novella train station, so it is very convenient to take the shuttle bus from the airport to the train station for Euro 4.50 and then walk to the hotel. The hotel is very close to San Lorenzo, but it is on a narrow street with very little car traffic. In fact, the street was so quiet that voices became amplified during the night, and I was awakened a couple of times by the voices of people walking by. Of course, our room fronted the street. The furnishings are very pleasant and new without being overly trendy, and the bathroom was particularly nice. Hairdryer provided. Comfortable bed. Very good breakfast, complete with meat, cheese, pate, fresh fruit (oranges, kiwis, etc while we were there), several types of bread\/pastry, and of course cold cereal.When we returned to stay for one night at the end of our travels, we were informed that our room had no electricity and the electrician hadn't been able to take care of it that day. Globus had already booked us a very nice room in another hotel just a few blocks away. They gave us clear directions, and there was not a bit of fuss. Our stay at Globus had been prepaid, so we were not charged for our stay in the other hotel -- Globus covered the cost. Globus also gave us a nice apology note and a bottle of chianti classico for our troubles. It went absolutely as smoothly as you could hope, in the event of that kind of a problem. The best kind of service imaginable.
