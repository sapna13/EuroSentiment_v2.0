{"text":"good holiday Me and my boyfriend went to the sirenis for two weeks in jan 2008 as a last minute deal. to say we came on allcoation on arrival we got a really nice room at the tropical side so we was really pleased with that. Food: the two buffets were really nice but did get a bit repetitive after having the same things for two weeks there wasnt a lot of choice seems to be alot of the same everynight.There is 7 restaurants on site we only tried the steak house and the mexican so can only really comment on these two the mexican was excellent with excellent service. the steak house wasnt so good as the steak was really fatty so ended up in the buffet afterwards as was still hungry.The two snacks bars near the pool also very nice good selection of food everyday. although as i said above became very repetitive after 2 weeks of eating the same thing.Drinks: the only downside to the bars in this hotel is that they shut too early midnight! my advice would be to get drinks in before 12 and you can still sit there. there is a disco in the hotel but you have to pay for drinks after midnight this is open till 2am same with the casino. to be honest most people are in bed early and up early. there is plenty to do during the day! although they shut early there is plenty of selection cocktails, shots milkshake any drinks you could want this did also include a lot of international brands. There is also a mini bar in the rooms filled everyday with coke sprite and water no beer though:(.Entertainment: the entertainment is very good at night lots of shows on down in the theatre and a band in the lobby everynight. althought the cds they play during the day are always the same so you will get bored of listening to the same songs for two weeks!! the entertainment during the day is not as fun its alot like butlins so if youre going on holiday to relax in the sun i would not recomend this hotel as we didnt get much peace when the activities were on!location: the location of this hotel is nice as it has a very nice beach. the sea is dead rough sometimes as where this hotel is its a cross between the atlantic and the carribean sea so it is rough and red flag is up alot of the time. it is an hour and 20 mins drive from the airport which is not very nice considering the roads are full of holes! everytime i went on a trip i had travel sickness due to the bumpy ride! and trust me there is no suspension on them coaches.excursions: we went on two excursions the swimming with sharks which is an excellent trip and not at all scary. you also have a party on the boat after which is really good. We also went on the shopping trip which for all the ladies who love shopping youll love this as you can buy lots of designer bags half the price! Reps: this is where our complaints come in. Jenna the rep was really nice we had no problem with her. James is a different story, hes fine when hes selling you excursions and waterproof cameras very helpful there but when you actually want some advice for example i had a bad ear infection and they didnt think i would be able to fly home as i got this a day before i went home. we went to the rep for advice he washed his hands of us and told us to contact our insurance as there was nothing they could do. this cost 30 dollars for a phonecall to the insurance as well! the travel insurance company advised they couldnt do anything while we were there they dealt with this when we got home. so im glad i was ok to go home otherwise i would of panicked so beware he is very unhelpful if you want anything else but excursions insect repellent and waterproof cameras.Overall thought i would recommend this hotel as we did have a good holiday. it is a very big place though and people visit this hotel from all over the world.if your going enjoy your holiday we did!
