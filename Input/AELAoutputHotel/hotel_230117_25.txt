{"text":"Mediocre and over-priced I stayed at this hotel for three nights as a business traveller so my review is from a different perspective to a holiday-maker. I really felt that the hotel did not deliver what I had expected. From the website and various reviews I had expected it to have a Japanese style and boutique feel to it, but in reality found it to be a rather standard and quite dated hotel.The rooms were mediocre √à√\u2020\u2022?fine for a short stay but nothing special. The view was great √à√\u2020\u2022?I was on one of the upper floors and so had a view of the entire city. Beds were reasonably comfortable, but being in a single room I rather frustratingly had two single beds.What stood out most about the hotel was the exceptionally slow service. I was running a conference in the hotel and so good service was paramount to the success of my event but throughout my time at the hotel I was repeatedly frustrated by the laid back attitude of staff that did not seem to appreciate my need for speed and efficiency. The communal areas of the hotel are horribly smoky √à√\u2020\u2022?perhaps this will change when regulations take effect. I noticed too that ashtrays were not frequently replaced.The hotel also takes every opportunity to charge extra for simply anything it can. As a company we were spending √ä√£¬¢20,000 at the hotel and were charged for everything from extra adaptors to a single extra bottle of water on site. The hotel would get far more business if it made allowances for customers √à√\u2020\u2022?I have not seen such an attitude in any hotel I have ever stayed in.Room service was also quite poor and pricey. The conference fare was also quite substandard √à√\u2020\u2022?the eggs in our salad nicoise weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ cooked properly. Portions served at our sit down lunch were small too to the point of being embarrassing to delegates.Location √à√\u2020\u2022?absolutely fine... Pleasantly out of the way and peacefully quiet. A great shuttle bus to the airport (return ticket 19 euros)Would I stay there again? No √à√\u2020\u2022?not unless a business trips requires me to and even then I would do my best to go elsewhere ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1676,"mention":"salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":1671},{"endOffset":1676,"mention":"salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":1671},{"endOffset":1676,"mention":"salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":1671},{"endOffset":1676,"mention":"salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":1671},{"endOffset":1676,"mention":"salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":1671}]}
