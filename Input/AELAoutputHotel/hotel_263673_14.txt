{"text":"best bar none in florence We booked in to the Degli Orafi for a treat on our last night in Italy and upon return to Florence (we kicked off trip with two nights at the Globus Hotel before heading to Lake Trasimeno and San Gimignano)We had already visited the hotel the week before to ask that they make dinner reservations for us for the night of our stay, they booked us into the best steak restaurant in town (in the end we arrived a little later at the hotel than expected , cancelled our reservation and headed to a place we'd eaten at on our first night)So to hotelReception: Staff helpful, reception not large or very impressive. In fact walking to the lift I thought 'oh no' due to tacky posters on the walls etc. However upon arrival on our floor we could see it was a bit grander!RoomsWe had what I imagine was a bog standard double: small perfectly formed, good bathroom, loads of towels and a good supply of toiletries , sewing kit etc - a bit of a rarity in italy.Only problem with room (apart from no view!) was no power sockets - could only find one in bathroom , not so convenient for charging PC.Nice touch was the sleepshirts on the bed. Location - what can I say, everything on door step, including great deli if you need a pack lunch etc. Top tip - book tickets for the galleries in advance - queues horrificHotel roof bar - when I think about my week in italy (a wet week in May) I would not trade the hour spent on the roof bar when we arrived at the hotel , sitting in the last of the days sun, sipping a glass of prosecco and munching on the nibbles provided . The roof terrace is tiny - 5 tables each seating 4 max, but it has views out over the Arno in one direction and views of the town hall, doumo and hills in the other. PricelessLikewise our nightcap on the roof terrace was picture perfect too, and surprisingly only 2 other tables taken.On the day of our departure we were scheduled to get a 4pm train so had breakfast in the amazing breakfast room, it was really nice, although not quite the 'american breakfast' i'd been expecting - I wanted pancakes and waffles! but a great start to the day for us. We then went for a walk across the river and up to the Piazzele Michelangiolo as had missed that when we arrived due to bad weather. We then decided to return to the hotel, used our vouchers for the free drink at the roof top bar (you must put drinks on your room - no cash, so once you've checked out not supposed to go back up!) and soaked up our final views of florence before heading away. Overall, the hotel, well the views, were worth every penny and it did feel like a real treat, however important to bear in mind you are paying through the nose for the location and views (which are perfect) our bog standard room was clean and comfy but not super luxurious. BAd point _ we had room 107 which is very close to the breakfast room - even closer to the kitchen - which meant being woken up very early with the sounds of the preparation etc luckily we wanted to wake early but maybe not that early.. something to consider. Overall a night at the defli orafi should be something everyone does in florence - even if it means living 'cheap style' for the day -eating pizza on the go , and avoiding the boutiques. The peace and the views from that roof terrace were to die for, not to mention the jealous looks from all the people walking along when you walk into the hotel!
