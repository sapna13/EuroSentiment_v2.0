{"text":"super hotel when we got there We booked via Thomsons here in the UK. I had read reports here before we left about construction etc so contacted them 4 times  on each time was told there wasnt any. However, there was..When we landed at Punta Cana we were told the hotel was overbooked for our first night so were taken to Sunscape Casa Del Mar; in no way was this a 4 to 5 star resort. Buffet was very poor, room was not good, door locks didnt work properly etc. We couldnt wait to leave next morningOn arrival at Dreams we were greeted with towels and champagne  immediately upgraded to a honeymoon suite as our room hadnt been ready the day before. We were also given $100 credit to use in the spa,  then they delivered free champagne and fruit to the room.The suite (7204) had a separate bedroom, living room, big dressing area etc + a jacuzzi hot tub on the balcony. It was heaven. We had a partial sea view.Our chambermaid did a lovely job every day on the room, and the nightly turn down service was nice.The pool is wonderful, stretching the length of the resort. There is a small problem for swimmers tho in that it is only 3 foot deep the whole way so serious swimmers take note.The beach was lovely, and the staff continually raked it etc.The bartenders were quick efficient and courteous. Premium brands all the way.The buffet was very good indeed.The a la carte restaurants were, a bit up and down. We found the french adult-only wonderful. The beef fillet  Lamb dinners were superb. Mexican was very good but always empty so lacked atmosphere. The italian (part of the buffet) was ok. The Chinese was very good indeed, but be warned if you want a romantic meal it can get very loud because of the diners in the Japanaese part (more of that later). The seaside grill was poor. The roadhouse good. As we were there 14 nights we sampled them all more than once. Light lunches at the seaside grill were good.The downer on the food was the desserts - they were pretty poor throughout.My wife is a vegetarian, and it would have been nice for each restaurant to have a veggie option. Too often it was a greek salad or a few veggies on a plate.We had booked the resort as it was marketed as a romantic destination. Unfortunately, my ideal of that does not equate to some of the other guests who were staying there, who seemed intent on getting as drunk as possible. There was one major incident that involved a whole party being thrown off the resort,  we did have to contend with people drunkenly running up and down the corridors at 3 in the morning banging on doors etc. We also had a neighbour who decided to have a party in his hot tub at 3 in the morning waking everyone up. (these were middle aged people not teenagers)The construction work at first appeared to be only the paths, but there was work going on in the rooms neighbouring ourts during the day, and quite loud it bacame if you went back for a siesta.The staff were all very polite indeed and have nothing but praise for them, despite being spoken to by some guests very badly indeed.Towards the end of our break there there was an awful lot of Head Office staff there running the rule over things. New high quality loungers appeared round the pool. They seemed to be making every attempt to make it a truly wonderful 5 star resort. However, to make that work they may need to review some of the the clientele that they attract. They can help this by enforcing the dress codes in the restaurants, sitting in a posh french restaurant opposite people in flip flops at night isnt really on. We dressed as per the dress code why couldnt the others? Sorry if I sound a snob hereOne last point, if you are going there for more than a week, the standard deluxe rooms might indeed be a bit small.All in all it would take much to make this a true dream destination ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1306,"mention":"Premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":1299},{"endOffset":1608,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1601},{"endOffset":1608,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1601},{"endOffset":1608,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1601},{"endOffset":1608,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1601},{"endOffset":1608,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1601},{"endOffset":1608,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1601},{"endOffset":1608,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1601},{"endOffset":1608,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1601},{"endOffset":1608,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1601},{"endOffset":2080,"mention":"veggie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Veggie_burger"],"startOffset":2074},{"endOffset":2119,"mention":"greek salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Greek_salad"],"startOffset":2108}]}
