{"text":"Impecaable service I had stayed at the Ayre Gran Hotel Colon over the weekend of 13 December 2008 and was pleasantly surprised by its high service standards and quality.Apart from the fact that a rather unfriendly-looking lady was manning the receptionist and had checked me in on the first day, the rest of my stay was a dream. I had stayed in the newly renovated Europa wing and it was very clean, comfortable, tastefully decorated and well-heated. The bottled water and chocolates in the room were also a nice touch. Most importantly, apart from the aforementioned lady on the first day, every other hotel staff whom I had come across was friendly and went on his or her way to assist me (e.g. with information on museums, transport and other recommendations, helping me to change to a non-smoking room and repair my shoe, etc). The hotel was also very reasonably priced (not much more than I had paid for a hostel in Florence in the same month!). I have only very recently stayed in hotels in Cardiff and Paris at significantly higher rates when those hotels (more aptly described as motels, in my view) were old, cramped and dark, had no facilities or personality and were utterly unimpressive. Although the Ayre Gran Colon is not located in the city centre, it is quite accessible. It is visible from and is not more than a 5 minute walk away from the metro and not more than a 40 minute ride on the metro to and from Madrid Barajas international airport. To reach the city centre and the museums, I simply had to walk through the nearby Retiro Park (which was a very pleasant walk as it was sunny and the weather was mild when I was there). I would certainly stay in this hotel should I visit Madrid again.
