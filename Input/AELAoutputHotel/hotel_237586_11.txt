{"text":"Decent hotel for the price but could be much better Me, my boyfriend and 3 other friends have booked this hotel for the weekend.On the internet, they say that it is a short walk to the center, well its not ! Unless you are an olympic champion of marathon, it will take you a hour to walk to centraal station, so unless you got plenty time, you got to take the tram, which I got to admit is pretty easy to get (number 2 is round the corner from the hotel).The double room was allright, but there was way not enough plugs, we had to unplugg the tv to charge our phone or use the straigtener.They provide a hairdryer in each double room but I do recommend to bring your own unless you have very short hair !!They shouldnt call a bathroom but more a washing room, after a shower, the room get flooded and you need to wear wellies to use the sink or toilet.But I do have a few positive things to say, the bed is one of the most comfy i have never had and we had a lovely terrace where we could sit and have a ciggie.We were on the ground floor and feared that it would be too noisy but overall it was quiet.I got to admit that the location is quiet and its near Vondelpark so perfect for a nice walk, but I wont choose this hotel again when I will go back to the Dam.
