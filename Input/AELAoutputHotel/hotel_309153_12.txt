{"text":"Insecure In-room Safe While we had an otherwise excellent stay in Bali, my husband and I were very sad to realize that someone had broken into the in-room safe (an electronic one where you set the combination) and stolen over 10% of our cash (this event could either have been at this location or the hotel they acquired in Tuban). The thief took a few bills in various denominations in various currencies, likely hoping we wouldn't notice the loss. Since we ended up staying at the hotel for the vast majority of our stay and didn't do much shopping, we did notice. So: Travelers Beware!! Avoid placing cash in the in-room safe. If you must, count it before and after you get back.As for the usual things about which people write reviews -- our stay at the hotel was otherwise excellent. Fantastic rooms. Fantastic service, far surpassing anything we've ever experienced. Cleaning was done 2X\/day and snacks were left at night. I believe someone had previously complained that towels were refolded and not replaced. The hotel now gives a notice saying that if you want the towels replaced, just indicate this by leaving the towel on the floor. Just so you know, it will be replaced later that day, not while they're cleaning the room that time. If you want the food removed after you've eaten, all you have to do is call the butler and someone will come to pick it up right away (otherwise, yes, it will be left overnight).By the way, the floors are really slippery. You may want to bring slippers with traction to reduce the chance of falling. Our villa had 4 split-levels, so we generally couldn't avoid the stairs. ","annotations":[]}
