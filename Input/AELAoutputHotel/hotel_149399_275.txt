{"text":"Amazing Holiday-Fantastic ! Just returned from a two week stay at the melia caribe and can honestly say it was well worth the money and we had a great experience. I travelled with my girlfriend for a romantic getaway over the christmas break and we both had a wonderful time at the hotel. Right from the start everything was just perfect, and I can say that even as frequent traveller. The hotel is around a 15 minute drive from Punta Cana Airport, as soon as we drove into the resort we knew is was the place for us. check in was very fast and friendly. The reception staff seemed very happy to greet us and wish us an enjoyable stay. I would advise people to take the royal service option, private pool, restaurant, lounge with premium drinks etc all included. however we spoke to a couple which did not take this option and the standard of there rooms etc was also to a very high standardThe Room, very decent size, very clean and well maintained, bathroom also of a large size with power shower, bathtub, large sink . also maids supply you with a great variety of products whcih my girlfriend lovedFood,amazing, all 11 restuarants are very good, food is of a very high quality with lots of choice. they are all up to US top-notch standard restaurant, i find it very hard to understand how this resort to could get a negative review.Ground,also amazing, a massive resort, beautiful gardens full of wildlife and birds. although large regular trains and carts are available if you dont fancy walkingEntertainment,shows are really good, lots of great dancing and singing, enjoyable for all ages. There is a lot to do at this hotel. After the show at 10 there is a fun pub, casino and regular beach parties.Overall a great place, loved my time here, did not want to leave and am planning on returning in the future.
