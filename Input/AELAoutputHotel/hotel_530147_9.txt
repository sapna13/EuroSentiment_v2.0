{"text":"A very nice night at the Marriott I spent one night at the airport Marriott this past week and I enjoyed it very much. Also during my week in the Miami I stayed at the airport Hilton and a Hilton Garden Inn and while all 3 were great, I preferred the Marriott.The good: The service was great. Check-in was smooth and I was upgraded to the concierge floor which had complimentary chicken wings, cheese and crackers, soft drinks, coffee, water, and an honor bar with beer and wine that was open until 10 PM as well as a hot breakfast w\/scrambled eggs, cereal, danish, fruit, etc.. in the morning.The room was clean the TV stations seemed to be more expansive than most hotels, and everything worked. Good water pressure, enough hot water, extra towels. The not-so-good: location? Its very close to the airport and the neighborhood isn't the best. It wasn't an issue for me since I was in town on business and had lots of work to do at the hotel, but if you are the kind of person that likes to get out and about in the area adjacent to the hotel, this didn't seem like a good area. small room: My room was pretty small. I didn't really mind since it was a business trip, but if I were there for a few days and was traveling with my wife or kids I probably would have preferred to have more elbow room.Overall I rate this an excellent hotel for business travel.
