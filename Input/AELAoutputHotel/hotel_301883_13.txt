{"text":"Favourite place on earth This is the second time I have stayed at the Four Seasons Sayan and had to return to show the place to my mother. It is true that the hotel has aged ever so slightly but you could not get a better example of amazing architecture. It is just such an incredible space to be in and leaves you feeling very relaxed and at peace.As I had a baby with me, we were lucky enough to get one of the top floor suites- which are huge. The are on one level and the other suites are on two levels. I think there are only a few of them and they are worth requesting. On both occasions I felt so happy in the suites that I wouldn't bother paying the extra for a villa.Make sure you venture out for dinner as it is a pricey place to spend your money. If you get the included breakfast then you can probably survive until late afternoon (buy some snacks in town). Having said this, it is worth spending the money on the day spa and having a cocktail by the pool!As with most luxury hotels you tend to be quite seperated from the 'real culture' of the country you are in but at this price and with things this nice it is almost worth setting aside a few days to just stay put and enjoy! For what it is worth, it does have a very strong Balinese influence and atmosphere...just at the luxury end, not the REAL end.Do yourself a favour, save up and go. Even if it is just for a few days.
