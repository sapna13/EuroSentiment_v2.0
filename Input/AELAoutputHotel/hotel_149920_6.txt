{"text":"very nice We stayed at the Marriott for our 20th anniversary in October 2008 for 5 days. Overall we really enjoyed our stay.1) I had ordered a wine and cheese basket for our arrival - this was brought up soon after we got to our room. Very nice selection of cheeses and crackers plus a bottle of good wine. The price even with the surcharges seemed less to me than we could have bought all the items ourselves. Very nice indeed! 2) The room was clean with a nice balcony and beautiful view. We did have to wait a while for the elevators but oh well. Housekeeping was plentiful and very attentive to our needs. 3) The beach was nice - lounge chairs were set out for us immediately without us asking. Servers were plentiful. The surf itself was pretty rough but we found that it was more manageable a short walk down the beach toward the Rennassaince. Still to rough to snorkel though. Our only compalint was the crowded pools and broken hot tub.4) We don't really gamble but had some fun playing in the casino and everyone was very helpful. 5) The area where the hotel is seems to be making a comeback. Still some seedy spots mixed with really nice areas. We walked around alot and felt safe with just two of us. We did however make sure to avoid dark walkways and stay on the main strip at night.. Old San Juan was a short cab ride away and where we spent most of our time. We felt completely safe day and night in old San Juan exploring many nooks and crannies.Overall a wonderful trip!
