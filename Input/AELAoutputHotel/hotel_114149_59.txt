{"text":"Expected closer to perfection for $350 a nite! Good 4 star hotel that lived up to expectations and I'd probably go back because of the staff and locale. I did observe a few oddities that I found out of sorts for a luxury hotel. Petty complaints? Decide for yourself.Met family in the lobby a couple of times during the week. Nice part is that there are plenty of places to sit; strange part, the furniture should have been restuffed and upholstered long ago. Threadbare fabric and cushions down to the springs?!?! Gimme a break! Seems odd that mgmt doesn't take notice, care.Booked a superior king room ($350+ a night!). Not terribly large and not terribly small. Typical for a city hotel. Bizarre thing, room was discombobulated when I walked in and remained that way for all three nights of my stay. Lampshades crooked, never straightened, dust ruffle around bed didn't fit; looked real sloppy. Suggestion: Get the dusty electric cords out of sight! A it looks muddled B its dangerous!! My 2 √à√¥√ú y\/o nephew pulled the lamp cord that was hanging down and piled along the side of the dresser and the lamp tumbled down  knocked him on the skull. Good thing it was the fabric shade that clunked him, not the metal base!! Common sense; if the cord was out of sight and mind, like in most hotels, it wouldn't have happened! Alright the maid cleaned the room as expected for a clean Holiday Inn but lacked the tidiness of a luxury hotel where people fork out $350 a pop! 3 nites, $1,300 bucks later, for me not so petty!
