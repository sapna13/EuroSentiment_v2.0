{"text":"Barcelo beach premium We stayed for a week and had a great time. We were going 100% for the beach and to just sit and relax. The hotel was nice, clean and the all inclusive meant we didn't have to carry a wallet around and think about how much we were spending. The beach was beautiful. You had to arrive early in the morning at the beach or the pool or else most of the cabanas could be taken. But that's fine, plop your stuff down and eat some bfast in the shade. The ocean temperature is perfect to walk right into the water. The food is OK. We would have prefered more typical Dominican food than hamburgers and such. Lots more Canadiens and Europeans than Americans. Speaking Spanish helps but not necessary. We never felt slighted for not tipping. For a la carte dinners we took cash and usually gave a small tip. The various tours operated outside the hotel, like horseback riding, dunebuggys, etc were very cool also. Those were expensive. $40-60USD, which in the Dominican is like a million dollars. Anyway, for those you need to negotiate a price. If you speak spanish it helps, but most speak some english anyway. Also, the resorts say there is no town outside puna cana, no reason to leave the hotels. Jump in a cab and go to the little town. It's not pretty, but it's not scary or bad either. At least you get to see a little bit of the DR that isn't a huge hotel. Plus if you are like us, it was a chance to eat a real Dominican meal. We'll return. Maybe try another hotel and see if we can get better food. Oh yes. Pay extra to be Premium at Barcelo. It gives you a private loung with internet, drinks, snacks, etc. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":143,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":139},{"endOffset":611,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":601},{"endOffset":1553,"mention":"Premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":1546}]}
