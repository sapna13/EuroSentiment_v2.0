{"text":"Excellent value I stayed here while attending an academic conference at UTS. When I booked it was called Aspen but by the time I arrived it had changed its name to Aspire. I was pleased with it. Great location, comfortable, reasonable price. Not flash, but a good-sized room with all the things you expect plus a big balcony with sliding doors that opened. I was on the third floor and looked out onto roof-tops so I could leave the door\/curtains wide and have a sense of the outside extending beyond my room. The neighbourhood was leafy and residential, as another tripadvisor reviewer had said - surprisingly so given that it was a block back from Harris St and a few minutes walk from Broadway. I felt that I'd made a good choice for my $115\/night.On my first morning I was up at 6am thinking I'd walk briskly around Darling Harbour, but was seduced by Bulwara St and explored it and surrounding areas instead, admiring the tenacity of quiet, tree-lined residential spaces in such proximity to the city centre and the snarling mass of arterial roads. I longed to peek inside the victorian terraces and see how many were expensively done up inside and how many might be affordable - judging from the outside, not all were renovated, some (with bicycles chained on the tiny verandahs and none-too-flash exteriors) looked liked they might be student accommodation. I found myself imagining that I could live here, if I had to. I think there'd be a good community feel to it, if only because they all had to turn inwards to appreciate their little patches of peace.I was glad that I'd found out about the Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre (near the Powerhouse Museum, on Harris St) before I came because otherwise I might not have thought of bringing my swimmers and goggles with me. The $4.50 (student rate) for entry was well-spent given how wonderful it felt doing laps after a long day of sitting and listening to speakers at the conference. ","annotations":[]}
