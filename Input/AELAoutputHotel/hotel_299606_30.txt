{"text":"Don't Stay at the Rendezvous Singapore!!! This hotel has is absolutely terrible and ruined the trip. The front desk staff are unfriendly, unreliable and the hotel manager was confrontational when we escalated our issue for his help.My mother flew 25 hours from the US to be in Singapore for my wedding. Before picking her up at the airport, I personally called the hotel and checked to see if her room would be available. I was assured by the hotel staff that indeed her reservation was in place and that a room would be ready for her check-in when we arrived from the airport in 1 hour.When we arrived at the hotel, not only was her room not available but we also learned that a tour bus of 30 other people had just arrived before us and they also did not have rooms. After such a long flight, my mother wanted to take a shower and get some rest. The front desk staff were rude, unfriendly and unsympathetic. This is not the type of professionalism you expect from an upmarket hotel. It was only when I asked to speak to the hotel manager that anyone seemed to take interest.Upon meeting the hotel manager, he proceed to tell me that it was my fault. He then told us that it was our travel agents fault. For some reason, he did not seem to accept that someone from his staff had, only 1 hour earlier, confirmed that a room was available. Had we known a room wasn't available, we would not have dragged my mother across town to the hotel.We cut short my mother's stay at the Rendezvous and moved her to another hotel, the Miramar which was significantly better. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels and I was appalled by the service, attitude and accusations of the hotel staff at the Rendezvous. There are a lot of other hotels in Singapore - very good ones. I would strongly urge people considering this hotel to consider their alternatives. ","annotations":[]}
