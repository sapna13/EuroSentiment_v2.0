{"text":"Worst Vacation EVER My friend and I just returned from the Naiboa. We did not have a good time at all. We actually ended our trip 3 days earlier because my second day there $260.00 US was stolen out of my wallet in my room .Neither the manager Santana or the staff seemed to really be concerned about my situation. The staff did not speak clear enough english for me to be able to communicate well with them. I bought a calling card the day I arrived to the hotel and was told by the front desk that the cost was $ 20.00. He did not tell me that when I used the phone from the room with my calling card I would be charged $2.00 US per call. The food was ok. Good variety .The beach was WONDERFUL !!! That was the best and only good part. When my money was stolen, we deceided that this was it for us ! We wanted to go home and go home ASAP! They manager gave us a hard time about changing our cab voucher ( when we booked the original package through RUI the service from the airport to the hotel and from hotel to airport was provided). He didn't even want to let us make a courtesy call to change flight and taxi information. For a hotel that is rated a 4 star, this hotel seemed run down and and out dated. I will NEVER visit another RUI hotel EVER again !!!!! ","annotations":[]}
