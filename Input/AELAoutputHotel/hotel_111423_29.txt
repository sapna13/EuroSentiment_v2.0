{"text":"Lovely, but formal, hotel in a great location Our family of five stayed in a one bedroom suite. The decor was beautiful, but it was small for the five of us. I understand that the corner suites are larger; I wish I had known to ask for one of those. The bathroom was quite tiny. There is only a low, three door chest to put clothes in. (There is plenty of room for a taller chest and I would recommend that they replace the short chests with taller ones.)I think that maybe the management has read the reviews about lack of a doorman, because EVERY time we came and went, we saw a doorman. The doormen were very helpful with luggage, etc.The hotel was a bit formal for us; the biggest pain was that there were no ice machines on the floors, so we had to request that ice be brought to the room. We are more used to being able to help ourselves.I asked that the mini-bar fridge be emptied so that we could use it for milk for the kids. They emptied the tiny fridge for us, but it turned out that it was barely cool, so it really wan't usable.The location is TERRIFIC. It is just a short walk to the T Station. It is also just 1\/2 block to Newbury Street, which is filled with shops and restaurants. There are also a couple of restaurants on the same block as the Eliot. We tried Island Hopper (Southeat Asian cuisine) and it was just terrific! Directly across the street is a nice convenience store. We'd send the kids with some money every morning to buy cereal, milk, etc. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1291,"mention":"Hopper","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Appam"],"startOffset":1285},{"endOffset":1291,"mention":"Hopper","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Appam"],"startOffset":1285},{"endOffset":1379,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1375}]}
