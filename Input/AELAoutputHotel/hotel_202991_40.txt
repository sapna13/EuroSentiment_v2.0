{"text":"Excellent value, great location I stayed at the Hotel Laurus in May 2007 and would very much recommend this hotel for value, comfort, and location. Out of all the hotels I stayed at in Paris, Venice, Florence, and Rome, the Laurus had the largest room and was the cheapest. I prepaid four nights on their website at 185 euros and that was 100 euros cheaper than my other italian hotels. So it was great value.When we got to the hotel the front desk clerk said she was giving us a nice room. We've heard that before, but she was right! The room was excellent. Top floor (6), large bedroom, small sitting area around the corner, large bathroom, and a private patio with view. Very pleasantly surprised.The hotel has a very nice breakfast room on the top floor, and they were the only hotel to serve a hot breakfast (eggs and sausages). Every other hotel just had croissants, cereal, fruit and cheeses. The breakfast room was also the bar in the evenings and it was pleasant to sit out there and enjoy a beer.The location is outstanding if you arrive by train (I highly recommend travelling by train in Italy - fast, efficient, no airport hassles). It is an easy 5-10 minute walk from the station to the hotel. As you exit the hotel, walk past the large Santa Maria Novella church on the left, keep walking as the street bends a bit to the left. That is the street the hotel is on (Cerratani) and it is only a block or two along. (Alternatively, take the tunnel from inside the station which takes you under the busy street and out a little further down towards the hotel.Florence compared to Rome is much easier to walk around and the Laurus is well situated for all Florence sights. It is only a five minute walk to the Duomo, and maybe fifteen minutes to the Uffizi and Accademy Gallery and Ponte Vecchio. We walked everywhere around Florence, even up to the top of Piazale Michelangelo (recommended for the great city views).The Uffizi is excellent but you should seriously consider booking in advance through Select Italy. Same with the Accademy gallery. The lines are huge although I suspect they lessen later in the afternoon after the tour groups go through.The Santa Maria Novella church is worth a visit, as is the Basilica di San Lorenzo which is not too far away. We took a bus tour to Siena and San Gimignano which I highly recommend. Both cities are amazing.Lots of restaurants to choose from. We ate at Sabbatini, which is about halfway between the hotel and the train station. Sabbatini is upscale, a little formal but has a very nice interior, and serves authentic florentine food. It was very good if you want something a bit better class than most of the streetside pizzerias which are hit and miss.And Buca Lapi was excellent as well if you want a nice but bit pricy meal. It is close to the hotel but a bit hard to find so you will need a good map or some help. It is downstairs in a basement and has a nice atmosphere with travel posters pasted to the walls and ceiling. They make an excellent (and HUGE) florentine steak. Meal for two with a bottle of wine was 150 euros.All in all, a great city and the Laurus is the perfect place to stay.
