{"text":"Good hotel but noisy We stayed in the Torre for 4 nights at the end of Sept 2007 and it was a mixed experience.The location was fine - we knew it was a little way out of the centre but with the proximity of Sants station and the metro it was fine. We also knew there was building work nearby so knew there might be some building noise.Barcelona was very busy, due to various conferences etc and The Police concert on 27 Sept which we went to (and fabulous it was too!). It meant the first night was expensive (260 Euros) but the following nights were about 160 euros per night. To add insult to injury the hotel charges 6 Euros per person per visit to the Spa, which might not be much but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the principle√à√\u2020\u2022?Our first problem was they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have our reservation when we arrived, despite using a well known website and paying in full in advance, after about 20 mins at the reception desk this was resolved and they √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°ound√à√\u2020\u2022?our reservation. The next problem was with internet access as my husband wanted to make an internet conference call on the Friday. He was advised wireless connection would work in our room but when it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ he contacted Reception and was told wireless only worked on the first two floors of the hotel. They didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ send anyone for about 45 mins by which time he√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° missed the start of his call√à√\u2020\u2022?Later on that day we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get access to the internet again and that time had to wait for over an hour for anyone to come to our room. On check out we had to argue our case to get them to wave their connection charge.On the Friday night we wanted a relatively early night following a day√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ sight seeing and we were kept awake by noisy neighbours √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µartying√à√\u2020\u2022?in the corridor from about 3am until 7am. We called reception and they sent someone to speak to the other guests. The noise was partly as the room doors don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a slow close mechanism and therefore are quite noisy when they close and also the floors are marble √à√\u2020\u2022?both in the corridors and rooms, so you can hear everyone walking around as well as not having soft furnishings to absorb some of the noise.After such a disturbed night the hotel staff agreed to move us to a much higher floor and they did so the following morning and in fact we were also given a room upgrade, so they handled that complaint well. To be honest we were so tired we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° have checked out and gone elsewhere if it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ for the fact our four nights were already paid for.Check out on the Sunday was also very slow. Perhaps we suffered from a particularly busy time for the hotel and they certainly didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have enough staff to deal with guests although they did try to resolve problems. We are back in Barcelona before Christmas but won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be staying there again. ","annotations":[]}
