{"text":"Fantastic hotel!! Worth Every Penny - You Must Stay Here! This is a FANTASTIC hotel-- in location, decor, service (top notch), ammenties, food. Everything about this hotel is fantastic and it must seriously have one of the best showers in all of Japan! I stayed in 5-star hotels the entire trip and even at the Park Hyatt and this shower was the best. I did pay extra for the room with a view of Mt. Fuji -- but don't get sucked into that trap. Mt. Fuji is known as the shy mountain b\/c it's often hidden behind the clouds, so you're wasting your money for that view. Opt instead for the city view if you must, but not the Mt. Fuji view. The service was absolutely exceptional with no pretense at all and they understood English perfectly. They were so incredibly helpful and every time I took a taxi they would write in Japanese where I was going on a business card and handed it to my taxi driver -- so thoughtful. I would highly recommend this hotel and it's so much fun to stay in Roppongi Hills. If you don't know this already - Roppongi Hills has no hill -- think Beverly Hills of Tokyo. It's swanky, trendy and very fun. Very international part of Tokyo so there are quite a few expats here -- I did like that, but some people do not. It was the 1st hotel I stayed at on my 2 week trip to Japan and was the best way to start off my trip smothered in such luxury. Definitely stay here -- it's worth every penny! ","annotations":[]}
