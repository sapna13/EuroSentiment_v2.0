{"text":"Just returned from the Clift My wife and I just returned from the wonderful city of San Francisco. If you have never gone, well worth the trip. Not a ton to do, but the ambiance and relaxed state of the city is soothing itself. Definitely check out the usual tourist traps (Alcatraz, Pier 39, Chinatown) and if you like art head over to the SFMOMA. There was gallery dedicated to Picasso's prevalent role in developing modern\/post modern artists.So about this hotel..... First of all if you are going ask yourself some specific questions...1) am I looking for a hotel to be chic and attempting the cutting edge of design (trying to make an artistic statement)?if you could care less or are not impressed with this previous statement, you may not like the Clift Hotel. This hotel is just like its sister in South Beach, The Delano. It is a great scene to be scene, have an amazing night (Redwood Room) and eat a fantastic, yet expensive meal (Asia De Cuba). Overall, I really felt like this was a couples hotel, friends looking to get out and party around SF hotel, business hotel, and romantic hotel, not really a family with kids hotel.2) Am I looking for a hotel with a large room and bathroom?Just like NYC and a couple of other large metropolitan areas, there just aren't many hotels with large rooms\/bathrooms. The Clift's bathroom is small like most hotels (W Hotel, Hotel Diva, Hiltons, Marriots) in the city.My overall impressions:ServiceBell Hops all the way up to management and front desk workers were extremely polite, friendly, and welcoming. They took our bags up to our room immediately, brought in room service promptly with a smile, and even were very friendly at the Redwood Bar getting us a table quickly without extra charges. When we checked out, our bags did not make it out to the car right away and our car was a few minutes late. The doorman was immediately on his phone and little radio twice to correct the situation promptly. I have read negative reviews about the service about six months ago on this site. These reviews are now false b\/c either management was changed or they changed their style of customer service. Either way, smart move Clift, your service will keep bringing people back.RoomSmall, but so are the majority of rooms in SF. Great king sized bed with comfortable sheets\/comforter. Pillows are down so if you are allergic (wife is) just call down to housekeeping and they will accomodate your needs. Bathroom is small but not completely terrible. There are also mirrors in the room which can make it a tad bit easier when getting ready to go out for the night. Only suggestion for this hotel is purchase some better quality towels. The white, holiday inn style doesn't fit.Lobby\/Bars\/RestaurantsThe lobby can definitely throw you off if you don't expect it. There is a huge fireplace, oversized chair (like the seat is six feet off the ground), amongst other eccentric nic-nacs. Great library\/sitting area with classic board games to pass the time.Redwood Room is a great bar. It has a beautiful design, plenty of seating (if you are lucky to get some), and a huge bar. Don't pass this place up. Great mix of a crowd age wise as well. Just fun, not pretentious like some of the bars\/clubs in South Beach, Vegas, LA, etc.Asia De Cuba seemed like a nice restaurant. Didn't get there for dinner or lunch, but had a good breakfast. Seemed trendy, but never heard a complaint from anyone who ate there. We got a great deal on the price (below $200), but even if it was $250\/$300 a night, we would definitely come back (unless the Four Seasons or Ritz was the same price). Great time and wonderful overall experience. Thanks Clift!
