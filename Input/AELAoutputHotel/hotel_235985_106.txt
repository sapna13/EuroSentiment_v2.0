{"text":"Our Home in Florence... We stayed in Florence four nights, in July 2006--two rooms--here at this charming small hotel. It is two small buildings joined together, with a nice breakfast room tucked just beyond the reception area, with a handy (gratis) internet desk right there too. Our rooms were very nice, scrupulously clean and air conditioned which was a joy in this very hot summer weather. Our two teenaged children actually had a larger twin room assigned to them than our double, the first night, and when we asked, the staff very quickly helped by giving us a similar sized room for the remainder of our stay, at the original rate. The hotel is just a short walk from the train station, a welcome haven at the end of our train trip to Florence. The location is perfect for exploring and shopping on foot. The hotel is not far from the Medici Chapel, and then not far beyond that, an easy walk to the Duomo, Palazzo Vecchio, Santa Croce and the incomparable Vivoli's, etc. We walked everywhere in Florence and found it doable, except when we took the bus up to San Mineato al Monte (you must do that for the views and for the monks singing vespers--but here is a hint not in the guidebooks, don't go down into the crypt to hear vespers unless you plan to worship as well as listen. If you are there to simply listen, stay up on the main level of the sanctuary). Oh and by the way the Ristorante Michelangelo up on that hill has great views and good food at surprisingly low prices.But, just steps from the hotel is the real gem of a restaurant, called Enzo and Pietro√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√Æun by the same family since 1932. Go there the first night and chances are you will go there every night. One other food note, when you want to have a nice al fresco in town dinner with a townscape view, go to the restaurant that you will find to the left, if you face the Palazzo Vecchio and the copy of the David statue. We had a good dinner there (we had the famous Florentine steak and pasta) for very reasonable prices, and glasses filled with...ICE! Unlike the other restaurants in that Piazza which will charge you an arm and a leg just for a Coke Lite.Do comparison shop if you go to the marts around Santa Croce--we found some marvelous shoes and handbags and the prices do run from bargains to pricey. We went back to the shops with the bargains and were glad we did.Let the folks at the front desk make your museum reservations for you. You do want to see the David and you do want to go to see the Leondardos and the view of the Ponte Vecchio at the Uffizi. It is filled with wonders, but it is a maze to get out of...
