{"text":"FANTASTIC Such a lovely hotel! We stayed in the triple room (1) downstairs for 2 nights which was lovely. The bathroom was spotless and the room was really quiet at night. No road noise or noise from other guests as it's not really joined to any. Just across the coridor to the breakfast room (less than 10 steps), which was great for after we'd stuffed ourselves.Staff at the Luna and Simone are very friendly and will do anything to help and make your stay more enjoyable. Tea and coffee facilities in the room, also a fan and a safe. Towels are lovely and soft and clean. Extra pillows and blankets incase you're cold.Quiet street, but still very close to everything. 10 min walk to the underground (pimlico is probably slightly closer). Close to Victoria station and Coach park. I had a problem with my bed on the first night (spring had broken and poked out of the bottom of my bed) which was very quickly sorted out and the staff couldn't seem to do enough to help. Very friendly and very nice, they all seem to take pride in thier jobs which does make a real difference to the atmosphere of the hotel.Not a problem to leave your luggage behind the reception desk on the morning of your departure. We went off to Buckingham palace (20\/30 min walk) after breakfast and they had no problem looking afer our luggage until we were ready to catch our coach in the afternoon (just let them know a rough time that you'll be collecting them) Enjoyed my stay so much i'm going back in December with my Mom to celebrate her birthday :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":478,"mention":"Tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":475},{"endOffset":489,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":483},{"endOffset":758,"mention":"Victoria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Victoria_Bitter"],"startOffset":750},{"endOffset":1236,"mention":"palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":1230},{"endOffset":1236,"mention":"palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":1230}]}
