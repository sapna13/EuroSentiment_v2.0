{"text":"Wonderful hotel We stayed at the hotel from the 13th to the 18th of August. Check in was nice and easy and the cookies we were handed sent my son into raptures of delight. We were pleasently suprised by the size of the rooms and out of the bedroom window we and a lovely view of the Charles River. My son loved the flat panel tv in the lounge. I was tired when we got to the hotel and pulled back the sheets so I could have a lie down. I noticed one of the sheets had a stain on so I called housekeeping. They immediatly sent someone up to change the bed. I then recieved a call from Kalika who was the housekeeping manager. He asked if everything was now ok and offered us a free movie for our inconvienience. He also got our 2 nights parking fee waived. A little later we had a small box of chocolates also delivered to our room with a note of appology. The front desk staff were wonderful with our son. Popping his popcorn as we didn't have a microwave. Warming his leftover burrito from lunch and giving him a good supply of the warm cookies. The concierge was also very helpful as was the bellboy. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again. Even though it isn't in the centre of Boston the shuttle bus was very handy and Cambridge Central T station was only a 10 minute walk away. If you don't fancy eating in the hotel restaurant the is a Wholefood market just over the river which sells ready prepared meals.
