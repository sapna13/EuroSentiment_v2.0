{"text":"Maybe I'm just too sensitive? We stayed at the Bahia principe from Nov 1\/07-Nov 8\/07. I have been to Mexico, Cancun  Puerto Vallarta as well as Bahamas and Aruba. The Bahia Principe itselft was a nice hotel, a 5 star in the Dominican though, is not comparable to a 5 star elsewhere from what I could see. Very large hotel, which is good, but difficult to coordinate with a large group, as the week goes on you get used to the trolly's so its not so bad. Pool was very nice, Food was okay, not bad, not really that great, I would have to say average, the breakfast buffet was probably the best part, though they did run out of bacon if you go there later than 9pm. The beach was the best part about this vacation, it is definitley beautiful, soft white sand, not alot of shells and beautiful water. The only other complaint would be that communication is hard as most of the staff could not speak english, we taught our cleaning lady a few words, she was very thankful. You can't blame the staff as they always made the effort, I feel the hotel should spend a little money and give their staff some english lessons, somehow I think they would be grateful. That all being said, my main issue was not with the resort but with leaving the resort. If you are a sensitive person, I highly suggest not leaving the resort. The poverty in areas was hard to bear witness to, I know there is poverty all over the world, but I just cant relax and party when I know there are starving people and animals just ouside the resort. I took some comfort in knowing that the resort was providing jobs, but the whole week I just kept feeling helpless at not knowing how to help those people. Also, being a huge animal lover, even harder were the stray dogs, on the beach, by the market and all over town. If you are not an animal lover you many not even notice them, but for me it was heartbreaking. There is one beautiful female dog, blind in one eye who visits the beach by the Bahia, if you see her...she really likes chicken and if very friendly, but wont let you touch her as she is somewhat timid and afraid, but will take food  water from you. If you walk down the beach to the right of the boat (in the water) about 30 minutes down is a local market, there are also quite a few dogs and puppies down that way, the locals dont really seem to acknowldge them, however i did notice that the tourists (some kind hearted one's anyways) do feed them scraps. It is a beautiful island... but for me the poor shacks and destitute looking stray animals in the reality outside of the resort, took most of that beauty away. If I do go back to the Dominican Republic it will be to do something more active to help the people and the animals, not to sip daquiri's on the beach.
