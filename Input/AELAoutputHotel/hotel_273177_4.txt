{"text":"Not that bad! My partner booked a weekend in Amsterdam for my 30th and we stayed at the Nieuw Hotel Slotania in Amsterdam. The accommodation is basic, but clean and comfortable. We had a double room, with a TV (several English channels available - not that you want to waste time watching tv!). The hotel also had four computers which you can use to browse the internet and check emails. These are vey popular though, so you might want to jump on one before breakfast! (ie before the teens get up!)The hotel serves a continental breakfast of cereal, plus bread, jams, cold meat and boiled eggs.The downside is that the hotel is a little way from the town centre. (about 20 to 30 mins by tram or bus). The buses and trams do run every 10 minutes though. Your best bet is to get a travel pass for the duration of your stay so you can jump on and off trams and buses without worrying about getting tickets for each trip. These arent very expensive - works out about √ä√£¬¢4 a day. Another tip is to buy the I Amsterdam card as that includes an unlimited travel swipe card, plus free entry to 20 of the museums and two canal boat cruises.You can buy thiis here: [--] or at the tourist info at the airport.This costs from √à√\u2020√ü?3 for 24 hours, or √à√\u2020√ü?3 for 48 hoursOpposite the hotel are several shops, inlcuding an Aldi, where you can stock up on essentials. There is also a Febo right next to the hotel - one of those famous vending machine takeaway bars! I didnt try these though as Im vegetarian and wasnt sure what was meat free! ( all instrucitons in Dutch!) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":560,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":555}]}
