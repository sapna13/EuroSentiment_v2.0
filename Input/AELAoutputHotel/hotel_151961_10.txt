{"text":"Nice and Quaint I found this hotel on tripadvisor.com. We paid about 100.00 USD for it all together ( 2 of us).. let me say, i was really expecting something low class.. but it was really pretty. We experienced the local feel that we wanted to as my friend and i did not want to come to puerto rico and just stay at a hilton or mariott. I believe this place had 4 floors.. and was supposed to have a rooftop bar\/restraunt.. but it was closed when we stayed there. We just gof off the royal carribean cruise, and stopped by our hotel to see if the room was ready @ 9am.. little did we know that check in was at 3. Completely fatigued out, we decided that we would just walk around old san juan for a few hours as the hotel is litereally center city (which is an amazing thing btw). We went out for some coffee and came back to rest in about 1\/2 an hour.. the owner was so accomodating, he asked for a houskeeper to clear and clean a room.. he then changed our room number and let us settle in early! There is a computer linked with internet in the lobby, which we had to wait a few minutes to use. Overall the hotel is very cute, the room comes with a book of wise sayings. i believe its written by a local poet... its kinda nice. Hotel milano did not seem like a hotel at all.. room and bathroom were spacious, seemed like home. I will recommend it every time !
