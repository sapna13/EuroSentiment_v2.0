{"text":"The Good\/The Bad at Wyndham Rio Mar We just returned tonight ( Jan. 5th) from an 8 day stay with our older kids ( two 20-year-olds, one 17-year-old) from the Wyndham Rio Mar.We joined Wyndham Rewards, and were upgraded to two ocean front rooms which were very spacious, with extremely comfortable beds, small flat screen TVS, and average size bathrooms that thankfully, unlike other Caribbean resorts, never ran out of hot water for the shower.The hotel is on the Atlantic side of Puerto Rico, so the water is not the calm blue\/green of the Caribbean. In some ways, that was a plus, since there were gigantic waves to play in, although we all had to be careful of a considerable undertow.The beach itself is just OK. It's nearly two miles long, so good for a jog back and forth, but some days , especially one end of it was littered with cigarette butts and plastic cups.Hotel food was mediocre to poor, except for the Italian restaurant PALIO, and even that didn't compare favorably to the most basic pizzeria in New York. Prices were high for all food except the hot dog\/hamburger grill set up near the pool for lunch.Luckily, we rented a car, because the hotel is in a gated community that is pretty isolated. We had dinner three nights in a row at LA PARILLA, a fantastic restaurant at one of the shacks just in front of Loquillo Beach. However, service was S L O W. We waited over an hour for a table, then about another hour or so for our food to arrive. There is great golf, nice tennis courts, a spa, and a decent workout room which fills up fast most mornings (!) on site.WOuld I recommend this place? Yes for a corporate exec or someone looking for an easy long weekend getaway.( The hotel is a quick 45 min. drive from the San Juan airport.) No, to a family who wants a more active, less isolated vacation, although the rain forest ( EL Junque) is only about a ten minute drive from the hotel.
