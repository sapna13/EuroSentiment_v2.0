{"text":"Desert Ridge- Convention Hell My wife and I wanted to treat our senior in high school with a special experience for Spring Break so we booked rooms at the JW Desert Ridge for post Easter. We had been there before so we thought we knew what to expect. The biggest problem we had was the hotel was overrun with convention folks. Hot tubs,pool decks,all day set ups were what we experienced for 2 of the 4 days we were there. Rooms arenothing special and neither is service or food at the pool. Slow and expensive would be fair to say. When I expressed this feedback to a senior manager of the property I was told that they cater to businesstravelers not family travel..The comments were not in line with the caring environment of the empolyees who work hard to be nice. I was left to feel that I was not important to the overall success of the operation. This is direct conflict with Mr Marriott's book and philosophies and I found that odd enough that I had to express it in this format. We wont go back to this property and I was planning to but a time share across the street for 2 week in prime time..but no reason to now that I know they focus their efforts in a way that I am not comfortable with. I am not naive to think business travel is not important to any hotel's livlehood...but if I want to be around drunk conventioners when I am with my family..I would book a lessor expensive place.
