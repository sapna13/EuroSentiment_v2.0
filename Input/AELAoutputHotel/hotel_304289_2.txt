{"text":"Amazing service for a chain hotel After nine nights at the Hilton Tokyo this past September, I can say this: It's got the best service I've ever had a Hilton.The hotel is about two to three hours from Narita Airport by bus, depending on traffic, which is the easiest and cheapest way to get there. Once you get there, the entire city of Tokyo is easily accessible to you. It's less than 15 minutes to walk to Shinjuku station where you can pick up the JR or take the subway to any of the wonders Tokyo has to offer. The hotel had a lot to offer for a city hotel. Rooms were good sized, which was nice to see after hearing horror stories about Tokyo hotels. The gym was large and clean and the staff was always ready with complimentary bottled water or towels. There were tennis courts, but they were fully booked during my stay. Umbrellas were available to guests, free of charge and taxis were plentiful. One of the nice things about the area the hotel is in, is that there is little street traffic. It's a very easy five minute walk to several 7-11 type stores (and two McDonalds if you just couldn't make it another day without a big mac). Insider tip: you can walk almost the entire distance between the Shinjuku station and the hotel underground by follwing the signs to the Tokyo government building, which was great for chilly days.The breakfast buffet, though expensive, was a good way to start the day. It had something for everyone from American standards like pancakes, to crepes, to simple Japanese dishes. On a less enthusiastic note, the hotel bar was deserted and too pricey for what it offered. There was a Belgian place called Frigo a few blocks south west that got most of our business.I'll close with an example of how good the service was. During my stay, I experienced a small earthquake one morning in my room. The hotel front desk actually apologized for the earthquake when I inquired about it later that day. You don't get that kind customer service at Hiltons in New York or London!
