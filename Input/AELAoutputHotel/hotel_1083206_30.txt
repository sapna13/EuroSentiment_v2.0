{"text":"Barcelo Raval - a very cool hotel! I have only never felt moved to write a review before in my life, as although I have experienced great (and very bad!) service and standards it has never been a surprise. However I want to write this to inform other travellers about this amazing gem of a hotel because a) it is brand new and no reviews or pictures exist and I had to take a gamble on whether to go for it or not for my girlfiend's surpise birthday; and b) because we had such a great time we want to thank the hotel by recommending it to everyone!(Just to put into context for readers - we are a couple in our late twenties, and have stayed in the top hotels of Dubai, Miami and Singapore, yet also the more basic chain hotels of Europe so have a wide experience of standards to refer against).Hotel Barcelo Raval is a really cool, chic design\/boutique hotel. From the moment you arrive outside and see its ergonomic design you know this will be a different experience. The lobby is ultra modern in styling with really interesting features (such as the life size horse that is a lamp), cool furniture items dispersed around apple mac flat screens for free online web access, and a minimalist bar area. The staff were fantastic in their welcome, all with very good English and we were soon checked in and on our way to the room. The hotel floors are dark with no natural light, but this accentuates things such as the fact no doors have room numbers - these are light in neon on the floor in the carpet instead. Sensor lights turn on as you approach your door and the electronic door key is not inserted into any slot, instead just waved over the sensor for the door to open.Inside the room is an all in one open plan design (it's not huge, but more than adequate) - with white bed and floor with stark bright colour and retro wallpaper and curtains. The shower cube is quite central and glass on both sides so you can see right in from the bed (fantastic for couples, not sure how it would work if you were travelling with a mate!). Some styling features that symbolise the room: there is no drain plug in the shower, the water trickles away around the square edge of the shower room; the toilet is hidden behind a mirror door that is accessed by sliding along and closing the wardrobe, ipod dock, flat screen tv, espresso machine, low level lighting for night-time, and electronic control panel for all lighting, curtains, etc....the list is very long!Another great feature is the rooftop floor - take a trip up there and you will get a panoramic view of the city as you walk all around the building and there are telescopes for your use too. The rooftop pool is small, not really for swimming in, more to dip in while sipping cocktails but it was not that warm for us to try. We wrapped up and went up at night, took a bottle of champagne with us and looked out at Barcelona under the stars sitting by the neon lit pool area. Amazing!We were one of the first guests to stay there - it only officially opened around the 24th September - yet everything went very very smooth. The hotel is only 5 mins walk to La Ramblas, and the square it is in has some very nice restaurants and bars and was quite lively on Friday night. We really loved the hotel and it really suits 'younger travellers', especially couples on a short city break. If you go to Barcelona you really should not be spending most of your time in the hotel room - but if you do, then I cannot imagine a better one than at Hotel Barcelo Raval!
