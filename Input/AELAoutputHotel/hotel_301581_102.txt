{"text":"We were so looking forward to this trip however ...... We love Singapore and visit at least once a year.There is no doubt that this is an above average hotel in a great position however customer service really let this hotel down.I have watched with interest the steady flow of positive reviews and have given a lot of thought as to why our experience was so different. I think the length of our stay was the contributing factor.We stayed for longer than the average guest,instead of the usual 2 or 3 nights we were booked in for nearly 3 weeks. After the first few nights the cracks began to show.We upgraded to the executive package which meant we could have breakfast and evening drinks\/snacks in the Executive Club.Despite staying for nearly 21 nights not one staff member remembered our name or indeed used it while we were in the club. We were mostly ignored in the club and attended to our own drinks whilst watching the manager and other staff focus all of their attention on other guests (regulars of the hotel).The reception staff could be best described as surly and at times everything seemed too much trouble. Even when enquiring about a service listed in the in room brochure, staff would stare blankly and claim they did not know what you were talking about.On the positive side:The rooms are hard to match in a hotel of this price bracket in Singapore. The room was very well appointed. The bathroom was a delight and included a rain drop shower which was a novelty. We also enjoyed the in room coffee machine and CD player.The view was spectacular and the location is so central you could almost ignore the customer service problems if you are staying a short period of time.The pool has a limited number of deck chairs and it can be hard to secure one during the busier periods of the day. The pool facilites are shared with the Swiss Hotel next door, a large number of airline staff stay at this property and spend a lot of time at the pool. My advice is to arrive early and enjoy the pool before heading off to the shops etc which tend to open at 10 or 11 am.Unfortunately the poor customer service extends to the Pool Bar staff and those working in the health centre.If you are staying less than a week, want a great room with a great view, close to all Singapore has to offer this is the hotel for you .....just don't expect the customer service to meet or exceed your expectations. If you intend to be out and about a lot this hotel probably isn't worth the extra money as there are many hotels with good views and central locations nearby.So overall I agree the property itself is great it is just so disappointing that the service was so bad I have been prompted to write this review and that we did not enjoy this trip as much as my other annual trips to this great city.
