{"text":"Great Location - Pricey Breakfast I have just landed back in the UK today from a fantastic week trip to Barcelona which is VERY hot right now!!! The hotel is very well located and is in easy walking distance from many many places to visit. The jacuzzi and pool are very small down in the basement, you are given slippers and a bathrobe in your room to wear to these facilities which are clean and have a shower and toilets.The room was smaller than expected and at the front of the hotel (where the twin rooms are - doubles at the back). The breakfast is very pricey and the mini bar prices will frighten most people - 3 euro's for a small packet of crisps!!! 3.50 for a can of coke and the alcohol is even pricier!! Do what we did, go to the supermarket on La Ramblas instead you get much more for your money. I was disappointed not to have tea\/coffee making facilities in the room (very annoying because you are forced to pay their prices if you want these hot drinks) but the water is free (2 bottles of still, 2 fizzy on a daily basis). There is very little storage space and I had to fight every day with the sliding wardrobe doors - I could hear the people in the next room doing the same thing!! You do get an electronic safe which is easy to use. The TV has BBC World News and CNN for English guests but all other channels are for french, italian and spanish languages. It was clean and the air con was a god send in the boiling heat but don't expect to be able to hear anyone talking if the door to the very tiny balcony is open, the traffic noise is loud but it's ok when the door is shut. There is no furniture on your balcony (too tiny a space). We didn't have a table in the room either so when we ordered room service there was nowhere to eat it from but the bed. Personally I would rate this hotel 3star plus (and I'm no snob!), it just didn't have the luxury the website glossy pictures portrayed. All in all it was comfortbale and clean and well located for our trip but I would not return to this hotel. If you book from their own website you will get half price breakfast but to be honest you'd be better off getting out onto the numerous street cafes, they are everywhere and a good way to enjoy the weather and people watch. The Ramblas is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel and NOT TO BE MISSED!!
