{"text":"Magnificent Hotel - 5 Stars My wife and I visited the Sofitel in NY for four nights in Jan '07. We booked this hotel based on the reviews on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed. This is a magnificent hotel. When you walk through the front doors you are immediately taken aback by the beautiful and spacious lobby. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and efficient. Our room was on the 18th floor and was superb. It is definitely worth paying a little extra for a deluxe room. The room was very tastefully decorated and very comfortable. The marble bathroom was spacious with an excellent large walk in shower. The bed was comfortable and warm (for the NY January weather). The concierge was very helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations etc. The doormen were very attentive and helpful. Overall the staff were extremely friendly and always on hand to help.Not only is this an excellent hotel but it's location is superb. The hotel is on 44th street between 5th and 6th avenue. It is about a 2 min walk to 5th avenue shops. The hotel is an excellent base from which to get around. Madison Square Garden, Broadway, Empire State Building and Port Authority Bus Station are all within walking distance.Rather than have breakfast at the hotel, we had breakfast at the Red Flame Diner on 44th. (Just take a right on leaving the hotel, the diner is on your right). It can be very busy but the service is great and the breakfast menu is vast. Overall this is a true gem of hotel and deserves to be the No.1 New York hotel on Tripadvisor. We would both recommend this hotel to anyone planning a break in the Big Apple. ","annotations":[]}
