{"text":"Fantastic quality and service in everything My husband, who is hard to please, thought this was possibly the best hotel he had ever stayed in.The lobby is pretty typical posh hotel of the low, dark and shiny variety. And the suite (with great views) was perhaps what one would expect - though if it didn't immediately overwhelm, neither did it disappoint.But from there, things just got better. The service was absolutely immaculate - and the quality was not only superb, but consistent. Loved the black silk 'loungey' dressing gowns as well as the usual bathroom towelling ones. The design of everything - from the red slippers to the shoe horn was fantastic. Everything worked perfectly and had clearly been thought through - computer set ups with every kind of (neatly labelled and bagged) lead provided, super comfy beds and linen with huge choice of pillows ... as many Hermes bathroom bits as you could possibly use, topped up every time we left the room,... decent range of satellite channels on huge flat screen tvs... shoe shine service that left even 'comfy shoes' gleaming only minutes after they were left out. We looked at and decided against the obviously popular with the locals brunch area - but the cafe and adjoining chocolate\/cake\/savouries shop were fantastic. Porridge was brilliant as were tarts and quiches. The Cantonese restaurant on the top floor was high quality with a great wine list. And the Shangai pedicure speciality is not to be missed. The concierge desk were brilliant - and the location is really central (and straight into the malls when it rains).Had it been hotter we may have missed an outdoor swimming pool. But we were genuinely sad to move on after our 4 day stay. (Though we did purchase the silk dressing gowns!) Many thanks for a hotel that consistently exceeded service expectation.
