{"text":"A deluxe business hotel. Not a luxury one. A disappointement I cannot agree more with PeteLondon. This Oriental is just ok. An upscale business hotel but defenitly not a 5 stars Mandarin Oriental hotel. I spent 4 nights there in a harbour view Club room after staying at the Landmark MO in Hong Kong and i noticed the difference right when check in. Lots of problems in the room. The wardrobe doors would not close and never been repaired. Only one plug was working. The same 2 apples and 2 oranges in a plate during the whole stay were never changed. No personal touches or special attentions. The SPA is rather small, though they have very good traitments. No steam room or sauna. Rather basic, small and old fitness center. Very good club lounge with high quality drinks and food. Very helping club level staff. I didn't try the restaurants and bars of the hotel.The club level is an excellent value, with free breakfast, tea, soft drinks and evening champagne with canap√ã√\u2022√ñs. But beware, the beautiful lounges is becoming crowdy and noisy when at the free alcohol time.I shall go back to the Oriental bearing in mind i won't have to ask for exceptional service and true luxury. I liked the connexion to the Marina Bay mall which is connecting to Raffles city and the subway. After expressing many times my disappointements regarding the room and the service i was offered a bottle of wine and a limo transfer to the airport. Fair enough!
