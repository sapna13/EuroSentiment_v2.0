{"text":"Nice hotel in a quiet residential area, far from city center: not for tourists I recently stayed at the Bilderberg Garden Hotel for 2 nights at the beginning of a long weekend in Holland and Belgium. As a Dutch-tourism-rated 5 star hotel, we expected a lot, but were told later that the Dutch star ratings are based on price more than services and amenities. It is a nice hotel, but if you are expecting a 5-star experience, look elsewhere--it is not posh by any means and is probably a 3 star in all honesty. Additionally, we found the distance a little too far from the city center for our liking. The hotel is nice-enough, but does not really shine in any area nor does it endear itself to its guests. As we were driven to the front door, we were taken aback by the construction along the entire front of the hotel--it did not look inviting. (Hopefully, the construction will be finished for future guests as it was neither attractive nor especially quiet.However, upon entering we found a Dutch-modern design, with inviting fresh flower arrangements throughout. Beyond the reception is a lobby bar with a cozy fireplace. We were fortunate enough to observe the pre-Christmas flowers arrangements and the Christmas themed arrangements: mid-stay, the numerous white rose arrangements were changed to red roses, and beautiful greenery and Christmas trees were on display.Our room, as the hotel, was Dutch-modern by design: stark, with lots of dark-wood paneling and simple dark wood built-ins and small leather furniture. The bedding was sleek, but the sheets were rough to the touch. Additionally, there was a problem with the TV, as it tended to turn off or become unusable at times, and the luggage holder collapsed upon first use.There are thoughtful touches, such as shoe-shine machines on each floor, in-room coffee service with a choice of coffees and teas, and a specific style of glass\/mug for each of the beers\/spirits in the mini-bar. But there are negatives, such as the below-average shower and water pressure (heat equalization), no shower curtain, and smallish bathroom. The service was polite, but neither polished nor especially helpful. The hotel is located in a quiet and rather upscale residential area, but the lack of lighting on the surrounding sidewalks at night may pose a problem for some.Finally, this hotel is not convenient to any tourist areas and we noticed that it was heavily tilted towards a business clientele. The tram stop is only about a 5 minute walk away, but the additional 5 minute tram ride to the museum quarter or the 10 minute ride to the Dam area was not especially convenient and made it hard to pop-in to the hotel to freshen-up during the day, especially in the rain common to the region this time of year. (The hotel was represented to be convenient to the city center, which we definitely did not agree). In summary, this is a nice hotel, but if you are looking for an above average upscale hotel experience, in service, amenities, quality and location, look elsewhere.
