{"text":"Great Hotel, Great Location I had read recommendations in Cruise Critic, and also the reviews on this site. The reviews were mixed and had to say had us a bit worried about our 3 day stay before we went on a cruise. We arrived Fri and stayed till Sun afternoon! We had a great time! The personnel at the hotel were great and suggested several different restaurants for us to get the feel of the country. Our room was on the 8th floor. I recommend that you join Starwood after booking a room there, as were put on a member No Smoking floor. We had requested a no smoking room and partial harbor view! We had a full harbor view-the view was fabulous. We also had an elevator, never a long wait, in fact most of the time we were the only people in them. We had the continental breakfast (buffet) which was $12., and if you wanted the full breakfast $21.95, which included hot meats, eggs, custom omelets, etc. Our room was very clean and so was our large bathroom. The only little part of a downside, the room had a slightly musty smell, and an edge of the ceiling at the corner plaster had come down by french doors that opened to the small balcony!The hotel itself is great, and what a location! We walked all evening on Friday and never was far from the hotel. We felt very safe. On Saturday, we walked to the toursit office, and took the free trolley to Old San Juan city, and then to Fort Morro. We had a very enjoyable time. Our Travel agent got the room about 5 months in advance for $135\/night, for a partial harbor view! We feel that was truely a bargain. We had friends staying in the Caribe Hilton, they said they had a great room, but were close to nothing, and constantly had to take a cab to get anywhere! ","annotations":[]}
