{"text":"The Hotel Monge is the perfect\/inexpensive place to stay in Paris! I just got back from a 5 day\/4 night stay at the Hotel Monge with my 21 year old daughter and loved it! It was in a wonderful location;close walk to many places, between two metro stops and was only a 42 euro cab ride from CDG. Our room was a corner room over looking the Rue Monge(somewhat noisy at night with windows open) but fun to look out . The room was quite large and very clean-appeared to be recently updated. The bathroom was spotless and larger than others have complained about on this forum. The beds were quite comfortable and had enough blankets for my daughter who is ALWAYS cold. It had a armoire closet,minibar fridge and cable TV.(The only thing that I can fault this hotel about was the towels-coarse and needed to be replaced.)The staff were delightful too. We did take the breakfast downstairs twice for 6.50 euros apiece to save us time a couple mornings and it was quite sufficient. It included a big pot of coffee (about 3 cups!!)and hot milk for each of us,various cheeses,jams and butter with a bread basket along with a yoghurt. After spending 3.50 for one coffee down the street, my daughter and I decided that for our coffee needs-this was easier and more convenient. I fly to Paris often for my job and think that this hotel is much more convenient to great restaurants and shops than the two 4 star hotels that my company puts me in for my crew layovers.We paid 98 euros for two a night and it was really a great place to enjoy Paris. You won't be disappointed!
