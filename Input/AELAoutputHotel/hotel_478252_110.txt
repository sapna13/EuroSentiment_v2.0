{"text":"not really a 5 star experience Pluses - look of the resort, pool areas. The rest is very questionable. Service is very bad, even rude at times (restaurant La Gourmet was the worst experience in all categories - never go there). Our check-in lasted almost 2 hours, full of mistakes and strange talks. Exhausting! It is true - rooms are musty and our clothes smelled bad even after few washes. Room service was weird - they never got how many towels should be left in the room for 3 people. Sometimes we would have 1, sometimes none, sometimes only bath and none hand, but never all. Even worse - towels were sometimes old, dirty, torn! It was an everyday chase after cleaning person. If you need something (any kind of service) be patient! '5 minutas' means an hour or two. In the restaurants service was almost non - existent. They wouldn't bring drinks, they would grab your plate before you had a chance to eat, there were no tea or coffee during lunch and dinner. At the bar we noticed some interesting rule - they ignore women and respond much faster to men. And don't even attempt to use their tennis courts -they look 20 years old and very slippery, not to mention cracks and holes. Gym is small but has most of what you might need. Spa is OK but message was mediocre and the whole lay-out is not very relaxing. My friend and I booked separate treatments in advance but then to our surprise discovered that they put us in one room because they didn't have empty ones! After I refused to share and waited for 10 min. the second room was found but they didn't act happy and the treatment was cut short. Honestly, that was not at all what I expected from a 5 star place (and I travel a lot). Food was better in quality and selection in a lobby restaurant only. People who ate meat complained it was hard to chew. Fish I ate was good only on a few occasions. But that could be forgiven if the service was at least somewhat present. Overall impression was that they really were not happy to see us there, didn't bother to make things more pleasant and sometimes just ignored English. Will never go back and advised my friends against going there too. We had 9 people in our group and all had similar feelings.
