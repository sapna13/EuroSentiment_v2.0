{"text":"Great little hotel on the Arno River; excellent location We were pleasantly surprised with the Hotel Degli Orafi in Florence. Because the dollar was so weak, we passed on the most expensive hotels and selected the Degli Orafi based on a more reasonable price and good reviews. We're really glad we did. It's a very nice hotel.The location is perfect, right next to the Ponte Vecchio, the River Arno, the Uffizi Museum, the main city plaza, and restaurants, shopping, etc. It was an easy walk to anything we wanted to do. Being right on the river, we had expected a great view as well, but due to the overhead walking area of the Ponte Vecchio, we could only see part of the river. However, the hotel has a roof deck restaurant\/bar with fabulous views in several directions, including toward the sunset. The roof restaurant has great lunches, snacks and good wine, etc., with friendly bartender\/waiters. We used it many times during our stay. It was a great spot to hang out. The buffet breakfast that came with our room was really good---large tables with lots of food\/options, great cappucino, good service. The scrambled eggs were delicious! Our room was large with a sitting area and big windows. It's not the Grand, but it was very nice, clean, and comfortable. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was large enough for both of us---though the shower was quite small. There was a large but cozy library a couple doors from our room with sofas and chairs and computers to use for the internet. Internet access was available in the room, but we had trouble accessing it with our laptop. The front desk staff also acted as concierge staff and were very helpful---some of them more than others---but all were quite friendly. The elevators were slow and adding a couple minutes to the schedule for elevator waiting time just became part of the routine. At the end of the stay, we both got Degli Orafi t-shirts which are really quite nice. We would definitely stay there again.
