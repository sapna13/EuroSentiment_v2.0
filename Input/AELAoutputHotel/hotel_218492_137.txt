{"text":"Beautiful Resort, Ugly Service Let me preface this review by saying that we won this trip in a contest. We would never choose an all-inclusive type of resort because we value quality over quantity. The front desk service was extremely inept. We were forced to wear these ridiculous yellow wrist bands for the entire week. When I asked why we had to wear them, Edgar, the front desk clerk, asked us if we wanted to eat or not. How tacky and rude. Edgar continued to be rude to us throughout our entire stay. The maid service was deplorable. At Grand Oasis, the maids must not follow the rule that towels that are hanging up should be left alone and towels that are on the floor should be taken away. We were constantly without towels. The maid removed all our towels (clean and dirty) every morning, leaving us with none until next morning. We had to beg the front desk for clean towels every day. By the third day, I was forced to lock up clean towels in my suitcase so they would not be taken away. Our safe did not work, so we were forced to lock our valuables in a suitcase. The resort is loud. There is a constant, steady stream of techno music piped throughout the lobby, all common areas, pools, restaurants, bars, bathrooms, even on the beach. The music is loud and grates on the nerves after a while. The watersports activity center was by far the worst aspect of this resort. Rude, apathetic staff ruined our snorkling trip. We paid 40 dollars US to go snorkling about a half mile off-shore. We asked about snorkling gear before we got on the boat. Monica, who worked at the watersports building, dismissively waved her hand toward the boat, indicating that gear was available once we boarded. There was no gear. We asked about the gear again when we reached the dive boat, and got a no English response. We were stranded on the boat with no gear. The boat operator found a dirty mask laying on the bottom of the boat and offered it to me. Um, no thanks. We asked for a refund and were met with attitude instead. Finally, the manager gave us our money back, but only after 20 minutes of haggling. No apologies were given for our wasted time. We were constantly bothered by Vacation Club reps on the resort, trying to get us to buy a vacation club through Oasis Resorts. We were hounded by these Vacation Club reps every. single. day. They are staked out all around the pools and outside every restaurant. A simple no, thanks was not enough. They even insulted us after we told them we were not interested for the last time by telling we were cheapskates for not snapping up such a good offer. Bottom line is this: go to Grand Oasis Punta Cana if you want to be treated poorly by apathetic, unfriendly staff. I was happy to leave that place.
