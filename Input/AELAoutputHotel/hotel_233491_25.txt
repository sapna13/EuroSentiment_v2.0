{"text":"What a hidden gem! I booked through Thomsons City Breaks with the help of TA. The hotel ticked all our boxes, small authentic and away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre.Check in was effortless. We were given a map and the hotel clearly marked on it, together with directions to the Accademia, Duomo and markets. Our room was on the 4th Floor, but unfortunately had a view of the fire escape - no problem! The whole city is full of views and you can't see them when you sleep!The room was stuffed with original features, a majolica tiled floor, a very old painted wardrobe and an antique desk. The bed dominated the room. This was the most comfortable hotel bed that we have ever slept in (better than some 5 star hotels we have been to!). There was a well stocked mini bar\/fridge, a tv and air con in the room (much needed as it reached 92 degrees while we were there!!) The bathroom was huge! A bidet, bath and shower, together with the usual loo. There was a basket full of hotel branded toiletries. An unusual feature for me (although it may be normal for Italy) was rather than have fluffy hand and face towel, they were linen!The staff always smiled and greeted us, no matter what time of day we saw them.The public areas were beautiful, with many more original features, such as painted ceilings and parquet flooring. The breakfast room has very pretty wall paintings of floral scenes and opened out onto a quiet terrace, where you could have breakfast or a quiet drink in the evening.Breakfast was a cold selection of rolls, bread, croissants and cake, with cheese and cold cuts. There was also fresh juices available together with milk, coffee and tea. 3 types of cereal were served, together with a variety of flavoured yoghurts, fruit salad and fresh fruit. There was so much choice!The hotel is said by come on these boards to be 'out of the way' - it is not! It is 2 minutes to the mercato centrale by walking left out of the hotel and continuing along Via San Gallo and heading straight until you get to San Lorenzo. Take a left and wander through the colourful stalls around San Lorenzo on your way to the market. Alternatively, if you head straight on when you get to San Lorenzo you will shortly get to the Duomo. Nothing is too far in Florence! I managed, even with a broken bone in my foot!For a pre-dinner drink try the 'pub' 2 doors along. They serve food and a drink for 7.50 euros from 7.30 til 9.30. They also do great cocktails for 6 euros. I can personally recommend the Mojitos!Any questions - just ask ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1549,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1544},{"endOffset":1561,"mention":"croissants","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Croissant"],"startOffset":1551},{"endOffset":1570,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1566},{"endOffset":1570,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1566},{"endOffset":1597,"mention":"cold cuts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cold_cut"],"startOffset":1588},{"endOffset":1663,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1657},{"endOffset":1671,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1668},{"endOffset":1762,"mention":"fruit salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fruit_salad"],"startOffset":1751}]}
