{"text":"Not bad First the bad stuff: our shower had unacceptably bad water pressure.Like, barely dripping out. Unacceptable. Although for the rest of my review, I will generally give this place a good review, I cannot recommend a place that does not have its plumbing in order. It is an inexpensive place, but they are ranked a five star resort, so they should not have any showers like this. Therefore I must say, unless you get some sort of guarantee regarding water pressure in your room, do not book a stay here.My comments may not sound like I'm giving the place a glowing review.But we had a great time here. Keep in mind, despite the so-so nature of some of my comments, this place was CHEAP. US$1500 pp for all-inclusive INCLUDING AIRFARE! You just can't complain with prices that low (except about water pressure). We didn't mind paying an additional $200 (for a $1700 total) for the premium club package.We had the premium (Platinum) option. This allowed us use of a pleasant clubhouse. Too many kids were allowed to use the computers--this should stop. It was very handy to have our own private bar in the clubhouse--no lines! Also, I believe the Platinum club rooms are closest to the beach. We had a dream-worthy view of the ocean from our terrace. A few other perks, but the closeness to the beach, the clubhouse, and also private check-in were what made the Platinum package worth it.The grounds were nice and well maintained. The beach, being on the Bavaro section of P.C., was of course phenomenal. Our room was nice and clean. The lobby was a great place to hang out. I would have hung out there more, but we were in the complete opposite end of the resort.The staff was, for the most part, OK. Not super-friendly, but not rude certainly. There were of course many exceptions--several bartenders and other staff people were truly friendly. But, overall, I was not wowed by friendliness. To be clear: no one was unfriendly, just not exactly exuberant. Food was edible, and that is about all I can say about it. Very odd: in the buffets, the food was almost never hot. They don't know how touse sterno or something. Alcohol was watered down. Wine was very thin. The ala carte restaurants were just slightly better. Service was third world, to put it kindly (again, there were some very friendly exceptions). The premium restaurant (Licey, I think), where you are allowed to eat one night, was many many steps above the rest of the resort. Also, the Dominican restaurant in the Caribe Club Princess (just up the beach), which you can also go to, was much better than the international restaurants at the Bavaro Princess. For breakfast and lunch, the buffet at the restaurant adjacent to thelobby was a little better than the one close to the beach.The pool was quite large and nicely designed, although certainly not a place for meditation (lots of loud aerobics and other stuff going on there). It was nice to go from the beach to the pool, or vice versa.
