{"text":"Peacs and tranqullity Having just completed a 12 Day Cruise from Hong Kong To Singapore visiting Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, it is always a comedown leaving the comforts of the luxury ship and checking into a hotel! To soften the effects I booked an Executive (Club) room for the 3 nights at the Orchard Hotel before returning to Dublin. Yes, the three nights cost another √à√\u2020√ü?50 above the rack rate but what you got was worth every penny.Checkin is on the Executive Floor and, by luck, a room was ready for us when we arrived... at 8 am in the morning. Having the Room so early enabled us to get a few hours sleep before seeing the sights of Singapore. The Rooms on the Executive floor live up to everything the Hotel website states and the colour co-ordination is totally peaceful and relaxing being a mix of Black, Blues and Red. The Breakfasts were delicious and served in the Executive lounge as was lunch bites, afternoon snacks and evening hot and cold hors d'oeuvres. Between 6 and 8 pm any drink you like was there for the asking, free including top-ups . The Service was outstanding and the Staff could not do more for you if they tried.On the last night we tried the Buffet in the Cafe on the Ground floor( don't be put off by the name as it is really a Restaurant). WOW, from Snow-Crab to fine Fillet roast and 36 other choices in-between together with 14 different sweets to finish....this was some meal to end our Holiday. The buffet only costs √à√\u2020√ü?0 for 2 including Service charge. I have stayed in many Hotels in the past but this has to be one of the most relaxing and tranquill ones. I will return to the Orchard if only for this.........rarely found elsewhere.
