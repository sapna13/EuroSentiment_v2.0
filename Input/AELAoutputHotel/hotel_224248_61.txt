{"text":"Very nice hotel! My husband and I stayed here for one night after we returned from a cruise. Overall it was a great experience! To my knowledge, it is not near anything remotely touristy, so don't stay here if you plan to sight-see. We chose this hotel for its proximity to the airport, to make our journey home less complicated. We made a good choice! A complimentary airport shuttle leaves the lobby every half-hour on thenose. The front desk staff were very friendly and very accomodating.Check-in time is 3:00 PM, but they let us into our room at 10:30 AM when we arrived exhausted from a week of cruising! The surrounding area is typical for an airport hotel. There are some 24-hour drugstores, a grocery store, many fast food places and a few sit-down restaurants. Like most other Tripadvisor users reported, the front desk highly recommended Casa Juan, a nearby Cuban restaurant. We promptly avoided it after reading what others have had to say about it! There is heavy vehicle traffic but not a lot of pedestrian traffic - I felt quite safe, actually. The hotel requires you to swipe your room key in the elevator to access any guestroom floors - also a nice safety feature. The free breakfast features a mix of hot and cold items - above avearge for a free hotel breakfast, in my opinion. Our room was very nice - the bed was extremely comfortable, the room and bathroom were clean and spacious, and even though we could see planes landing and taking off outside our window, we heard absolutely no outside noise while trying to sleep. While we didn't get a chance to use it, there is an outdoor pool and hot tub area that looked quite inviting. I highly recommend this hotel - I can see why it is ranked #1 in its area!
