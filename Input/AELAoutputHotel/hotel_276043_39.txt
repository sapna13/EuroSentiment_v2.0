{"text":"Good Hotel - Fantastic Location - Super City! I have to say, I really enjoyed my stay here. The main advantage is the fantastic location, hard to beat Right next door to Potzdamer Platz and its U-Banh\/S-Bahn station. A few hundred meters north is the Reichstag and the Brandenburger Tor, and within walking distance of the fantastic shopping centre of the Ku'damm (about 3km in distance, although the U-Bahn will get your there quicker - just 6 stops on the U2 line). There are some great moderately priced restaurants nearby, and of course the Sony Centre is practically next door.The U2 U-Bahn line that ruins through Potsdamer Platz is very useful, and links the city's two centres along an axis from AlexanderPlatz, through south part of the historic centre, and on to the Ku'damm (station at Zoo Gardens). A day ticket is very cheap and well worth the money as it covers both U-Bahn and S-Bahn, which is a very efficient, safe and clean mode of transport in Berlin. For gay travellers, the gay area around Nollendorfplatz is less than 2km away from this hotel, and a nice walk (or if you're lazy , 4 stops on the U2 U-Bahn Line from Potsdamer Platz).The hotel rooms themselves were spacious (by European standards) and nicely decorated. Some great views from the rooms, especially from the top floor where the executive lunge is. Access to the executive lounge was part of a paid upgrade to our room, and is worth it if you intend to use the hotel as a regular stop off during your stay. Access to the lounge included internet access, breakfast and various drinks\/snacks throughout the day.The restaurant attached to the hotel, called the Midtown Grill, is superb . A little pricey by German standards, but the service and the food is excellent. The most impressive touch is a complementary flaming fondue of marshmallows with chocolate which arrives with your bill, which is not only fun, it made me wish I hadn't filled up on dessert before hand!On the down side, the pool in the leisure facilities is a little on small side... don't expect to be doing Olympic training here, its nothing morer than an oversized bath. In addition to the pool there are showers and a sauna, but that's about it. Not very impressive in all.Also, the total has a policy of doing something rather annoying with your credit card: they block large amounts of cash on your credit card BEFORE you check out. A receptionist told me this is standard policy in German Hotels, although I have never before seen this in any German hotel previously, and I was told it was to ensure payment of the room. Not a very trusting and welcoming approach to their customers. However, the amount they reserved on my credit card was way in excess of the total bill amount, to which couldn't get a straight answer from the hotel staff as to why this was the case, or any enthusiasm to remedy this situation. When I checked out, of course all that was taken out of the card was the agreed amount, but the massive amount reserved (over 3,500 Euro over a one week period!) almost made my credit card useless on the holiday. Be warned about this... make sure you have a big enough credit limit before using this hotel.On Berlin in general: (1) On a safety note, just don't find yourself wandering around the Eastern suburbs of Berlin, day or night... but then again, you should have no business to bring you there in the first place.(2) Don't forget to validate your ticket in the U-Bahn stations, look for the yellow box, its not always easy to find.(3) Germans are very law abiding, don't cross the road until the green man shows, even if your are the only person on the entire street.(4) If you have only time for one museum to visit, make it the Pergamon, if only for the Gates of Ishtar (with free entry on late night Thursdays)(4) DO try the curry worst... Its cheap, nasty and totally addictive!Overall, despite the credit card fiasco, its a great hotel, super location, and I would certainly use them again.
