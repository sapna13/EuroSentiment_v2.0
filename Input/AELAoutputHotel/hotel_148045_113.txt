{"text":"Specatacular views  Just returned from 3 nights and 4 days at El Con. This place was amazing. It lived up to it's 5 star rating. The grounds were SO spreadout and I had no complaints with the walking around because the views are so specatcular everywhere you go - who can complain?! If you're looking for lavish and luxury, this is the place to go. If you're looking for the real Puerto Rico, venture towards the West side of the island and don't stay here because this is truly for relaxation and luxury.The thing I liked the most about this resort is that nothing was set in stone. If you needed something - they'd go above and beyond to accomodate you. If it was possible, they'd make it happen. We never heard the word no to anything we needed or asked for. Things we loved: *Cleanliness.*The room had great decor and very spacious. It had an i-home on one of the dressers which was great to prop up your i-pod while you're getting ready or just lounging on your balcony at sunrise or sunset.*Great service by the staff. Everyone was so helpful and friendly. We arrived at 11am and they let us check in early which was awesome. I recommend to stay in the main building because it will eliminate the longer walks and it's central to everything.*The amazing pools. Check out the Infinity pool in Las Casitas (not the small one by the waterpark). This Infinity pool has the most beautiful view I've ever seen. Although the pool is in Las Casitas, it is open to all guests.*Variety of tropical drinks. Try the El Conquistador. *Fridge in room.*Amazing views - the resort is located on a cliff. *Weather was at a steady 85 degrees every day (a few sprinkles once a day and there but nothing that lasted longer than 15 minutes).Things that could've been better:*Prices at the restaurants. However, there is a way around this!!! ***CASH SAVING TIPS***--Get a ride in to town and go to the Amigo (grocery store) and buy bottle water (Desani since that is what they use and you can get away with towing your bottled water to Palomino island). This saved us $100. --The further you away from the main building where check in was, the cheaper things were. For example, if you walked all the way down to the marina, the bottles of water were cheaper. -- We found an all you can eat breakfast down by the marina for $18. This beat the $30 breakfast everywhere else and the quality was excellent.--If you rent jet skiis at Palomino island and they are having a slow day with jet ski rental, they'll come down on the price. Just ask!!--If you're ordering drinks with rum - they tend to be weak. Just ask for more and they'll add it.
