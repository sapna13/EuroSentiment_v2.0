{"text":"great beach, good food and staff always bending backwards to please Just got back from the Grand Palladium Punta Cana(Nov 9 - nov16). I'm sure you will read good reviews and bad reviews and after a while, you will be just as confused as I was before I went for my vacation to this resort. I left my bag of complaints at home before I left, so I have nothing but good things to say about the facility! The beach is endless with no rocks or shells and beautiful soft white sand. There's no sign of any fish so if you plan on snorkeling, this is not the place.There are a lot of bare breasts on the beach and in the pools, but they are not dangerous and they don't bite! so just relax and go with the flow.The complex is huge with three hotels which are accessible to all guests, so you can have a choice of where you spend your time. You can choose a busy pool with lots of activity or a quiet area with little action.The room was clean, comfortable, roomy and well stocked with drinks such as water, soft drinks and beer. There's a jacuzzi in the room but the water pressure is so low it would take forever to fill up so plan on taking showers in the tub.I know that many reviews complain about the buffet restaurants but I found that there was plenty of choice (better than many places I've been to) and if you can't find something to please you, then you must be very picky. you can go to 4 different a la carte restaurants if you prefer and no reservations are needed.To conclude, it's a beautiful place with a great beach, decent food, good service and lots of nice people from all over the world to meet, so just go and enjoy.
