{"text":"Perfect Hotel My girlfriend and I stayed here for a short break of four nights in February 2008, and I have to say that the hotel was perfect in every respect - I don't think I could find a thing to fault it.I selected this hotel after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and after looking at all the top rated hotels for both a central location and price, this seemed to be the perfect combination.We arrived early Friday evening and found the hotel located in a perfect spot on La Rambla just a couple of minutes from Place Catulunya.We were greeted at the door by a hotel porter (although I don't believe he was there all the time during the stay, so it may just be pot luck on whether there is a porter there when you arrive). The porter took our bags to reception where we were swiftly and efficiently checked in by a polite and helpfull receptionist with perfect English.After checking in, the porter went with us to the room, carrying the bags and then showing us the features etc. of the room.The room was great - a good sized room with king size bed, contemporary style and nice and clean. The room had doors which opened to overlook La Rambla - and even though the street outside was busy and bustling, you could close the doors and all was quiet. In fact, the hotel was quiet as a whole - everyday we had a nice long lie in without being woken up by noise. The bathroom was wonderful - a good size, clean and with a nice big jacuzzi - big enough for two :-)) with a good shower over the bath.TV was limited in choice - only BBC World and CNN in English - but we didn't go to Barcelona to watch TV. Reception had free Internet access.Overall this was an excellent hotel that I would definitely recommend.TIP - the tax from the airport to the hotel was about 40 Euros inc. tip. However, the Airport bus stops and starts in Placa Catulunya and is five mins walk to the hotel straight down La Rambla. The airport bus only cost 4 Euros per person.
