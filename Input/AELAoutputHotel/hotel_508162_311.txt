{"text":"FANTASTIC HOTEL - BEST SERVICE EVER We have just returned from the best two weeks holiday we have ever had at Dreams.. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before.Rooms We stayed in a honeymoon suite in the preferred club. It was well worth the upgrade - massive rooms, great maid service twice a day, jacuzzi on the balcony, free DVD rental - the list just goes on and on. Vanessa, Ricardo, George and Bertillio were fantastic. PoolAbsolutely massive and very clean - my kids loved the Iceberg to climb up on. As I have two young children, I was able to relax as the pool is the same depth all the way round which they could both stand up in.BeachWe were so lucky, as if you are in the preferred club we had our own private bit of beach which included 4 massive 4 poster beds, towel service and all the suncreams you'd ever need. I would reiterate with everyone else and say that it's best to go to the left - where the turtle trampoline is - there are no rocks thereEntertainmentExcellent again - the team worked so hardy, mickey Mouse, 50 cent etc. My children loved going in for the competitiions however if you just wanted to chill - they were more than happy to just have a quick chat. All I would say is that the shows at night are the same each week so they might wish to do it fortnightly however most nights my children were shattered by 9.30pm so it didn't affect usCoreZoneMy children loved the corezone - playing pool, table football, air hockey, ping-pong etc so they used to go there at midday for a couple of hours as it was all covered - in the midday heatFoodSome restaurants are fantastic (French,grill and Oceana for lunch) but was not impressed with the japanese, World Cafe at night or the mexican. Just a bit bland ExcursionsWe went quad biking which was fantastic (make sure you take a few dollar bills to give to the kids in the village you pass) and Zip lines which was great also Both were only 2-3 hours long which was great for my familyCaricaturistQuick mention that there is a caricaturist in the lobby at night - he was a fantastic artist and we have some great pictures to hang on the wall at homeOverallService, rooms, entertainment and pool were fantastic. Only slight disappointment was the food in some of the restaurants and the AC was not brilliant.
