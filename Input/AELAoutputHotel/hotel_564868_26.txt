{"text":"Very nice, comfortable and modern...would stay again. When we arrived at CDG airport we travelled by Metro to the Pont De St-Cloud station and it took about 15 mins. The area where the hotel is located is pleasent enough with a few supermarkets dotted around which are all within walking distance. The Metro station is about a 5 minute walk to the hotel.The hotel itself is very modern, it has a big open lobby which you enter through some front revolving doors. The staff where very helpful and although it wasn't check-in time they took our bags and stored them until 3pm when we returned. We were given our keycard for the room and our lugggage was brought up to us.The room was lovely - it had a huge King-Size bed with fresh linen sheets - the room was VERY clean and had a big plush bathroom with a mixture of different shampoo's, conditioner, gels and creams. Mounted on the wall was an LCD TV with a massive range of channels including Sky News, BBC1 and BBC2!My only problems with the hotel where that the bar closed at about 12 on an evening, it would have been nice to of had a nightcap when we returned on a night. Also, room service was pricey with only a limited selection and they tried to over charge us for this, just be aware of that.To summarise, the hotel was good. It was out of the hustle and bustle of central Paris but in an ideal location for getting the metro to some of the sights e.g. the Louvre, The Eiffel Tower, The Latin Quarter etc...The place was very comfortable and we would definitely stay again.We also got engaged which made things all the better...
