{"text":"Not going to that hotel ever again Many things, that combined to not so good experience at the hotel. 1. Dont book through a travel agent, they do not get you what you asked for, at the hotel the front desk ladies are rude, as if they are doing a favor to us. 2. If that was not enough, travel agent of a repute in Hongkong, booked for me a standard room, and that was a small room with queensize bed, in front of lift, the smallest anyone could ever imagine, they are giving out rooms that are built using the space under the stairs. 3. After getting them to task, and threatening to leave the hotel, they tell me to pay me 400 HKD more for a room, that is similar but slightly bigger in size, when I asked them to give me the complete bill of what room they give me and what charges they took, as usual the rude front desk, refused flatly. Saying we do not give bill to people who book through travel agent. 4. DO NOT Take broadband service in your room, complete fraud, the service will work good for 1 hour and then the speed goes down like hell. Completely pathetic. 5. Ask for a service from housekeeping, they will say right there sir, we are coming, no-one turns up until you are ready for checkout, and will look at you as if you are going to give them a good tips for the wonderful service. I have left these feedback at hotel for Anita Chan too, if she gets to read. On a whole a bad bad hotel. Not worth.
