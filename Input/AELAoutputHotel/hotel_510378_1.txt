{"text":"Mixed feelings I have mixed feelings about the Gaylord Suites.We had great, friendly service from an African-American man, but a consistently icy reception from a dark haired woman - she never looked up or smiled at us, was very reluctant in her dealings with us, and was obviously disinterested in us (but not blatantly rude).The rooms are very nicely decorated, but are noisy at night (streetnoise, sirens), possibly this is just more noticeably because the windows are not double glazed. I wore earplugs every night (front desk were more than happy to move us to a quieter room when we asked, but the new room was unfortunately no quieter, as it was next to the elevator). Light from the hallway shone brightly all night into the room.We had a few maintenance \/ hygiene issues in both rooms. The flooring was buckled by the bathroom door, and we kept tripping and hurting ourselves until we jammed toilet paper into the gap to remind us not to walk over that piece. The blanket on the chair smelt strongly of body odour and was visibly dirty. There was dried blood on the duvet inner (the cover was clean). There was no plug for the kitchenette sink, but front desk said they would lend us one if we wanted. In our first room the bath plug was broken and had masses of long hair around the base of it, which I very reluctantly had to clean off to try and fix it. Maintenance came to fix it the next day, they were very efficient.Great location, a few blocks from Union Square.We did not have an *awful* experience here, but it was too flawed to recommend to anyone. I would not stay here again. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1067,"mention":"blood","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Black_pudding"],"startOffset":1062}]}
