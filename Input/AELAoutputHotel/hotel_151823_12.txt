{"text":"Great Hotel and Staff I apologize to the Hotel for not getting this review in much sooner.I have been dealing with a family crisis.Allow me to start off by saying that it is NOT my intent to insult anyone. That being said let me say this.After reading some of the reviews. I was shocked by some of the comments.I felt the they were unfair. I say this, for this reason only.I am a Puerto Rican that lives in N.Central Florida and travel to San Juan often and stay at many different hotels throughout the Island.I have to admit that the Staff and Hotel at the San Juan Beach is Truly Outstanding and Very Professional from the Manager to the Grounds keepers.My room was Cleaned everyday and fresh linens and towels were always used. My only issue was with their WIFI working properly. Other than that I Loved My Stay There.Folks ...Please...Be Realistic...You did not pay for The Marriott or Hilton. I did not walking in expecting to be treated like the President of a large company. The rates at the San Juan Beach in comparison to the Hilton and Marriott is Half. The employee's of the San Juan Beach do not have swanty uniforms or have modern style decor...But after all...all that is needed is a Clean and Safe place for one to rest his or her head for a good nite sleep along with a staff that smiles at you and always welcomes you back as u walk in the hotel after a long day at the beach or shopping. The San Juan Beach Hotel and its Staff does just that.THANK YOU FOR A GREAT VACATION EXPIERENCE AND STAY.PJD ","annotations":[]}
