{"text":"Thanks but no thanks. Never returning again Stayed here for two nights from Oct 10th thru Oct 12th. Hotel was easy to find since we know the area very well and have stayed at other hotels in the vicinity. First, there are people who claim that the hotel is far away from everything. Absolutely not true. They are very spoiled or do not know what they are talking about. The metro is a few minutes walk away as well as the tram. The Diagonal Mar shopping center is a few minutes walk too. True, the hotel is located in a quiet part of town which is going through a complete transformation but I would hardly call it unsafe. There were plenty of people living around the area in all directions. There are many businesses there too so the area is not filled with tons of people but the streets are clean, well light, and no danger present. Check in was fast and friendly. Hotel room was interesting. Despite it being a newish hotel, we noticed in our room many things that seemed to be a sign of poor workmanship. We noticed things peeling, parquet floors that were not measured and cut correctly. Too many signs of wear and tear for a new hotel. Also, not that I am a prude but I found the interior space poorly planned especially the bathroom walls. How can you have walls made of clear glass in the bathroom so that everyone else in the room can see you squatting on a toilet seat. No thank you! Room was clean and sufficient but nothing to rave about. Breakfast was mediocre. The head waitress, Bea was aloft and rude. She was too busy critiqing the other staff than analyzing how she operates. She asks us if we want coffee and then we have to wait several minutes because she was busy making some breakfast for someone in the back area. Several people who came in after us were served first. And it seemed that if you did not come in wearing a suit, you were not worthy of notice. We asked her two more times and each time showed indifference. The food was very bland. Nothing tasted decent. The eggs were water. The tortillas were void of taste. No real selection of fruits or yogurts. Overall, hotel was not horrible but I would search for a better deal elsewhere on expedia when I go back to Barcelona.
