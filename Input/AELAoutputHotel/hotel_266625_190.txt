{"text":"Someting in my sausage..... My boyfriend and i went to the Sirenis for 2 Weeks in March\/April of this year. We had read lots of reviews and decided to go with an open mind, and just decided that some people just love to moan and will always find something to moan about. This was our first Caribbean holiday, and we had lots of friends\/family who go to the Caribbean every year and love it. The flight was SHOCKING! We went with My Travel and the plane was pretty dirty and they didnt tell us that we would be travelling via Manchester both ways and we even had an emergency landing into Bermuda airport, which was an emergency i know, but the whole flight took us 15hours instead of 8-9hrs. My boyfriends TV didnt work for the whole way back, and my headphones only worked if i held them in the socket, quite annoying, but we were just wanting to get home at this point so didnt really care! However...The hotel on arrival was lovely, the rooms are very comfortable and everything you need is included, i.e. fresh bottled water in your mini bar everyday, sometimes flower petals on your bed if you're lucky!The complex is very well maintained, and the flamingos, turtles and fish are lovely. The male bar staff seem to be friendly and try their hand at english, but the women did not seem to be so accomodating! Dont underestimate the sun, on the first day we led out in the sun and it was very overcast, and we got very burnt, stupid we know, but it was only about 8 in the morning!Then buying after-sun and antiseptic was SO expensive from the hotel shops, dont rely on be able to buy anything over there. Also the money dispensed from the ATM is Domincan Dollars, however, they are not accepted as currency by the Hotel Reception or even at Customs, which is riduculous!THe food was pretty bad, and talking to our friends and other people who have been, they have all suffered from dicky tummies during their trip so if you are a bit delicate in that area, beware.ALso, the 'foreign body' i found in my sausage at dinner one night was not a bit of black pepper like the waitress tried to fob me off with, as we all know that black pepper does not have hair.!!!The drinks and cocktails were fab, the food was ok, but you became cautious of what you ate, the pool and beach were also lovely. We did have a leak in the bathroom ceiling of our bathroom, which took at least four days for the maintainence guys to fix, in the end we demanded to move rooms because nothing had been done, and the liquid had turned yellow and it was pleasant having to sit on the toilet with your knees to one side so that it didnt drip on you, or having to keep a towel on the floor so that you didnt step in a puddle of ---- each morning!The nightclub is hilarious and the drinks are NOT FREE in there, and guess what they dont take dominican currency either!I would recommend you go to the Sirenis as the resort is lovely, and you can make up your own mind, but it certainly doesnt sound as though it compares to Barbados, Jamaica and Tobago, but for the money you pay, its not bad value, i just wouldnt go again. Thanks for hearing me out til the end!
