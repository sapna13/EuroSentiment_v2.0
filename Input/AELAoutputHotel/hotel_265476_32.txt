{"text":"Location, Location, Location I tried to book two rooms at the Hotel de la Tulipe, a smaller very charming hotel closer to the Rue Clare, but they were fully booked. So our stay at the de Londres was not really our first choice, but our three night stay was enjoyable. As usual for Parisian hotels, the room was small but the bathrooms were newly remodeled; all white sparkling tiles and new fixtures.The staff was polite and most were very friendly. The lady manager was so charming and friendly. We stayed in room 107, one of the Poets Room. We didn't request a room with a view, so we weren't disappointed. But, if you have mobility problems you need to be very specific when you book a room. There IS an elevator for guests. But what isn't clear is that the Poets rooms aren't serviced by that elevator. Our room 107 was up three flights of narrow stairs. So tell the booking clerk of any special needs. Actually, I like those narrow curving stairs, they always make me think of Paris.The hotel breakfast was 12 euros ($18!) for cold cuts, cheese, cold cereal and bread. Walk out the lobby door and turn right, make another right on to Saint Dominique. Walk about 100 feet and across the street is the prettiest, friendliest little patissier shop you could hope to have breakfast at. If you keep walking about three blocks further there is a Starbucks. Although why any American would go to Paris to drink at Starbucks is beyond me.The best thing about the de Londres is the location near the Rue Clare. After a visit to the Opera house and then to the hectic department stores behind it, we escaped the crowds and popped out of the Metro at La Tour Maubourg. My son looked around the quiet streets and the pretty little park and sighed Home!
