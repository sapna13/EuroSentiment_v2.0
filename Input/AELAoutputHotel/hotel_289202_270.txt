{"text":"Warm, friendly Hotel We recently returned from our second trip to Italy, and our second stay at the Antiche Figure Hotel in Venice. The first trip, we relyed on Hotels.com to help us find a good hotel, and we were so pleased with this wonderful, little hotel.First of all, it has a fantastic location. Our first trip, we came in from Marco Polo Airport, via the bus, which dropped us off at Piazelle Roma, which is a transportation hub. We hopped a vaporetto (water bus) to find our hotel, and there it was, on the right side in full view! We got off at the first stop, Ferrovia,and walked across the bridge to the hotel. We couldn't believe that it was that convenient. It is also across the Grand Canal from the train station, which also came in handy for both of our trips to and from other cities. Remember that Venice is unlike other cities where one can hail a cab and be dropped right in front of your hotel. Their location is fantastic!As we walked trhrough the front door, we were greeted warmly by Alessandro, the hotel manager, who was very helpful in orienting us to the city of Venice, as well. During our three day stay, we were always treated like a member of the family by this warm and friendly staff. They all spoke English, too.The rooms are very pretty and comfortable. It is my understanding that the Grand Canal side rooms are larger, and that was where we stayed both visits. The bathrooms are very nice, too, with a bathtub and shower and a nice sized vanity.As I said earlier, we just returned from our second trip to Venice and a big reason for returning was the Antiche Figure. We have sent friends to stay there, as well, and I highly recommend this hotel.As a final note, I celebrated my birthday there last week and planned on a gondola ride, which Gianni, at the front desk, arranged for us. He escorted us to the gondola (again, right out in front of the hotel) and then quickly went back in to their bar and returned with an ice bucket and my favorite white wine, courtesy of the hotel! He even made me a birthday card on the hotel computer and presented it with the wine. Needless, to say, I was very touched by his thoughtfulness!
