{"text":"Absolutely Wonderful!!!! This was our first visit to San Juan and we are happy we stayed at the Marriott. We arived at about 12:35 p.m. knowing check in time would be 4:00 p.m. The front desk personnel were very friendly and we were offered the opportunity to store our bags and change in the spa if we wanted to go to the beach or pool. The room, a beautiful ocean front...not view, but front, was ready before 1:30 p.m. The room includes a small refrigerator so you stock up on snacks for your use later. The balcony was great and private. Flat screen TV is a plus.We enjoyed the multi level pool and spa and liked the activity in the lobby...live music most nights and a nice casino. There is a bar in the pool or wait service will come to you as you lounge. The pool area also includes some vendors on the weekend. The location is great. You can stroll along Ashford and eat at a variety of restaurants or enjoy the food in the hotel. There is a great deal to do in the area and many convenience stores all within walking distance.There is a full array of tours offered and the concierge service is excellent and well informed. This is the place to be if you like activity. Also a short bus ride to Old San Juan....note: buses have no specific schedule so you might need to wait a bit. Take the bus into Old San Jaun and taxi (which is reasonable) home.The hotel is right on the beach which is spectacular and the beach staff will gladly provide chairs and umbrella (no cost) and serve drinks on the beach. The hotel is very clean and the staff is friendly at all times. This was a perfect vacation and a great property. Don't miss it.
