{"text":"Avoid! Under construction! I never write reviews about my trips, but in this case it is definitely warranted. The Marriott Miami Airport has been under construction for some time, and although most of the renovations should be completed in the next couple of months, the entire complex (Marriott, Marriott Courtyard and Residence Inn) is not expected to be finished until Summer of 2009.We had to go through a detour maze of corridors and two sets of elevators to go between our rooms and the lobby, where we found the staff somewhat weary and fed up. The restaurant was temporarily located in the ballroom, yet there was a bar in the corner with a widescreen TV showing football. It was an odd mix with the chandeliers. The trek back involved walking over plastic sheeting into a large staff elevator.The rooms were nice, but the bathrooms are the smallest I've ever seen in a U.S. hotel. The sink is RIGHT NEXT to the toilet, which is RIGHT NEXT to the shower. You kind of have to squeeze in beside the toilet just to close the door.Location is very good if you want to be in the vicinity of the airport and close to major roads like the 836, but honestly if I had known what the hotel was going to be like, we never would have stayed there. We always stay at the Marriott Dadeland, but it was sold out.I felt bad for the staff, who obviously have been dealing with irate customers for months. Let's face it, they would have had no say in the renovations, yet are the ones who have to take the abuse. I didn't find them particularly welcoming, but then in the same position I might have gone postal by now.Before you book this hotel I would STRONGLY suggest getting an update on where they are with the improvements.
