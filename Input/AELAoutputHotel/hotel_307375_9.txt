{"text":"Great Service at a Great Price I have stayed at this hotel twice, and I plan to continue using it for all my business trips to Tokyo. The rooms are clean, well-stocked with amenities, and, by Tokyo standards, quite spacious. The staff is exceedingly polite.I always opt for the Executive Floors, for four reasons:1. The Executive Lounge offers and excellent selection of snacks and beverages, and is a great way to unwind after work (trade show work in my case).2. The executive rooms have the USEN440 Satellite Radio. Now this is not a major thing, I know, but if you've never experienced Japanese Satellite Radio, you are in for a treat. You would be hard pressed to name a type of music that they haven't devoted a 24 hour station to, not to mention soundscapes, language lessons, and Auld Lang Syne (the Japanese signal that a place is closing).3. The breakfast buffet is included, and it's a good buffet. Certainly better than anything that passes for a breakfast buffet in the States.4. Free Internet. If you are like me, and have to check your email nearly constantly, then this is worth it. When you add the buffet and the Internet access to the mix, the price difference between the executive level and the other floors starts to look far less imposing.I recommend stepping outside and eating at one of the neighborhood restaurants for most of your meals. There is a good selection of restaurants nearby that cost much less than the ones in the hotel. If you want to go really cheap, there's a pretty good ramen place a few doors away that will only cost you around 700 Yen.The hotel is located in the Chuo-ku district, which puts it a little off the beaten path. If you are the kind of person who likes to step out the door into full Tokyo commotion, then this is not the hotel for you. The hotel is close to two of the major subway lines, so it is easy to get nearly anywhere from the hotel. One of these lines is directly under the hotel. The other is just a few blocks away.If you are a business traveler, and you find yourself stuck at hotels a lot, eating breakfast buffet food, and logging onto the computer at all hours, the Royal Park Hotel is a wonderful way to make a trip to Tokyo a lot less fatiguing.
