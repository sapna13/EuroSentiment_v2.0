{"text":"Amazing Resort, Don't Play Multi Ball Roulette! Don't play Multi Ball Roulette!! When you go to the Casino they will give you chips to play Multi Ball Roulette and then they suck you into betting big. We met 6 couples who played the game and every one of them lost money, 2 couples lost $2500, 1 couple lost $4000 and a couple from England lost the most, $6000. The dealer is very slick and we assume is working on commission. We were watching one couple through the window at the casino and tried to warn them not to play and after they lost $4000 and walked out of the casino visibly upset we saw the dealer laughing with the pit boss. This game is a Scam! I work at a Casino and none of the pit bosses have heard of this game. Stay Away From Multi Ball Roulette!!The resort was amazing! There were bars all over the resort, one near the beach that was open 24hrs. The swim up bar Bartender, Juan, was amazing and had a great time with the customers. There is nightly entertainment, movies and live shows every night, Karaoke on Sunday, Tuesday and Friday and the Disco is pumping every night as well. The Italian restaurant was OK even through a lot of reviews said it was the best, every couple we talked to including ourselves would say the pasta bar at Windows Buffet was better then this place so don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ waste your time. The American grill was AMAZING and we ate there twice during our stay. The service was top notch and the food was by far the best on the resort. The food at the windows buffet was great, you had to pick through to find the stuff you liked but over all it was good. The theme changes every night so you always have a good selection. The beach is beautiful and over all the resort is well kept and a great place to spend 7 days. We paid $1500 for the two of us and we could not have asked for a better vacation.
