{"text":"Very Good I recently stayed at the Establishment Hotel in Sydney, for 5 nights at the beginning of my visit to Australia, and another two nights on the back end before my departure. This hotel is great. The rooms are sleek and comfortable, the bathrooms are sweet (stocked with Bulgari green tea bath products, one of my fave scents), the staff are all very helpful and professional, the housekeeping is immaculate, and the bars and restaurants are appealing (albeit a bit of a scene, but that's obviously by design). I particularly liked the sushi bar (Sushi E), which I ate at twice - very tasty sushi and a nice host. Also, the hotel's location is good - a short walk to the Opera House, the ferries, the Rocks and all of its restaurants, and also really not far from trendier neighborhoods like Surry Hills (a short cab ride or a decent walk).My only constructive criticism: Certain rooms can be louder than others on weekend nights (there is also a nightclub that is attached to and affiliated with the hotel, so ask to stay on the 4th or 5th floors), and I would have loved it if one of the hotel's bars or restaurants remained open on Sunday nights (I realize Sunday restaurant\/bar closure is true of many hotels in Sydney, but still it would be great for guests if there was at least one in-hotel option other than room service). Other than that, no problems, and I would absolutely stay here again.
