{"text":"Great but not quite perfect Large comfortable rooms with great business desk and chair at a reasonable price (for NYC). The kitchen was very handy for snacks, breakfast.Loved the location (a) a calmer part of NYC but still near the subway, empire state building, grand central station, etc. If you like those hop on\/hop off tourist buses, the empire state building is the closest place to catch them. (b) a number of good restaurants within 2 blocks (especially on 3rd ave. and 33rd street), (c) an easy $30 taxi ride from Laguardia. (d) the Murray Hill Market, a small market\/deli just down the block was fabulous, and shockingly reasonable prices for NYC. Housekeeping did an excellent job, including all the kitchen cleaning, and they respected the do not distrub and please clean now signs.We had a couple of glitches:(a) the business office is just one PC in the very small lobby that you can rent for $6\/20 minutes. The PC is locked down from a security standpoint, so anything beyond the most straightforward functionality will not work. (In other words I should have brought my own laptop and used the in room internet functionality). This PC can also be used for free to print your boarding passes which is a nice touch. The printer was acting up when we tried to use it but I appreciated the idea.(b) Our first night the heater did not work. The room started out relatively pleasant but got very cold while we were sleeping. We talked to the management who said that it was due to NYC regulations that if the outside temp was above a certain level (it was in the 50s while we were there) the heat could not be turned on. This sounded odd, but the hotel did get us a portable heater for the remaining nights for our stay, which we appreciated.
