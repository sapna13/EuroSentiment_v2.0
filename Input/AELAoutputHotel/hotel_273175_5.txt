{"text":"People, You're in Amsterdam... I went to Amsterdam back in '04, so of course this review is dated, yet my family had planned on staying there again last year. Due to high airline costs, we were unable to make the trip there. At the time, the hotel was pricey, but as were other hotels in the area. It's really in a prime spot, but the railway that went right in front of the hotel got old when you are trying to sleep (Imagine hearing the rumbling outside when it went zooming up, ringing the bell to say IM HERE!!!! and then whiz away. The houses in Amsterdam are tall... not wide, which means that anyone with a fear of steep stairs, or a disability, should really contact the hotel and ask if it's accomodating to them. I nearly laughed when reading about other people's suprise when they realized they had to climb the tiny stairs to their rooms. It sucks carrying your luggage up the stairs, but I tend to pack light and didn't have a problem. The hotel didn't have a.c. when we went, which was fine. It was nice out. And the view of the building across the street was amazing. The walk to the historical sites (which are everywhere), was fairly easy. A short walk, and you're at Rembrandt square and in he red light district. The internet was slow, yet I emailed people and that was it. The staff was always friendly, and always willing to give suggestions on where to go sightseeing. I won't get into many more details, as my post is very outdated, but really.... If anyone physically cannot walk up stairs (particularily small winding steps), then don't waste your time on this hotel. Also, call the hotel of your choice ahead of time to make sure that they can help with your disability\/fear\/other physical limits. Amsterdam is known for its tall, narrow houses though, and much appreciation should be given to them. They are truly beautiful. ","annotations":[]}
