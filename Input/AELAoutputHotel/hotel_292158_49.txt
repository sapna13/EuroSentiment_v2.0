{"text":"Great Resort for a Fantastic Price Had a fantastic time at this huge resort.Almost too big as it takes 3-4 days to learn the layout.For price we paid how can anyone complain. Room was dated but clean. Shower pressure was good.Bed was hard not so comfortable.Service at check in was OK. Staff generally tries real hard. Tons of Europeans and very few Americans and Canadians. We tipped well and the staff deserved every cent. Drinks refilled constantly and with good local rums and beer. Casino and Hemingways bars have Bombay, Red Label, Dewars and other Medium Shelf liquors.Food was plentiful, buffets had much variety. Do not miss the Dominican night on Thursday it is fantastic. La Catherdral is the best buffet houe out of the 4 different buffet restaurants.Ala Cartes were OK, service slow but plate presentation was fine. Il Quijote was very good for Paella.Pools were fantastic, beach great and Sports bar was great for munchies after midnight.All in all a great place for family.For those whining and complaining when you travel abroad food expectations and room products vary greatly. Americans tend to eat twice as much than our cousins across the pond and it shows when you are at the pool. Unless you're paying more than $200 per person per day then I would be very happy with the Palladium.Staff work real hard and it is easier to tip big at beginning at pool bar as opposed to carrying singles in the water. We did so at Palace pool, Willy was fantastic and took great care of the 8 of us for all week.Speak some Spanish and do not expect too many workers to speak English. When in Rome...As far as Animation team goes they try hard but need some polish.Surrounding area, well there isn't any. A few run down shops and bodegas. There is no town to speak of.I would recommend for a family or large group of friends.
