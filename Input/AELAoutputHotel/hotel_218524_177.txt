{"text":"Had a fantastic time! I just got back from the excellence. My hubby and were there from Sept. 29, 08 until Oct. 3, 08. We had a great time! Our room was beautiful. Very clean and spacious. The staff was extremely friendly and catered to us. Luckily we had great weather. The food is really good. I am not a picky eater but my hubby is and he enjoyed the food as well. The only negatives I have about this place are the flies at the toscana and the beach is too rough to swim in. Everything else was fine. Your greeted with champagne and a cool nice smelling towel. During the day you hit the pools and the beach. They have all sorts of activities going on. At night they have shows and a club called Alegria. At night everyone gets dressed up and goes out to the restaurant of choice for dinner. There are 7 restaurants and everynight it varies on which one will be closed. Its a great romantic atmosphere. Oh and something I haven't seen mentioned, at night the maid comes to change the sheets and she leaves an itenarary for the following day. We loved the itenarary. It would state the weather the activities for the day and what was being cooked at 12:30pm by the beach, and what restaurants would be open. and other little information. I had a relaxing time. There is that long bus ride but it didn't bother me at all... I think some people are just tooooooo picky and expect toooooo much. I know you paid money for your trip BUT big deal you find a bug in your room... or your towel isn't WHITE enough...Just go and have a good time and try not to focus on these little and i mean little minor set backs.
