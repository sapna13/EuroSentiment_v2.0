{"text":"Affinia is great...great...great! First off, I just wanted to say that I booked the Affinia Dumont off of the reviews I read on here. Almost all of the reviews were great. My first impression of this hotel was fantastic. The lobby was bright and colorful, and the doorman greated us every time were came into the hotel. The front desk staff was really helpful and friendly, except for one thing I will talk about later. The hotel even has a computer to print out boarding passes free of charge. You can also pay to IM or email. Free iced tea and fruit was available on the front desk. The elevators, despite the 37 floors went really fast. I stayed for a weekend and every time I used the elevator to the 31st floor, I did not stop on any other floor. I was amazed by this. The spa looked very nice, but I did not use the services. They have guest laundry in the basement with a vending machine. My room was excellent. It was a studio suite on the 31st floor, #3102. It was way bigger than any other NYC hotels. I loved the kitchen, very convienient for a weekend. We kept our leftover food and pizza there, along with beverages and milk for coffee. Our coffee pot was hard to use though, becuase we had a hard time getting the pot off. We did no cooking, but it was convienient. The beds were very comfortable. We had two queens and ordered pillows off the pillow menu, I ordered a hypo allergenic. There was a nice big desk to do work, or store your travel papers and all of your shopping buys. The tv was nice and big. The air kept it nice and cool, although we broke the front using it. The hotel even had a safe. There was a large closet and many drawers in the hallway as you entered the suite. That was where the safe was. We also forgot our code to the safe, so we had to call the front desk for somebody to come up and unlock it. The bathroom was also very big, a nice shower and sink. There was even a telephone in the bathroom. The Aveda products were a nice compliment. The hotel hasan Affinia Fresh promotion where they give you toothpaste, razors, mouthwash, eye solution, etc. free of charge. The location was very nice in Murry Hill. Nice on the east side close to Macys and the Empire State Building. There was a Murry Hill Market right next to the hotel. They sold convienence items and really nice flowers outside that were extremely cheap. We would have bought so many, except we flew into JFK. We found that walking everywhere was the best way to get around, but if you are tired of walking, then take a taxi. They were really cheap to the hotel and very fast. We took the bus twice, but we waited a while for the to come around, and waited more to try to find out what bus to take. We booked the City Sights NY tour (The Blue Buses) and took the tour of downtown. They picked us up at the Empire State Building, about 4 blocks west. Also Macys is a stop where you could catch the bus. The tour guides were very nice and helpful on the buses. We saw the bigger sights of NYC like Rockefeller Center and Ellis Island\/Statue of Liberty and all of the neighborhoods like Little Italy and Chinatown (Hated Chinatown). The negative thing about the hotel was that we booked through hotels.com and it was $162. The hotel tried to charge us $212. We fought for an hour and called hotels.com and we called hotels.com and they were very helpful and got us the $162 price. Then we paid, and the women at the front desk tried to not give us a reciept. Other than this minor price problem, the hotel was nice. I would definatly stay here again, but the only other hotel I would stay at is the Sheraton in Times Square, because it looked nicer, and about the same standard regular price as this hotel. I would stay were again because of the rooms and amenities.
