{"text":"Classic Italian Experience My husband and I heard about this hotel through a recommendation in a travel book we read. Before going to Florence, we emailed the owners to ask them some basic questions about parking, accomodations, location and possible cooking courses. We heard back from Andrea (a co-owner) with immediacy, who was very gracious, responsive and helpful. We even had directions to the hotel and parking. This was a hotel with great staff and a home-like appeal. The breakfast buffet was delicious and served in a very cute villa room. The server made you feel at home by adding a drawn smile in the foam of the cappucino. The little extra touches at this hotel just added to our experience. We booked a junior suite, which had a view that looked out at clock tower and of the Arno river. The suite was large, spacious and had a true classic italian feel to it. The price for this hotel suite in comparison to other hotels we stayed in across Italy was similar and above average in the authenticity and spaciousness we were looking for. It also had a safe and a fridge that we appreciated while we were there. The hotel is within a reasonable walking distance to all of the sites we went to and the staff was able to secure cooking lessons for us previous to the day we arrived. Since we only were staying 1 1\/2 days, having things set up in advance was a great advantage. Our stay in Florence, in this hotel and the cooking course we experienced was at the top of our list of experiences in our drive across Italy. We definitely want to go back and will stay at the Hotel Allesandra when we return. We highly recommend this place.
