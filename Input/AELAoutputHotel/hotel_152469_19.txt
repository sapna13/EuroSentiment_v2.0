{"text":"Nikko Mexico was great Traveled for business with 3 other colleagues. I called directly and got a better rate than advertised since we booked 4 rooms for a week. The rooms had a safe, robe, slippers, tv (several English language stations), alarm clock. Bathroom was nice and bed was comfortable. Everything was clean. Had a nice view of the Chapultepec Park. Staff was very attentive, pleasant and efficient and everything we needed was taken care of. They have a few in house restaurants including Mexican, sushi, Japanese and general. There is also a pastry \/ coffee \/ chocolate place on the lobby level if you are not into big breakfasts. Big breakfast buffet but it was not included in the price. SInce I don't eat animal products including dairy (I'm a vegan) I did not partake but my fellow travelers liked it. There is a really nice restaurant about 3 blocks away called SAKS that had mixed food including several vegetarian offerings. All of us raved about the food and service there and was reasonably priced. Fitness area is good and they have an indoor pool. There are some nice shops with jewelry and art too - I bought a nice turquoise and silver set for reasonable price considering it was in a hotel. They have several tours available that can be charged to your room - to the Teotihuacan Pyramids, Taxco, Mexican Folk Ballet etc. I've been to all of them at one time or another and they are all enjoyable and reasonably priced - They pick you up \/ drop you off at the hotel - Pyramids group tour is about $55 USD. The open tour bus of Mexico City has a stop just across from the hotel as well.
