{"text":"Had a Great Time Thanks to Cheap Caribbean my husband and I spent 4 nights at this outstanding resort. Upon arrival we received a room upgrade. The room was nice sized and well appointed. Each room has a terrace with privacy wall,so you really can enjoy sitting out there. We dont golf or tennis,so really can't comment on that. The common areas in the hotel are gourgeous, as are the grounds...well maintained ,nice lawn areas and palm trees abound. The beach is more of a mix of dirt and sand, but the ocean was just perfect...sparkling clean..none of the usual noise from parasailing boats..no one bothers you on the beach...we sat under the natural shade of palm trees, although you could rent a cabana and get luxurious cushioned chairs. We rented a car which allowed us the flexibility for meals...and we really loved La Parilla which is a Kiosk on the beach in Luqillo...the area has a lot of local flavor..too bad they dont clean up there beach area because it is so naturally beautiful. We purchased a bottle of rum and fruit juice to enjoy cocktails in our room after a day at the beach. Perhaps only one draw back to the car was the daily parking fee...we chose the self parking ($15 per day) which required validation at the front desk and a long walk and elevator ride to the covered garage..each time you used the car.The pool area is pretty nice and well populated... but in my opinion, why stay by a pool when the ocean is just great. The Casino is OK...not very expensive..$2.00 for roulette and $5 for Black Jack...alot of slots..not very sophisticated. There was live music around the resort, alot of happy people . The hotel restaurants seemed pretty pricey, more for expense accounts. If you go to the resort, try to take a trip to EL YUNQUE Rainforest...it's really nice to see the views and experience the rainforest habitat.Overall, I recommend a visit before the area is over built. There seems to be alot of construction going on, so that will bring other problems...and check out Cheap Caribbean.com ","annotations":[{"endOffset":485,"mention":"dirt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Dirt_cake"],"startOffset":481},{"endOffset":485,"mention":"dirt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Dirt_cake"],"startOffset":481}]}
