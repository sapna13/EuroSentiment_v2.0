{"text":"Fabulous Trip! Going Back! I sit at my computer listening to my CD of music purchased at the Grand Bahia Principe Punta Cana after just having returned last night from a fabulous 2 week vacation in Punta Cana.Prior to leaving, we had read many many reviews about the hotel and being seasoned travellers had been a little leary about going to the Dominican. We had read good and bad about the size of the hotel, the food, the service etc. Well, we travelled with another couple - total 4 adults and 5 children. I must say, what a fabulous time we had!!!!!!! Our biggest choice of the day was what bathing suit to wear and where we would eat each night? How can you go wrong???As for the hotel, yes it is big, but please keep in mind that they have shuttle buses that go back and forth every 2 minutes and it really is fun riding on them! We stayed in building #2 closest to the beach and would go back and forth everyday. Also, think about it, if you are really not leaving the hotel to tour alot, you want to have a variety of choices and places to go. We found the size to be great and a lot of choices of areas to go to.The beach was one of the most beautiful we've been to. The sand is fabulous and we could swim out into the ocean and never touch a rock. Great for all the walkers too! Weather was fantastic - mucho caliente (very HOT), but we love hot.We have travelled with children (now 9 and 11) to Mexico (5 times), St. Lucia, Antigua, Barbadoes, Jamaica, and now the Dominican. We found it to be top notch. THE best beach since Negril in Jamaica. Our husbands got up early (7:00 a.m) and would go and find a spot on the beach or one by the pool - no problem. Even if you couldn't find a spot under a palapa, there are lots of palm trees to create shade. There is banana boats for fun and you can book the sailboats in advance also. There were bars at the beach as well as pool area (not that we drink that much alcohol) but an endless supply of soda and coco loco's - no alcoholThe entertainment in the evening was fantastic! Michael Jackson, The Lion King (our kids were actually in the show - with the kids club), and the Circus Show. Took every one in and was never disappointed with any. Kids stayed to the end of every one. As far as the food goes, I'm the FIRST one to get sick.....nothing. Many choices to take in. I truly must say the variety was fabulous and the buffet ended up being the favourite. Lots of variety from the salads to pasta, and the deserts are to die for.......... In the evening after dinner there is a fabulous main lobby to relax in and have a drink or coffee. They play music and we enjoyed it immensely.There is also a shopping market attached to the property to browse around in. Nothing above average, but just enough to get souvenirs, play pool, or try your luck at casino.Service we found was definitely above average. I know the hotel was overbooked but we managed to get a great room with no issues. There is always activities going on if you want to participate (aerobics, bingo, fun games, music).We took advantage of an excursion to Manati Park (terrific), swam with the dolphins, did some more shopping, saw a parrot show and a horse show). The kids and husbands did a resort scuba dive and loved it (first for the kids). We also took a glass bottom boat ride but didn't get to see many fish.After reading the bad reviews, I just don't get it. You have to understand the you are in a foreign country and on vacation I might add. Relax and enjoy the beauty of where you are. People who complain must really have had the misfortune of having a bad experience and it tainted their opinion of the hotel. We as a group can't find anything to complain about. If you enjoy being with other people, exercise a little patience if needed, there is not much to complain about when you're in paradise. We'll be going back next year for another fun filled vacation in the tropics.
