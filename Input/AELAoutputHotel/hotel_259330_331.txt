{"text":"Excellent Value - Awesome Beach! I use Trip Advisor every time BEFORE I book a vacation but I have never written a review myself √à√\u2020\u2022?figured I owed the other√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ who contribute their experiences!This was our thrird year to visit the Dominican Republic (the lst two years were at the Santana Beach Resort and Casino in La Romana). Santana Beach was cheap but the beach was disappointing (surprising considering its name) and the food was okay. Avoid the Casino!The Grand Paradise was a wonderful surprise (Feb 18 √à√\u2020\u2022?25)! We were close to the beach on the first floor (originally on the third floor but moved to the first floor to avoid the stairs for my elderly parents). The only problem with the first floor is the noise from the late night travelers who appeared to enjoy banging on doors and making excessive noises as they passed through the buildings (the second floor would avoid this).The rooms were clean but often were cleaned late in the afternoon (an issue if you showered in the morning, hit the beach until mid afternoon and wanted to shower again afterwards). We declined one day to have the room cleaned and got fresh towels instead. They put two cokes (not diet) and two sprite bottles in the fridge and a one gallon jug of water. No beer!We had a minor issue with ants (discovered they liked peanuts on the floor but did not like MMs). We heard one traveler complain of roaches but we did not see any in our building. Remember that this is a tropical climate.The Beach was awesome and went for miles! Great for long strolls along the beach. We played a ton of Volleyball and there was lots of other activities that you could do. Check their website.The food was better than expected (previous experiences in Cuba and the Dominican). No issues with the restaurents or the buffet (tons of selection and the quality was reasonable). Minor issue with the service after we elected to order the house win rather than buying bottles of the more expensive imports. They were reasonably priced $15 USD or so and higher but we only wanted a glass and often did not feel like nor could justify the cost.Interesting comments on the Club from other reviews. I believe it is a newer addition to the resort and does require a two minute commute to the main resort via the trolly. The pool at the Club is MUCH nicer with excellent padded deck chairs and an awesome swim up bar! We were told that the rooms were excellent and had whirlpool bathtubs in them. If you are the type of traveler who spends the day on the beach the commute should not be an issue.The internet was pretty slow and someone hacked my mail account and sent some nasty messages. Cost was reasonable at $8US for one hour of time (you could disconnect and reconnect later and it maintained the balance). I suspect they will eventually get a wireless service so that I could bring my laptop and connect via VPN to my mail server √à√\u2020\u2022?wait √à√\u2020\u2022?scratch that ... I am on holidays!We took the Mountain View Surfari (good day trip) and hired a cab to go to Higuey on one of the rainy days. It took an hour or so to get there and we spent a couple of hours there (picked up a translator there who took us to a local grocery store and a painting factory). Great deals on paintings and Vanella \/ coffee. The cab costs $70 USD for the trip (not bad for the four of us).I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° recommend this resort to others and give it a 7.5 out of 10 based on the cost and its rating.There √à√\u2020\u2022?I have made my first contribution!glennandcheryl@symapatico.ca ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1742,"mention":"Cuba","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cuban_sandwich"],"startOffset":1738},{"endOffset":2154,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2150},{"endOffset":2315,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2311},{"endOffset":3279,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":3273}]}
