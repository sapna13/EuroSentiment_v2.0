{"text":"So trendy it made it uncomfortable at times but will stay there again I will have to say the hotel it's self is very nice and I found it extremly clean while I was there. However, it was so trendy that it made it uncomfortable at times. Let's start with the hallways and elevators, there is no AC at all in them. So, when you are coming back from 90 degree heat back to the room you really feel it going up the elevator that seemed to take forever. I think I lost 5 lbs just riding in the elevator and sweating. However, the ambeance of hallways was neat with the waterfalls in the hallway.We had a king size partcial view room. The rooms seemed really clean as well as the bathroom but there was no alarm clock, or clock for that matter at all in our room. The lack of dresser space didn't bother me since I like to keep my thing in my suit case but I could see how it would be bothersome for someone who enjoys unpacking. (We were there for 10 days so most people would unpack that long.) The blue lights in the room are VERY annoying. We kept ours off and used the only floor lamp but the maids would turn them back on. The TV tube was going out so it would go back and forth between color and black and white. The bed was very comfy and there were plenty of pillows, which was nice since it was really the only thing in the room. The walls were thin we could hear everything in the room next door so we know they heard us.I know they cleaned the bath room every day cause they would pack all my stuff back into my travel bag (which I really didn't appreciate, felt like they were going though my stuff). I also would leave my shampoo on the shower floor since there was not enough caddy space to put it and they would move it to clean the floor. The shower is great for two! And yes, if you are in there by yourself no matter what you do you will get water on the floor. The 1\/2 glass wall just doesn't come out far enough. So be sure to put a towel down. There is ZERO counter space but I guess that goes for them minimal feel with the rest of the room.The staff is GREAT. They all will bend over backwards to help you and they are sincere about it. We were there during hurricane Omar and they made every accomendation to entertain the guest. They brought out a Wi and provided drinks and cookie, they went the extra mile since everything closed at 10 pm that day to prepare. Kevin and the door guys are the best. They will give you the low down on everything. Where to go, where to eat, what things are open before you spend the day driving there. (i.e, the caves). They make up what the rooms lack considering you really aren't spending that much time in the rooms.The amenities were so so. Wet, the roof top bar and resturant, was closed most of the time we were there but that was due to the hurricane. The pool is really a 5 foot wading pool but the leather lounges are nice. Tangerine was nice as well. We didn't eat there because it was so expensive but we had a drink there. The gym was closed when we where there so I just walked on the beach.I do have to say it is the best location for the beach. Yes, you walk across the street but it's like 10 steps and the other hotels you walk further. It's on a side street so not a lot of people hit that part of the beach. The El San Juan Hotel and Intercontinental are right there for the casinos, shopping, and dining so you can walk there in less than 5 min to enjoy those. Plus, you can really tell the difference between the staff when you visit the others. Water and Beach has MUCH better staff.Overall, I would stay there again and do recommend it but parts of it were too trendy and made it uncomfortable.
