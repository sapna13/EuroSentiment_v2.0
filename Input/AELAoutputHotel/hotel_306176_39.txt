{"text":"Successful stopover hotel We chose the Grand Plaza Park from the hotels on offer with the Singapore Airlines stopover package, after researching on Trip Advisor. Our stopover was on the return leg of our trip to Europe (flying back to Australia from Paris). We wanted a hotel that would provide a double and a twin room on a non-smoking floor(we are a family of 4), in a fairly central area (so we could walk to Chinatown, Little India, Clarke and Boat Quays etc), and with late check-out (as our flight out of Singapore was at 9.10 pm). We also wanted a hotel that would be pleasant enough to spend all weekend in, if we just wanted to hit the beds and stay there! (not knowing how tired we would be feeling after four weeks away and a number of flights). Our flight to Singapore got us in very early on a Saturday morning, so we were at the hotel at about 8.00am. The twin room was ready, and the staff were happy for us to move into it and wait for the double to be ready (suggesting that would be by 12.00 midday). Our teenage daughters went straight to bed, and my husband and I went for a walk to Chinatown. When we got back to the hotel at about 11.00, our room was ready. We found both rooms to be spacious, clean and well-presented, with very nice bathrooms. The beds were comfortable, and both rooms had pleasant views over the pool side of the hotel (we were on the 7th floor; the hotel is not too large with only 10 floors).We found all the staff at reception to be friendly and helpful, quick to offer assistance with luggage and with directions. Enjoyed the pool Saturday afternoon, after a walk to Little India and some hawker market food.After a really nice night out on the Saturday night (with a walk to Clarke Quay and dinner at Lotus Grill) we slept in til late on Sunday, checked out at 12.00, left our luggage in the reception area, went out for brunch at a sushi place nearby, then hung around the hotel for the afternoon. My husband and I had massages at the Spa attached to the hotel, leaving us time for happy hour drinks at the hotel bar before our transfer to the airport. This was a pretty idyllic stopover, and means that I will now never do a long haul flight again without breaking it up with some rest and relaxation!
