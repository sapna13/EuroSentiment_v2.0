{"text":"Wonderful Experience We were a bit apprehensive after reading some of the negative reviews on this site. However, we noticed that the majority of reviews were positive and went in to the stay hoping for the best. We wouldn't be disappointed! The hotel grounds, gardens, pools, beach, and overall scenery and views were spectacular! The staff was all very friendly, helpful, and always willing to go out of their way to make the stay more enjoyable. The staff at the pool bar was wonderful - especially Hiram who always remembered our names and what we wanted to order (we usually ended our days at the pool bar). We stayed in the HHonors tower on the 19th floor and our room was very nice with a great ocean view. The mini fridge in the room was nice to have and the remodeled bathroom with the tavertine shower and double sink was beautiful as well. The executive lounge was nice to get the evenings started with light snacks and cheap drinks. The breakfast in the lounge was very adequate and the free soda and water was great during the day. We did a lot of our eating at local restaurants (highly recommend the Parrot Club and Raices) but did eat at Morton's at the hotel. It was expensive but one of the best overall meals we've ever had! We did use the spa for massages and were pleased with those services as well. Overall, we had a great experience at the Caribe Hilton and would not hesitate to return or to recommend to others!
