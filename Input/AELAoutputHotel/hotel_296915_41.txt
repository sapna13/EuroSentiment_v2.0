{"text":"Somewhat disappointing Based on previous reviews, I had high expectations for this hotel, but have to admit, similar to the previous review, that I was somewhat disappointed with this hotel. The lobby area, dining room and roof-top bar are all very nice, but the rooms are very small! We had even decided to book the 'superior room' as we knew that the rooms were small, but it also was very narrow and the only difference between this room and the standard room appeared to be the addition of a small couch. The width of the room, however, appeared to be similar, which me feel quite claustrophobic. As previously noted, there was little space to get by the t.v. on the wall to the desk area (you actually had to duck down to get by), and the sitting area by the desk was also quite cramped. We did have a small balcony, but couldn't figure out how to open the door. Similar to the previous reviewer, we were given no instructions on the room when our luggage was brought up.We also arrived from overseas around 11 am and were told that because other guests in the room wouldn't be checking out until noon that the room wouldn't be ready until around 2 (or possibly 1 at the earliest). We checked our luggage and tried to entertain ourselves, but after an hour of walking around returned to the lobby in the hopes that we could get into the room early. After listening to rather annoying new wave music for nearly 2 hours, we were finally let into our room at 1:55 pm. I have to admit that I was quite disappointed that no efforts were made to attend to our room to accommodate the fact that we had been traveling all night to get to Barcelona.We had also booked the romantic package, but despite previous reference to red bows and rose petals all we got was a bottle of cava delivered to our room.Positives of the hotel include a great location (close to the Ramblas and to several metro stops), very friendly staff (who helped with restaurant recommendations--including a very good nearby tapas bar), free internet, a good breakfast buffet, and a nice roof-top bar (we did not have a drink there though). I haven't stayed in other hotels in Barcelona so don't know how this compares, but I would not rate this hotel as anything special as compared to hotels that I have stayed at in other major cities around the world.
