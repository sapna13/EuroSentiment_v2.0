{"text":"It was sweltering at the Maestri Towers We generally choose to stay in apartments when we travel and enjoy the slightly more relaxed style. Like other reviewers have mentioned the Maestri Towers location is excellent, close to Darling Harbour and the CBD. We left there this morning after a 3 day stay and to be honest this will be our first and last stay at an Oaks property.We are fairly easy going travellers.On the first day our air conditioning was not working (The temperature outside was 40 degrees celcius) and we asked if it could be fixed. We asked again the second day and then the third day but we were offered fans and the airconditioning was not working when we checked out. As other reviewers have stated, you can not leave the windows and balcony doors open because the noise is significant. Security is a bit worrying as the property uses keys rather than security cards and in our case the double lock was not working, we used a chair.In itself this might not put you off on the whole Oaks Group however there was a sense from staff that they really were not concerned about the airconditioning or anything much else and this must start at the top. Small things like no room directory explaining about the premises and how things worked did not exist and the general welcoming front office staff you expect where not there, there was a clear perception of understaffing. The properties 4 star rating must be a real stretch. ","annotations":[]}
