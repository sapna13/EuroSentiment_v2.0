{"text":"wayyyyy to big for me Our visit was in May. We returned from a one week holiday on May 20\/07. The reason for the trip was my niece's wedding. We had hesitated booking for a long time. Due to the malaria information, flight inconveniences etc. My family and I have traveled to Mexico all inclusive resorts extensively. (Probably 20 X's in the last 8 years.) We love the amenities these resorts offer. We were hesitant to travel to the Dominican. The price was high, and other problems that I mentioned.But I really didn't want to miss my niece's wedding so we booked.The flights offered were all horrible. With an 8 hour lay over in either Toronto or Montreal. We traveled for 2 days to get there, and2 days to get home. Terrible. (have been spoiled by all the direct flights to Mexico).There was NO direct flights. Upon arriving, the resort is beautiful. It is what I would expect from a 5 star resort. However, the resort falls short in many areas. The rooms are missing the small touches. Robes, slippers. The mini bar was only restocked every other day,if you wanted more, you paid for it.All 5 star resorts I have stayed at have had 24 hour room service. Not here. The staff were not as friendly as Mexico. The food was onlyaverage, nothing special. Could not have stayed for 2 weeks. The BIGGEST drawback for this resort.. the size. It was wayyyy to big forme. If you happened to be down at the beach, and wanted somethingfrom your room, it was so far to go. I did not like the mini tram\/buses that took you everywhere blowing their diesel fumes. Could not see the ocean from any room. I love ocean front rooms! Some good things though. I was worried about mosquitoes. Only had about 12 bites. Most from one night. So not too bad. The resort was clean. And I wouldn't have missed my niece's wedding for anything. There were 43 of us there. And we were all having similar thoughts on the resort.We had a nice time, have had better elsewhere. We would definitely NOT go back, but glad we have been. Don't like the malaria pills.(still taking them) Mexico here we come!!
