{"text":"Did not like it very much I am surprised that I am the only one who was not impressed by this hotel. Prior to going there, I could not wait to see this trendy hotel and especially after reading all the reviews here.I got the room for 69 Euros\/night which was cheap. However, I thought that there was more to this hotel than what it actually was. First of all, I did not like the idea of checking in through a computer. It felt like I was nobody. However, the staff was REALLY helpful and friendly. I went to my room, and as every guest does when they go into a room like that, I did the wow thing. However, after a few minutes I started realizing how uncomfortable the room was. The sink is tiny and is in the middle of the room. If you spill any water around, you're in trouble. The idea of the rain shower was nice. However, once you get in there, you realize that the shower knobs are extremely uncomfortable to control, especially when you have wet hands. When I wanted to get an extra towel, I tried to use the phone with no luck. I finally went downstairs and asked them how to operate the phone to have towels delivered to my room, they said that they don't have housekeeping services and that I would need to come down and get them myself !!The room itself was small and had no desk or a large table to put your stuff in. Only two tiny tables and that's it. The safe box is tiny. The MoodPad was very hard to operate and I honestly did not like it. I very much prefer to do these things manually. The Do Not Disturb sign is basically a picture of a woman covered in bed sheets saying Don't come in. Someone is naked in this room. I felt very uncomfortable with this sign. In the restaurant downstairs, they had no white sugar! The plastic cups for coffee have a cover yet no hole to drink through! I've never seen something like that before. The train ride to Amsterdam Central takes about 20 minutes. The train runs every 10 minutes I think but once every hour after midnight or so.On the other hand, the bed was very nice and comfortable with 4 pillows. The staff downstairs was also friendly and helpful. I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you find a hotel with the same price in downtown Amsterdam.
