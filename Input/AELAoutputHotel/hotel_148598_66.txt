{"text":"Just Back From the Rio Mar We just returned from the Rio Mar. Our room was very nice, high ceilings, with a ocean view. We found the bed very comfortable, with a nice selection of pillows. The staff was very helpful. Jesus at the concierge desk was very helpful. Had the hand and foot ritual at the Spa. It was a splurge, but I really enjoyed it. We rented a car and did a little exploring. What they say about the Puerto Rican drivers is true! They are truly an aggressive bunch of drivers. Motorcycles zip between lanes. You must use your best defensive driving skills here. We went to the rainforest (it was, OK. )I was dissapointed that we didn't see very many birds or critters of any kind! We took the big tree trail to La Mina falls.We were told it was a flat trail. Wrong! It was up and down hills.When we arrived at the falls, it was so packed with people, we couldn't even dunk our feet in! We also went to Las Plaza Americas, the big mall. It was a very nice, large mall, with all the same stores we have in the States. We ate at the resort. TheItalian restaurant was very pricey, but very good. The bread waswonderful. I had the chicken marsala, and it was very good.My husband had the raviolli stuffed with butternut squash. He said it was like eating desert for dinner. Marabella restaurant was much better priced. We ate there several times and everything we ordered was good. Try the ribs, they had a guava BBQ sauce on them. If you are lucky, you can get served byVladamir. He was good at describing the Puerto Rican dishes. We went out of the resort and up to the top of the hill to Trepas(?).Inexpensive Puerto Rican food with a great view. We had a little difficulty getting the waiter to understand what we wanted, but with some pointing at the menu (in spanish and english), we were able to communicate. The pool area was great. There were plenty of lounge chairs. A very nice waitress strolls through frequently to bring you drinks and snacks. The casino was small, but fun. Lots of 5 cent slots.I didn't see anyone winning much, but it was something to do in the evening. Overall, we had a very relaxing vacation.
