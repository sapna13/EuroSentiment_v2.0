{"text":"Fun Place! I used Marriott Rewards points to book two nights here on a trip that took my mom, neice, her friend, and me from San Francisco to LA. I chose this hotel due to its proximity to Hollywood attractions that I thought would interest my teenage neice and her friend.The hotel did not disappoint.The Mezzanine level of the hotel connects to the adjacent entertainment\/shopping complex, so we could easily access restaurants, movies, and tourist attractions like the Kodak Theater and the Graumann's Chinese theater.We took a Starline Tour and walked the Hollywood Walk of Fame from the hotel. We were also several miles away from the Warner Brothers Studio VIp tour which we also took.The only complaint I had with the hotel was that upon check-in when I inquired about the rollaway bed I had requested I was told it would be sent right up. When time passed and it was not there and we were all wanting to go out I decided to go ahead with our plans and expected the bed would be there upon return. It was not. I called and this time I was told the person who would deliver the bed was on break, but that it should be there in twenty minutes. An hour later I called again and when the person on the other line said At your service I told them that he needed to answer the phone differently based on my experience thus far with the hotel staff. The bed was immediately delivered. When the man who delivered the bed saw there were four of us sharing the room he left and returned not only with extra towels, but extra coffee cups, shampoo and conditioner. I very much appreciated this attention to detail!We ordered room service one night and the food was delivered within the time promised and att he right temperature. The man who delivered the food said that the hotel was very busy and that we should just leave the table outside the door and not to call for pick-up. I was disappointed to see that the table stayed outside the room overnight and was removed mid-morning of the following day. The food itself was delicious and there were no complaints from any of us about it. The only problem we had was they only gave us two flatware services--despite it clearly being four distinct meals with four beverages, etc. Luckily, we had plastic flatware in the room from an earlier take-out meal so we made do using a spoon when a fork might have worked better, etc.The room was clean and the pull-down window shade blocked the sun nicely so we were able to sleep well even though we were on Eastern Standard Time and a bit out of sorts with the Pacific time schedule.All in all it was a good visit. The bell staff delivered our car in a timely fashion though I was a bit annoyed when at check-out two employees chatted away while we waited with our luggage needing to leave for the airport. The driver stopped, backed up, and then stopped so that we could not get to the car. I felt the reason he did this was that the bellman were busy loading the luggage of guests ahead of us and that if he pulled up we might load the car ourselves rather than waiting for the assistance of the bellmen depriving them of their tip. I don't know that this was the case, but it was annoying to me as we were watching the clock and anxious to get on our way. It was frustrating to see our car yards a way and the driver and another employee (the person who we had given our car receipt to for picking up the car) just joking around while we waited and waited and waited......Other than that the staff was friendly and helpful. I used the concierge's service several times for directions and they were always on the mark.The gift shop at the hotel is very tiny and cramped, but almost anything you need is within walking distance to the hotel. There is a Starbucks in the adjacent shopping center and another right down the street, as well as another take-out place with fruit bowls, pastries, breakfast sandwiches, etc.-I think it was called Fatima's.This is a very good location for seeing the area. The hotel itself was very quiet and the view of the Hollywood sign out the window of the hotel was nice.
