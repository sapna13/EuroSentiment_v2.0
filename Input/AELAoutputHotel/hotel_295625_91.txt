{"text":"Caravaggio was a lifesaver! When my family and I got into Florence, we arrived at our hostel and found out that although it said Shared Rooms, Shared Bathrooms there were only tents on the property. Because we were staying in Florence for three nights, there was no way that we could stay for that long. We used their internet access at the hostel and found the Caravaggio. My aunt called and within 10 minutes, we had the hotel booked, two rooms for five people. We arrived after that phone call in about 20 minutes and everything was ready for us. Elisa, one of the people at the reception, was incredibly helpful and kind. She went above and beyond her call of duty (and we used her help much more during our stay)! The hotel is located on a square and there is a lot of night life there (bands, etc) so if noise bothers you, make sure to ask for a room in the back. The rooms back there are very peaceful and quiet. The hotel used to be an old palace that was reconstructed into very comfortable rooms. The room has all the amenities that are expected (wet bar, television, phone, etc) and the bathroom is spacious enough and has very modern appliances. On the main floor, there is a bar, lounge, a outdoor courtyard, and a computer with internet access (but for the reasonable price of one euro per 15 minutes). Also, there is a complimentary breakfast provided each morning from 7:30-11. This hotel was a beautiful place in a wonderful locale in Firenze that was moderately priced. The hotel Caravaggio is an excellent place to stay and was a lifesaver for my family! ","annotations":[]}
