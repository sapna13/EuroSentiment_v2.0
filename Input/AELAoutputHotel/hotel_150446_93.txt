{"text":"Great spring break getaway for family We found the hotel to be just what the doctor ordered...our trip away from cold Ky. was much needed! The staff was fabulous - from our first moment of getting out of the taxi, until the moment we got back in a taxi to the airport. In fact - at check in, we were upgraded to an ocean view room - when we had booked a garden view room. We were booked for a Triple A room rate, too. I didn't even ask for the upgrade, it was just offered to us. My one thought was - at the time of booking I thought to enter my Priority Membership Card since the Intercontinenal is part of that family of hotels. I'm not in it for the points, but I've heard that sometimes you can get upgraded to a better floor or get some better amenities with just being a member (and membership is free). So...maybe just having that member number on the reservation helped. Who knows. Anyway - the view was GREAT. Pool was FABULOUS. Our 7 year old couldn't get enough! Food at hotel IS expensive. However - if you want to splurge - the Japanese restaurant is good and a hit with kids. The Ruth's Chris steakhouse is also excellent. There is a bakery across the street that has cheap breakfast - like bagels and pancakes. Also , Mi Casita, a Puerto Rican restaurant across the street, is a nice alternative. Not totally cheap - but better priced than the hotel. Go to Walgreens down the street for snacks\/groceries. You can put stuff in the in-room fridge for b'fast (we did). There's a subway across the street - and Domino's pizza. Pizza Hut is nearby as is Wendy's. We HIGHLY recommend a tour to the Rain Forest. We booked it through the concierge the day before - and it was well worth it. Again - the hotel was wonderful for our needs. Room was clean, not totally fashionable - but beds were comfy. All other parts of the hotel were beautiful. I felt extremely safe - and felt comfortable with my 7 year old running around the pool. The staff could not have been nicer. We plan to return to Puerto Rico, and if we return to the San Juan - we would definitely stay at the Intercontinental again. Flight note: if you fly Delta - we found out you can change your flight time on the same day for just $50 per ticket if you call within 3 hours of the flight you would like to take (if there is space). We were able to take an earlier flight from home and get an extra half day in the sun. By doing this we didn't have to pay a full ticket change fee or pay new charges on a new ticket.
