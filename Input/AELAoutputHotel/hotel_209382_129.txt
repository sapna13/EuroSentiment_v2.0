{"text":"Sleep on the Subway it is Better What a horrible experience, we booked on Hotwire and there was nobody in the hotel but they gave us the worst room ever probably because of how we booked it. First of all our room had blemishes on the wall, dust everywhere and also black curly hairs in various places in the washroom. This website requested I review the room and therefore I am. When we went to lower the blinds to go to sleep around 10pm as we had to leave at 5am the blinds came crashing down and could not be fixed. It then took them an hour to move us to another room and then they tried to incredulously charge me for some drinks we did not have. I would never stay there ever again, the manager on duty did not care at all for servicing her clients and empathizing with the needs of the guests. It was almost like she felt it was our fault that the entire apparatus for holding up the blinds came crashing down at 10pm and we inconvenienced her. Then to say it would take 10 minutes but it took an hour to move rooms. Honesty and Integrity do not equal the Millennium UN Plaza Hotel.I called the hotel to discuss the issue with the director but they did not know how to handle the call. I was given the voicemail of someone in the service department. It is completely out of order with no process or pride for the manner in which the establishment is run.
