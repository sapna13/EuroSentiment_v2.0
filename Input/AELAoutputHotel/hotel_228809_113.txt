{"text":"Excellent disabled room We booked the disabled room, which is located besides the reception and we stayed five nights in the hotel. The room had enough space for the two wheelchairs of my wife (one for normal use and one to be connected to a electric powered wheel). While I was having business meetings she could go where she wanted go through entire Paris autonomously, because most sidewalks are lowered down to street level at the corners. The room was very clean and very quiet! Especially the latter is rare in noisy Paris! There are some good restaurants in the vicinity. The entrance of the hotel is also rather good for wheelchairs. From the sidewalk only a little step of 2 - 4 cm has to be taken. Most wheel chair drivers can manage that. When ever you have a problem, the people at the reception are very friendly and helpful. In my view this room is very adequeate for people in a wheelchair. Some positive suggestions for the management: 1. In the bathroom there is no screen or curtain to prevent water splashing on the ground surface. It was no problem for my disabled wife when she took a bath, but when I took a shower, standing upright, I could not prevent that a lot of water came on the ground surface. 2. Also the flexible water supply is too short for a normal person taking a shower. Holding the shower head just above my head it sqeezed off the water supply. 3. Further, the place to put your bath room stuff (shaving kit, make up and other things) is far to small. Twice, I moved my hair comb on the one side and at the other side of the glass plank the glass fell into the sink. It was broken both times (sorry manager...). Anyhow, the next time that we will come to Paris, we will again go to this hotel. ","annotations":[]}
