{"text":"We could not fault the Colomba! We travelled to Florence for a weekend break. The flight went smoothly, we got a great, chatty taxi driver and the weather was glorious.Rosanna and her husband who own the Colomba are lovely and as Rosanna spent some time in Australia, her English is brilliant for all us lazy Brits who don;t speak Italian. The Colomba is on the 2nd floor of a palace building about 300 yards from Il Duomo and only about 10 minutes from the railway station. There is also a bus stops ritght outside goes to the station or up to Fiesole.The lift is bijou! 3 people max or 2 and their cases - just. But it works perfectly well.The rooms are large with air con, fabulous shower in the big bathroom, enormous 6' wide very comfortable bed, wardrobe and lots of drawer space, safe, fridge with mini-bar, and a window looking out over a series of gardens, yards and courtyards. They don't ring the Duomo bells at night but they are lovely to hear in the morning.Nothing was too much trouble for the staff or Rosanna, free internet! Borrow an iron and board, no problem, a map? recommedndation for a restaurant? museum reservations? (Do this in advance of arrival through Rosanna)Breakfast, coffee or tea any way up, fruit juices, cereals, cold meats cheeses, breads, jams, honey. Boiled eggs, everything you could wish for.Actually, I am almost reluctant to recommend the Colomba because they may not have space for us when we go back!!Thank you Rosanna and everyone for giving us such a happy stay.
