{"text":"good hotel trying to be too trendy The Apex ticked most of the boxes for a four star hotel - the room was meticulously clean, marvellous white sheets, duvet and miraculously, clean pillows that smelt new - bathroom sparkling with excellent bath products - and a refrigerator for our use was a lovely touch, especially as it was not possible to have a drink in the hotel. (See more on this later.) We had booked and paid for english breakfasts (when in Rome...) but on seeing their continental breakfast spread I opted for that - good really fresh fruit, including strawberries, melon and pineapple, a selection of cheese and cold meats, smoked salmon, breads, croissants and sweet pastries, plus of course fruit topped yoghourt and the usual cereals. (10\/10!) Very civilized.Now the negatives - I never saw anyone actually eating in the Bistro - overly trendy menu full of pesto, rocket, etc. and very pricey. Ditto with the bar - no english beer on tap, just Czech Pils and bottled foreign beer - a pint of Pils and a glass of Pinot Grigio with tip was √ä√£¬¢11! Too much, I am afraid. If they had some local beer, and more reasonable wine, and some wholesome untrendy meals in their Bistro they would have got a lot more of our sterling which we would have loved to spend in our hotel, without having to go out footsore at the end of the day seeking dinner. (Especially on the weekend, when many of the pubs and restaurants in the area are closed.)Staff were very pleasant. I would recommend the hotel to friends, yes, apart from the pub and the Bistro.
