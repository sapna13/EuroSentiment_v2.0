{"text":"A Pleasant Stay This hotel is a very good place to stay. It has old world charm to it -- not some cookie-cutter business hotel. It has a beautiful restaurant and lobby area -- very 19th century. The rooms are also quaint, although a little small. The area was quiet and off the main drags (even though the Hard Rock Cafe is right across the street!).The staff here were all wonderful and very helpful -- spoke great English and were always willing to help out. They gave me a good map of the city to use.Free newspapers in the lobby -- although none were in English. There was a good events newspaper that I used heavily (in English).The hotel is very close to no less than 4 different S-bahn or U-bahn (subway\/train) stops. Very easy to base from here and then go any number of directions in the city. It's also very central to many attractions -- such as Charlottenburg, Ka De We, the Zoo, Kurfurstendam, Europe Center. It's not near the new city center though -- but easy access via subways. It was also very easy to get to Tegel airport from here. I walked over to the Zoologischer Garten S-bahn station and caught a 20 minute bus to Tegel for 2.10 Euros -- much cheaper than a taxi (bus runs every 10-15 minutes). It was also easy to get here from the Hauptbahnhof using the S-bahn (straight shot -- no connections).There was one computer with free internet in an office room near the lobby. The room was always open and available. (Nice room too, with a large table and office paper and pens laid out)The bathrooms were fine -- good shower. I didn't have the typical twin bed as a single. I think it was 2 twins put together, but that was better than just one! There were big pillows too! There was no air conditioning, but it wasn't very hot while I was there.Some negatives: 1.) Breakfast was extra and cost 14 Euros. I thought that was a bit pricey for breakfast (especially since that equates to about $19. (It sounds like it was a big breakfast, but I didn't ever go, because of the cost.) 2.) There was no safe in the room, although the staff was very willing to lock up things at the reception 3.) Minibar items were too expensive 4.) Halls can sometimes be a little noisy, because of the old doors closing, etc. 5.) Hotel restaurant looked good, but it was pricey and limited selection (with high-end choices). You weren't going to get a basic Jaegerschnitzel here. The dining room had a beautiful ambience, though. 6.) No coffee\/tea making facilities and I didn't see available any in the lobby either.All in all, I liked the hotel, enjoyed my stay there, and would consider staying there again. Like I said, the staff was terrific and did their best to make sure I had a pleasant stay. The room ran me about 70 Euros a night (without breakfast). I guess that isn't too bad a deal in Berlin, but I wouldn't say it was a great deal either. Nice, safe, decent hotel.
