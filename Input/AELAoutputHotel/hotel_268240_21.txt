{"text":"Club Quarters SF a great find. We visit SF often and were thrilled to find an inexpensive place in a great location (walk easily to Ferry Building gourmet world, Chinatown and North Beach) at a reasonable price, especially since the building was new and very clean, as compared to the vintage lower priced hotels. The complaint about small room and small bed must have been from two people trying to stay in a single person room; we had a standard, with Queen bed, and it was large enough. Nothing bumped into anything and there was room for luggage next to the bed and next to the easy chair and next to the work desk. True, few amenities, no luxury, and since I never depend on hotel shampoo, who cares if it is mediocre. Our towels were very fluffy, even though we only got one washcloth. When we asked for extra toilet paper (my mistake; I didn't see the extra roll already there) two rolls were delivered within 5 minutes. The air conditioner and heating unit worked perfectly (from the thermostat on the wall) and was unusually quiet. And by the way, new buildings in San Francisco are not allowed to have windows that open, because of the overuse of utilities that would occur. Noisy guests can be found in any hotel, even 4 star hotels. As for the restaurant downstairs, why would anyone eat there when there are dozens of Zagat rated and dozens of moderate restaurants nearby, including a dozen in the Embarcadero Center across the street and in the Ferry Building 3 blocks away; do your homework!! iIn short, we will return to Club Quarters in San Francisco whenever we can.
