{"text":"Substandard, overpriced My wife and I stayed here for several nights. Our room on the fifth floor was small with nothing in particular to suggest any luxury except a full length mirror partially concealed by one of the beds. The room had a bad smell which on the last day we finally determined was coming from the mattresses. The room was equipped with fairly standard appliances, coffee maker, iron, and hair dryer. The TV was a modest flat screen TV. The bathroom had one sink. The toilet was in a separate small room with a wall phone next to it for some reason. There was a minibar which was wildly overpriced. A can of coke cost $3.50.There is a large pool in back with extensive landscaping. Beyond the pool, a door takes you to the beach. The beach seemed clean but otherwise nothing special. The restaurants in the hotel seemed very expensive. We had planned to try the casual one but found it inexplicably closed. There are other restaurants within walking distance of varying quality and cost. The ones in hotels are invariably overpriced. Probably the best bet bet is the Metropol restaurant across the street. There is little to see or do at this location. There is a cockfighting arena across the street and that is about it. A taxi to Old San Juan costs about $42 roundtrip without tips but offers considerably more nightlife than Isla Verde. We went into the rather dreary casino at the Ritz but only to use the ATM.Excursions from the hotel are handled by Castillo Tours which has a small office there. We tried the catamaran snorkel trip. Perhaps because there were only 5 people booked, we were driven to Fajardo, the hopping off point for the trip, and unceremoniously dumped on the boat of a totally different tour operator who operated on the cheap. For example, while we were told that we would receive brand new snorkels we could keep, the snorkels used were old and well worn, held onto the masks by rubber bands and when one woman asked if she could keep hers, she was told a firm 'no'. We were offered no explanation or apology from Castillo Tours. It is rare to encounter this kind of dishonesty but despite the convenience of having the tour operater in the hotel, I would strongly suggest booking elsewhere.The hotel seems to be significantly overpriced. Our room had problems which would have been a concern at any price. Beyond the public areas of the hotel there is little to do in the area. The bars and restaurants in the hotel are wildly overpriced with a mojito for example costing $14. A big improvement would be to offer some form of shuttle service between the airport and the hotel and between the hotel and Old San Juan. But first the hotel must throw out those horrible smelly mattresses.
