{"text":"Our nightmare in Puerto Rico Here are a few examples of our nightmare in Gran Melia Puerto Rico. If you need more examples, please simply scroll down. Also check this, the approximated score from the reviews are about 3.5; this is a good evaluation for a Four Diamond Hotel?I wasted 1 hour waiting to check-in, is ridiculous and you are very lucky if they have a room ready. My brother√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ room at check-in was not ready at 3pm, and it took 4 hours to check him, also I requested a crib for my baby and after 8 hours they come out with an old Pack √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√Æ Play.YES, the resort is isolated and there is no place to eat... and YES, It is a 3 or 4 miles from the main road, so you are stuck there to eat the awful food they put at the buffet or √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬©estaurants√à√\u2020\u2022?everyday. AND don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ forget to make a reservation at your arrival or you will end ordering from the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬©oom-disservice√à√\u2020\u2022?Most of the staff was not helpful or friendly at all, in some cases, very rude.The limited selection from the 3 out of the 6 expensive restaurants that were open wasn't very good or good at all, specially the Italian√à√\u2020\u2022?Before you leave the front desk at your check-out, CHECK VERY CAREFULLY YOUR STATEMENT; they charged us $134 twice for a lunch.To finish√à√\u2020\u2022?ask for the beach at the Hotel and you will receive a JA JA JA as a response. Sorry guys but you are going to spend so many ours in the pool on a beautiful island in the Caribbean. Is this bizarre or what? ","annotations":[]}
