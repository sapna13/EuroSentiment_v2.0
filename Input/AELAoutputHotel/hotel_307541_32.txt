{"text":"Best Hotel in Sanur We stayed at the Bali Hyatt for 12 nights in April. The hotel itself was great, the staff were lovely, and the gardens were amazing. The two pools were nice although the sun beds around the pools were taken quite early, however there were enough beds to sit in the gardens or on the beach which was a lot quieter. The breakfast was lovely, filtered coffee and lots of choice. We used room service a few times which was good and the prices were not too expensive although it is a lot cheaper to eat outside the hotel. The rooms were lovely although we had read the rooms were tired (not the case with ours at all). We had an ocean view room and our room was lovely. The pillows and king size bed were so comfortable and the towels were big and thick. The sink plug hole did occasionally smell but that wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really a problem. The room was not humid as you have a machine in the room to control this. The spa is nice but very expensive compared to outside the hotel. If you like a nice hotel and you do want to visit Bali and Sanur then this hotel is really traditional and pretty.We ate out at a place called 'The Village' a few times and this cost about √ä√£¬¢20 for two people in total (more expensive than the other restaurants we went to) but is the nicest looking restaurant in Sanur just past Hardy's supermarket. We expected Sanur to be quiet, but not as quiet as it was. We were going in about 10pm most nights after our meal as there aren't many bars at all. Sometimes it felt like we were the only tourists walking back to our hotel. The people are friendly and not once did we feel unsafe even when we went to Kuta for a few hours. The weather was fantastic; I think we only had 10 mins of rain in 12 days. This was our first trip to Bali and even though we loved this hotel if you go beyond the beach outside the Bali Hyatt it isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ very nice, it was quite disappointing. The beach at the hotel is lovely but the sea is full of seaweed and not very inviting considering you are in the Indian Ocean. The beach to the left and right of the hotel isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ very nice. There are stalls\/shops either side of the hotel and you do get asked a number of times if you want transport or a massage and the rubbish on the beaches outside these stalls is not very nice. If you are expecting paradise when you go to Bali I think you maybe a bit disappointed. We thought the country itself was pretty and green when we travelled outside the hotel to see the Rice Fields and moutains etc but they should really keep the beaches tidy as that was a total put off, you do not see or hear about this so just be aware. We visited the sister hotel (Grand Hyatt) at Nusa Dua and even though this hotel was new and fantastic, once you walk along the lovely beach in Nusa Dusa we came across flip flops, corn on a cob and loads of empty crisp packets etc. Not our idea of paradise I am afraid. I just think it would not take much to keep on top of these beaches. I appreciate it is a third world country and we have been to a lot of places including India and Thailand but haven√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ experienced rubbish on the beach like this before. But if you are happy to stay in the hotel grounds then this is a lovely hotel although expensive to eat and drink in compared to eating outside.
