{"text":"Overpriced and average but convenient I have stayed several times at the Sheraton at Frankfurt Airport. I haven't seen any benefit from being a member of the Starwood Preferred Guest programme (including not being on an SPG floor).The rooms are OK - the furnishings aren't bad but you might expect something better from a 4* at this price. Rooms I've stayed in had a regular TV, a cordless phone and desk area, but no minibar. The bed is comfortable but I don't like the way the duvet consists of two separate single duvets laid onto a double bed (so you have to overlap them). Room service after 11:15pm has very sparse options (basically a selection of ghoulash, a few pizzas or sandwiches), which considering this is an international airport hotel where people are coming and going at all hours is not convenient. The breakfast buffet in the Flavors restaurant has a good selection. The Lemons and Limes bars look stylish, but are typical airport bars √à√\u2020\u2022?given the transient nature of the hotel it's probably hard to create too much atmosphere.The front desk staff are generally quite slow, but most of all pretty lacking in smiles, politeness or service - it's just average. I find the hotel somewhat soulless, even more so than some other airport hotels. Perhaps this rubs off on the staff, who see faces come and go on short term stays and seem pretty unenthused about anything other than giving average service.Overall I don't think the hotel is very good value (given the quite high prices), but what you're paying for is the (considerable) convenience of it being adjoined via skywalk to Terminal 1. It's not a terrible hotel, but it's not great.
