{"text":"Good, solid relaxing time We are in our 40's and went to Punta Cana primarily for the sun and sea. We also wanted some comfort having done the hostel type of vacation for many years when our kids were young. We got what we were looking for, a comfortable room with a clean bathroom, a great beach and warm waters. We arrived at the hotel at 3pm and were checked in immediately and were told of the $25 fee for the safety deposit box in the room. This is a common practice throughout the DR and Cuba so it came as no surprise. We received our key cards, towel chits and barcelets then were escorted to building 12 -207. It seemed a far walk to start off with but after travelling 5 hours, a delay of 2 hours and then a bus ride of 45 mins time and distance were hard to judge. We later timed ourselves and it was less than 3 minutes. Not much at all. However, the place is big and once you had walked from your building to the beach and then down to where the towel hut was and then to the main lobby where the large buffet was, you had probably been walking around for a good 10 minutes or more. We had purchased a deluxe package with concierge service, meaning a king size bed suite, a balcony or patio with garden view, turn-down service, robes to wear, 2 free 30 min massages, 10% discount at the spa, a fruit plate and a bottle of champagne. There was no fruit plate or welcome bottle nor robes etc. As we were tired we decided to find out why the next morning. We went straight to the Air Canada rep, Catherine, who checked our reservation and sent us to see Laura at the concierge desk. Laura was fantastic and everything was settled within 20 minutes. we even got free internet access daily. THe massages on the beach were extremely relaxing, The only thing strange was the bottle of champagne turned out to be a bottle of vodka. With regards to the size of the resort and the friendliness of the staff, we found the place too big to get really friendly with any of them. By the end of the week they recognized our faces but not our names. Of course, unless you were one of the booze-hounds, one of the flirty girls or one of the major loud-mouths, then they knew those names and were polite in English to them, but what they said about them in their own language was a different story but I was in complete agreement. The only really down side was the repeated yelling, swearing and running through the buildings every morning by the overly drunk american college students returning from the Mangu disco at 4am. The fights between security and\/or the boy\/girl stuff was extremely annoying.
