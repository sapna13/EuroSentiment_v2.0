{"text":"Just about OK I stayed here on business for two niight. On the positive side, I found the room size relatively good .The breakfast was also good. Wide selection of food and fresh orange juice. I hate the watery juice that is often served in hotels. It was also easy to get a cab from outside the hotel whenever we needed one. Staff friendly but incompetent.Negative - Staff, though friendly, didn`t seem particularly well-trained. e.g. my colleague had to struggle to explain to the breakfast staff what decaff coffee is. The staff member on reception didn`t know where one of the main conference centres was. That kind of thing. You just expect better from a 4 star hotel. Colleagues of mine ringing the hotel rang me several times on my mobile because they did not get any reply from the switchboard (!) The second big negative is the equipment. They seem to have one iron for the whole building. When I finally got it, they told me there was no ironing board. My female colleague ask for a replacement hair drier to be sent up and specifically NOT a maintenance man but still she got the maintenance man which is not what she wanted at 7am in her underwear. Maybe it is just the language barrier and they say they understand but do not. I don`t konw. They also have a problem with the heating - it was almost impossible to turn off. Same with my colleagues room. Overall, the breakfast and size of the room - and comfort of bed -would make me possibly consider staying here again but there were so many negatives and so many other hotels, I would look elsewhere first. Tip: Try to get a room at the front or side - the rooms at the back looking onto the courtyard are very dark.
