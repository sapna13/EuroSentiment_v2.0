{"text":"Loved It! Hola!! Let me start off by saying that some people complain about everything and will never be happy. I like to stay at 4.5- 5 star resorts and this exceeded my standards! If you are looking for a great resort on a beautiful beach, this is the place to go! I am Travel Agent from Canada and I traveled to the Palladium Punta Cana from April 27 √à√\u2020\u2022?May 4, 2008. There were 7 of us ranging from ages 21-26.We booked through Apple Vacations and flew USA 3000. The flights were great and on time! Apple Vacations is a good company.We arrived at about noon and requested early check-in, which was granted to us! We stayed in block 2000. We had rooms 2029, 2028, and 2006. I would recommend Block 2000 as you are right beside the activity pool, a restaurant and right on the beach! It was about 30 steps from our room to the beach! It was a great location! Block 2000 or 3000 would be good.The rooms were great in the Punta Cana section. They cleaned the room in the morning and then maid on the late shift would come through and clean again and give you fresh towels. One of our rooms had 3 people in it, and when we arrived they already had the rollaway bed we requested in the room. The staff at the resort was great and very eager to please you.On the third day our air conditioning was pretty loud and making some weird noises. We called down at about 11am and they said they would come fix it. We got back to the room at around 1 and the air conditioning was fixed. It was great how fast they fixed it. That was really the only problem and I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really call that a problem.Yes, the resort is large. But that is what I enjoyed about it the most. It didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel crowded even though the resort was full. There is a tram going around. This is great if it is raining as it is covered. I found walking was the fastest way to get around as we beat the tram by 10 minutes at least every time.The food was great at this resort. There are so many restaurants to choose from. The Bavaro buffet was the best out of the buffets. The drinks were good and the bartenders were amazing! We loved Freddy at the Disco!! The disco was a good time. We had a great time because we met so many people and we made it fun. The sports bar is great because it is right beside the disco and open 24 hours. They have pizza, fries, nachos, sandwiches, desserts, salads, and tons to choose from at the sports bar! Great for after the disco!The grounds of the resort were kept very clean. The pools were amazing. Very big, free form, tones of room for everyone. We had no problem finding chairs at the beach or the pool at any time. We did see some people put their towels out the night before which I found ridiculous. There is a jetted tub in each bathroom which was nice. We did do excursions and booked through the Apple Vacations rep in the Bavaro lobby. I would highly recommend the Dolphin Island excursion! It is about $110 US but well worth it! All 7 of us were in the sea in a blocked off area with 2 dolphins. Very good value for your money! Also, we did the ATVS (so fun) and the Outback Safari! Our group recommends all 3 tours.The POP animation team is one of the best I have seen in my experiences at other resorts. They all can dance so well and try so hard to get everyone involved. You see them there at 9am and you see them at the disco at 11pm trying to get everyone involved. They work very hard and do an awesome job!I could go on forever about how great this resort it. We walked 2 and half hours down the beach and saw many resorts. I though the set up of ours was one of the best. Tons of palm trees as well! Some resorts barley had any! We found pools and restaurants on our last day that we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even know existed! You can be active at this resort or you can relax in quieter areas of the resort.If you are looking for a great 4.5-5 star resort with good food, drinks and service with clean rooms, this is the resort to go to!!
