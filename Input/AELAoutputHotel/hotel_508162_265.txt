{"text":"Dreams - Punta Cana, the best vacation we ever had This was the best vacation we have ever had in 20 years of marriage. We have been all over the world and this place was by far the best. The food was excellant and there were plenty of different restaurants to choose from. The best for me personally was the Chinese. They had a wide selection in the World Cafe. The only thing that was missing for us was ranch dressing and flavored creamers. But not a problem I will just bring our own next time we visit. The Entertainment team was the greatest. The guys and girls were extremely polite and went out of their way for all the guests not just us but several did treat us like we were special. Those were Melkis, Angel, Meky Mouse, 50-cent, DJ TuTo, Stephanie, Usher, Luis and Michael Jackson. My teenage daughter Cassie made some special friends(see above) and she cried all the way back to Miami ( was already missing her new found friends) She wants us to buy a vacation home there.We plan to visit there next year and hope to bring the rest of the family. The Dance team was fantastic, the shows were great. My husband and I were in the True Love show and I have never laughed so hard. We didn't win but we sure had fun. We also met some wonderful people from the USA, Ireland and England. Maybe we could do a reunion same place , same time next year. We took 2 excursions , they were OK but now that I look back, We will not take any next year but just stay at the resort and have more fun. Again I would like the thank everyone at Dreams Punta Cana for a wonderful time.......Ann Owen, Florida USA ","annotations":[{"endOffset":316,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":309},{"endOffset":420,"mention":"ranch dressing","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ranch_dressing"],"startOffset":406}]}
