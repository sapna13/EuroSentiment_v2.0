{"text":"Awful The rooms in this hotel are awful and nothing like the pictures that were featured in the trailfinders brochure that we booked from. They are outdated and grubby and in serious need of refurbishment. The first room we were given had a serious damp problem (no 1112) and one wall was all lumpy due to the damp on the plaster beneath, but rather than deal with the problem, the hotel had just tried to crudely cover it up with some new wallpaper. When I asked to move rooms they told me that we had been given one of their best standard rooms as we were on honeymoon (this just meant that we got a glimpse of the side of the harbour where the China Ferries dock, past an office building. In my humble opinion, not exactly a view to die for). They then showed me to another room that was the same grubby outdated decor, but at least it didn't appear to have a damp problem. The lady who showed me to the new room told me that they have had a lot of guests complain about the rooms, but they are always busy so they don't want to close to renovate. Clearly they are only busy because of first time chumps like us who didn't realise how bad it was, and are not interested in making the hotel a nice experience so that they get repeat bookings. This hotel is awful and I will be warning off everyone I can from staying there. I don't know what hotels the reviewer below who said this hotel was the best in the world has been staying at before, but it seems to me they are either connected with the hotel, or their review relates to a different hotel entirely. Whilst the shopping centre attached to the hotel is nice (Harbour City), Kowloon is very frustrating if you are western, and this is not because of the locals. As you walk along the street you will see many Indian men loitering, waiting for westerners to walk past to offer copy handbags, copy watches or the services of a British tailor. This gets very annoying as even if you walk on the other side of the pavement and there are many local Chinese people in between you and them, they will push through to target you just because you are western and they know that you are on holiday. My hubby got so annoyed with one that kept talking at us even though it was clear that we weren't interested that he shushed him, which did not go down well. These men really spoilt our enjoyment of the place, and as there are none over on the Island, we wish we'd stayed on the other side of the harbour instead.
