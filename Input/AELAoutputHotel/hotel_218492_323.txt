{"text":"Great resort, but will not be back We have just returned from a week at the Globalia on April the 24th very nice and tropical. Check-in time was 3:00pm we had to wait 4 hour for our room to be ready. The room was nice on the 1st floor, clean but noisy as it was on the gound level in block 5 and close to the beach,high traffic. After complaining they moved us to the 3rd floor with side ocean view great rooms.Buffett dinner at the Windows resturant had variety and was good. We ate at all 2 of the a la carte resturants, but didn't enjoy them had to return to the buffet resturant to finish dinner. My daugther is vegiterian and there is nothing for her at the a la card resturants, Make your reservations early. Lunch was usually the same everyday at the beach resturant, Pizza , chicken  rice. But we sat outside and viewed the ocean while we ate, beautiful  relaxing. The beach was beautiful, white sand, but lot of sea weeds on the ocean and the beach side. never took more than one dip., get your lounge chair early arround 5 am or you will not be able to get one. My wife and i walked on the beach every morning  all lounge chairs under umbrellas at beach  pool were taken. The weather was not that Great! rain some times and Sunny  warm another. Water sport is a joke , you have to be there by 9 am sharp to put your name on a list for a free lesson , not one minute before, even if you book, you will never go as its always to calm (no wind) or to windy cant go, they want you to by insurance to take the katamran out $ 5 for 30 minute. We had some problems with the rooms, no towels, air-conditioning leaks. All of this would not have been much of a problem, except when we reported these problems it was looked after but after some time. Our kids had a great time as this was their first tripto the Dominican. What upsets us most is the harrasment you will get at the resort and on the beach when you go for a walk. On the resort sales people want to sell you trips, water activities etc. and the photographer will walk arround alomst ever hour with some exotic animals and ask you if you want to have your picture taken with the animanls. Money grab $ 8 for a 5X4 print or they could put it on a CD for $5 a picture minimum 6 picture. The shpos on the resorts are not better than the beach they are hunders time more expensive and you will still be harrassed once you pass infront of them. I would not return to this hotel again nore the Dominican there mentality is that you paid for this trip so you can afford to pay for other things too. There were just too many inconsistencies in service.
