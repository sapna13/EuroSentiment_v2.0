{"text":"Wouldn't go back to the RIU What was good...the staff was friendly and the food was good.What was bad....Went to the disco (which is open to the public), our male friends were approached by prostitutes and a drug dealers that were both persistent. So no more disco.The walls were paper thin and I am a light sleeper so because of the screaming German children at 6:30am, 7am and 7:45am in the echo chamber that is the hallway outside your room, I got less sleep than during a regular workweek. The phone number provided by the agent was disconnected, the only phone number that works rings into the RIU Palace and then you have to ask for Bambu reception then the room number. And sometimes NO one would even answer the phone so I had to make phone calls from my room costing me $80.00 US.The pool bar is good until the kids start jumping around you and splashing everyone while their parents ignore it or are not even around.The activities board is not right and I prefer the resorts that hand out photocopied itineraries because we would constantly have to check the board.Take a watch or some time piece, the maid would turn off the room power every day and the clock would have to be reset.Take big cups...6 oz cups on steaming hot days are worthless.Air conditioner does NOT keep up, room was warm.I have stayed at the Iberostar resort next to the RIU and would book there...at least I got to sleep.
