{"text":"Excellence is Excellenti!! Well were shall I start.Restaurants:All restaurants were amazing, the only one we were unable to eat at is the French Restaurant, and there was always a long wait. We usually eat supper around 8pm.The Pizza restaurant for a late night snack was awesome but be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for your Pizza. We usually went there after the show, which was around 12am. Many people would head there for a snack, which caused a little backlog....but when you are on vacation...who cares!The service in all restaurants was amazing; every detail has been taken care of. What we loved most is there are no reservations required at all restaurants. It makes things more relaxed.Rooms:The rooms were spacious and nice, the hotels claims they have wifi in every room. The signal is extremely poor; we were originally in building 11 which is quite far from the lobby. We requested a room change, something closer to the lobby. They moved us to building 2; the wifi signal was still poor. The best signal is in the lobby, so I would take my laptop to the bar in the morning, have a great cappuccino and connect to the net...what a life! Ha-haThe only negative about our room 2208 was the Air Conditioning was not working well. We complained a few times, they sent people to play with the thermostat...the problem were never resolved and I did not feel like changing rooms again. The temp. In the room was OK for sleeping.Pools:Beautiful.Beaches:Beautiful, the ocean is rough, but we knew that when we booked there. Entertainment:The evening shows were OK. At least they try and succeed to entertain us.Bars:Bars are all awesome, all drinks are freshly made. Bar staff are awesome.Check-inEverything was smooth, no problems. The bus ride from the airport is 1 hour and 15 minutes.
