{"text":"Service was excellent I just got back from the Tropical Princess in Punta Cana and we had a blast. Contrary to what a lot of other reviewers stated, the workers were extremely friendly and helpful. If you tipped them or knew a little Spanish, you were treated like kings. The resort was filled to capacity, and I think we were the only people from the US. Most of the other tourists were from Italy, Germany, France, or Russia and spoke little or no English. I also noticed that the Europeans never or hardly ever tip. I'm not sure if that is a cultural thing or if that they are just outright cheap. Make sure you give a dollar or two for every drink or meal. You'll make a lot of good friends fast and you'll get excellent service. The resort grounds were beautiful. Workers were outside all day combing the grounds for any imperfections. The only thing I didn't like was a smell that resembled sewage a few tropical trees gave off. These trees had what looked like berries hanging from them so we called them Poopberry Trees. Most of the tourists are families or couples so it isn't the best place for singles. I went with one friend and we are both single, but we still ended up having a great time. We met a few good looking Italian women who didn't speak English so nothing became of that. The club Arieto on the grounds was a good time, but not the best club for singles, unless you want to pay for a night with a Dominican woman. Dominican women are exceptionally gorgeous. They would come up and flirt with you a lot, but would then tell you how much they cost. I wasn't really into that. I went off of the resort into the inner Dominican and found everyone to be friendly. I didn't run into any problems. If you rent a car, don't let your Dominican friend borrow it because he will probably total it. It was interesting riding the cabs located right off the resort. These were composed of dirt bikes where my friend and I would climb on the back. We both average around 220 pounds so picture three people on one of these little dirt bikes weaving in and out of traffic. One time, the driver couldn't make a turn and we crashed right into a car waiting at a stop sign. He was not too happy with the dents in the side of his car and his broken mirror. We fled that scene quickly. The Mamajuana is a different kind of liquor and I haven't seen it in the US. Ask to try some at one of the bars. Don't drink too much during the day. The combination of alcohol and the hot sun will wear you out fast. Ask for Hansel at the Brazilian restaurant and tell him Mike and Tim sent you. He'll take care of you. Make sure you get the VIP package (it was very well worth it). Don't order any drinks with ice in them. I was very sick for a day because of this. We at El Pescador one night and the dinner was awesome. The buffet didn't have a huge variety, but the fresh fruit and pastries made up for it. The pizza was very good there. Make sure you give some beers to the workers throughout the day. They will appreciate it very much. We were there for Hurricane Dean for a day, which was an interesting experience to be part of. The crepes and gelato at La Creperie were awesome. The pools were beautiful. They closed at 7pm, but no one monitored them to see if you went in after that. The spa and workout facilities were impressive for a resort. I recommend getting a massage, but not if you're sunburned. Also, I don't recommend you try driving a car you rent down the sidewalks of the resort. Security doesn't find it as funny as you may think it is. Overall, we had a fabulous time. I can only imagine that the people who would write negative reviews are whiny, expect everyone to speak English, and are too cheap to tip. Let me know if anyone needs any info.
