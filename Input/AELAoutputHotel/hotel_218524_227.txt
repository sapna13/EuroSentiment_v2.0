{"text":"Loved the Excellence Punta Cana The Excellence in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic is one of the most beautiful resorts I've ever stayed at. We had a Swim up room which has a patio that opens up on the pool. The pools, 2 of them, are HUGE. They go from one end of the resort to the other. We stayed at the far end of the resort, and could literally swim from the room all the way to the other end of the resort, and only get out of the water for 5 seconds to get into the second pool. The room was wonderful, had a full minibar with everything we needed, and we never ran out. The sand on the beach was sooo clean, it was like playground sand, and went for as far as our eyes could see. The staff treated us like royaly, getting us anything we wanted. The restaurants had good food, and were always available. The Lobster house was good, but it's not the same flavor of lobster as we are used to. Some of the vendors that showed up were a little annoying, but that's expected, they need to sell to make a living, and we only saw them on the resort one evening. The only problem we experienced was the mesquitos. The first night there they were attacking like it was full out war, and my legs got chewed up! After that, we used bug spray and it wasn't a problem, so make sure you take some! The trip from the airport to the resort goes through some very poor towns, and was an eye-opener for anyone who's never travelled to another country. I highly recommend the horse rides, they travel through the jungle, stop on the beach to take pictures, then back to the hotel along the beach, it was beautiful. The water was warm (pool and ocean) and had some fairly big waves that were fun to swim in. The resort is a long way from any shopping centers, so if it's shopping you're interested in, you'll have to take an excursion to get there. Overall I would highly recommend Excellence Punta Cana to anyone. ","annotations":[]}
