{"text":"Excellence was Excellent!!!! Excellence was the perfect place for our Honeymoon!! We picked this all inclusive because it was an adult only resort and because the pictures in the brochure were beautiful. We were pleased to find out that when we arrived it was like we stepped into one of those pictures in the brochure! The hospitality was incredible, such a wonderful staff on the resort that always welcomed us with a smile serving us the best food  drinks 24 hours a day!!! We enjoyed the horseback riding on the beach. Also water aerobics with Joel, Frankin  Juan Carlo (very entertaining individuals!!) was a great workout and lots of laughs!! And we defininetly want to give a shout out to Domingo Rosa who entertained us each night with his phenominal sax music (my husband was pulling me up onto the dance floor every song!!) : )Other names we remember Ebeth a wonderful hostess with the greatest smile, Junior a very nice waiter  our cute little bartender Jonathan!! Wish we could remember everyone's names like the folks who greeted us  checked us in when we arrived and many other waiters  waitresses.. even the maids were so pleasant!! Even though we don't remember names we will hold their kind faces in our memories along with the memories of a beautiful landscape with photo opportunties at every glance. We will absolutely be back to this resort!!!!!!Our deepest thanks to the Excellence Staff  Resort for a wonderful honeymoon! Michael  Cheryl ","annotations":[]}
