{"text":"The perfect beach for the perfect holiday... We booked this hotel on teletext holidays and got a pretty good deal compared to Airtours.Myself, boyfriend (both aged 22) and my parents stayed at the hotel for 2 weeks from the 17th September. All of us had a brillant time and would, without a doubt go back. We had paid the extra to get the sea view rooms and were not disappointed. We were on the ground floor (rooms 5014 and 5019) rooms. Looking into the standard rooms we had a far bigger room, with the room including a mini sitting room (which we didn't really need). From the room, I would say we were about 10m from the sea - perfect when waking up in the morning and opening your curtains - you felt that you were on a maladives island! The rooms were a little basic, however suited the purpose of sleeping! Reading other reviews, and the complaints about the toilets - we didn't have a problem!The food was brillant and throughout the 2 weeks we didn't get bored or struggle finding things to eat. We have stayed in a lot of AI before and I have to say the buffet was the best. The stir fry station was yummy with you being able to choice how much and what you wanted. The pasta station was also the same. Some days the roast station the meat was a bit tough - but the turkey was brill. We went to both al carte resturants, however felt the sea food resturant was a waste of time. The italian was superb, with the best pizza's and lasagne I've tasted in a long time - so good that we went here 3 times!We didn't spend much time around the pool however it was always busy with little children with the childrens pool well sheltered with palm trees. Most of our time was spent on the beach. Our spot of beach was by far the best bit of beach! The sea was that lovely blue colour, some days it was slightly cloudy so snorkeling was hard but most of the time we saw lovely coloured fish. You don't need to take your snorkels as you can get them from the watersports station for an hr each day for free as well as flippers. Also we took bread rolls out and you got soooo many fish eating from you :-)We did two trips - the trip to the Island and the caribbean festival. The Island trip was good, the sea was a lovely blue however we were disappointed with the sea as there was huge bits of coral near the edge so it made it difficult to get in and out. On the way back we did the starfish bit. It was interesting to see them, however we only found a couple so were led slightly astray on seeing the hundreds which we were promised. This trip took all day where we were picked up at 7am and didn't get back till gone 6pm with a good 1hr30min drive to the port. The caribbean festival was brillant. First stop was a coral reef followed by a swim with sharks and stingrays. The staff on the boat did a fantastic job and we would do it again. In terms of shopping you won't find a lot apart from the usual tourist bits. We found the lamire (blue stone) very over priced so you have to haggle a far bit. Your best bet would be to get the brugal rum. All in all we had a brill holiday, and without a doubt would go back in a flash - we landed in Gatwick and wanted the plane to turn around!
