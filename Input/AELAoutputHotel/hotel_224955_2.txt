{"text":"A great little hotel near Downtown SF, great for traveling on a budget Booked a room for myself, and another for coworkers traveling to a conference at the Moscone center. Getting to the Metropolis from the airport was super easy, just hop on the BART to the Powell St. station and it's one block up Market. The Metropolis is close to the Westfield shopping center (upscale mall) and a lot of downtown shopping, as well as Chinatown and the Moscone convention center. Being in town for a convention, it was a short 10 minute walk each way. As some travelers note the area is populated by panhandlers, but since it's an area with a lot of pedestrians, business types, shoppers and tourists walking around it felt generally safe to walk around to me. As long as you walk towards Powell, and don't wander alone aimlessly towards the Tenderloin you should be fine. The decor is a mix of retro\/future, with some Art Deco from the silent movie Metropolis (hence the name). Since it's an older building the layout reflects this, so the rooms are on the small side but not too cramped (though it might be for a family of 4). All the furniture, carpeting, fixtures, bathrooms, etc are recently remodeled. The bathroom was one of the cleanest I've seen. The bed was super comfortable. The staff was very helpful and friendly. There is free coffee mornings in the little library, which was good except for the christmas music they piped in (had to endure that everywhere though). One night I met a friend for drinks at the bar\/restaurant downstairs, which had a cool (but not too cool for school, if you know what I mean) feel to it. I recommend the mulled cider with bourbon. The only negatives - the heater was a bit on the weak side, though I guess that week it was about as cold as it gets in SF. And the alarm clock was kind of gimpy, good thing I used my cell phone as a backup alarm. I would definitely recommend Hotel Metropolis to a friend. It's a convenient location, clean, friendly, and a great value for the price, especially when you compare to what other hotels in San Fran charge.
