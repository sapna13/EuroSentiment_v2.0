{"text":"We couldn't run out of there fast enough. First off, I'd like to thank Hotwire for negotiating this hellhole for us. The hotel (if you want to call it that) lost our reservation too, and if we had known what we were getting into, it would have been better off left lost.Everything about this place is so horrifying that we almost couldn't believe it. We spent upwards of $200 for a room that must have been 100+ sq ft, and barely fit the double bed. My boyfriend and I had to continually stand up and switch positions so that one of us could move around the place. The TV is hooked onto one of those 80s TV wall mounts because there isn't a spare inch to put the thing. Our window faced the garbage, and didn't open (you would understand this gripe if you knew what the ventilation and A\/C were like).There was one towel in the bathroom and the closet was like a stand-up coffin. Our door was maybe 1 foot away from the door next to us. Our neighbors did provide endless entertainment - screaming down the hallways, bringing security guards to the door, and one drunken person who thought our room was his and tried, persistently, to open our door.The one luxury they offer is a complimentary bottled water vending station, where they stack washed water bottles and you get to fill them yourself with tap water. The receptionists were nice, but that's about it. Needless to say, when the sun came up, we ran. Fast. ","annotations":[]}
