{"text":"Loved the Europa We could not believe our luck when we arrived at the Hotel Europa last week . We were met at the door by a friendly porter who promptly relieved us of our bags and deposited them in our room. The staff at the check-in desk were very efficent and friendly and have a multitude of languages . The room was usual European city size and was very comfortable with a large bathroom and had lovely french doors opening onto a little balcony. The hotel has a very popular restaurant and outside terrace , perfect for relaxing in the evening . Our room also had air conditioning which was much needed in 30 degree temperatures. Actually - check out the website - the rooms are very much as is on the pictures. Fantastic value for √à√\u2020√ü?0 per night for the room. The hotel itself has a perfect location. Right outside its door are shops like Mango  Zara and many other hight street stores  department stores. You're also no more than 5 mniutes walk from the main shopping street the Gran Via and less than a 10 minute walk to the main bar \/ restaurant area. Everything within Madrid is easily reached by walking. The hotel can also arrange the open top bus tour which I would highly recoommend to anyone visiting the city for only a few days. There is also free internet access in the foyer - there is a limit of 15mins per person tho. ","annotations":[]}
