{"text":"Not Worth It My husband and I have traveled to all inclusive hotels in the past and this one was the worst. We chose this hotel because of the kid's club and royal services, but the hotel failed to share some VERY important details. So here they are:1. Service and Shade: We opted for the royal service due to the numerous complaints regarding reservations issues at the restaurants and towel shortages. The rumors where true. But even at the royal side we had to make some sacrifices. First, you must make your restaurant reservation by 9 a.m. the day before with a VIP representative. The phone lines are constantly busy, so you will need to do them in person or have a lot of patience. Second, we found it difficult to find shade near the pool or by the beach. To overcome this problem, most people would get up between 5-6 a.m. to reserve a spot using the yellow royal service towels, BUT this is NOT guaranteed. The official hotel policy is that spots can only be reserved up to an hour. So, we found many people taking morning naps by the pool and beach. We also found it necessary to pay off the guards and attendants in order for the spaces to be assured and safe. We even witnessed a fight on the Royal Service Beach regarding this issue. Management had to be called in to alleviate the problem caused by overbooking.Finally and most importantly, the service was less than royal. VERY spotty. Except at the Gabi, the service at the other restaurants was marginal at best. The servers will forget to offer you drinks, mention the a la cart options, forget to close the kitchen doors, forget items you have ordered, and take an excessive amount of time. They will also refuse to let you take food out of the restaurant (hotel policy). The food, although abundant, was fair at best. The wine is not included, except for a local brand that was awful.2. The Kid's Club: Does not open till 10:00 a.m. Opening and drop off times vary day to day. It took most parents 20 minutes to drop off their kids. Drop off sometimes changes location to the restaurant by the beach or the camp grounds. Signs communicating the drop of changes are faded and unclear . The kids club for the younger population (i.e. 3 year olds) does NOT serve them Lunch nor snacks. You must pick up your child, feed them, and return. This is not a big problem if you are on the Caribe side or if you do not plan to go on any activities such as tours, snorkling, para-sailing, etc. But, if you are on the Royal service beach\/side or Tropical side of the hotel, it will take you 10-15 minutes walking by the beach or 30 minutes through the gardens\/trains to drop off\/pick up your child each time. In addition, the 3 year olds stay inside all the time. They watch TV and color. They do not take the younger kids on strolls nor to a playground. Oh yes... the playground that you see on the web site does NOT exist because it is being replaced. Right now they have a hot slab of cement surrounded by sand. Now, it is true that the 5 -9 year old camp side is better. Ana, the head camp coordinator is very sweet. They get served lunch and take part in varied activities. But, be aware, if you plan to pick up your child prior to the 5 p.m. pick up time, you will be challenged to find them. Also, they refused to apply sun lotion on my child when she asked. They also did not remind her to put on a shirt while in the pool as we specifically requested.3. Transportation: If you stay at the Royal side, you will be at the point furthest from the beach. The hotel offers special royal service carts to take you from the VIP lounge to the beach, but not to the Caribe side. We had to make special arrangements to try to get to the kid's club from the royal service pool. It took us 30 minutes total to get there, and 45 minutes back. We do not recommend that you purchase the royal service if you plan to use the kid's club or if you cannot walk moderately large distances.Overall, we do not recommend this hotel. Several local service guides recommended the RIU palace hotel instead.
