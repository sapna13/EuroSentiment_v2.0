{"text":"19 yr old male's opinoin My family and I stayed for a week in early august.General:The temperature was in the mid 80's and it was very humid. There were many Europeans and people from Spanish speaking countries. Very unlike Mexico where virtually everyone speaks English. At night the sun goes down, but the temperature never drops.Room:After a quick check-in and getting to our rooms, our luggage arrived shortly after. The air conditioning didn't seem very cold, but after putting it on setting 1 (the coldest) it quickly cooled down. The room had two full sized beds and one couch set up with sheets to make a third. Inside the room was a mini bar that didn't seem very cold stocked daily with water beer and pop. The bathroom was nice, it had both a shower and a bathtub. Our room wasn't a far walk from anything, although it was right next to the construction. I could sometimes hear hammering noises in the morning it wasn't too bothersome. The worst thing was hearing a rooster (which roam free) crowing one morning.Food:The food was very good. There was somewhere to eat every day, I was never hungry the entire trip. I enjoyed the buffets and could have eaten every meal there. I ate at 3 of the restaurants: Japanese, steak house and cajun. Personally, I enjoyed the appetizers at the Japanese and cajun the most. The ribeye was great at the steakhouse. The service wasn't the best at these restaurants but didn't bother me much.Pool:The pool was a nice size and had a beach effect which I liked a lot. The swim up bar never seemed too crowded, resulting in fairly quick service. There were always open chairs but it was sometimes difficult to find spots for 5. Something I did not enjoy where swarms little kids screaming and running into people. It seemed as if their parents just let them run lose. Beach: The beach was very nice with ample seating. It was clean, but nothing compared to the beach in Cancun.Staff:The staff was amazing. They made virtually every request you made. Spaghetti was one of the greatest entertainers. He always remembered you.Entertainment:Some of the shows were very good. I preferred the ones with just the entertainers singing as opposed to the shows with audience participation. After the shows I frequently ventured to the casino, just a 3 min walk away, or 30 second golf cart ride. It was air conditioned. I was very surprised to see that it had poker. I visited the disco one night. I did not enjoy it seeing as it seemed to be filled heavily with Europeans and played only techno music.Conclusion:I enjoyed the trip very much, and would definitely go back with my family, but I don't think I would want to stay for more than a week, being that it was so hot and humid. This was a great place for relaxation, not somewhere for 18-30 year olds to party and get drunk.
