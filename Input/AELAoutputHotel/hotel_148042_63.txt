{"text":"We were happy but stayed with a discount We stayed at the Ritz Carlton for 5 nights, at a significant corporate discount. Without the discount, I don't think we would have been quite so happy, but with the discount, we were pleased. The room was clean and spacious, the beds very comfortable, and the staff was really pleasant. The pool was extremely crowded our first day there (a Sunday) but that did not happen again during the rest of our stay (we left on a Friday). And you always had the option of having chairs set out for you on the beach, which was really nice. The pool was also great, and the grounds are beautiful. we even saw some very cool lizards running around, and at night, if you walk around you can hear the frogs singing. The little touches are nice - like the NY Times supplement, the fruit at the towel stand, the fact that at any given time, staff were always around and were always helpful. The casino (and the whole hotel) is now non-smoking, and that was great too. I think overall it is a great place to relax and get away, with very easy beach and pool access that is comfortable and clean. Complaints would be the food - on every level. For what you pay to stay there (full price or not), I think they should include a continental breakfast. The hotel restaurant options are all very expensive. We ate at Il Mulino one night and were extremely disappointed both with the service and the food. The poolside restaurant menu was really limited, overpriced, and the food not very good. We discovered a small diner a block off the property called Cafe Piu, which has fabulous gelatto and a really nice staff, and just relied on it heavily for breakfast and lunch. Other than that, there are not a lot of restaurant options within walking distance (other than fast food) so getting to the good restaurants required a cab ride or a car rental.
