{"text":"Ritz: Cancelled our Wedding Plans We just returned from a 5 day stay at the Ritz..we were headed there to plan our wedding taking place in June 08...after our 3rd day there we had a change of heart! Overall: The grounds were well kept and beautiful including the lobby and restuarants..the people were extremely nice...however the rooms leave little to be desired...we got a great deal $175 a nite through our travel agent but ended up facing the city aka the airport...we were willing to accept this because of the low price we paid, however when we explained we were planning to have our wedding there they didnt even bother to help give us an upgrade..Noise: Far as previous reviews posted about the airplanes...we werent too upset with this..indoors you couldnt really hear them but outside by the pool was a bit too noisy for me especially in the morning when your just trying to relaxFood: The restuarants were fare, I think what made them worse was the fact that the prices were out of sight! Now just to be clear we live in the heart of NYC and are used to paying high prices at restuarants but we usually get what we pay for here...at the Ritz it felt like we were being taken advantage of...$58 per person for the sunday buffet at the restaurant Mares!! Im sorry but no breakfast is worth $58 per personNeedless to say we will not be coming back here and have called off the plans to have our wedding here next year...starting our plans back at ground 0 But if you do plan to visit san juan after exploring other hotels nearby the Ritz is your best bet ","annotations":[]}
