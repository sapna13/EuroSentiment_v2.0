{"text":"Great Hotel, Amazing Location We stayed at the New York Palace for four nights in late June. The service was impeccable and the room was very well proportioned. Our room was on the eleventh floor and looked over the roof of another building. (Not a great view but if you looked to either side of the window, it wasn't so bad.) The beds were very comfortable and the linens were nice. There was a huge flat-screen TV in the room which was fun. All of the lights in the room were controlled by a control panel on the side table by the bed. The control panel was a little confusing because some of the lights couldn't be controlled by the panel, but we eventually figured it out. The breakfast at the hotel was amazing but a bit pricey (on one day, it was $82.00 for two people.) Breakfast was included in our rate but we went over the breakfast credit every day. (The orange juice was $10.00 a glass, no wonder we went over the breakfast credit!) There was a bit of a mix up when we checked in, we reserved a room with two beds and the man at the front desk said that the only room they had available was with one king-sized bed. (I was travelling with my teenage son and there was no way we were going to sleep in the same bed!) We insisted that we booked a room with two beds and that was what we were going to have. He eventually found us a room with two beds. Overall, the New York Palace is a great hotel and I would definetly go back.
