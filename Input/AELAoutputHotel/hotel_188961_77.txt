{"text":"Sheer Pleasure We had booked 41 for a birthday weekend. Having stayed at many 5* in London we have been searching for a more personal touch and 41 has it in plenty. From the moment you arrive you are made to feel very special. The black and white decor is perfect for deco lovers. The atmosphere is private club rather than hotel, peaceful and classy.Room stunning, gleaming clean, fabulous bedding of Egyptian Cotton crisp and inviting to say nothing of the comfort of the mattress!Breakfast in the Lounge where every whim can be accomodated with discreet loving service from the gorgeous staff. You are always known by your name and you really feel you are part of the family not just passing through.Every member of staff knows who you are and greets you with the same warmth.Few little negatives, wrong type of room had been allocated, this was soon dealt with but we did feel a little uncomfortable as if we were trying to upgrade ourselves, which was not the case. There was no fruit in the room although this was advertised as being included, this was rectified later when we mentioned it. few other little niggles but not really want to focus on them as the whole experience was so beautiful and if anything is not right it is rectified and apologised for straight away.A wonderful birthday cake was left in our room, such a lovely surprise, we were too full to eat so it was boxed carefully for our journey and put in a lovely hessian bag, wonderful touches like this make for a very special experience.This is not the hotel for you if you like to remain anonymous as the level of interaction may be too much for you but if you love to be pampered and made to feel very special, stay at 41 we will be returning soon, spoilt for other hotels now as they may be lovely but where else would you get the service level!! Go on treat yourself without hesitation!!!
