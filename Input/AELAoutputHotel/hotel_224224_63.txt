{"text":"Tries at service but problems possibly inherent in building I initially checked in expecting the Ritz-Carlton service and experience especially since the New York Central Park branch has had a number of positive reviews.The staff were indeed very friendly, given New York City standards, and put me in a deluxe 9 series room due to my extended 3 week stay.However, by the 2nd night, rumbling\/rattling sounds were vibrating through the room and disturbing my sleep intermittently. It worsens during the day. I immediately thought of the review of another guest about trains and called front desk for help. After 2 visits by engineers, I was told it was the elevator and moved to a 3 series room; but not before being misinformed by the front desk that the 3 series room had a larger wardrobe space and told to go to the wrong floor first and being embarassed by the guest already occupying the room who was in the midst of drying up after a shower. On talking to the night manager, who apologised for the misinformation but said he couldn't do much except for giving us a wheeled clothes rack in the room, I went to sleep somewhat soured in my experience but hoping to get some sleep. Unfortunately, I was awakened again by rumbling\/rattling sounds the next day.I've resigned to sleeping with uncomfortable ear plugs but I'll NEVER stay in the Ritz-Carlton New York again. For the price you pay and the promise made by the chain, you'd expect more. This hotel is nowhere near the Ritz-Carlton standard of other hotels I've stayed in.A definite disappointment.
