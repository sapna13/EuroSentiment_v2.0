{"text":"It was great! My fiancee and I spent our first vacation in a city view room at the Intercontinental. I have no serious complaints! The first night I got there, I didn't really like the area, as there are a FEW abandoned businesses around. By the second night, the area had intoxicated me! It's so charming, clean (you could go barefoot) and everyone is so pleasant. ***Hotel PROS  CONS***I can't even think of any serious complaints. The restaurants were pricey? But the food was delish. We booked trips through the hotel, they cleaned our room as long as we left the sign on the door, the AC was comfortable, there was a mini-fridge, cofeemaker...Ok, yeah the TV sucked but we weren't really on vacation to watch TV! Balcony was small, but we weren\/t on vacation to stay on our balcony either.***Beach PROS CONS***PROS:-not a ton of annoying noisy kids around, but there are more at the pool-water is turquoise(but not crystal clear)-water is calm-parasailing and jet skis activities availableCONS:-some may be annoyed by the airplanes (I only noticed them 2 or 3x during our 4 day stay, and we spent hoursssssss on the beach[and I am sensitive to noise)Restaurants we went to:Mi Casita: is right across the street and the food was DELICOUS, even though the service was a little slow. A meal there will run you about $30-$50Platos: A little more pricey. They serve a Paella that can feed at least SIX grown men for $45. I think it's a recurrign theme for relaxed Islands like PR- the service was a little slow.Lupis: DISGUSTING! The meal came out to just over $50, yet made Taco Bell look like a freaken' gourmet restaurant. Def. a tourist trap.For daytime fun: We booked a day catamaran trip through our hotel for $88? per person. Pros: (for day trip)-Our first stop was at Icacos, an AMAZING deserted island whose waters were crystal clear. Seriously, you could see like every grain of sand on the ocean floor-Yummy food-Energetic staffCons: -Catamaran shelter leaked when it started raining-we didnt' spend nearly enough time at Icacos, but spent more time on Culebra (?) whose waters had more interesting fish but murkier water-Catamaran bathroom was nasty, no airfreshner, and sinks with no running water.The area had a Walgreens which was 4 minutes away. Whatever we ran out of or needed, was a 4 minute walk away at Walgreens If you want to save money, get some $3 coolers from there and get some water and cold cuts. You can get the same souveniers they sell in the souvenir shops for less than half the price.Next time we may rent a car so we can explore a bit more, but there are so many amazing things to do in that area.
