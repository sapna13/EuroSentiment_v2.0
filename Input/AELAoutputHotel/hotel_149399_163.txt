{"text":"A great vacation Just returned from a 7 night stay at the Melia in Punta Cana. It was a great vacation ... what a vacation is supposed to be ... RELAXING. The facilities are solid but not luxurious. Our room was very nice with a king, sitting area, balcony, and jacuzzi and shower in the bath. Closet space was enough although we could have used another drawer or so. The flat screen HDTV was good and selections were fine. We played golf daily at the Cocotal Country Club and found the layout to be challenging but fully playable. There are now 3 nines with 2 traditional resort 9's and the Bouganvilla 9 is more like a test and plays to about 4000 yards from the back tees. The added 9 holes gives them more flexibility in tee times. The greens were excellent and the course was immaculate. At the resort, the beach was nice and the pools were very nice. We particularly enjoyed the Gabi Pool and restaurant for lunch. Breakfast is good at the Marketplace or Gabi. Dinner was varied. The La Gormet (international) was excellent; Gondola (Italian) was horrid and bland; Maisson (French) was good; Hokaido (Japanese Hibachi style) was very good and lots of food; Capri (seafood) was average; Pagoda (Thai) was outstanding; The last evening we went back to the La Gourmet and were again rewarded for that choice. We did not visit the Hacienda (Mexican), Guarabo (Dominican), Tuhey (at the beach), Agra (also at the beach), or American Grill. The lobby bars were active and served good drinks. There seemed to be weddings several times a day at the Gazebo. And, there were several families with children. It seemed that there were plenty of activities for the kids. The Royal Service option seemed worth the difference to us. It was much easier to make reservations for dinners and with our morning trips to the golf course it would have been a problem. The private shuttles were nice, too. Cocktail hour in the Royal Service lounge is nice with premium brands plentiful.The staff seemed committed to being helpful and pleasant. There were a few language barriers but with my weak Spanish it all worked out. The VIP\/Royal Service staff was wonderful. Check-in\/Check-out were quick and painless.Overall, I would rate it 4.5 of 5. The price was perfect and was a real value for what we got. I booked it about 8 months early and watched for specials (I could change). There were some specials that showed up but none were better than the deal that I booked.
