{"text":"Great room at the Westin Booked a fantastic rate via TravelZoo ($199 nt) and upgraded to Executive King, Club Floor for another $50; super deal for Westin in NYC. Club rooms are located 10-16th floors so really great views are not available, but view on 16th floor was good and size of room and extra amenities were very nice (lounge access for free breakfast, afternoon snacks). Room was as depicted on hotel website: huge by NYC standards  very modern, sleek decor. Low chair was ok, but a bit awkward  no side table, even though plenty of space. A real plus: IMAC computer  IPOD docking in Bose system. Desk\/chair\/work area was comfortable  had good lighting. Room was very clean, came with a robe  bathroom was large (not the usual NYC closet!). Heavenly bed once again lived up to its name! Check-in had a few issues but ultimately  politely resolved ; overall service at all levels was good. Great location if you are in town for theater\/plays, as easy walk to all of them. Lots of dining options nearby. If SPG Gold Level  higher, will allow late 4pm late checkout (if able). Club lounge was nice but nothing special  had usual amenities, such as free food  drinks (non-alcoholic)  some confortable sitting areas with large screen TV's. Only negative, it did not have guest computer\/printer access but the service attendant was very helpful and printed my boarding pass for me. Only gripe, Internet for a fee  no WIFI in room, only in public areas of hotel. Overall, stayed 5 days  was very satisfied  would stay again.
