{"text":"Wonderful vacation My husband and I stayed at the Grand Palladium Bavaro Resort Jan 12 - 17 2008. We had a wonderful vacation! Driving from the airport to the resort was a little sketchy and had me worried, but the resort was amazing. It has a security gate at the entrance, and guards walking the premise, so I felt completely safe.The resort grounds are beautiful and the room was very clean. We stayed in a junior suite, which had a king size bed, sleeper sofa, and jacquzzi in the bathroom. The only problem we had with our room was that the shower leaked onto the floor, which made it very slippery when you got out!The weather was great everyday we were there. We would spend the mornings at the beach (absolutely gorgeous - prettiest beach I've ever seen) and the afternoons at the pool (and pool bar!) We did have a little trouble in finding chairs on the beach everyday, but we always managed to find two...we just had to find one and then another somewhere else and put them together. The beach was very crowded at the Bavaro end, but a little less crowded at the other two hotels on the property. The water was a little cool when you first got in at both pool  ocean, but we quickly adapted. There were several buffets and theme restaurants (no reservation required anymore). The food was ok....there was a wide selection, but some of it was a little out there for me. Maybe I am too picky....I always found something to eat though. The buffet changes for dinner everynight, so you could eat there the whole time. We tried the Mexican, Asian and Italian restaurants. The Italian was our favorite, the others were so-so. The service was a little slow in all. The sports bar was open 24 hours for pizza, hamburgers, sandwhiches and snacks. The drinks were very good (except for the strawberry daquiri, which was a little too sweet for me) Try the coco loco (very good) but beware of the mamajuana =)The staff at the hotel was very nice. There was a little language barrier, but we were always able to communicate what we wanted. We were a little surpised at the number of Europeans and Canadiens there...we only met one couple on the last night that were also from the US!The nightly shows were entertaining, although some were a little corny. We also went to the disco one night, which was lots of fun. The entertainment staff was great in getting everyone involved in all the different activities throughout the day  night (bingo games, dance lessons, volleyball, aerobics, etc.) There was always something going on.We did an excursion one day called Marinarium. You snorkel along the coral reef and then with nurse sharks  stingrays! It was probably our favorite part of the trip...I highly recommend it.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Grand Palladium and would definitely go back.
