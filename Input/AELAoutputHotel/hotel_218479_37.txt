{"text":"Good Resort for the money Stayed in the Barcelo Bavaro Caribe from Dec 20-25, 2007.Reservations: Booked via Deltavacations.com website package of flight + hotel.Flight from New York(JFK): 3 1\/2 hours, no food - snacks only., arrived at 2:00PM local time.Airport at Punta Cana - fast going through customs, $10 entry fee collected before you pass through customs and they take away all the papers you fill on the plane\/airport.Shuttle to hotel via Club Caribe: could be located outside, just turn right. They usually wear green shirts. Ride to the hotel in the A\/C mini-van for about 25 minutes.Check-In: within 20 minutes, provided the print-out from the website with the reservation information, no credit card asked, got the room on the second floor, # 6108. The building is located next to the lobby and the balcony is facing the little yard. All the buildings are very very close to the beach...1 minute walk...Room: Two large queen beds, table with two chairs, 20 inch TV, CNN and couple of other english-language channels, but mostly local ones and spanish\/german\/french ones.Large bathroom, with separate room with a toilet. Great showers, hot water everyday and great water pressure. Good white towels.Regrigerator is in the room and usually filled with 3 bottles of local beer, 4-5 sodas(pepsi, light pepsi, sprite, etc), two large bottles of water) - re-filled once a day.The room looks kind of old but I could not say that everything was in bad shape or damaged...just it looks like it had few years of usage... The A\/C was working great....a little bit noisy but working just fine the entire stay.Room service: every day around 10-11AM....great quality....I usually left few $$ every day for the maid.Beach: really great, white clean sand, lots of shade, you don't have to go early in the morning to get a good spot - plenty were available....you can go in eighther direction..the beach is very long...lots of space if you want to have quiet stay. Great ocean, clean, clear water, no rocks, great temperature.Activities: There is beach volleyball, some activities near the pool, but the activity team is not as involved as in other hotels I've stayed. Food: The buffet breakfast is standard with eggs station, some salads, potatoes, cold cuts, fruits, pancakes, pretty bad juices. Service is a bit slow...but you can go and get yourself a coffee wthout waiting for a waiter to service you. Lunch: lots of choices, some dishes are better than others, usually two soups, few types of meat dishes, pasta station, grill station(meats, fish could be ordered and cooked in few minutes).Also, there are several places right on the beach serving lunch: pizzas, hot dogs, hamburgers, etc. Dinner: The buffet is good, lots of choices, great white and red wines, local beer. I have NOT gone to any of the restaurants this time.I've also went to the buffets of other hotels in the complex: Beach, CCasino and Golf. Again, pretty much the same food choices.Food safety: I have not had any issues\/problems with food. Use bottled water, I've also used soda drinks at the buffet, I've avoided some salads that didn't look too good. Entertainment: There is a show in each hotel every evening at 22:30. All the shows at Caribe were below everage. I went to see the show at the Casino hotel(Tropicalissimo). That one was pretty good but all the drinks they serve at the theatre are not free.I've also went to the Barcelo Palace to view couple of shows...they were slightly better quality....Overall, nothing to be impressed. The shows at Barcelo at Riviera Maya in Mexico were much better..You can easily walk between the Caribe\/Beach, Casino and Golf - they are within 10-15 minute walk from each other. The Palace is away - about 30 minutes walk...so use the mini-train that is available the entire day and runs every 1--15 minutes.People: from all over the world, lots of europeans(brits, french, italians, germans, spanish), lots of south america(equador, columbia, venezuela, argentina, brazil), some canadians, some US. If you prefer all US\/canada - this is NOT the place to go.Weather: really great, about 82-84F everyday, could rain for 15-30 minutes, the humidity is not very high. Check-out: no issues,12:00PM, ride to the airport with Club Caribe. Flight to NYC, 3 1\/2 hours.
