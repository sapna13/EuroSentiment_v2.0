{"text":"Not so good. I have to agree with most posters here that the rooms and service at Caribe Hilton are very lacking. I was here on business staying at the Caribe for a second time. It was no better than the first go around. The rooms are really bad. I don't know how else to say it. My boss made the reservations and she is a Diamond Member. We still didn't get into the Executive Tower - we are all full - they told us. It's August - give me a break.So, we marched off to our rooms and the front desk clerk comes running after me. Trouble with the room key - I will be right back. It's midnight. She comes back and I just asked her straight out - someone was in that room, right? Yup. Had to move you to another floor. The rooms are just old. Everything needs updating. The bathrooms are very old. Breakfast - check it out. The fruit on the breakfast bar had mold on it. We usually just stick to the executive lounge, but we were meeting people that morning and we all went downstairs. Just okay.Location is great for me, but I just cannot abide by these rooms. Come on Hilton - $239 plus that resort fee in low season and you can't get some money to update the rooms?I think I will go back to the Ritz where our corporate rate is and put up with their bad service. At least the rooms are better. ","annotations":[]}
