{"text":"The Best City Hotel in the World! During the Christmas break, we decided to book a short 2 night stay at the Peninsula Hong Kong. We were celebrating our Anniversary and had revealed this information while booking our room, a Superior Harbour View Suite. Like so many others, we felt that the Rolls-Royce Phantom transfer from the airport was a must. Upon stepping off the plane, you are pleasantly greeted by the airport concierge who escort you on a cart to customs and later baggage claim. It was a very nice service, and they handle all the work. After entering the Arrivals Hall, you are met by a member of the hotel staff and led to your personal Rolls-Royce. The EWB Phantom is one of the nicest cars ever built. The interior is incredibly comfortable, with lots of legroom. We were given cold towels and chilled bottled water to cool us from the heat of Hong Kong. After a swift journey, we arrived at the Peninsula. We were pleased to discover that the hotel had been decked out in lots of pretty decorations for the holidays. Entering the lobby, there was a nice little string band playing the traditional Christmas tunes. The lobby itself is gorgeous and just as opulent as the pictures make it look. Very grand and airy! We were properly greeted by the staff as we were led to the check-in counter. After wishing us a happy anniversary, they surprised us by saying that we had been upgraded to a Deluxe Harbour View Suite. For those that are not familiar with the rooms or pricing structure of the hotel, our upgraded suite was about 270 square feet larger and would have cost us an additional $HK 4000 (more than 500 U.S dollars). Needless to say, we were overwhelmed by this upgrade.Entering our room, we were amazed at its spaciousness. There was a separate sitting room and bedroom, both with jaw-dropping harbour views. I've said this before, but the harbour views from the Kowloon side are far more impressive than those on the Island side. Noting that it was our anniversary, we received (in addition to the welcome tea and fruits) a bottle of champagne and some sweets (including a lovely cake and some very nice chocolates). We enjoyed the European decor with subtle Oriental influences that are tastefully incorporated. Every suite has a nice bronze telescope for guests to admire the breathtaking views. The bathroom in the bedroom is huge, with a large jacuzzi tub and a spacious shower area. All rooms and suites at the Peninsula have two sinks, which is a big plus in my books. In the bathroom were two red boxes ornately carved with Chinese images for guests to take as souvenirs. Inside each box was a classy face soap. A very elegant touch that is a testament to the world-class status of the Peninsula. I could go on and on about the amenities in the room, but I think that has already been done to death here on the site.On to the other facilities. The Peninsula has one of the nicest pools I've ever seen. It is designed to look like a Roman bath and is very beautiful, with sweeping views of the harbour and city skyline. It wasn't that busy when we visited, so it was a peaceful retreat. They have a large terrace outside the pool area for sunbathing, along with a pool bar for light snacks and drinks. The staff members at the pool hand you cold bottled water when you enter and are very attentive.The restaurants at the Peninsula are among the most best and historic in the city. Our meals at the Peninsula included:Dinner at Gaddi'sBreakfast at the VerandahAfternoon Tea at the LobbyDinner at Spring MoonLunch at ChesaAll were excellent and enjoyable dining experiences, especially Gaddi's. Gaddi's is one of the best French restaurants in Asia and a must if you're looking for gourmet, Michelin-starred cuisine. The dining room is very luxurious and palatial, and the service is among the best I've ever experienced in a restaurant. I've dined at several restaurants in Paris with 3 Michelin stars and would rank Gaddi's right up there in their class.Aftertoon tea at the Lobby is a very authentic and elegant experience. Everything from the tableware to the food is of very high quality. They also had a large selection of teas in addition to the classics. It is expensive but well worth it for the experience. And that about sums up my experience at the Peninsula as a whole. It is a very expensive hotel, but you truly get your money's worth and more when you stay at the Peninsula. The Peninsula Hong Kong is, without a doubt, the best city hotel in the world!
