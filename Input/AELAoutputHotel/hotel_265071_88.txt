{"text":"Lovely hotel and kind efficient staff. We stayed at this hotel in July and booked two rooms. We found it to be extremely good value. It is close to the train and bus station which is handy for arriving and leaving as well as picking up the city sight-seeing tours, plus only a ten minute walk from the Duomo - Forence is a walking city. Our rooms were quite roomy and cleaned each day as well as having our sheets changed during our three day stay. The whole hotel is air conditioned and our bedrooms were a cool oasis from the hot summer heat. Despite being a busy road we heard no noise due to the double glazing and shutters however, I did enjoy being able to open the window and watch the world go by in the morning. The breakfast is more than a continental with a lot of options . Our son got good value out of the free internet access , not available in a lot of hotels, with six terminals for the use of the guests. My final commendations are reserved for the staff who very always very accommodating and helpful with our many queries and they assisted us in locating and booking a nice restaurant (ZA-ZA). I would also recommend the restaurant opposite the train station entrance, lovely linen table cloths and really good cheap pasta meals. If, when, I return to Florence (to see David next time) I hope to be able to stay at this hotel again.
