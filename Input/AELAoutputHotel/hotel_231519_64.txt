{"text":"Hated the City, Loved the Room We arrived in Barcelona on October 22 after spending 1 week in Paris. I had booked the room online on the hotel's website and had been in communication with the Staff via email regarding price and discounts. As soon as we arrived, we were abruptly notified that the price we had confirmed online was incorrect and it was going to be an additional 20 euros\/night for the room. Not a good first impression and it was all downhill from there.The only positive thing was that the roms were beautiful. We were in 211 which is a corner room with high ceilings, modern decoration, and 2 balconies. Had I stayed the room the entire time, I probably would have had a more positive experience. They offered a Breakfast Buffet in their restaurant for a whopping 12 Euros and charged 20 Euros\/week for internet service. The location was ideal, only 1 block from La Rambla and there are open-air bus tours that leave from there all day to take you around the city. It was ALWAYS crowded everywhere you walked and we found the street performers bizarre and freakish rather than amusing and entertaining. Other than walk up and down La Rambla and seeing some of the few (and uninteresting) sights like La Sagrada Familia (Waste of time as you are charged 8 Euros to walk through the eyesore and it is under COMPLETE construction as it has been for over 100 years), the Olympic Stadium from 1992 (Yawn) and the Cathedral (You guessed it, under construction too!) there really is nothing more to do. I also noticed a disturbing number of beggars everywhere holding everything from babies to dogs that all appeared sedated or dead. Even saw a completely naked old man (twice!) walking the streets without any hesitation. WEIRD!After 3 days, we had had enough of the circus and actually cut our trip short by 4 days to come home early. A week in Barcelona would have been the equivilant to Chinese water torture and we were thrilled to get out early regardless of fees incurred by the airline. I would NEVER return there nor would I recommend Spain to anyone. I would have rather spent another week in glorious Paris. C'est la vie!
