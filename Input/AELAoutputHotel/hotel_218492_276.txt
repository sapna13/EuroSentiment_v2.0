{"text":"amazing resort! We just returned from our stay at the Grand Oasis. In our group there was my parents, a 21 year old, a 19 year old, three 18 year olds and one 10 year old. Overall I would say our trip was amazing. Everyone there was so nice. The rooms were big (we stayed in buildings 2 and 7). Building 7 was incredible, my parents stayed in the junior suite there which was amazing. The Italian restaurant was the best place to eat; after we ate there the first night, we went at 8 the next morning to get a reservation for the following day. I wouldn't recommend the Tex Mex Grill restaurant at all. The buffet, Windows, was very good and always had a wide selection. You can never run out of food at this resort. For lunch we went to the beach garden cafe which was good. The server AMADOR was our favorite, he was always eager to help us out. We didn't see many people tipping anyone that worked there but we tipped them all a couple dollars everytime they served us and they were entirely grateful. We also tipped our maid 2 or 3 dollars a day. The beach was amazing, especially at night although it was pretty much empty since everyone goes to sleep or to the bars. Most of the people there are not American and speak very little English, but we didn't really mind. The shops on the beach are a good place to get souvenirs, much cheaper than the shops at the resort. I LOVED this resort and if I ever return to Punta Cana I would definitely want to stay here again.
