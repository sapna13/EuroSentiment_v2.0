{"text":"Great Time at the Taino I was here for 4 nights and 5 days, i reall can't give a bad review being in the D.R. for the first time since i know nothing to compare it to. But if u read these reviews they can really make u go batty...lol The food was great!! The pool was great!! The beach was unbeliveable!!! When we first arrived they had our room situated way to far away from the main house so we asked if we could move...not a problem. We were a stones throw away from the beach, pool and dining. I did not think the rooms had an any odor of any sort, as mentioned by other reviewers. There was a period of a couple of hours or so that we did not have hot water and of course it was when i wanted to take my shower before dinner, hence wasn't a happy camper to take a cold shower!!! But it was restored by the next shower it was a problem throughout the whole complex i was told. Staff was nice and polite. My only real complaint was the hotel was filled with people from Spain which i'm sure are very nice people but did not speak a word of English.. so that was a bummer.. Was told by staff that they usually come there in June, July and August. So my lack of spanish didn't help the situation i guess as well. But also in the months of Dec, Jan, Feb and March it is usually filled with Americans, Canadians and Germans all of which speak English. So i will never go back there in those months when they don't speak English... All in All had a great time... It is Paradise... Also the Riu's are all connected so u can toggle between all the Riu's on the complex except for maybe the palace which u can't go i think...Any questions will be happy to answer, oh also pack light u do not need MUCH!!!!
