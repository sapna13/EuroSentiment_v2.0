{"text":"Great beach vacation!!!!! returned recently from a great week of fun in the sun at the sirenis in Punta Cana. Dec 30th- thru jan 5th. We LOVED the ocean, beach, and pool. The resort was great, very clean and good friendly service. The decor in the rooms was a little outdated, but it was very clean and comfortable with fresh flowers in our room every day. Lots of restaurants or buffets to choose from- enjoyed in particular their new Japanese restaurant; eating at the grill on the beach for lunch; ordering room service for breakfast. Many locations to get a cocktail or beer. The beer was good as were the pina colada's and the local drink mamajawana. The nightly entertainment was decent- best show was the Michael Jackson impersonators. Would not recommend this resort for snorkeling - water was too rough although there are coral reefs in the area. Enjoyed the excursions we took to go horseback riding and ATV riding. We booked them thru the restaurant on the beach located next door to the resort. Their prices were half of the tour companies and were much more convenient with smaller groups and more personal service. As far a negatives go for the area- the roads in the punta cana area were HORRIBLE . I would not recommend any bus trips or excursions other than to get to and from the airport. Overall this was a great beach vacation, and great value for the money. I would return to the area again and to this resort. ","annotations":[]}
