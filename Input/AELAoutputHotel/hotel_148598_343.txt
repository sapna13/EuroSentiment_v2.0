{"text":"Great Resort - Can NOT understand the negative reviews!! This resort was fabulous, we were there for 5 nights and had a great time. The staff were incredibly friendly, the rooms were great, and overall it was a great experience. It was just as nice, if not nicer, than any other Westin I have stayed in, and I have stayed in a lot of Westins.If you read the complainers complaints closely you will notice one common thread - it doesn't seem that they did their research before they arrived at the Westin at all. Most complain that it is far away from San Juan, that they needed to rent a car, that the food was expensive, etc.So what? The location is right near the rainforest in a beautiful location. It is about a 30-45 minute drive from San Juan, depending on traffic. The beach is a beautiful beach, no, it is not the white sand, crystal clear turqouise water of the Caribbean, but that is because it is located on the Atlantic side of the ocean. Duh. Look at a map and look at the pictures of the resort before you book the trip there!!The rooms were great. The standard room is large, with a nice sitting area. It was very clean, I have no idea what a previous poster was talking about dirty rooms. We were upgraded to a junior suite after one night (once the hotel cleared out a convention, and with a $20 tip to the reception - TIP - in ANY hotel, if you want to be upgraded to a better room, be prepared to tip the person who can put you in that better room!) and it was beautiful. But even the standard room was great.We didn't really eat in the hotel's restaurants because we were on the go so much. We did eat at the coffee place next to the casino every morning, which was a good, cheap alternative to spending a lot of money on the hotel food. I did check out the food prices and thery did not seem any higher than at any other Westin, and in fact, I thought the room serive prices were quite reasonable for a large hotel (I have seen double the prices charged at other hotels). We did order room service one night and it was quick and good food. Also, rent a car and explore the restaurants around the resort, there are plenty - I highly recommend Kiosk #2 at Loquillo beach, very close to the resort.The service at the hotel is fabulous - we wanted a fridge for our room, and one was there within 10 minutes. The safe didn't work in out first room (the person prior to us didn't leave it open), and someone was there in a matter of minutes to fix it. My husband got food poisioning, and the concierge helped out immensly, getting a dr to our room immediately, and even sending someone to go get the prescription from a local pharmacy. The staff could not have done more, they are truly great and extremly friendly and care about their jobs and their customers.Overall we had a great time at the Westin and would not hesitate to return or recommend it for a great vacation. Don't listen to the whiners and complainers - honestly, if they didn't like this hotel, I cannot imagine that any hotel would live up to their expectations (I have traveled all over the world and stayed at numerous 5 star resorts - the Westin Rio Mar lived up to its 4 star rating)Here's another tip - you can book this hotel through Hotwire or Priceline for a substantial savings, which makes it an even better deal.
