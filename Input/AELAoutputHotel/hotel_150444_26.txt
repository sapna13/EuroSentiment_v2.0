{"text":"Choose Another Hotel I just returned from a few nights at the Radisson. If you want or need to stay in the Condado area of San Juan, I would not recommend the Radisson.Three weeks before arrival, I specifically requested a room AWAY from the elevators and ice machine (noise factor). Upon arrival at the front desk, I again asked for a room away from the elevators and ice machine. The clerk made no comment. Well, sure enough, when I got to my room (531) after check-in, what did I find. The hotel was not nearly full, but my room was directly across from the elevator and the ice machine backed against my wall. The view was of the rooftop air conditioners on the 4th floor. I just said to myself to forget it and if it gets too bad, I will demand to be moved,The remote control to the television did not work, so I had to call and have it replaced. The room safe was locked and I called the desk to have someone to come up and open it - that never happened!Overall, the nights in the room were quiet enough so I did not complain about it anymore. However, upon checkout, I mentioned that I had wanted to use my room safe, but it was locked and no one ever came to open it. I was THEN told that the safe in the room was broken and didn't work. I thought that was unacceptable - to have a broken room safe in a casino hotel. (A very dirty casino I might add.)I will not stay at this hotel again. I would highly recommend paying a few dollars more (if any) and stay just down the street at the Marriott. The hotel and grounds there are beautiful. ","annotations":[]}
