{"text":"Comfortable and convenient Stayed in the Lagoon tower for 5 nights. With tax, the nightly charge was $360. We had a one bedroom condo promoted as having an ocean view. Coming in from the curb late in the evening involved walking up a few steps with many suitcases. There is no convenient ramp to bring the wheeled cases up. Check-in was reasonably quick. Our room was on the side of the hotel, so there was indeed an ocean view...if you walked out onto the balcony and turned to the right. There was not an ocean view out the window of the unit.The tower faces the rainbow tower on one side, but the rainbow tower has an outdoor bar with fairly loud music until 10 or so each night. So you get to hear loud music instead of calm ocean breezes. The alternative, on the other side, faces a construction area and parking lot. For the week we were there, there was little construction work going on, and therefore little construction noise. The room itself is perfectly comfortable and well stocked with kitchen appliances and accessories. It isn't luxurious, but is perfectly comfortable. There is a pullout couch in the living room and a queen bed in the single bedroom. The bath is accessible to either room without anyone having to go through the other bedroom area. Housekeeping was excellent and the staff was friendly and accommodating. Checkout was quick and accurate. Overall, it was a perfectly comfortable and convenient location, but I don't think it had the luxury and relaxation factors one would expect for the price point.
