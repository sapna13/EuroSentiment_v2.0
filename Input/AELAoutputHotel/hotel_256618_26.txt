{"text":"Under whelmed Stayed for 3 nights in a city harbour view room. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be expecting the view shown on the website with this category of room. I had to lean over the railing and look to the left to see the Opera House. Loved the balcony and would of loved to sit out there but the seat cushions were soiled and the table was less than clean.The room itself was OK. Loved all the shelves. The lights in them do make the top surface warm so watch what you place on them. The automatic curtains would not close all the way. The light wood is pleasant but it shows every mar and scuff. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable I have experienced. I think the pillow topper was missing as it was very firm. Even our friends that came to our room made mention of it so I knew it was not just us. The bedside clock did not have a light so you could not tell the time after dark. Huge bathroom with great amenities. Slight mildew issue at the base of one of the glass walls in the shower. Toilet seat opening is quite large so beware. Some of the TV channels came in less than focused. Wonderful closet. Common areas were good with the exception of the area near the bar that smelled of stale smoke. The Staff are beyond wonderful! They are some of the best I have ever encountered.They along with the location are what make this hotel. If you put the building anywhere else it would not command such a price. ","annotations":[]}
