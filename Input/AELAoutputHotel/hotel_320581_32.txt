{"text":"Excellent Value, Superb Location I booked this hotel based solely on the reviews on TripAdvisor. I must say I'm glad I did! The hotel is new, so everything is squeaky clean and there are no funky stains or smells to be found :-)The room was narrow. With 2 cabin-size trolley luggage pieces and one medium one on the floor, there was not much to walk on around the bed. The bed was a king-size and comfortable. The room was also very quet. There wasn't an interesting view outside the window, but this didn't matter to us.There was cable TV with no english channels, but it was entertaining to check out TV commercials, cooking shows,l documentaries, even in Japanese.There was a small fridge in the room, an electric kettle with bags of Japanese green tea, and cups so you can fix yourself some any time of day. Further, there was a vending machine room across our front door that had a good selection of drinks (alcoholic,non-alcoholic) --- also reasonably priced compared to the vending machines and convenience stores across the street and elsewhere in the city.The bathroom was clean and well-stocked with the necessary amenities (yes, ladies, shampoo and conditioner are separate!). There was a fresh smelling yukata (cotton bath robe) for each of the occupants laid on the bed every night.The location cannot be beat! There was a Toei subway station just outside the hotel. Purchase a reloadable Suica\/Pasmo card so you can use any station with no hassle. Further away is the main JR Shinjuku station about three long staircases away. We used the Narita Express inbound, and the Airport Bus Limousine outbound because it will be difficult to lug all our heavy luggage up the stairs to the station, through the station gates, and down to the trains again. The Airport Limo bus has a stop at the Plaza Shinjuku so it's super convenient. Shopping and eats are just a 5-10 minute walk away.The hotel staff does not speak much English, so it is challenging, but they are helpful and will attempt to assist you with anything you need. A+++ for effort!We paid less than USD500 for a 4-night stay, booked thru Expedia (breakfast not included). Fantastic value! Will definitely stay at this hotel again when in Tokyo.
