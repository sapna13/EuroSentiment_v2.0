{"text":"Fantastic hotel What can I say, I think this is the best place to stay in Singapore! For location you simply cannot beat it. The most scenic areas of Singapore are at your doorstep, for lovely late evening jet-lagged walks, or for swims with views of the skyscrapers looming above you in the eternity pool. I was surprised to see other reviewers say that the service was not up to scratch - for this was the area that particularly stood out about the Fullerton. We stayed there for a week, and consistently found the staff extremely helpful and charming. The doormen were particularly friendly, always with a ready smile to welcome you back at the end of the day, it started to feel like home! The impression I got is that the management have really got things right, because the place ran like a well oiled machine - super efficient, yet still managing to be friendly and welcoming. Check-in and check-out was seamless. Concierge and restaurant staff likewise were always on the ball. The exterior of the building is far more interesting, attractive and historic than many of the other hotels in this category, possibly only with Raffles to compete on this score. But I would still give the Fullerton the edge, as it is a real landmark.The interior of the building is lovely. The flowers were always interesting, beautiful displays. I loved the tall pillars of the atrium, and particularly enjoyed watching the fish in the Atrium pool. The rooms werea good size, very comfortable, absolutely no complaints. The bathrooms were spacious and with great attention to detail in the design. Being a courtyard room, it wasn't the sunniest or brightest, but this was clear from the start.There are lots of interesting places to visit in walking distance, lest you be put off by the fact that it is in the city centre - it is by no means geared only towards business travellers. For dinner I particularly enjoyed the 'hawker stalls' next to the Esplanade theatre. The shop houses are nearby, boat cruises, and for everything else you can just pop into a convenient and cheap taxi! We had the Seafood buffet at the hotel and found it to be excellent. The Fullerton gets 10 out of 10 from me. I would not hesitate to recommend it. It was an absolute pleasure to stay there.
