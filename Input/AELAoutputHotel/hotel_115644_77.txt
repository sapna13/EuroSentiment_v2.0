{"text":"Wonderful Hotel, Great Service Booked this hotel on the advice of the reviewers. It was definitely everything that I expected and more. The rooms, although a touch small were clean, pleasant, and having a window that actually opened was a great plus. We were used to small hotel rooms travelling Europe so it didn't bother us at all. We were hardly ever in the room, as SF has so much to offer. The lobby was spacious and comfortable, and there was always fresh fruit, coffee and cookies. This was such a wecome sight when coming in from a long walk up and down the hills of SF! The bar in the lobby was wecolming as well, with 2 flat screen TVs that usually had a ball game or some other sporting event on. The people at the front desk were friendly and helpful. There was a menu in the room offering many different types of pillows, should you require something softer, more supportive, or hypoallergenic. There was also a list of spa equipment to add to the bath tub should you feel like a foot or bubble massage after a long day of walking. The tub was very deep and long, and a bath after a long day in SF was just what the doctor ordered! The location is great, as everyone else mentioned, right outside is a cable car stop (good to ride on at least once for the novelty) and shopping in the area is abundant, with Macys, Saks, Neimans, all across the street. Dotties True Blue Cafe, a wonderful breakfast spot was about a 3 block walk, ( and you need that walk, especially after you eat dotties fabulous breakfasts). A wonderful Mexican restaurant, Colibri, was also a couple of blocks away. If you get a chance eat at the Slanted Door at the Ferry Building for lunch or dinner. Food is fabulous. The Chancellor was just the perfect home base for all our SF explorations.
