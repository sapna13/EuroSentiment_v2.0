{"text":"The Best Resort in Punta Cana This resort was outstanding. Nothing but good comments about it. The resort is absolutely huge and I was spoiled for my first getaway. Lots of activities and things to see. Upkeep of this resort should be credited to the ground keepers which are up at early hours each day to rake the beach and maintain the ground. If your up early enough, you can see them high in the trees cutting down leaves, while only hanging from a rope and supporting themselves with their bare feet. On your walk around the resort you might catch the odd worker cutting open coconuts with his machete{very cool} You may also be surprised by the two main pools, both supporting a swim up bar with exceptioal staff there to make your day by the pool a memorable one. The suites are fantastic, however my girlfriend and her husband had a main floor room which they said had some everyday bugs, due to the fact that they were at ground level. So the reccomend staying second level and higher to eliminate this problem. Nice jucuzzi tubs for your pleasure in your room. Beach is beautiful. Manicured very nicely. Water was actually warm getting in. Made the ocean a beautiful place. Your walk down to the near village is 5 minutes on the beach. The border between the resort and the village is guarded by one security guard with a camera, but the villagers seem to be respectful in not crossing it. However I was quite uncomfortable with the pushiness of the village people so I suggest keeping your shopping along the beach if you do not want to be extremely hassled by them. There are enough stores along the beach to get what you want. I would also reccommend that you do alot of your shopping in the resort because the prices are better than the village and you save yourself the hassle. They also have some of the retail guys come in from the city every week, so ask. The disco is good, but we enjoyed the entertainment in the theatres. Great Michael Jackson preformance. A must see. Lots of variety on drinks. Must try some traditional Mama Huana, but be careful it allows for a fantastic time. We like to call it Dominican Viagra. Ask your server to explain. Buffets are huge. Lots of selection. If your a picky eater I suggest the Papa Fritta's {French fries} to keep it simple. If your a milk drinker, I suggest sticking to the pepsi. Closest thing to home for taste. The buffets were really tasty. a la carte restaurants are decent, I recommend the mexican and ittalian. Lots of excursions. The best is the dune buggies. What a great excursion. You are picked up and are taken for a ride through some village life on the way there. You are greeted at the destination where you are suited up and taken on your tour. If you are not a good driver however I recommend having someone else drive for you are on your own on their roads at the beginning and let me tell you it is scary with no road rules. You arrive at a coffee plantation and get to mingle with the locals. Next up is a dip in a natural spa. Very cool. Ending up at the beach at the end of the day. DO NOT BRING ANY BAGS ON THIS EXCURSION!!!! THEY END UP FILTHY!!! Camereas are okay but tuck them in somewhere they won't get wet. This resort is outstanding and I am very fortunate to have experienced this place. Take lots of dollar bills for tipping, sit back at the pool, drink some mama huana, fall down, and be somebody. Don't forget to tip your groundsmen, Remembery they are the ones who keep it beautiful for you, ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1025,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1021},{"endOffset":2267,"mention":"French fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":2255},{"endOffset":2267,"mention":"French fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":2255},{"endOffset":2267,"mention":"French fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":2255},{"endOffset":2343,"mention":"pepsi","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pepsi"],"startOffset":2338},{"endOffset":2931,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2925},{"endOffset":2931,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2925},{"endOffset":2931,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2925},{"endOffset":2931,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2925},{"endOffset":2931,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2925}]}
