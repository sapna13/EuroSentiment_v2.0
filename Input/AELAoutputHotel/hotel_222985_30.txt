{"text":"NO Air Conditioning, No Management Attention To It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This place was very hard to find, you would never have stumbled upon it for a nights stay. We finally got in to our room after a long drive and going around the place for about an hour. You have to pay $19.00 per night for Valet parking whether you want it or not. When we got into the room i noticed it was rather warm. I fiddled with every switch on the thermostat but to no avail. Opened the windows and sweated the night in Miami. Next morning we had to get up early but around noon came back for a nap. I called the front desk and was told they would have maintenance check it outAfter dinner we came back STILL NO AIRCONDITIONING. I sweated all night and woke up every hour until about 4:00 am. At check out i asked if there would be any recompense for no Air Conditioning. I had already retrieved my vehicle. Management did not bother to come out and actually talk to me, but i was offered a free breakfast. Well if i recall, it was an overpriced continental breakfast. Basically i was offered a free jelly roll for having spent two nights in a hot Miami room with the windows open and noisy water traffic outside. Despite my lack of sleep, we did drive safely to our next location. I wrote management suggesting they do something for me, but they gave me a big fat NOTHING. A. someone either, knew it (the Air-Conditioning) was not working and gave me a bad room anyway OR management was ignorant of one of their rooms condition. Then B. when made aware, NOTHING got fixed and NO offers of a working room were made. Then finally C. when asking for some adjustment, I once again got NOTHING in from management. This used to be a Clarion resort and i guess they got smart enough to sell it off. This place has to rely on internet reservations or i doubt anyone would find it. I wrote management and suggested, make it right or i'll write which is exactly what i am doing. I will never ever consider staying here again, because apparently they just don't care. They got my money and after that i was just out of luck.
