{"text":"Amazing hotel - loved it! My partner and I came back from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Pulitzer this morning and I loved this hotel so much that wanted to write a review straight away.The hotel was absolutely fantastic. It is very modern and luxurious and spottless with very comfortable surroundings. There was free internet access in the room so we took our laptop along and really enjoyed being able to email home and sends pictures to all our friends and family to make them jealous.We used room service on several occassions and found the price very reasonable. The food was absolutely delicious and at a very high standard.The location of the hotel was fantastic. You could walk to a great number of attractions and a 1 minute walk from the main shopping street. We also used the many metro stops around the hotel to travel to different sights such as the Segrada Familia and found it so easy to travel around the city.We both agreed one of the best parts of this hotel were the staff. They were so helpful and couldn't do enough to make our stay an enjoyable one. They always recognised us and said hello even though it isn't a very small hotel. When we ordered a drink in the main lobby bar the bar staff seemed horrified that we would carry the drinks to the table ourselves and insisted on bringing them over. They were all just great.If you have any doubt about staying at this hotel then there really is no need. If I ever go to Barcelona again I will definately be staying at this hotel. ","annotations":[]}
