{"text":"Great family hotel We stayed here for 4 nights in April (recommendation from the Rick Steve's book). My husband had a conference in the Dam area, and none of the conference hotels would accommodate 4 people! This place was cheaper than most of the conference room hotels, and breakfast was included!Since I was traveling with my husband and two kids (6  9) I wanted a place that was safe and quite. This hotel was ideal for us. We stayed in room16, (which was large by European standards) it had a nice balcony overlooking a quite street. Since my son got sick soon after our arrival, it was nice having a large room that allowed my husband to work while my son got through his illness. We also stayed in Room 2 (which is even larger), it had a nice view of the back patio. I originally booked the hotel for 3 nights, but realized I needed it for another night for our flight out, and luckily they were able to accommodate us. The pillows\/bed\/showers were very nice. I'm afraid my kids will be spoiled because it was so nice. It is very close to the Leidsplain and Museum area, so you can walk to alot of sites. If you want to get to the center of town, it's only a 5-10 minute trolley ride to the Red Light District and Dam area. (Get a strip card from the TI at Leidslain about 6E for a strip card of 15. You need to use two strip cards\/trip.)The breakfast was fine for everyone, no one felt hungry. The kids especially like the chocolate sprinkles to put on their bread. You can buy a wifi card if you bring your own computer.
