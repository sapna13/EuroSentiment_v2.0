{"text":"Great Trip! First for those who say it is a 3 star. They are wrong, the only complaint i have for my whole trip was the other tourests that were there, alot were european, and very rude, not all of them but most when they knew that we didnt speak spanish right away they were rude. Besides that eveything was amazing. The food was good, anywhere you go tropical you cant go overboard with alot of exotic food that you are not used to or else you will be in the bathroom....Bahia's food was above normal for these resorts. The grounds are Lush and amazing, every where you look people are keeping them up. The lobby is great marble everywhere, very friendly staff, and the front desk is the only people you can count on to speak 100% english. All the other staff Try very hard to accomidate you. After a few days you will pick up general things, that will help you along the way. The beach and pools were awsome, allways could find a spot, it was quite busy when we were there but there was allways a spot either on the beach or pool area. The resort is quite big so if you dont like to walk, then dont complain, but there is a tram service that runs every 2 mins to and from the front to the back of the resort. All and all great vacation, for my first one to a tropical destination....Will deff recomend to others and will be back sometime.....Jeff at the front desk is a hoot....Also Jose at the front desk....great guy***** golden stars ","annotations":[]}
