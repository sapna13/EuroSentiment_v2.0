{"text":"Brilliant Stayed here from 31 July to 14 August 2008  couldn't have had a better time anywhere. This was my second visit to DR  I wasn't disappointed.Flight with First Choice was good even though we where slightly delayed, only problem was they where quite late bringing the first lot of food round - bearing in mind that we had been up since 3.a.m  had nothing to eat. The food areas at North Terminal leave a lot to be desired  as it was relatively early most of the shops hadn't stocked up on food items. If I had known about the food choices at North I would have gone back down to South at least theres a McDonalds there for the kids!Arrived at Punta Cana same time as about 4 other planes but nevertheless it didn't take long to get through immigration collect bags  be on our coach.Check in at Ocean Sands was very organised - everyone ushered through to what appeared to be a conference room where we where given our room details  fitted with wrist bands.Off to our rooms  5 minutes later luggage arrived. One problem - safety deposit box had been left closed by previous occupants - phone call down to reception  within 10 minutes maintenance  security men arrived  proceeded to open the safe. Couldn't have asked for speedier service.Rooms are very big, but unfortunately where rather bare (no pictures on the walls)  also a little tired looking. Bathroom too was huge but some maintenance required here - several of the fittings where coming away form the walls  toilet flush handle had been broken  glued together. But hey we weren't here to spend our 2 weeks in the room. The air con unit was very noisy  turned it off the 1st night only then to have the noise of the fridge in the background. We then spent the rest of the 2 weeks going to sleep with earplugs in - couldn't do without the air con. The general appearance of the hotel is well presented - all the restaurants  entertainment away from the bedrooms. All of the public areas where extremely clean  well looked after.We ate in all of the restaurants apart from the ones which you have to pay. Our favourite was the Mexican - food  service brilliant. Route 66 food  service appalling - don't bother with this one!Buffet had a large choice but if you ate here every night I am sure it would be rather repetetive. The beach restaurant was great at lunch - able to get pizza, chicken chips etc  take these back to the sunbed on the beach to eat. Deserts served here where also good but you had to be there early when it opened as the best quickly went  where not replaced - lovely chocolate gateuax.At night this restaurant was also very good  we ate here 3 times. Never seemed to be very busy - probably because it wasn't in the main section  also I think that some people thought it was the restaurant on the beach which you had to pay extra for. Witnessed several weddings during our stay  this was where they had there receptions.Mikes - excellent - drinks  cakes. Sometimes took a take away Latte back to the room at night.The beach went on for miles  was beautiful white sand. Would often get up  walk for between 1-2 hours every morning at 7ish. The seaweed would always be raked away by the hotel cleaners along the way.Spent most of our days at the beach - the pool tended to be too hot  on the beach 4 people where able to get shade unlike at the pool only 2 under an umberella. Believe me you will need shade between 12  2 - very hot.The sea was lovely  warm, clean  clear.One evening my son got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom only to find a puddle of water on the floor - air con unit was leaking Phone call to reception  someone was there within 15 minutes  had it fixed. Can't understand the previous reviews I read where people said they where waiting ages for things to be repaired. All in all we had a wonderful time. Hope to go back again to DR - its the only place I have wanted to return to  hopefully will be back again.
