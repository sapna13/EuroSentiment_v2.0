{"text":"The Intercontinental Bali is the worst hotel in Bali. We stayed at the Intercontinental Bali during our 9 day honeymoon in August 2006. We also stayed at the Kajane Mua in Ubud, the Ubud Hanging Gardens, and Conrad Hilton hotels. In comparison, the Intercontinental was THE worst hotel we stayed at. I'm extremely surprised at the rave reviews for the Intercontinental on this site. There are MUCH better hotels on Bali, for better prices. The main problem with the Intercontinental is that it is old. The furniture and overall condition of the rooms are horrible. We had to ask to have rooms changed three times. One room even had what looked to be blood stains on the bed sheets. Another room had a horrible smell. We were shown to a different room, and as we were entering an employee was leaving with a can of air freshener he had just sprayed to mask the smell.We stayed at the Singaraja wing which provided a free concierge service. Be Warned! The concierge service offered to help us by arranging dinner at a nearby seafood restaurant on the beach. The restaurant even came to pick us up. Everything was fine until we found out the restaurants right next to the hotel within walkin distance were just as nice and charged 5 times less for the same seafood. When I complained to the hotel, the hotel assistant manager confirmed that the concierge people were taking bribes or a commission for these services from the restaurant which they shouldn't be doing. He apologized and all he said he could do was to look into it and talk to those employees.Also, DO NOT GET A MASSAGE at the hotel spa. It is overpriced and actually was the worst massage we got in Bali. There are lots of non-hotel spas that charge over 10 times less and offer a better massage. We went to one of these non-hotel spas and got a full 1 hour massage for less than $9USD. The Intercontinental charges around $60USD plus the 21% tax for a similar massage.The only thing good about this hotel is that it is on one of the better beaches in Bali, great for surfing. If you do not plan to swim in the ocean, the Conrad Hilton is a much better hotel and overall value.I would urge anybody considering the Intercontinental to please reconsider.
