{"text":"Room thefts Vacationed at Paradisus Punta Cana 6\/11-6\/14\/07.Hotel was very nice-beautiful grounds, friendly service, food average. Overall would have said it was a very nice vacation. Two major problems: 1. We arrived at 1pm, check in is not until 3pm. We did not get into our room until 4pm- we travelled during the off season-so the resort was not crowded, reception repeated told us our room was not cleaned yet and kept advising us 15 more minutes, a familar story that was also told to other guests that we spoke to duing our stay. 2. The day we checked out, we got to the airport when I realized I had left a bag which contained a battery charger to my digital camera in a draw in my room, as soon as I got home I phoned the resort and spoke to 2 people in lost and found who told me nothing was turned in. I then spoke with a manager and was told he spoke to housekeeping and was told nothing was found in the room. So obviously the bag was stolen and not reported to the lost and found-which is very dishearting because the bag was a cheap cavas bag w\/ only a battery charger in it. I was also told by another guest who had left some costume jewerly out on her dresser, which was stolen as well and when she reported it stolen the manager told her to call the local police and was of no help. So be careful about what you leave out -use your safe and triple check your room before checking out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
