{"text":"Charming hotel close to the Eiffel My partner and I stayed at this charming hotel in April 2007 and were completely won over by all aspects of its hospitality. First of all, the location is ideal as it is close to the Ecole Militaire Metro (in the 7th arrondisement) with many wonderful cafes nearby for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Les Invalides (Napoleon's tomb) is practically a stone's throw away. The rooms themselves are quite spacious for a Paris hotel as I've stayed in places in Paris before that were slightly bigger than a kitchen drawer. The rooms look as if they've been recently renovated with marble\/granite bathroom countertops that are nicely cleaned everyday. There is a good breakfast - I particulary appreciated the fresh fruit - and all the amenities one could expect in a hotel (i.e. soap, lotion, dryer, internet, etc). Above all, however, I must single out the staff who were all exceptional. Muhammed, Amandine, Estelle and the cleaning and wait staff were a delight to deal with and they went out of their way to be pleasant and helpful. (How Parisians get their reputation for being snotty, I'll never know, but I'm guessing it has as much to do with the visitor as with the way the French respond to certain attitudes). The cherry on the cake, of course, was the view of the Eiffel Tower from our rom with its glorious shimmering lights at night. I think you have to have a corner room to see it; so, ask for rooms 25, 35 or 45. This is a gem of a place and I wholly recommend it to anyone visiting Paris in the near future.
