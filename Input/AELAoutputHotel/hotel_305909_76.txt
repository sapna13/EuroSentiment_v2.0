{"text":"Lovely hotel, near the MTR As soon as we arrived at this hotel we were impressed with the look of it. The lobby was spacious and very bright. The reception area was easily located to the right of the main doors. The recptionists were very friendly and helpful. The hotel leads on to a large mall, which has 7 floors of shops. Ideal for the tourist who wants to splash out on things. We bought so much we had to buy another case to bring the presents home.The area that this hotel is situated is near Mongkok, close to all the markets and near the MTR for trips to Hong Kong island. The MTR is excellent, it is cheap, quick and regular. The room in the hotel was good, not overly wonderful, but good it had all the necessities in the room for you to enjoy some relaxation time.The bathroom was clean with enough towels to enjoy a comfort hug.The lounge area of the hotel was large, it had 3 big TV screen's playing throughout the evening time. It is in this area that they serve cakes by the bucket full (provided you pay for them). The lounge had an excellent atmosphere in the evening when they had a duo who would sing requests...by the way they were very good.The food in the restaurant was really good and presented well, and the buffet was..WOW.Everyone of the staff were really helpful and we had no complaints. We could actually cash our travellers cheques without any problems..Woohoo!I would definately stay at this hotel again. It was a diamond in the rough.
