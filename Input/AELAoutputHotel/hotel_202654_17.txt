{"text":"Above average with but disappointing because of its potential We stayed for 5 nights in early February. The location is a little far to walk to Alexanderplatz but the U-Bahn is really like 20 steps from the hotel. We took a deluxe apartment but with the short stay option rather than the hotel. That saved us about 30% off the price. Apparently the difference is that the rooms are only cleaned twice a week and breakfast is included. The apartments have a kitchen - a FULL kitchen with cutlery and plates cups and glasses and a dining table and everything you need. We bought food and made our own breakfast. We were pretty tired when we arrived so we ordered room service. The food was a bit pricey and ok quality.The apartment was big and clean and neat. The TVs are small and the choice of english language programs was incredibly poor. Thats not really the hotels fault - it's a German thing. The staff were polite and efficient most of the time. The safe in the room is tiny - too small for a laptop. That was annoying. The wifi is pretty expensive, especially when they say they are a 4 star hotel and nowadays I expect free wifi in a 4 star hotel. A week of wifi cost about 70 EUR and the download rates I was getting were only like 20 or 30 k\/s so we couldn't really stream video on the laptop either. Podcasts came through fine though. Their authentication system would cut in every few hours and kill any downloads you were running as it resets. That was a pain.The aircon  heating is seperate from a ventilation system that works all night whether you want it or not. The fans were a little noisy and kept my wife awake on the first night. The next day we called, and they got a technician to turn it off only for our room. We also needed their help to get the heating system working. There are no instructions in the room and control panels are pretty useless without someone explaining it to you. There is no temperature control.The parking was about 150 m. away from the hotel. We had sunny weather most of the time but I can imagine that being a long 150 m. in the wind and rain. Next to the parking is a supermarket that actually had a pretty good range of organic foods.Just down Wallstrasse there is a shop that specialises in Australian food. It has some really nice things. I can recommend the Tasmanian Leatherwood honey. Its pretty strong but there is nothing like it on some toast with a little butter.On checkout, they said we had used the minibar which was not true. They immediately removed the minibar items from the bill.Overall, I would recommend it - especially for a family trying to get a nice, big, clean room for a reasonable price. With a few changes it could really be a fantastic place. As it is, its just pretty good.
