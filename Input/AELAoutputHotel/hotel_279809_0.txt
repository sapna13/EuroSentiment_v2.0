{"text":"BARFFF! It was my first time at an all inclusive resort so i was pretty excited to go... we arrived pretty late our first night and were VERY hungry - but there was NO food to be found..unless you were looking for an old crusty bun and some nasty meat (which we were not) --- soo we hit the bar instead we almost went into a coma from all the sugar in the lame drinks. not impressed. The beach is great but being Canadian girls we arent accustomed to topless women and old speedo-ed men. One of the girls sllipped on the dirty [--] floors and got a leg injury .not impressed. Now heres where the horror story begins!!!!!!!!!!!! the food tasted okay.. i guess.. but as vegatrians we couldnt eat to much... what we did eat made us VERRRRRRRRYYYY ILL!!!!! not impressed!!!! after one week of throwing up -- and sitting on a toilet (ants in the bathroom) -- wising for our death we were more than happy to go home - this was by FARRR the best day of our trip!!!! NOTTTTTT IMPRESSED!!!! When we got back to Canada we went to the doctors first thing - we were givin LOTSS of med's and one of the girls had to go to the hospital due to the severity of illness that was inflicted onto her by the WONDERFUL LTI now known as the VIK I wonder how great this resort really is if they had to change their name???? Lawsuit anyone???? ","annotations":[{"endOffset":231,"mention":"bun","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bun"],"startOffset":228}]}
