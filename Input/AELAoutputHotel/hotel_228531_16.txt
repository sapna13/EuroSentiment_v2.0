{"text":"Hotel exceeded expectations - excellent experience As an American used to spacious hotel rooms my expectations were not very high when I booked a room for 4 in this hotel through Expedia for me, my husband, and my two grown sons (both over 6 ft so I expected a tight fit in a small European hotel room). What a pleasant surprise the stay was! The front desk staff was very helpful and upgraded us to a 2 bedroom suite that was larger than most of the American hotels I've stayed in. It had a full dining room, two large bathrooms with showers and tubs, a nice size bedroom and a large living room\/bedroom - plus a large terrace accessible from all rooms. There was a complimentary mini bar (fridge) in the lobby and in the room with sodas, bottled water and beer, and a television in each room. Climate controls\/air conditioning worked well throughout, and the front desk staff was extremely helpful giving us maps, directions, or suggestions (in English, which was appreciated) on getting around Barcelona (they could also book excursions if you choose to use a tour but we didn't). The rooms were clean and comfortable (unfortunately, only two English TV stations though - CNN and BBC, but the Euro 2008 games kept my sons busy and we didn't travel to Barcelona to watch TV). While the hotel was not located near the tourist area of Los Ramblas, the #17 bus a block away takes you to Los Ramblas and the beaches easily, and the hotel is walking distance to the diagonal and metro stations. We tired of Los Ramblas after the first two days and found the diagonal was easy to walk to and an enjoyable and interesting place to spend some time visiting. The hotel offers breakfast at 12 euros\/person but we didn't try it since we moved at too slow a pace in the morning, but there is a supermarket (supermarcado) right across the street as well as numerous pastry shops open most of the time. My other son was staying in a much more expensive hotel that hosted a conference he was presenting at, and it did not have as nice a room or as many amenities (like free internet service or the room minibar) as we had. I highly recommend this hotel to travelers looking for a nice play to stay in Barcelona where the rooms are nice, the staff is attentive and the location is safe and centrally situated.
