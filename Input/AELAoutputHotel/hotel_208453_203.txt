{"text":"Loved Hilton Times Square and NYC! My family(party of 4) stayed at this hotel on Sept 2005 for 6 nights. We got a very good rate at $249\/night for a deluxe room on the high floor. Excellent Views of 42nd Street and some views of Times Square from there. The hotel was excellent. I noticed that some people were complaining below, but cannot understand their complaints. The room was very comfortable and spacious, the bathroom was a large size, beds were comfortable and the elevators were very fast. All the staff members we met were friendly. They even checked us in and let us go to our rooms in the morning as we arrived in NYC at 7am(although check in time was supposed to be noon). We just returned from our trip to Europe, we went to London and Nice and paid even more for our hotels there. With the price we paid in London and Nice, the hotels there were below average. The Hilton Times Square was definitely 5 stars compared to the hotels we stayed in Europe for exactly the same price we paid. The location of the Hilton Times Square can't be beat. Walking distance to all the sites and attractions of Times Square. Next to it is a subway stop and you're also close to all the city tour bus stops. It's not a far walk either to 5th Ave, Macys, and Central Park. We even walked to the UN from our hotel last year, not too bad of a walk if you're up to it. There are a bunch of restaurants, delis, bars in the area. No need to eat at the hotel's restaurant or have 24 hour room service, as it's expensive. Some of the delis we went into were 24 hours and the food was inexpensive but very good. Location was awesome!I noticed that the hotel rates have gone up since last year, but we still got a good rate as we're coming back this Thanksgiving 2006 for a whole week, this time with more family members. We did book 7 months in advance to get a $299\/rate for the Thanksgiving week. I just looked at the website again and it's now $600\/night for the same room. Hotel room rates in Manhattan have skyrocketed so expect to pay if you are staying in Manhattan during peak times.. One of the reasons, there's a lot of conversions of hotel rooms to condos\/lofts, so there are less and less hotel rooms available in Manhattan. When researching for hotels, even for a 2 star hotel can cost you $200\/night during peak season. Plus so many people from all over the world wants to go there, that would mean more demand and less supply which will make it more and more expensive to stay in Manhattan. Loved NYC and can't wait to go back there in a month!
