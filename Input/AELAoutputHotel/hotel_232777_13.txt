{"text":"Super Location My husband and I just returned from a Mediterranean cruise on the Emerald Princess. Barcelona was our last port where we disembarked. We wanted to experience Barcelona before going home and wanted to be near Las Rambla street where all of the action is in Barcelona.( Don't miss walking the whole length of the street from Placa Catalunya to the Port). This Hotel Gravina was very close and not too expensive compared to many other hotels. You definitely need 2 days to do everything and we only stayed 1 night, which wasn't enough.The hotel was nothing to rave about, but was very clean and great for taking the airport bus the next morning. It is about a 10 minute walk with luggage to Placa Catalunya. The blue Aerobus can be caught on the far side of the park from the hotel as you walk to Placa Catalunya. The cost was 4 euros pp for the bus and it took about 20 minutes to get to the airport. There were many people using the bus at 6:30 am. It runs about every 15 to 20 minutes and drops you right at the terminal you need.If you want a beautiful hotel, this isn't for you, but if you want clean and less expensive, you won't be disappointed.By the way, be sure if you take a taxi from the cruise that you get in line early for a taxi. We waited for 1 hour in a long, hot line, and then the taxi driver didn't know where Hotel Gravina was until I showed him the address on the confirmation statement from the internet.
