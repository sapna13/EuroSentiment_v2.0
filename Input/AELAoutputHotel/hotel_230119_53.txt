{"text":"Convenient location but not 100% satisfied We stayed at the Sheraton for 1 night while we had a 30 hours before a flight back home. The airport location was great, no need to go outside at all. The train took only 15 minutes to get to the city center and you could walk out of your hotel and literally be able to check in for your flight. However, I was a little bit amazed that the hotel was charging 5 euro for 15 minutes of internet usage. I havent lived in Europe in 10 years so I am not too sure but maybe internet is very expensive in Amsterdam and thats why they were charging, to me, outrageous prices for internet service. Also, our flight was not until 4:30 pm the next day and we asked if it was possible to check out at 2pm, instead of the 1pm time listed. We were told that there was a 10e charge for every hour stayed over. We could not believe it...I have NEVER (and i mean never) been asked to pay for staying an hour over the check out time. At 12 oclock we were also called to ask when we were checking out and had a cleaner knock on our door at 12:30, which I thought was rude. I really liked the decor of the hotel, was very modern and clean. The rooms were quite small but very comfortable and the bed was great! I also thought the bathroom looked very nice. The front desk people were also friendly and nice. ","annotations":[]}
