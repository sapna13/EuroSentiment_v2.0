{"text":"Great Resort I do realize I'm writing this review late I went last year in May, but I have to say I loved this resort. We said VIP where we had our own private pool, swim up bar, and private beach. This section is for 18+ so if want to be away from the chaos I would totally recommend upgrading to that section. The resort is huge and involves walking unless you wait for thr trolley which we did most of the time. The food was very good we always found something we liked. Our favorite a la carte restaurant was the spain restaurant I would def recommend the steak it was great. As VIP you get unlimited reservations. We also ate at the mexican and japanese rest. and we both very good also they only restaurant that was alittle disppointing was the italian one. The service is amazing, all the employees work so hard to accommodate you and I tipped. Tips are suppose to be included but I still did and they appreciate it so much. The shows were pretty good and the club was very good they managed to get everyone up to dance so be prepared. the employees will grab you and dance with you. The drinks were good but once you tip them they make it extremely strong FYI. The beach was gorgeous we also went parasailing which was so much fun and I totally recommend it even if you are scared of heights because I am. You can see how beautiful the island really is. The only thing is I wouldnt recommend leaving the resort thats for sure! But the reason I loved this resort is there was no reason to leave we never got bored. We stayed for 8 days. We also got massages on the beach, I work in the spa industry so I have had many massages before but that was the best massage my boyfriend and I have ever had. Obviously this was a yr ago so I dont know if you'll get the same people or experience. But theres so much to do. You would like it. When I go back to punta cana I will probably try a different resort because there are so many. but I would recommend this place for anyone. If you are honeymoooners, couples or just all adults do the VIP. but the resort is great for families also.
