{"text":"All the charm of Venice After reading extensive reviews of hotels in Venice, I chose this hotel for our two night stay in March 2008. We had requested a room for three people and I was a bit apprehensive of what we were going to get, but could not have been more pleased with the room we were given.Upon check in, the staff was very friendly and gave us a briefing of where we were in relationship to all the major attractions. We were offered an upgrade for a suite in an adjacent building for a few more Euro, but opted to keep the room we booked. It was a beautiful room that fit a queen size bed and roll-in twin comfortably with a very large bathroom that looked like it was recently renovated. It was done in beautiful stone tiling with ample counter space, glass sconces, a shower, and bidet. If you stuck your head out the bathroom window, you could actually see the Grand Canal. The room itself was very clean and decorated accordingly with the old world charm of Venice.To some, the location may seem far from places like the Rialto (a 10-15 minute walk) or Piazza San Marco (a 20 minute vaporetto ride), but it proved extremely convenient to the train station (from where we arrived) and to Piazzale Roma where all the taxis and shuttles depart from to the airport (from where we left.) The only word of warning is that you will need to carry your luggage over the Scalzi Bridge (around 80 steps) from the train station) and two other bridges if you're heading to Piazzale Roma. It's a small price to pay for the great location and sure beats rolling your luggage to a hotel around Piazza San Marco or lugging it onto a water taxi.The area felt very safe and easy to find your way back after wandering all the streets and canals (just keep following the signs that say Ferrovia). Getting lost is the quintessential experience in Venice and it's how you discover some amazing architecture, shops, and restaurants.We had breakfast at the hotel on our last day and enjoyed the simple buffet of pastries, fruit and coffee. The free internet terminal in the lobby was also a nice bonus. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone willing to stay a little bit away from the major sites, but appreciates great service, charming rooms, and is in need of some good cardio getting those bags over the bridges.
