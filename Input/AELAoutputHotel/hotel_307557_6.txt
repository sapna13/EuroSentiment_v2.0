{"text":"Nice but lacking personality Me, my wife and some relatives spent 9 days in the Puri Bagus Lovina this july. Disregarding some apparent communication problems between our agent and the hotel check in was efficient and fast.Me and my wife got a Deluxe Ocean View and the relatives Superior Garden view. Both bungalow types were nice and clean, although the extra money we spent on the ocean view definitely wasn't worth it. Sure, we saw the ocean, but we definitely had to work on it to manage (trees and other buildings in the way). The cable tv consisted of CNN and two indonesian channels, so not much to write home about (not that tv was the reason for going to Bali).The hotel grounds were beautiful. A lot of flowers and trees. Make sure you watch the palm trees though as we almost got hit by falling coconuts twice. They do not seem to keep after the trees enough.The pool was nice, if maybe a bit small. The last fact made worse by the hotel arranging diving courses that partly took place in the pool. The beach is not really bath friendly, but some stretches of it are quite nice during high tide and the black sand is really splendid! The gazebos along the beach are wonderful and I can highly recommend them, sadly there're not that many of them and when a lot of people are in the hotel you will have to get up really early to manage to get a hold of either a sun chair or a gazebo. There're just not enough of them and the recommendation we got from the assistant hotel manager was just that: get up early and put a towel on a chair to book it before heading to breakfast. The only problem with this was that towels were cleared away from a chair if nothing else was there too (as they should be). Most people put down books or something like that in addition to the towels, but sadly my sister and her boyfriends books got stolen from one of the gazebos. After talking to management (who first told them that the books hadn't been stolen but that they had misplaced them in their bungalow) the books eventually resurfaced after a visit to the small village that's located next to the hotel. The irritating part was, of course, the attitude from management since the books disappeared during a 10 minute absence.The restaurant served a very nice breakfast buff√ã√\u2022√ñ and had nice food over all. Rather expensive though and especially drinks were about three times the price to what they should be. We only had a few meals in the hotel and left the hotel grounds for all others. We can especially recommend 1000 Dreams that's just outside the Puribagus if you walk left along the beach. They had cheap and very tasty food and great service that put a golden lining on our stay.One last thing that was a tad irritating was the rather insistent tries to get you to sign up for the different buff√ã√\u2022√ñs etc that the hotel arranged. You just don't have to both place flyers in the bungalow and ask 2-3 times. After a while that gets really irritating.To sum up, we had a nice and relaxing stay with a few points of irritation. Mostly we had expected a bit more from the Puri Bagus Lovina, but on the whole it's a nice hotel if maybe a bit expensive for what you actually get.
