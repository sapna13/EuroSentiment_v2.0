{"text":"The review to read!! I booked this room for my boyfriends b-day through priceline and only paid $79!.I was surprised when the rate was excepted. I was also skeptical because I have read in the past that priceline's customers may get the crappy rooms in a hotel, but this was quite the opposite. I will start from the beginning:1. Parking- Outside parking was not a big deal for us. We always seemed to find a spot. Even though we may have had to drive around once or twice. There is garage parking available but it costs either $10 or $15 so I did the free parking2. Lobby- Usual 4 star lobby with all the marble and granite. Very nice but the ballrooms were showing its age a little bit.3.Elevators-Kinda small for such a big hotel and some of them smelled like feet. Good thing it was a short ride! On the plus side, there was a lot of elevators so the wait time was very short if any wait time at all.4. Room- Very clean and adequately equipped for business and pleasure. The one thing that ticks me off with these 4 star hotels are the TV's. The room would be so much nicer with a 32 LCD instead of the customary 27 bubble screen. We stayed on the 12th floor so at night the city was lit and it was kinda nice. There was also a minibar, but beware...the prices are downright crazy! they have regular size kit-kats for $2.50. The beds were also kinda hard...usually hotel beds should be plush....but it was okay. Room service was great! We had pizza and tortilla soup. The food was excellent but the prices were ridiculous!. It was $28! They add in their own 15% gratutity. Also if you look online, the rooms look the exact way so it was good there were no surprises.5.Bathroom- Kinda small but had nice counter space. The shower head was kinda weak, but it still did its job.6. Area attractions-Was near to all types of restaurants and shopping, movie theatre etc..only a five minute drive.Overall I would give this hotel a 3.5. They would get a 4 if the beds were softer and they had better tv's. I checked online and the regular rate is $199. I think that they are stretching it a lot. The most I would pay in Dallas is $120 and even thats stretching it a bit!
