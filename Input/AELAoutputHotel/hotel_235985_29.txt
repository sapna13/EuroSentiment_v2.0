{"text":"A real gem of a hotel! Staying at this Hotel was truly the highlight of our trip to Florence. It was very close to the train station, but yet the neighborhood was very nice. I recommend heading east out of the train station, and not out the front main entrance. Head out towards where the bus station is on a small side street, then turn right on Via Faenza you can't miss it on the right hand side. It is at most a five minute walk. Also on the small side street to the back of the hotel is where you will find a mini market, and the laundrymat. We were traveling as a large party of 10, and bookked two quadruple rooms and one double. All the rooms were large, very clean, and with superior linens. The towels were the some of the nicest we could ever hope for, and we were given plenty of towels, and there was a chest with extra blankets, everything very clean and fresh smelling. There was a good safe in the room, and all three of our rooms had a very nice tub\/shower combination, plus an extra shower. The hotel was not noisy, and it had a lift. The staff was very professional and pleasant. Alberto was especially helpful to my father as he lost his cell phone and Alberto helped him out the best he could. They also called a taxi for us so we could go to the Uffizi museum and the Accademia, and they did the reservations for us ahead of time to cut down on the lines. The breakfast was the best we had in Italy, with plenty of fresh fruit, delicious breads and pastries, cereals, juices, yogurt. They made you to order your capuccino, and for the children fresh hot chocolate made with real chocolate, not powdered chocolate. At the front desk they have a small bar where you can get a glass of wine or cup of tea in the evening. We had the best dinner at Enzo and Piero which was just a few doors down, and a great pizzeria also a few doors down, and pastries and gelato on the corner. Around a block and a half away was the laundromat where we were able to wash our clothes. The San Lorenzo market was just across the the main street and a short walk. Highly recommend this market it is where we found the best prices. We were so happy we picked this hotel, all the family loved it and hope to come back one day.
