{"text":"Good, Solid Airport Hotel This turned out to be an very good stay, but please read my review so we can keep in mind that sometimes reviewers are not open-minded or that hotels can change.  I made this reservation through hotwire.com, which does not allow purchasers to see which hotel they are reserving when booking a stay. They merely give you a rating and a class. They also reference a tripadvisor rating, if available. So, when I saw an excellent price ($64.00 per night before taxes and charges) for a hotel rated by hotwire at 3 stars plus a tripadvisor rating at 3.5, I thought, this can't be bad. Besides, I had checked tripadvisor.com prior to consulting hotwire and the hotels rated at 3.5 by tripadvisor were good hotels. I'd had had good experiences with hotwire.com before, so I bought my travel package without knowing which it would be. To my horror, it turned out to be this Holiday Inn, and I say to my horror, because I had noticed this hotel on tripadvisor.com, and prior to my visit, it had a customer rating of 2 or 2.5 stars, and some very negative recent comments, although there were one or two comments that were positive. So, I was predisposed, because of what I had read on tripadvisor.com, to believe this was not going to be a good experience. My wife and I stayed for 7 days and 6 nights. We were given a room with two beds, which were both queens (a good thing; hotels should dump standard beds and get queens from now on), which we need because our son stayed with us a couple of nights.  The room was clean, well-appointed. There is wallpaper in the bathroom that was peeling, but it wasn't anything horrific. Besides, I've seen peeling wallpaper in other hotels, which should be a lesson to hotels not to use it in humid areas such as bathrooms. The room service was adequate and always done before we arrived back for the evening. The beds were comfortable and roomy. The bathroom was old-looking, but clean and the shower had adequate water pressure and sufficient hot water.  The hotel is located in an industrial park-airport hotel area just north of the airport, to which it has easy access via a road that runs right in front of the hotel and parellel to the 101 freeway. It is right off the northbound 101 freeway, and the northbound freeway exit actually feeds directly into the hotel's parking lot (after crossing a controlled intersection, of course). This means that the access to the northbound 101 to The City (San Francisco) is right out of the parking lot, once crossing the intersection. However, access to the southbound 101 and returning from areas north of the hotel off the southbound 101 is more complicated.  This is a good hotel for visiting the San Francisco Bay area without having to be in San Francisco, which means FREE PARKING! Hotel parking in The City is outrageous, so if you find a good rate on a hotel in The City, but you have to drive count on your daily hotel rate to increase from $11.00 to over $40.00 per day, if your in-city hotel even has parking. Some airport hotels charge for parking, but many do not. Always check if there is daily parking charge, or your visit could become more expensive than you realized. Luckily, this Holiday Inn had free parking, which is definitely a plus.  This is not a resort, it is a business-airport hotel. It was clean, comfortable and quiet, in spite of its proximity to the airport. It has a very attractive lobby area and a nice restaurant-bar on the premises, Houlihan's that, though it had spotty and usually indifferent service, was a nice place to relax after a long day. Even better, there is an IHOP just a hop, skip and a jump down the road from the hotel for real, good American breakfasts and lunches. When I travel, I want my hotel to be clean, comfortable, quiet, safe and moderately roomy with a good location. Okay, the view out the window was industrial park, but I was not going to be at the hotel all day. It was just a place to get cleaned up, change clothes and sleep. They were doing some renovations, but it never interfered with my stay. The Holiday Inn SFO North met all my criteria. It is a solid, 3-star hotel. I would stay there again and will recommend it to others.
