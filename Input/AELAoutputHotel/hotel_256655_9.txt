{"text":"Do not stay at this hotel Two days before we were scheduled to arrive I called to confirm my reservations and was assured that I was confirmed with a room for three nights. Imagine our surprise when after a 12 hour flight and 35 minute cab ride we arrived at the hotel only to be told that we had no reservation.After about 20 minutes they said they could give us a room and by that time we were so tired we accepted. In hind sight I wish we had walked a few blocks to any of the other hotels in town but we were so tired we weren't thinking straight. I think we would have done better sleeping on the cobblestone sidewalk the bed was so uncomfortable. The sheets felt like rough sandpaper and the bed bowed into the center like a hammock with springs digging into our backs. The pillows were lumpy and smelled of mold. In fact the whole room smelled of mold and stale cigarettes. There was visible mildew on the walls around the windows.There was about a 2 inch difference between the bedroom and the bathroom floors which is very unsafe. I stubbed my toe more than once going in and out of the bathroom.We decided to check out the next day but were told there was a 2 day minimum stay. So we ended up having to pay for a night we never used. Even though we hated to waste the money there was absolutely no way we were going to stay in that room another night.My recommendation is to stay at the Intercontinental or the Shangri-La. For just a few more $ you are going to have an immensely more comfortable experience.I will say without a doubt that the Rendezvous Hotel in Sydney is by far the worse hotel I have ever stayed in.You√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been warned!!!
