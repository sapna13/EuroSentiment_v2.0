{"text":"Loved it! Fabulous Anniversary!!!! Everything was perfect from the time I made my reservations until the day we left. We made reservations to celebrate our anniversary and do a quick in-town getaway. The Omni is located in the financial district, but is close to many great neighborhoods. We were able to walk to the Embarcadero, North Beach, and Chinatown. It is also really close to public transportation, including BART and the Cable Car (for real tourists).Originally I was going to just spend one night in a suite, but the reservationist suggested that since we were coming for our anniversary, we consider their Hearts in San Francisco package. We decided to do this instead for 2 nights. It included a deluxe room with King bed, champagne and chocolates in the evening, and breakfast either at the restaurant on site or served in your room.I called ahead to see if they had any suggestions for a special anniversary dinner and they made us reservations at Aqua. We checked in online and simply had to pick up our keys and go straight to our room upon arrival. When we got to the room, housekeeping had put a heart of rose petals on our bed. Within 20 minutes our champagne and chocolates arrived. There was also a reminder letter with our key to give us directions to the restaurant which is only 2 blocks away. I also called for suggestions of somewhere to go after dinner and was given the perfect spot at the Bubble Lounge.The next day was just as wonderful and with the same treatment of the room the next night was completely romantic. Everyone at this hotel is friendly and helpful. It all started with Joey Nubla (concierge), to Darrell at the front door, to our bellmen Adam and Joey, our fabulous housekeeper Maria, the room service staff and John and Justin at the front desk. Thank you all for giving us the perfect getaway for our anniversary!
