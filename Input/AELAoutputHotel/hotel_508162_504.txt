{"text":"Perfect DREAMS vacation! We had a great vacation at Dreams last week! A truly fantastic hotel. The only down side is that it takes 1 hour to get to it, but trust me, it's all worth it. Who cares if it takes an hour, you're going to be in paradise when you get there!There are 6 restaurants, each with great staff offering great food. We loved Himitsu the best. Make sure you visit the grill on the beach, we went there everyday for fresh hamburgers, if you're lucky he'll have chicken and pork chops too. There's also the fruit lady on the side of the pool, she cuts fresh fruit daily for you!The entertainment staff was amazing. They are funny and really know how to work the crowd. They work very long hours and are very committed. Go 50 cent! Make sure you participate in the activities each day, a great way to meet people and it's so much fun, and you get money for it! The shows at night were great, packed with lots of dancing.The casino is a bit small, but I don't think the hotel needs a bigger one. I never had a hard time finding a seat, but the dealers are very grumpy and some are brand new, so make sure to watch your cards and make sure you're paid out correctly. All the staff at the resort had smiles on their faces, except for the casino dealers!The beach was fantastic, stick to the left side, there are less rocks and it's also a bit quieter. All the beach activities happen on the right side. We had no problems finding chairs on the beach, and we usually got out there around 11am. The chairs around the pool seemed to get filled fast every morning, but when we headed over there around 3pm, we'd find some empty ones.Each buildling has it's pros and cons at the hotel. You may be farther away from the main lobby and show stage, but you'll be closer to the beach. We were in buildling #2, and loved it. It was so convenient to be so close to the room when you're on the beach.The rooms are always clean, fresh towels, fresh fruit, and stocked mini-bar. You must try the spa, it was worth every penny. The jacuzzi was great, we did the honeymoon package and it was very relaxing.There were no mosquitos at all on the resort, I might've seen only one or two. The grounds are kept beautifully.Our flight was delayed for 9 hours coming back home, but we already checked out and Sunwing put us up at the Bavaro Princess for one night and that hotel was disgusting. I don't know why expedia rates it higher than Dreams. BOOK DREAMS!!!A vacation will only be as good as you make it. This is a fantastic resort, easy to get around, and a guaranteed great time. I'd go back in a heartbeat.- Lucy Liu and Jacky Chan ","annotations":[{"endOffset":448,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":438},{"endOffset":448,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":438}]}
