{"text":"Great Stay! Have just returned from a week's stay at Hotel Cram, Barcelona. We got a fantastic rate through www.tablethotels.com, which may have influenced our positive attitude towards the hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. They provided good advice on everything we asked and couldn't have been more helpful. The decor was modern, well designed (I am a designer myself) and spotlessly clean - if a little frayed here and there. The rooftop pool is small, but as large or larger than any other rooftop pools in Barcelona that I encountered. It has 8 sun beds and plenty of tables and chairs. Also an outdoor shower. It is a fantastic facility and we appreciated being able to cool down and relax after a morning's sightseeing.The rooms are certainly as large as any standard rooms in a 4 star in Ireland. There was plenty of storage and the free movies, games, information and internet access (via the TV and wireless keyboard) was a bonus for siesta time and for browsing information on Barcelona. The location was perfect - within walking distance of many attractions (including Casa Bastillo, MCCB, etc), very close to the Universitat Metro and lots of bars and restaurants. We tried 'Flaut' (mentioned below) and loved it for the great tapas and food. Also recommend 'Origins', which is nearby for fantastic tapas and Spanish produced ingredients. 'Teller Tapas' is another fantastic restaurant in the locality. For good food further afield, try 'Shoko', Paseo Maritimo de la Barcelonetta - fantastic Asian cuisine in a great restaurant in the trendy beach area. Have a fantastic outdoor lounge area for after dinner drinks overlooking the ocean. Another favourite was 'Cuines Santa Caterina', Av. Francesc Cambo in El Born - bustling, great food and fantastic atmosphere and choice.Make the effort to visit Sitges - a small coastal town about 30 minutes by train from central Barcelona. Bustling, great beaches, places to eat and people watch. Well worth the effort and a nice break from city life. Is a very gay friendly area.If you're visiting Sagrada Familia or Museo de Picasso get there early as the queues are extraordinary and difficult in the heat.I would highly recommend this hotel - it provided everything we needed and the rooms were much larger than we were expecting due to earlier reviews. I'm not sure if I would have been giving such a glowing report had we paid the full rack rate - but if you look around, you'll always get a better price.
