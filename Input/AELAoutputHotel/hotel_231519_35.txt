{"text":"A great stay for this family of 3 I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ Slovenian Erasmus student and I came to Barcelona six months ago. My parents came to visit me from Slovenia and I booked them a room at the Hotel Inglaterra. I booked a triple room in order to be with them those days. I chose this hotel because it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ close to my university and the place where I live. My parents wanted to be in the centre and because they were in Barcelona many years ago and they love this area.We found Hotel Inglaterra a very nice place to stay. The rate we got included breakfast and we found breakfast buffet to be very nice. Lots of selections. Our room was clean, comfortable and the staff was very pleasant. I speak a good portion of Spanish and a bit of Catalan so I can communicate with the staff. Anyway the staff was multilingual. My parents could communicate in Italian and German with the receptionists. Daniel was fluent in German and Maribel (spoke Italian and French). There was also a French receptionist (whose name I cannot remember) and who spoke Italian as well. In any case all of them were fluent in English.The hotel is right near the Plaza Catalu√Ç??a and there are two metro stations nearby. The Hotel is within walking distance of restaurants, museums and la Rambla. This hotel was fantastic from start to finish and my parents want to stay here again when they visit me in December. This is an amazing hotel located in an amazing city! I love Barcelona!Muchas gracias Hotel Inglaterra!
