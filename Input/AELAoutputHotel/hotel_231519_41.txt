{"text":"Good location, clean modern room I found the hotel conveniently located to allow us to walk most everywhere we went. It is also very close to metro line and the tourist bus departure location. Very clean and modern hotel. Our roomwas small and overlooked the street. The insulated windows kept any noise from the street out. The bathroom was almost as big as the room. Mini fridge in room, nice flat screen TV, and very comfortable bed with nice linens. We were on the Discovery Package so breakfast was included. The breakfast room was very nice but the meal was disappointing. Big selection (so if you like all you can chow buffets you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l love it) but either the bread or pastries were not top quality or they weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ fresh. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know what the additional charge for the breakfast would have been but I would not have eaten breakfast here every morning if I had to pay extra. The top floor patio was a disappointment. There really isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a view of the city since you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e not up very high (6th floor) and no outside beverages or food are allowed so a romantic class of wine is out unless you order it from the hotel. We couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even bring our Starbucks coffee up there. The front desk was helpful and spoke English. The only difficult thing about the hotel was the constant street person that was always present lying on the sidewalk down a door or two outside the hotel. Disabled beggars are the most distressing things about Barcelona. Their seemed to be quite a lot of them. Overall a great place to stay that gives you that √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¨uropean√à√\u2020\u2022?experience.
