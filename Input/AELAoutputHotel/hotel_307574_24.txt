{"text":"Best Place Ever This is the best place I ever stayed in!!!!We had a plunge pool villa: a very tranquil and luxurious villa in every sense of the word. It has a living-room, a four-posted-bed, a dressing and a gorgeous spacious bathroom. Outside was our own private pool, app. 2,5m by 6m and a very private garden with views over the tropical forest that surrounds the hotel.In one of the gorges of the river, that flows nearby, a very tranquil health-spa is located. It also has a beautiful pool with private sitting areas. The massage and spa-treatments were superb!Near the main building of the hotel there is a panoramic pool, again with vieuws over the tropical forest and again with very private sitting areas.The food was exquisite! For breakfast, there is the traditional Indonesian breakfast, but also American breakfast and also a Japanese breakfast buffet. There is a panoramic bar with great cocktails and pre-dinner drinks.The diners we had there were also great, but we often went to Ubud for diner. One evening there was a traditional dance being performed in the hotel, which was great! About 40 or 50 dancers and musicians entertained us - all very professional and serene, though: very classy.The reception and the staff is very professional and discreet. They will do their utmost best to be as invisible as possible, yet alway delevering their best service!We felt being treated like royalty!If you're looking for peace and quiet, excellent service and beautifull surroundings, I would definately recommend this hotel!It comes very close to being paradise!!
