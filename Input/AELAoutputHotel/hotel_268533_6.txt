{"text":"Great location, fantastic staff I stayed at the Argonaut for two nights beginning December 16.I arrived very late (after midnight), so I didn't notice the valet parking when I pulled up. Luckily there was a spot around the corner. The valet met me at the door, let me in, and was very pleasant. The desk clerk was equally friendly and I was on my way to my room (482) in a minute or two.Upon entry, I was surprised at how small the room was. It was also pretty cold. Otherwise, it was nicely decorated and cozy. The iPod-dockable clock radio was on and softly playing some classical music.Because I am an inTouch member, a gift of a bottle of water and a bar of chocolate were waiting for me on the nightstand. Another pair of chocolates lay on the pillow. I thought that was a nice touch. I turned on the heat and the room was at a comfortable temperature by the time I had finished unpacking. The bed was extremely comfortable.The room was very clean. The shower was hot and the water pressure strong. The bathroom amenities were L'Occitane.The only lapse in the otherwise excellent service was at breakfast the following morning. I had been given vouchers for a continental breakfast at check-in. I was hungry for a bit more than that and ordered eggs and sausage. The waiter brought eggs and bacon instead. When I pointed out the mistake, he returned with sausage, then disappeared. I had to flag down the hostess in order to get my check. The food was excellent.With that sole exception, the service was every bit as good as I've come to expect from the Kimpton brand.Thanks to a busy work schedule, I did not get to spend much time in the area around the hotel. From what I saw while driving, the neighborhood is very picturesque. This would be a great home-base for exploring the Fisherman's Wharf area.A note for the budget-conscious: the parking rates are outrageous - $39\/day plus tax (and tip) for valet parking. In their defense, it's my understanding that parking in San Francisco is uniformly insane.I would definitely stay here again.
