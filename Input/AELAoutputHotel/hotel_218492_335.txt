{"text":"Great Time at the Grand Met our group from last year ( Ocean Bavaro ) Mike  Janice, Brent  Boomer and us Sandy  Cam at the Punta Cana Grand. Our group expanded to include Tim, Ross  Gail, Ken  Mary, Jeff  Melinda, Frank  Penny, Rick  Val and George. The hotel is rated 4.5 stars and I'm sure that everyone agrees. We were in building three, third floor with a cathedral ceiling which was really nice and handy for everything including the beach, pool, bars and restaurants. All the restaurants combined provided a huge selection of food. Also you were never far from your next drink! Thursday nights all guest were served supper on the beach. You can only imagine the looks from the Manager and all vacationers when our group put on the fake nose, glasses and moustaches along with the hillbilly teeth. The beach party provided the perfect setting to celebrate Boomers birthday which included a pair of serengaudi sunglasses. The Karaoke Bar provided Sandy with her chance of stardom on Dominican Idol. The pool bar also provided Mike with his first job in the Dominican, beertender! Our excursions included four wheeling, speedboat\/catamaran ride to Saona Island, and snorkling. I personally did the flying zodiac boat ride down the coast for twenty minutes getting an aerial view of many resorts. The staff was very friendly and provided an nightly show which included a great Micheal Jackson show. The Casino even co-operated with me and paid out one night. The only negative was the flight times by Sunwing, leaving at 2am and landing at 6:45am made for a very tiring drive home from the airport. Hope to see our group next winter at the next destination being????? We'll review it next year and let everyone know the good  bad. ","annotations":[]}
