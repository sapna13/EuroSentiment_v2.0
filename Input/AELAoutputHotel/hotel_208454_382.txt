{"text":"Absolutely Perfect Just returned from a week long stay at the Sofitel visiting our son.The weather was absolutely freezing but the hotel was wonderful and exactly as described in previous reviews. Having walked every inch ofManhattan, including the Brooklyn Bridge (a must at dusk to see the lights come on in Manhattan), it was a joy to get back and relax in our gorgeous bed! We signed up for a privilege card and were upgradedto a room on the 21st floor with an amazing view of the Chrysler Building and were given vouchers for two free drinks in the bar and late checkout. Can highly recommend doing this. We took breakfast either in our room or in the Gaby Restaurant and the little extras and attention to detail made it well worth the money. Our son works in SoHo and took us to many trendy cafes and restaurants inGreenwich, SoHo, Alphabet City and East Side, which we would have missed on our own. They may look scruffy on the outside but are packed with locals and ooze atmosphere, especially for the younger visitor. I can't remember all the names but we lunched at Chat 'n Chew at 10 East 16th St and had dinner one night at Esperanto Restaurant in Alphabet City, as well as quaint French and Italian restaurants. Be sure to also visit Cafe Lalo at 201 W 83rd St on the Corner of Amsterdam Avenue where 'You Got Mail' was filmed. Our first day we took a 'New York Party Shuttle Bus' tour which I can heartily recommend. The small bus with guide takes you all around Manhattan including the Statten Island Ferry and Ground Zero and the guide gives a personal insight into the whole of Manhattan. Check out their website. On returning to the airport the doormen arranged for us to travel in the black limousine shared with a neighbouring hotel, costing 65 dollars including tolls, and worth the extra for the comfort. From the hotel we could walk to Grand Central, Empire State Building, Rockerfeller Centre (the views from the top are as good if not better than the Empire State, and the queues are a lot less - again dusk is a popular time to see the city in daylight and as the lights come on), Chrysler Building, Times Square, Maceys, etc,making it the perfect location. I'm glad we didn't stay in Times Square as this gets very busy and noisy but a cut price show can be booked at the TKTS booth now by Drowsy Chaperone (didn't see this show but it was recommended to us). New Yorkers are very friendly and helpful and the city felt very safe. Apart from the weather we had an absolutely wonderful stay in New York.
