{"text":"Best hotel I've ever stayed in The Oriental Singapore was definitely the best hotel I've ever stayed in. I'm sure there are more luxurious ones somewhere in the world, but I've never stayed in them -- and I've stayed in quite a few five star hotels.Firstly, the interior of the hotel is just stunning. The entire centre of it is hollow, so you can look from the ground floor up to the very top. It's quite an amazing sight. Secondly, the buffet meals at the restaurant were just breathtaking. The spread goes on for rooms, with what must be easily over 100 dishes available at any one time. Every cuisine is catered for at all times of the day. The breakfast was particularly excellent -- the quality of every dish was a cut above what you typically get in a five star hotel.The staff were impeccably attentive and polite. From the moment we were picked up at the airport by limo and then greeted at the hotel with extremely fast checkin (everything done in advance for us) to the many, many staff available all around the hotel to help you.The hotel gym and spa was very nice, with attentive gym instructors and free bottled water, towels and headphones. The selection of restaurants in the hotel was amazing -- apart from the main buffet restaurant, there were many other bars and restaurants, and even one standing alone from the hotel near the spa. All in all, the Oriental experience made my business trip vastly more enjoyable and I have been hankering to go back for a holiday ever since!!!! ","annotations":[]}
