{"text":"lots of positives and a few niggles I have just spent 3 nights at the Soho hotel with my 2 teenage sons. If I could I would rate the experience as 41\/2 stars. Mostly it was lovely but there were a few flaws. Firstly the positives- We stayed in a deluxe suite which was large, very tasteful, pristine and with a super bathroom. The lighting was a bit subdued for my taste.The staff were all very pleasant, helpful and unpretentious. The service was excellent without being cloying. The hotel managed to be very luxurious and stylish without being overly formal. My issues were mainly to do with expense which I suppose is irrelevant to the super wealthy but an issue for people like myself who can afford the Soho as a once a year treat rather than a regular stay. When we arrived we were asked whether we would like a cup of tea sent to the room. Naively I thought this was complementary but in fact a pot of tea for 2 was √ä√£¬¢7.50! We were also offered tea in the morning but by this stage I knew to refuse. Breakfast was also confusing. The only way to have a cooked breakfast and to help ourselves to the buffet ( very important to my sons) was to order the √ä√£¬¢24-50 refuel breakfast which included fruit juice etc. However we were offered smoothies and I was amazed to be charged an extra √ä√£¬¢13.50 for these meaning are day 1 breakfast bill was √ä√£¬¢87-50! I must add that the food was lovely but still too expensive by most standards. Another niggle was internet access which my younger son was keen to have. This was √ä√£¬¢20 for 24 hours or 30 pence per minute - it should have been free in my opinion. So there we are - 41\/2 stars.
