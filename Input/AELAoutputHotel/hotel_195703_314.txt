{"text":"A Rare Work of Art Hotel Casci was by far the best hotel we stayed at during our month in Italy. Hotel Casci is to the hotel industry what the David is to the world of art: a resplendent example of seemingly effortless perfection, both in the overall impression that first strikes you, and in the subsequent explorations of its subtle mysteries, its reservoirs of carefully rendered beauty. Our room was spacious and one of the cleanest spaces we have ever seen. The cleaning crew actually scrubbed the floor space UNDER the bed every single day! We would have happily eaten breakfast on the bathroom floor. Lovely bathroom with a large jacuzzi-style bathtub, and abundant hot water. Firm, new beds. We slept like babies. Great, free internet access in the lobby. A well stocked bar and cooler in the front room of the hotel. Yummy breakfast. Superb laundry service was returned same day, carefully wrapped in paper. They were happy to hang dry our delicates.  What truly seperates Hotel Casci from other hotels however, is the personally tailored service you'll recieve from the lovely family that runs the establishment. The are fully ready, and indeed, eager to help you track down any information you may require: restaurants, bus routes, museum reservations. Not only will they locate the information you need, but they will actually go the extra step of making your restaurant or train reservation for you, or charting your day's journey on a city map. Their knowledge of the city and of its resources is abundant and happily provided. There was no request we made that they were not able to accomodate. They remember your preferences, and incorporate them immediately into your service. Their attention to detail is what you might expect to find at a five-star hotel.  The sense that you feel when you stay at this hotel is that you are in the care of family, for not only is the staff professional to the nth degree, but their sincere interest and dedication to your well-being and pleasant stay is always evident. An anecdote may serve to illustrate the point. While in Florence, we had bought two huge umbrellas. When we were leaving for Liguria, we found that we could not fit the umbrellas in any of our luggage. One of the owners immediately suggested that we leave the umbrellas with them until our return at the end of the month. Two weeks later, upon arriving back at Hotel Casci, we were presented with our umbrellas, bound together with a rubber band, and labeled with a post-it bearing our family name and the date of our return. Three days later, as we were leaving Florence to return to the states, I presented the umbrellas to the mother of the family, saying: Please donate these to the next hotel guest who finds himself in need of an umbrella. Her response: No, signore. We will place these in our storage, so that they will be here for you on your next visit.  Now, back in the U.S., we miss the Hotel and its delightful and amazing staff (ladies, prepare yourselves to lay eyes on Pierre-Paolo, the youngest of the clan, and possibly the most handsome and statuesque Italian man in the city of Florence; how he is not a Gucci model escapes us). But it is a comfort to know that somewhere, in an immaculate storage space in Hotel Casci, there sits a pair of large umbrellas, bound together with a rubber band, with a note bearing our family name, and, we imagine, the words: Return date: ?  Thank you for everything, Hotel Casci. We will certainly be back.
