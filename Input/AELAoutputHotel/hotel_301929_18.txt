{"text":"The ultimate honeymoon We wanted to go someplace that we likely would not go again (it took us 32 hours to get there)- so Bali seemed reasonable (we stayed for 2 weeks and including our airfare it was less than if we'd gone to Mexico or the Carribean)The Nikko Bali was the most opulent place I have ever stayed- the floors were dark polished hardwood with the most comfortable king sized bed I had ever, and have since slept on. The bathroom was HUGE!! a corner glass shower, a hue soaker tub, sink, toilet- beautiful tile.The beach was fantastic, the pools were out of this world. Our package included a daily breakfast buffet- which varied only slightly from one day to the next- but the food was consistenly good. The first night we were so tired after our epic journey, we figured we'd eat at the hotel- the theme of the night was Italian- which was served buffet style- it was OK- but that's all I can say about it- we just about croaked though when they brought the bill that was slightly over $100!! for a buffet!!!- We panicked a little, thinking we were going to have to eat one meal a day (our free breakfast)- because there's no way we'd budgeted for $100 dinners each night for 2 weeks.The next morning, after breakfast we headed down to the beach- and after awhile noticed a little grass shack- at the end of the beach- just off the Nikko property (it might not still be there,...)- anyway, we got two huge servings of Nasi goreng and several litre sized bottles of Bintang beer for less than $10- ah ha!! We weren't going to starve!!The same day, we discovered for a very small cab fair ($2-3) we could take a cab down the hill into Nusa Dua for dinner- there were several restaurants to choose from- all were good- some were very much better than others, however. Kuta was also about a $7 cab ride which took about 30mins.Anyway, WE LOVED THE HOTEL- it was superb in every way- and we are so glad we made the journey to the other side of the world so we could experience it.
