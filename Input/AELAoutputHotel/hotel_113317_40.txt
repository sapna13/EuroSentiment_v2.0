{"text":"Very enjoyable stay! I stayed at the Casablanca for 4 nights in mid-October. I had a room on the third floor, and found the room to be extremely quiet. In fact, I slept better at the Casablanca than I did at the other hotels I stayed at in the USA, even though the others were in quiet rural locations. The room was at the back of the hotel not facing the street, and although this makes it a little dark it was probably the best choice.The room was a little on the small side, and lacked a bit of draw space for longer stays. However, the wardrobe is big enough, and a table and chair are also provided. After a bit of too-ing and fro-ing we managed to get settled. The owners have resisted the urge to cram lots of furniture in ( a good thing in my view).The bathroom was nicely finished and was functional, with a full length mirror (yay!), making good use of space.The standard of d√ã√\u2022√ñcor was acceptable to good.One thing I would say is that the room was extremely clean when we entered it (and I do look at these things), and was correctly and properly cleaned and tidied each day.Rick√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ caf√ã√\u2022√ñ is a nice place to get a cup of tea or coffee. It was about the only place in my trip to the USA where I managed to get a really good cup of tea, and my wife liked the choices of different types of coffee. Breakfast was OK, with lots of tea for me and a selection of pastries. This room was large enough for the number of guests using it, and kept neat and tidy at all times.All in all, the Casablanca has quite ordinary guest rooms and public spaces. What makes the place stand out are the staff, and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l give you some examples.- The cleaning staff who clean and tidy rooms to a high standard.- The staff who work in Rick√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ on the second floor. There was always a member of staff in attendance, making sure the room is clean and tidy, and re-stocking cookies, tea, coffee, and anything else that might run out.- The staff who work in reception. Check in and out was quick and efficient, and they usually opened doors for us as we came and went.- All of the staff are bright and cheerful towards guests.- The manager took the time to introduce himself to us. The location is pretty good. Personally I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like Times Square, but there are so many other places in NYC that I do like that are within a short walk it makes up for it. There is also a good number of subway lines to choose from close by.On the whole a good choice.My only minor negative comment is on the subject of value. My 4 night stay cost 2000 dollars (including taxes) which to me seems a little on the high side, but may be quite normal for NYC.
