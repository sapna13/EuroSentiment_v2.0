{"text":"OK Hotel-too far from the action I've read many of the previous reviews. I'm not sure what the expectation is but if your expectation is to be in a business hotel 40-60 minutes outside of the city this fits the bill. The rooms are in line with a business class European hotel; small by American standards but with the expected amenities. The free wi fi is a definate plus not expected in Europe. The strongest point in favor of this hotel is the breakfast. Our room included the breakfast and was paid for by the company. Normally, I believe breakfast is quite pricey so if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e thinking staying here, and of course you care about breakfast, try to negotiate breakfast into the room price. Hotel breakfast includes unlimited espressos and cappuccinos, croissants, fruit, pancakes, smoked salmon, local meat and cheese, eggs, bacon, juice, etc. A very nice spread and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe eaten at a lot of hotel buffets. There is nothing close by for eating establishments so plan to eat dinner in Amsterdam. No comment on the hotel for dinner as I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat there. The hotel has a small fitness center, tread mill, bike some minor amounts of weights. Not much. Everything from this hotel is a drive or a tram ride. I read amount service comments. There are some bad apples here, basically some youthful slackers but I felt they were contained and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ impact me. On check in my wife commented that the clerk was a bit curt. However they let us check in at 8 in the morning and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ charge us a second day which was also unexpected. This is big deal as we were both exhausted from the flight. We hit the bed at 8 AM ish and slept until 4 PM without any disturbance. If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e coming from the US, check this out. The WSJ did a piece a few years ago about London hotels that wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ let people check in until 3PM. So I think a very nice feature. The worst thing about this hotel is its location. A five to ten minute walk gets you to the tram station. From there you wait. There is a schedule but essentially a tram comes every 10 minutes or so. Thus, the wait isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ that bad. The tram ride is 30 minutes to a major tourist area. It runs right through central Amsterdam so you can get to most everything with a straight shot of a tram ride. The museum district, the dam, and the main train station are on the route. The hotel staff are not very helpful in terms of traditional concierge service. Essentially you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l get a very marginal amount of assistance compared to a concierge at a Four Seasons or Ritz. They try marginally to help and are polite but not very knowledgeable. So all considered, I would rate this as a three star hotel. The service is not great but not horrible. The rooms are reasonably clean. Proper amenities are applied for the style of hotel expected. The restaurant appears to be well stocked and in line with a higher caliper facility. Workout facilities are basic and there is no outside gym option. Attractions are too far away and add a hassle that, if you pay $300 plus a night, you shouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to deal with. In my mind, this is a hotel for people stuck on a layover from the airport who are going to stay one night and clear out. From that perspective, it is aces. The other group here would be tour groups on group rates. Tours can tout the 5 star hotel BS and one could argue it loosely fits the tour guide description. From a critical view, this is puely a thee star location. From any other view point, I have to think anyone who recommends this hotel just hasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ traveled enough or experienced enough of the other options available given the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ price point. There are far better options inside the city with easy access to the sights you came to see at better price points, so why bother with this place?
