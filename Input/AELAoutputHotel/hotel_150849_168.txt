{"text":"Fantastic Holiday Fantastic resort - could not fault the hotel at all. The room:The room was always clean and the cleaners cleaned the rooms daily and left fresh towels on the bed positioned like swans etc. The fridge was refilled every other day, but by request the will restock the fridge with specified drinks. Optics in the room, maintained. The Hotel public areas: Standard of cleanliness through out the hotel was good except American refused to use the hand cleaning product the hotel provided as you enter the restaurants.Food: The Buffet restaurant offered a wide selection of foods catering for the different nationalities, plenty of salads etc, so americans not happy that there is no burgers and chips every day - I think most other guests liked the wide selection and non Stodge food that I have found in USA.Drink: Wide selection of hot, cold and alcoholic drinks, but brand names are not readily available, but what do you expect when it is all included in the price? Variety of cocktails available - with a daily special.Beach:The beach is private so no hassle from people selling you things, there are a couple of drinks huts on the beach. The sports beach which is at the far end of the resort has motorised and non motorised sports, (only non motorised are included in the all inclusive offer) Entertainment:There is as much as you want to join in with - personally I am not in to that sort of thing, but there seemed to be plenty on offer ","annotations":[{"endOffset":650,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":644},{"endOffset":650,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":644},{"endOffset":650,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":644},{"endOffset":650,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":644},{"endOffset":650,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":644},{"endOffset":650,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":644}]}
