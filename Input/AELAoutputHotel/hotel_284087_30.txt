{"text":"Disappointed After having read the reviews about this hotel, I had higher expectations and I must say after my stay at this hotel this weekend I was disappointed. I am VERY unclear about where the good reviews are coming from! I would say that I am a very reasonable person, widely travelled, having stayed at a range of accomodations from hostels to 5* hotels. Sure, the hotel was centrally located, and directions to the hotel clear, but I agree with another reviewer that this hotel was more of a hostel than a hotel. The bathroom had a pungent, old, dank smell to it and it was a wet bathroom - ie - you had to shower right over the toilet without a tub. The bed was quite hard as well. As for decor, because it was raining outside, they had spread out a white bath sized towels on the floor which was damp and walked on and which we had to walk on to get to the stairs...not exactly inspiring. I walked by hotels closer to the center with much nicer lobbies that looked warm, newer and more comfortable for comparable prices (I asked). Because the doors to the rooms were so flimsy, in the morning we could hear their bird (they have pet parrot) shreaking and squacking and we could also clearly hear the lobby telephone ringing throughout the hotel at 2am in the morning. Although the man who owned the hotel in the end allowed me to pay for our two nights with a credit card, he grumbled about it, when I asked, he punched numbers into his calculator to say that because it was low season (√à√\u2020√ü?5 per night for 3 people), I should be paying cash. I won't be staying here again. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":764,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":759}]}
