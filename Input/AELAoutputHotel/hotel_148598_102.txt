{"text":"Beautiful Property, but bring your wallet Booked a package on CheapCarribean.com. What we noticed at this property was overall, a lower level of service. We had to request that the room be cleaned better for one thing. We looked into getting picked up by the hotel from the airport 60 bucks per person EACH way. We rented a car because we wanted to explore the area, I recommend this even though the hotel will charge you for self-park or valet. You are less than 3 miles from El Yunque rain forrest. The hotel charges 38 per person for them to drive you there, your cost if you drive over yourself? Zero, if you skip the Visitor Center (3 bucks if you don't). The resort is big but the food prices are really jacked up: 4 bucks for an ice cream, almost 3 bucks for a coffee. Breakfast Buffet is 25 per person. We were able to find Isamar Bakery at the bottom of the hill near the main road. Breakfast and pasteries were very reasonable. Also, the concierge station. While somewhat helpful, were clearly training some staff, never saw the same person twice. This is NOT an all-inclusive and the level of service is less than we expected, while the staff was courteous their level of service was average at best. The property and grounds are gorgeous but it is very pricey to eat 2-3 meals a day there, keep that in mind. If you have a rental car there are plenty of places to eat nearby.
