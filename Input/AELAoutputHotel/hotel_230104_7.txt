{"text":"Good for motorists; close to motorway Beware: This hotel is NOT in or near downtown Amsterdam !That being said, I have to state that I have stayed in this hotel a couple of times recently while being on business trips.LOCATION:This 3-storey hotel is conveniently located off the A9-motorway near Gaasperplas and has a big parking lot (though even this one can get quite full at times).About 1 km (0.6 mi) away is the terminus of a Light Rail line which will take you to City Center of Amsterdam.There are no other buildings in the vicinity of the hotel. To visit a restaurant you best have a car available (or get a taxi).ROOMS:... are quite large in size with a roomy bathroom.No real problems with cleanliness sofar. Beds are firm and comfortable.Numerous rooms face the street, but noise is not a problem here.A few rooms have a balcony overlooking a canal.The micro-fridge is always locked and I never cared about it.There is no Wireless-LAN in the rooms and also only the business rooms have a dataport - and this is of the local style only, rather than the usually found outlet for Western-plugs. Trying to find a adaptor for it can be difficult.RESTAURANT:Food in the evening is good (√ã?¬© la carte) with the set menu√à?√¨s offering the best deals. The restaurant is also frequented by non-hotel guests.Breakfast is a mix of continental and american style with a local touch.Beware: Upon my recent trips, almost every morning there was a tour group of chinese tourists in the hotel: Not every morning the hotel staff was paying attention, that these groups have a seperate area set aside for their breakfast - so it became rather full in the breakfast area.SERVICE:Apart from a single occasion where I got checked-in into a room that appeared to be occupied by a member of hotel staff, I haven`t run into any further problems.As I am a return customer, check-in is accomplished very fast - no more forms to be filled out for me.Upon my last check-out, staff surprised me when they were aware that I would return 3 weeks later ... (another 2 weeks in this hotel for business).COSTS:With a negotiated company rate, this hotel costs only a fraction of the hotels downtown plus parking is free !
