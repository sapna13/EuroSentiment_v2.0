{"text":"Wedded Bliss I was getting married at a local mansion, Castillo Serralles about 15 minutes away and felt this would be the best place to host my guests, and did not regret it.We started planning our wedding in March and had continious communication with Enid Montes in customer service. She is by far one of the most helpful persons there. She ensured that our guests got the best accomidations, and catered to their every need. She was also helpful in getting a limo two days before our wedding, and gave wonderful recommendations for local venues.The day of my wedding they allowed me to check into my room in the morning in order to relax and get ready for the chaotic day. My husband and I booked a spa day the day before and the girls at the spa are AMAZING. Gladys and Carla were so friendly and did a wonderful job. On the day of my wedding my stylist cancelled and Gladys was able to acommodate me the morning of the wedding.The room service was a bit slow, but I understood the hotel was hosting two conventions that weekend..so I was not disturbed.In terms of the appearance....I LOVED IT. The pool is open 24 hours a day, and each pool is clean and enough to host children and adults alike. True indeed once you leave the facilities it's not as picturesque as you'd like it to be but in all my travels I've encountered the same experience. I will say that my non Spanish speaking guests were able to get to hotel quickly because it is right off of Highway 2.My husband and I have decided that whenever we go to the enchanted island of Puerto Rico we will have to stay at least one night at the Ponce Hilton. We love it and would recommend the hotel to everyone. ","annotations":[]}
