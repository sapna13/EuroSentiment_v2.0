{"text":"Tokyo stole my heart...... This was the second time that we have stayed in this fabulous hotel and I have just booked another fortnight here in april 2007.The hotel is located in a fabulous part of Shinjuku close to shinjuku train station and close to the large shinjuku shopping area. The views from the large windows are breathtaking. And even though you are very close to the neon lit bustle of shinjuku the rooms are very quiet, the beds are extremely comfortable and you will get a great nights sleep.Rooms were fully equipped with everything you need including a fully stocked reasonably priced mini bar, Hairdryer, satellite TV, lovely toiletries, japanese tea \/ english tea and coffee...etc etc..Room service is excellent and prompt and there is an extensive Japanese \/ Continental \/ British menu that is available 24 hours a day.The rooms are very large and comfortable and very clean.They come complete with a japanese 'yukata' robe and free slippers.The hotel is a mini city in itself and has many restaurants, shops, and bars inside the huge skyscraper building. The view from the sky bar is fabulous!! Sip a cocktail whilst looking at the most fantastic view of Tokyo.The Keio Plaza also has a swimming pool and excellent gymnasium.My only criticism..... and it isn't really a criticism ( I am just desperate to find something that wasn't 100% !!)... the rooms are a little dated but the hotel have fully renovated one of it's towers with the new slick modern 'plaza premier' rooms and they plan to renovate the complete hotel within a couple of years.The first time we visited they supplied modems at reception if you wanted to use the internet in your room, however now all rooms are equipped with extremely fast free 100 mb internet.I took my laptop and was able to send photos and emails from my room every day which was really handy.I cannot praise the service highly enough...... but in my experience this is the same across the whole of Japan.The rooms were perfectly clean, the staff were extremely respectful, courteous and helpful and spoke many languages fluently.I plan on visiting this hotel every year from now on...... I fell in love with Tokyo and this hotel made both of my trips so far extra special.
