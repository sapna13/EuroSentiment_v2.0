{"text":"Not loving it WOULD NOT GO BACK.......luckily we had great friends with us.........THis hotel is soooo not a 4 star. More like a 2 starno one speaks english there........only spanish or french........1 of our 3 rooms had no air conditioning and no one would help us. Then the last night the same room leaked water on one of the beds. there are 2 free restaurants in this resort....but by the time you figure out where they are or how to book them you give up! The others are a charge of a min. $11 US pp. The kids club is terrible............we had 5 kids with us ranging from 5 to 13 and they lasted 15 min there before they returned to us! The entertainment staff didnt come out til x mas eve.......no schedules on entertainment etc. The room was ok............clean....showers had no pressure though. The beach was beautiful....however my kids personally are not beach kids........so we went to the pools (3 of them) every day...however they were freezing .....so I as the mother only went in 2x the whole week.there is really nothing to do at night......so we ended up sleeping at around 9ish....which is fine b\/c if you dont get up early you miss the sun!!!!!!if you tip the waiters in the buffet you get good service.......as we were 11 ppl so we got our table saved every morning..... I recommend the banana juice and the crossaisants...yumI would never go back.....................the language barrier is very frustrating......and the kids were bored!!!!!!!!!
