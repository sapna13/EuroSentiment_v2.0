{"text":"Great hotel Never having been to Florence, this was a great find. It is right in the middle of the area of Florence with all the attractions - no more than 5 minutes walking from the Uffuzi Museum and the same from the Duomo. There is an outdoor market with leather products, etc. a block away and restaurants everywhere, including a nice one on the same block.Each evening we took advantage of the free cocktail hour and in the morning the free breakfast. The front desk was extremely helpful with baggage storage, wake up call and taxi at 5 am. They are willing to help you with anything you want to do in Florence - they couldn't have been friendlier.At the time we stayed, the Hotel was willing to discount your bill 10% if you paid with cash, which we did.The only two minor challenges - it takes a little looking to find it. The street numbers don't run consecutively so you can't go by them. The Hotel sign is up above the first floor, so just keep looking up. We came in to the city a day before our stay and two of us strolled down the street looking for the hotel and we found it on the first pass. Don't worry about it if you are arriving by taxi - they know. Secondly, there is a flight of stairs (20 or so) to get up to the elevator which takes you up to the second floor reception desk. If you ring the bell at the door on the street level, someone will come down to help you with your bags. It was fine for us, but if you have an impairment it could be a problem.  Our bathroom was modern, with a shower. The room (204) had a double and a twin bed. The room came with a laptop and free access to the internet. The windows have been upgraded to help block street noise and they provide a white noise machine if you need it to help you sleep. We didn't need it. We heard some street noise, but not enough to keep us up. If you're sensitive, ask for a room off the street. Street noise can be a common problem in Florence hotels, so don't let this deter you.We would definitely return and have already referred the hotel to friends traveling later this year.
