{"text":"Great for pre-cruise stay Our family of four stayed at the Summerfield Suites on August 2, 2007 for our cruise the next day. We arrived at the Miami Airport 1 pm sharp. As instructed by the hotel employee previously, we called the hotel for the free shuttle to pick us up. We were told the shuttle should arrive around 1:15pm. Later, the employee called and said the shuttle was running 30 minutes behind. He told us to get a taxi to the hotel and the taxi fare will be taken care of by the hotel. I was skeptical, but since I had no way of knowing when the shuttle is actually going to arrive, we went ahead and got a taxi. When I arrived at the hotel, I put the taxi fare receipt on the counter,. Without my saying a word, the front desk clerk handed me $14 cash.We paid $61 through Hotwire for the room. It came to $73 with taxes. We had a one bedroom suite with full kitchen. Everything looked really nice, new, and clean. The king size bed was comfortable with new linens. The kids slept on the sectional sofa bed. Our room was facing the street and a corner of the airport (I could see the tails of the planes), but it was surprisingly quiet. If you are very sensitive about sounds, you may have to request rooms in the back of the hotel.They had freshly baked chocolate chip and peanut butter cookiesin the lobby aound check-in time. We also had free dinner (Thursdays until August 31) that night at the hotel. The next morning, we had free breakfast buffet (every morning). Free coffee, tea, and soda were available through out the day. We saved quite a bit of money on dining by staying at Hyatt Summerfield.The hotel was within walking distance to Publix. We purchased many essentials that we could not put in our carry-ons. In the evening, the kids had a blast in the pool, making new friends in the process. All in all, it was a great stay.
