{"text":"Paradise We stayed at this resort upon recommendation from business collagues that had visited and were glad that we did. The resort is massive and there is lots of places that you can walk to. Shopping in the Plaza is also on-site. There is also shopping on the beach that is about 25 mins walk.The resort is beautiful and always clean. With the huge size of this resort it did not seem to be busy when really it was. We booked Diamond Club and would recommend paying the extra for the private pool. It is also a wonderful resort if you are planning on taking children. We went on our own and are planning a return trip with our 4 year old daughter. We ate mostly at the a-la cartes and they were all wonderful. The sea bass at the Seafood restaurant was wonderful and I'm picky with fish. We only had one dinner at the main buffet and we were not dissappointed with any of our choices. The only complaint with food is that it is all so good that you eat too much so that you can try it all. Drinks were also plentiful. The staff at the resort are awesome. They all work so hard for very little pay and are always smiling. We adored Jose in the pool bar and also at the Lobby bar at night. He always makes you feel special and makes extra efforts to ensure that you are happy. Nelson also does amazing bottle shows in the lobby at night.Rooms are out of this world and are all marble. This resort also has the most comfortable beds from any of the resorts that we have stayed at.The beaches were the best. White sands and beautiful blue water for as far as you can see.We went on one tour - The Caribbean Festival. It was great. There is a show and then snorkling at the reef. The guide took us away from the others and gave us some food to feed the fish. They swam right to us and he also took our underwater camera and took a lot of amazing pictures for us and of us together snorkling. We would never have had those pictures without him. Sailing to the shark tank was a little scary as it is a pen in the middle of the ocean and you swim to it and climb in with the sharks and sting rays. A few people declined but I figured I was there and I would regret it later if I didn't so off I went. It was amazing. The cruise back was also memorable as the staff put on an amazing show and they encouraged every one to participate.I would totally recommend this resort and are planning to return again in a few months.
