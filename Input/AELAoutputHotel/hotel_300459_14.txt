{"text":"Absolutely loved this place, you should go! Well I don't normally title a review like that. It sounds like a review written by someone who has nothing to compare it to. But I usually do well over 100,000 miles travel a year (this year could be twice that), so I stay a lot of places (check out my other reviews), and this hotel really was just terrific.The service is impeccable from beginning to end. Just go visit the bar (which by the way is on the 3F) and watch in awe as your drink is placed precisely in front of you and served immaculately. Or go to the panorama bar (actual name is the Manhattan Room) on 36F and sip a Mojito whilst looking out over the city lights. That has to rank as one of the most romantic locations I've ever been. Pity I was on a business trip!The rooms are again precisely set out with Japanese attention to detail. Every conceivable amenity is there for you (iron, kettle, bar, snacks, very comprehensive bathroom bits and bobs). The style is sort of Frank Lloyd Wright with lots of darker wood. The bed compares closely to the Marriott Heavenly Bed. Actually a bit soft for my preference but luxurious.If you are leaving from here to go Narita the Limousine Bus goes from here. You can buy your ticket from the hotel and put it on your bill. I checked out and gave them my bags, then went off to a meeting for the morning. On returning in time for the 12.30 bus, without any further query on my part my bags were brought right to the point where the bus leaves, and were loaded for me. That was very cool.I only had one meal here, a lunch in the bar. It was terrific and presented with great style (great plating as they say). There are a great variety of on-site restaurants but I did not use them.I suppose there is not too much more to say. If you are looking for a refuge from a busy world and just want everything to be taken care of, I highly recommend that you stay here. ","annotations":[]}
