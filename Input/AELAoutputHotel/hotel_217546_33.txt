{"text":"Worst Customer Service Ever Having stayed at this hotel before and needing something quick I decided to stay again, now read on for my horrible experience. I am a kidney donor for someone in Boston, I live in PIttsburgh. I had to be in Boston for final tissue typing and some other tests. Due to a flight cancellation I had to ride Greyhound to Boston. When I purchased my ticket the Greyhound ticket agent kept my drivers license and credit card. I did not realize this until I was on my way to Boston. I arrived in Boston at 450am. I had my blood tests completed and was tired and needed a room before my afternoon tests. I called Holiday Inn and advised them of my missing ID and that I was a Priority Club Gold member and needed a day room at the Beacon Hill property. They advised that should not be a problem but to call the hotel to book the room. I called the hotel and was told to come over because they do not book day rates over the phone. I took a cab to the hotel and Anna the front desk clerk asked, Do you have a reservation? I advised her I was told to come directly to the hotel. She then booked my room and was aware I was a gold member of Priority Club. She then asked for a credit card. I advised her of my problem with Greyhound. She took cash for the room, gave me my room keys and as I was walking away she said, Oh, I need your ID. I advised her that I did not have the drivers license, but did have an employment photo ID along with my voters registration card. She then said I could not check in without a Massachusetts drivers license. I advised her I do not live in Massachusetts. She then said I could not check in and refunded my money. I was outraged. I am submitting this report because I did pay my money, was given a key and then refused to be allowed to check into my room. I have stayed at this same hotel twice before within the past month. Please take my advice and do not book this hotel.
