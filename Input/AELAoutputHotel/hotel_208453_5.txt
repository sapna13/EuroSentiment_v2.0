{"text":"Ideal locaton I travelled to New York with 3 friends and we booked a double double room at the Hilton, which was plenty big enough for all four of us.ROOMOur room had 2 double beds, plasma TV, desk, haidryer, comfy chair, mini bar and plenty of wardrobe space. The beds were just normal doubles, not kingsize, but they were the most comfy i have slept in. We got a free upgrade to a deluxe room, which was a lot bigger than i expected and it had views over New York and looked out at the Empire State Building. We were on the 41st floor, but it really didnt seem that high. The room was also very quiet, hardly hearing any outside noise or noise in the corridor. We also got a coffee machine and tea and coffee were provided.BATHROOMThe bathroom was actually a bit disappointing, it was very small, with a small bath and also had a shower over the bath. The shower was great, powerful and hot. We were supplied with Evelyn and Crabtree toiletries which were very nice. The towels were good quality and bath robes were also provided, but not much room to move!LOCATIONThis hotel is definatley in an ideal location, literally on the doorstep of Times Sqaure attractions and theatres. There are bar, restaurants and shops all just outside. Is also just 5 mintues walk to Macy's department store.FOODWe never ate at the hotel as the prices were very high, but we usually had breakfast at Applebys which is at the front door of the hotel. BEST BITSLocation!!!!!!!!! Size and comfort of room.WORST BITSwhen we arrived at our room we only had 2 towels, 2 cups and one bath robe for 4 of us. We complained and we were given extras very quickly. Another day we we only given 3 sets of towels...so again had to call reception. Also one day we came back to our room at 4pm and the cleaner had still not even been in to clean it!! Maid service was definately the worst part of this hotel...appear to be short staffed. Overall this was a hotel in a great location, had large comfy rooms and good facilities. Would recommend, mainly for location.
