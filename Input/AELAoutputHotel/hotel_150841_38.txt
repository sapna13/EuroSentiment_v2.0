{"text":"OMG this hotel was amazing.! this hotel was great and the staff was amazing.! Im 16 years old and my sister is 13, and we traveled with our parents. And this is a all inclusive (joke with the staff) is a great resort for everyone. room-Conveinent (spell?) to my mom we got connecting rooms which was easy to get inbetween ours and our parents rooms. I thought the beds were really comfertable and we got good night sleeps, and the maid service was amazing and everyday we came home to a clean room with flowers and chocolates. pool  beach-the beach was really pretty and the water was basically air temp. the only thing is for people who havent traveld or dont live in europe, may be offeneded by the topless beach goers. There was plenty of things to do on the beach like volleyball and snorkling, windsurfing, kyaking and much more. The pool was awsome and had activites to do as well as a pool side bar. the towels were convient because you could trade in yours anytime you wanted a fresh one. It was really clean as well and lunch is pool side.food-breakfast is a buffet but its like art and for dinner as well. the way they set it up is basically set for a picture.! the food at the buffet is good because they have so many things to choose from and an amazing dessert. the resturants are okay, they have cajun, mediterainian, and japanese and alot of other things. supprisingly the resutants arent that good, and becareful THEY DONT CLEAN THE SHRIMP, my sister and i are vegitarians and it actually was wast to find food, even without the shrimp. another great thing is that there is ALWAYS food.! if you miss a meal, there always is food by the pool.staff and entertainment-i CANNOT say enough good things about them.! they were the ones to make this vacation as great as it is.! There is always things to do during the day and the star friends always try to get people out of their comfort zone to participate, in a great way. Spagetti, pikachu, j.p, trebelin, and henry just to name a few were so funny always up for a laugh for example, dressing up in makeup and bikinis to take pictures with the guests on the beach.! the night shows were the BEST time of the day, both funny and dancing your mouth is either smiling, laughing, or just open with suprise.excursions and airport travel-the day excursions were fun but we only did the half day ones which pretty much took up a whole day. The only thing was the roads arent very developed so its a bumpy ride, same with the two and from airports. But it was all worth it.Overall it was a great trip.! we met people from all different places and all different ages.! i highly recommend this to anyone who wants an amazing vacation.!
