{"text":"Excellece is Excellente OK so my trip was supposed to be a romantic getaway with my boyfriend. Did not happen that way he decided not to go NOT MY BOYFRIEND ANYMORE. In any case I went on my vacation. The plane ride was the plane ride from h**l a family with 3 children on the flight let thier children cry and carry on for the entire 4hr flight. So now I'm thinking this trip is doomed. The bus ride to the hotel is a little long about an hour, however the driver from Pierto Tours was great, one of the other passenger was joking about how he could go for a beer the next thing we knew the driver pulled over to get beer. Once at the resort I forgot about the plane ride. We were greeted with champagne and cold wash cloths. I stayed in the Excellence Club. As soon as I gave my name to the host I was promptly greeted by my conceige, pointed to my bags and in my room within 10 minutes. In the Excellence Club you will find a fully stock bar (all top shelf), big screen TV, 3 computers w\/free internet also food all day. I must say the food at this resort is the best that I have had in Punta Cana. This was my 4th visit to Punta Cana. This resort is by far the best of the 3 that I have stayed in. I consider myself a very picky eater and I must say I have no complains about the food. I would advise anyone travel outside the U.S. to always pack some snack foods if you are like me you will crave some potato chips or candy. The room was large and had stocked bar with liquor. I do not like the Dominican rum that was left in my room so I asked if it could be replaced with Bacardi rum, I had the bottle within minutes. I will suggest that you bring you own iron the one in the room was not a steam iron and if you were not very very careful your cloths will be burnt. The beach and the ocean were great the water was warm but very rough and you are on the Pacific ocean. If you want to pick up a gift for someone go to Nancys she will bargain and give a great deal. Also if you want a massage ask Nancy it's only $45 for 70 minutes. Nancy is located on the beach if facing the ocean go to the left just outside the resort line. If you want to have fun I suggest you get involed in the daily activities offered by the resort and the entertainment crew. (Cesar,Santo,Mariel and Inez ) I must say the entertainment crew are wonderful people they work really hard and long hours but are always smiling and very cheerful and upbeat. I must say if it was not for the Entertainment crew (Cesar,Santo,Mariel and Inez) my trip would not have been as wonderful as it was. The nightly shows were great. The disco is a must while you are there go and learn a new dance from the Entertainment crew (Cesar,Santo,Mariel and Inez) If you want to plan an excursion go see Johnny @ Pierto Tours in the lobby. I did the zipline what a blast. I will say the staff at this resort go above and beyond their duties to make your stay enjoyable and accomodating. For example one day they had rice pudding (very good) out and I did not see it the next day and asked for it they brought some out to me right away. The head chef is walking around to make sure everyone is satisfied.TO MANAGEMENT AT THIS RESORT YOUR ENTERTAIMENT CREW (Cesar,Santo,Mariel and Inez) SHOULD RECIEVE A RAISE OR A BONUS.THIS IS A 5 STAR PLUS RESORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
