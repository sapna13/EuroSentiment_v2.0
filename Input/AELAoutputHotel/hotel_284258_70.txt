{"text":"Excellent Hotel - Would recommend to all Stayed here for 10 nights for our honeymoon in December 2006. When we arrived at the hotel we had been travelling for 42 hours from the UK (our flight had been delayed 11 hours in Dubai)So we were so jet lagged. We were greeted by a very friendly lady at the reception who booked us in very quickly!! We were on the 33rd floor (1 floor from the top)  the view was amazing. The bed was so comfortable  could have taken it home with me if i could have got it in my suitcase. The Concierge were so helpful  very friendly indeed. They knew so much about the city, the best tours  the best places to eat etc. The pool was small but not busy at all  went in the jucuzzi every day!! The hotel location is also excellent. Less than a five minute walk from the harbour bridge, opera house the rocks. Only 10-15 minutes walk from Darling Harbour. Hotel is on Jamison Street wjich is off George Street - which is the main shopping area  there are many take aways within a few minutes walking distance. The underground station is just 2 mins walk from the hotel also. We had a Jamison Club room which gave us access to Jamison Club Facilities (breakfast, evening canapies 5pm-7pm, internet access etc) at only which i would highly recommend. I can go on about how amazing this hotel is but you if you visit Sydney this is a MUST stay hotel.
