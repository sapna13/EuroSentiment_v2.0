{"text":"Paradise Three friends and I stayed at the Grand Palladium February 18th to the 25th. The week literally dragged by and I do not mean that in a negative way. We just relaxed the whole week sans watches. None of us had ever been south before and didn't know what to expect. We were completely blown away and amazed by our experience. All four of us stayed in the same room to cut to cost and there was plenty of room for all of us. Our room was in a wonderful location. We were as close as you can possibly get to the beach and we had a huge pool right beside us as well. The grounds and facilities were all immaculate. Everything is just so lush and beautiful. Everyone was so friendly as well. You should be sure to get up a little early and reserve some pool or beach chairs because they do go quite quickly but we never had a problem with this at all. Everyone respects each others reserved chairs. The a la carte restaurants were all great! We ate like queens the whole week!Another suggestion would be to hop on the train and see the whole resort so that you get a feel of your surroundings and everything the resort has to offer.The activities staff was excellent. They are all so friendly and we were surprised how many of them could speak English, French, Spanish and German. BUT most of the staff employed in the restaurarnts and the bars do not speak English so well. We knew this before we went but completely forgot to learn simple phrases so I would definitely suggest learning a bit of basic Spanish phrases before you go. The disco was sooo fun and that nightly shows were always interesting as well. Apparently there was a popular disco to go to at a resort a little ways down from ours but keep in mind you'd have to pay for the drinks there. We didn't go but we heard it was incredible. All in all is was the most relaxing vacation I have ever been on. The Grand Palladium will not disappoint. ","annotations":[]}
