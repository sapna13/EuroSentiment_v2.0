{"text":"Served it's purpose My wife and I stayed in a penthouse unit at the ESJ for four nights. Reviews of this property are accurate. The facilities are reasonable with some inconveniences.Our studio was clean and well equiped. The elevator to the 16th floor was quick. The elvevator was necessary often as the beach, lobby and pool are on seperate floors. It is nesessary to use a coded keycard to a access the pool area. Pool is OK. You get a towel with no hassle. No access to the beach and beers are $4.50 You must buy them from ESJ. The pool has no slide, floatation devices, umbrellas or filter. An out of water filter is mobile and used to clean the water. To get to the beach, back on the elevator and down to the garage. Pick up complementary chairs and towels. Lug them through the garage to a revolving privacy gate and enter the code. You must stick the chairs through the opening of the fence and gather them on the other side. Very old chairs but they work. No bathrooms or concessions available.The local area has some good restaurants . Mi Casini is a block West in a shopping center. It is excellent. To the East is Interpol. Also very good but no breakfast.Rented a car as there is not much to do locally. Reasonable rates. Advised by ESJ to look for our P-spot as they are not in order for security reasons. Four floors of searching random numbers. We never found it in two days. Ran the risk of using guest parking and won. We still can't make sense of this. Also, the conciere was helpful in calling the rental company but not much help in pointing out that they were looking for us outside while I roamed the lobby for 20 minutes.Internet access is their strong point. Available all day with no wait,We never venture to SJ before. Probably will avoid in the future. Expensive and inferior to remote islands in the Carribean. ","annotations":[]}
