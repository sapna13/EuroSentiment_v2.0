{"text":"Wonderful vacation We have just returned from this resort yesterday and had a one week stay (April 9-16\/08). I had concerns with some of the negative reviews and was worried that maybe we had made a mistake booking this resort but was pleasantly surprised. Our entire trip was a fantastic experience and would definately recommend this resort to anyone and would return again with absolutely no hesitation.The resort is immaculate and the staff work very hard to maintain such an appearance. From the perfectly manicured property to the super clean rooms and everything in between, we were very pleased with our stay. We travelled with our 2 children (ages 11  15) and their only real complaint was that they would have enjoyed bringing a friend to hang out with. The resort is very, very large but you can take the little shuttle buses which come in very handy, esp. in the extreme heat.Take lots of sunblock with a high SPF, (such as 60 and up). We wore 45 thinking that we would be saved from sunburn, but were sadly mistaken when we had blisters by sundown on our first day.We had done 2 excursions, The Marinarium ( half day of snorkelling with stingrays  sharks and sailing in catamaran) and The Outback Safari (which was a full day of travelling out in the country seeing real dominican life which was a real eye opener for our children). We thoroughly enjoyed both but the kids really loved the marinarium and our tour rep suggested it would be the most fun for our family. Thanks Ryan!!!! If anyone has any questions regarding this resort, please do not hesitate to contact me. I will give you any info that I can or any tips. Like I said, our trip was just fantastic all the way around. Enjoy!!!!! ","annotations":[]}
