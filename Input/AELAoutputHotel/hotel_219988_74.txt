{"text":"Perfect hotel, great location This was our first trip to Paris, so we were flying sort of blind (thanks Tripadvisor). I had been through briefly on business, so I knew we wanted to stay in the Latin quarter, but that was all. Hotel des Grands Hommes seemed to fit the bill, so we went for it. We couldn't have enjoyed it more. The hotel was top notch and the staff was extremely helpful - and spoke English. Fara (or maybe Sara?) at the front desk helped us with directions each day and arranged a dinner cruise. She even gave us free RER tickets to the airport when we mentioned we were going to take the train (apparently left there by another guest). Our room on the 5th floor (542) had no balcony, but we were lucky to have a large bathroom. The size and shape of the rooms vary quite a bit. I was a little nervous about the European air conditioning, but we had the control and it got cold if you wanted it to. We didn't eat in the hotel - too many nice places close by. Our routine included crepes for breakfast at the Crepe-a-go-go around the corner. The hotel is on the plaza of the Pantheon at the top of the hill overlooking the latin quarter. The Pantheon is worth a visit, but probably won't be the highlight of your trip. The location is perfect - a short stroll to Blvd. St. Gremain and all the latin quarter action, but removed enough that you're not kept up by the noise. There's so much to do in Paris, you won't spend much time in the hotel, but I couldn't ask for a better base to explore.
