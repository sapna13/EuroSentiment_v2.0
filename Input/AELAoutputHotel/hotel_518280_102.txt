{"text":"Excellent stay at the QT Myself and my partner have just returned from a 6 night stay at the hotel Qt. Having read some of the reviews on the website we were slightly concerned about the size of room we were to have and the activities within the pool area!However this Hotel is excellent. We had room F (smallest style) and found it to be perfect for us - large, comfy double bed, LCD TV with DVD player, Ipod alarm clock, huge modern bathroom with rain effect walk-in shower (with Neutrogena products). Closet space is a little limited but there is plenty of space on the platform surrounding the bed. We were on the 11th floor at the back of the building and it was extremely quiet. They were actually fitting new windows in all rooms during our stay so all rooms should be very sound-proof!The location is very convenient for Times Square, Fifth Avenue, and Macy's. Choice of 2 subway stops in Times Square - one to the right and to the left. There are 3 good Irish bars within a couple of doors of the hotel and of course you have the bright lights of times square down the street - Virgil√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ BBQ is a good place to head if you are hungry - think hand towels instead of napkins!The hotel lobby is cool with very helpful and friendly staff. The pool area is lovely ... especially after a hard day shopping. It is very quiet during the day and early evening, it did get busier after 8pm but was not too loud and we were not offended or uncomfortable - Don't be put off by some reviews stating wild parties throughout the night, we certainly did not see any.The hotel breakfast is served from 7-11am (mid-day on weekends) and is very enjoyable - especially the croissants and lattes (there is a free coffee machine available all day and night)There were a variety of people staying at the hotel - couples of all ages, families, small groups of friends and business people.Overall - excellent hotel, excellent staff and excellent location.
