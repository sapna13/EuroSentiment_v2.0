{"text":"Lovely hotel I would definately recommend this hotel. We stayed in a double room which was very large, with a super king size bed, 2x couches, flat screen tv, mini bar and massive power shower with jet sprays. Room service is excellent and the maids do an excellent job each day. Reception are very helpful. We changed rooms mid way through our stay because we could hear a baby crying in the room next to us - so not sure if the rooms have great sound proofing or this was a very noisy baby! We didn't hear any other noises. Location wise, the hotel is located on the corner of a busy road, but we didn't have any problems with road noise though. It isn't right in the middle of town, but there are lots of nearby restaurants to eat in, and you can either walk to Las Ramblas in 20-25 mins, or grab a cab (lots of them) for less than √à√\u2020√ü?; you can walk to The Sagrada Familia in 20 minutes. I would definately recommend taking the Tourist Bus which does 3 routes (Red, Green and Blue) and you can jump on and off as many times are you like (~√à√\u2020√ü?0 for 1 day).One restaurant I would 100% NOT recommend is the Les Quinze Nits located in La Ramblas. It is by far the worst restaurant I have even been to with regards to incredibly terrible food and service. It seems to have lots of good reviews online - but don't fall into the trap of believing them! ","annotations":[]}
