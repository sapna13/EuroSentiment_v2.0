{"text":"Very nice hotel with a touch of snootiness. I stayed here for a few days during the first week of May (I also stayed at the Hilton Eiffel Tower as well if you want a comparison). The hotel is very nice and the staff were exceptional. I was hoping for a room upgrade, being a Gold member, but there were no upgrades to be had for all 5 days I was there. They did compensate me with free breakfast coupons for their breakfast buffet. That turns out to be quite a deal as they charge 30 Euros for breakfast! I don't know who pays that kind of money for breakfast, but it was always packed. The rooms are small, as expected in Europe, but very neat and mostly clean. There was some normal wear and tear, but in the bathroom there was a good bit of mold in the shower and ceiling. Otherwise, the bathroom was nice with a seperate tub and shower. The only other complaint I had is the airconditioning was turned off. I still find it hard to believe that a hotel like this would still decide when their customers would like airconditioning. It was still a bit cool in May, but being in a small room with stagnant air can become very uncomfortable and warm. Opening a window was just ok, but the noise level outside made it impractical for me. The hotel is very popular with business people and upscale travelers, so I didn't exactly fit in around there. The patrons seemed to have a bit of snob appeal but the staff were very pleasant. The location is a bit out of the way except for the Arc de Triomphe. Making use of the excellent subway system in Paris is recommended and effortless, otherwise you will be spending a good bit of money to get to the rest of Paris from this location.I would stay here again if the price were right, otherwise you will find me at Hilton's Eiffel Tower location.
