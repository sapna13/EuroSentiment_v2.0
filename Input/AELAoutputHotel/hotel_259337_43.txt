{"text":"Terrible, very anti-British Me and my girlfriend had the misfortune of spending two weeks in the Grand Palladium Bavaro, having first to cope with a 9 hour flight delay leaving Newcastle Airport things didnt get off to a great start. After the bad start im afraid to say that things soon progressed from bad to worse, we had money stolen from our locked room (hotel customer service manager didnt seem to care and was in fact rude), I would like to go into more details but at this time we are seeking legal advice on the matter. We also found the staff (with the odd excepetion) to be rude, sulky and have a very negative reaction to not just us but other English guests who stayed at the hotel at the same time we did. We often ordered drinks around the pool and in the restaurants and they simply never arrived (this WAS NOT the case with guests from other nations). While im on about the restaurants we found the food to be of a very poor standard, for a 5* hotel the lack of any herbs and spices in the food was a joke. Another problem with the hotel was the local companies located in the hotel who tried to sell you excursions every 10 yards, a polite no thank you these guys refused to take and we spent half of our holiday trying to advoid them. We spoke to several other guests from the UK and found that our problems weren't uncommon and some even had worse experiences than ourselves (one couple from Scotland even had sewage coming out of there air-con system for most of there trip!If you are looking for a holiday in Punta Cana I urge you to look elsewhere as this hotel would be lucky to gain a two star rating in Europe. For the reasons stated above I wont be returning to this hotel and I also wont be visiting any of the Fiesta sister properties either.
