{"text":"Absolute perfection across the board! My husband and I just returned from a wonderful 3 week trip to Europe. Our trip ended in Beautiful Venice at the Ca Maria Adele situated on the quiet, clean and quaint Dursoduro district just across from San Marco. I cannot say enough good things about this precious boutique hotel. The accommodations are luxurious and elegant in every way. We enjoyed two rooms during our stay. The first three nights we stayed in Suite 336 with the modern jacuzzi bath at the foot of the bed. We stayed in the Oriental themed room on the final night. The rooms were very different but both were simply perfect - large comfortable kind sized beds, cozy linens and well appointed bathrooms. The common areas of the hotel are stunning as well. Everything you would expect from a top-notch resort, hotel or BB plus more! Ca Maria Adele has set the standard in modern luxury, without going overboard or being pretentious. In addition to the perfect rooms, the service and staff were outstanding. Our every request was met with superb results, whether it was restaurant recommendations, cultural suggestions or simple a great Gelato shop. The staff in particular were extremely impressive. The location is absolutely perfect as well. Away from the crowds, yet close enough to get to any of the main attractions within a few minutes. I highly recommend this area of Venice, opposed to San Marco, which is where you will of course, spend a lot of your time anyway. I can't wait to return to this hidden gem!My husband and I have stayed at many fine hotels, resorts, inns and bb's around the world. If I was asked to give feedback on the Maria Adele, I simple would give nothing but high marks. It's simply perfect.To top it off, the included breakfast, served everyday in any area of the hotel you wish, is sumptuous, diverse and leaves you feeling extremely satisfied.My hat's off to this beautiful, well run, perfect oasis, in the heart of Venice.
