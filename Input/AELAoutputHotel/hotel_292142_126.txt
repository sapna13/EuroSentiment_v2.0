{"text":"Watching the 4th of July fireworks in a great hotel The past few years I only select hotels based on the reviews in TripAdvisor. Again we were very pleasantly surprised with finding and chosing the Affinia Dumont hotel located in Murray Hill on this website. We first searched the big hotelwebsites, Expedia's, Kayak's etc. to find a good deal, but in the end the best deal was on the hotel's website itself. As a matter of fact I cannot remember when I booked a hotel or flight through one of these big sites for the last time. I am afraid they are losing their value-add for me.We also followed the advise of a previous reviewer to go to Penelope's (Lexington Avenue) for breakfast: great place and staff. And the Affinia advised us two great restaurants: Jackson Hole (for a good American hamburger - down PArk Avenue) and Daciro (Italian - also down Lexington Avenue). All very close to the hotel which does have a restaurant next door (Barking Dog - also okay), which also delivers for the room service of the hotel. I am not sure whether this is part of the hotel as such - if so, maybe they should be more clear about this.For the 4th of July the hotel made a suite available for its guests from where we could view the fireworks. Great since it was raining and nearly impossible to access the viewing points (we we walked back after several attempts to get there; we were stopped everywhere by the police). We had a large one bedroom suite with all we needed for our one week stay. We were on the 29th floor and traffic could still be heard, but not in a way that it kept us awake.So: great!
