{"text":"Better than expected A couple friends and I stayed at Princess for a week in February 2008. I've been to a few all inclusive resorts in the last few years and this was my first time in DR. Punta Cana is a very developed tourist area and there were many resorts to choose from. I found it difficult to narrow down my choices, but ultimately it was the recommendations from TripAdvisor and the cost that helped me decide on Princess.The reviews I read all had good things to say about the resort and I don't recall anything bad standing out in my mind.With that being said, I was somewhat worried about whether everything would run smoothly. Because there were three of us staying in one room I was worried about whether we would get a room with the right number of beds, towels, etc. I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived to find that, yes indeed, there were enough towels in our room. Sometimes it's the little details like that that make the difference between relaxation and stress.I wanted to write this review to point out that I feel Princess is well run. There always seemed to be help available, seating at restaurants, chairs around the pool, etc. The grounds were well maintained, the staff were friendly, and many staff made an effort to get to know us. I had a less than ideal experience with food in Cuba, but I found the food at Princess surprisingly good, especially the lobster tail one night.A final note about the resort. My friends and I range from 26-33 and while we found the resort to be an older crowd (adults only), we enjoyed the quiet, relaxing aspect of the resort. There were fun activities available, but what was great was that we had access to the two neighbouring resorts where the guests were noticeably younger and more interested in partying.
