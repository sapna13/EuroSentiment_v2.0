{"text":"Just okay... We visited The Vibe in North Sydney from November 15th - 21st. This motel is nice and very centrally located - right across from the train station and also very close to the ferry at Luna Park. We got there at 10:00 a.m. The reception area seemed very nice. We told them we knew we were early, but wondered what time we could check in. The lady at the front desk told us about noon a room would be ready. So, after a 17 hour plane ride, we decided to go get something to eat just down the road. We walked back at noon and they told us that the housekeeping still didn't have it ready and it would be another hour. So, we walked to a friends place that was nearby. We waited to come back until 2:30 and still were told that the room wasn't ready! I got a little testy with them and they took us up to the bar to have drinks on them until it was ready. Well, needless to say I went back down at 3:00 and still not ready. They were then going to show us upgrades for the hotel - so we took their tour and wouldn't you know our initial room was ready! So, finally at 3:45 we were in our room! What service....The room - Basic - we had a nice view of the Harbour. The bed was nice(r) than some hotels. The lighting wasn't the greatest by the bathroom\/mirror. The shower door is only a half door, which I don't understand and so of course our floor was soaked each time we got out of the shower!We never ate at the restaurant there and so I can't really say much about that.Otherwise just an okay hotel. Nothing too great except for the location...would recommend it only for location.
