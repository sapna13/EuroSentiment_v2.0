{"text":"This is THE place to stay in London This fantastic hotel is located a 5min walk down Millbank (Thames Walk) from the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Bridge. After a 'hiccup' on arrival (our Club Room wasn't ready at 3:15pm), we were upgraded to a junior suite (13th floor) - beautiful views over Thames\/H of P (St.Paul's Tower) and Westminster Abbey (all floodlit at night).Hotel was beautifully decorated (minimilist\/contemporary yet very comfortable); rooms were immaculate and modern and again comfortable. Bed was highest quality.But it was the attention to detail and helpfullness of the staff that rates this hotel. They are great. Professional; customer service oriented to a fault; and friendly.The 1st floor lounge was a bit noisy (music) and difficult to talk over. Restaurant on the main floor was beautiful, service was excellent and the food was 5Star. I would however give afternoon tea in the first floor lounge a miss, as it comprised of two scones that were inedible (rock hard), and service was a hit and miss (enthusiastic, but obviously in training). All other meals - breakfast\/dinner in restaurant - excellent value.We booked this hotel because of the excellent reviews on TRIPADVISOR.COM (there are other hotels in the vicinity that we deliberately didn't book because of the comments on this website). We previously have had 2 very bad experiences with central London Hotels (4Star ones), but our stay at the CITYINN, WESTMINSTER has restored our faith in quality service at a central London Hotel. We will be staying at this hotel on our future trips to London. We would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London for its attention to customer service; fantastic location; excellent and highest quality of fixtures\/fitting in rooms and great restaurant\/cafe.
