{"text":"Not a 4 Star Resort! Where do I begin? Apple rates this resort 4 star, it barely makes 1. From the beginning, we requested and were told there would be a portable bed available for us since there were 3 of us to 1 room. Not true. We had to pay a 270.00 upgrade to get a suite w\/a third cot (not a bed). The suite, 10X12, had a serious leak and bubble in the tiles above the tub in ceiling of the bathroom which we thought at any time would collapse, the safe was broken and we had to carry everything with us at all times, the one time I forgot a bracelet my father gave me on the bathroom sink I came back from the beach only to have it missing. I was sick! I told the manager (same one complained about the safe to) about the theft and he asked why we didn't use our safe??!! No apology, nothing! The sliding glass door to our room would not lock, we notified the front desk of all of this 3 times and finally gave up. The maid would only give us 2 bottles of each, water, soda, beer per day. There were 3 of us in the room. No unlimited anything! The food in every area was horrible. Buffets were fly infested (horribly)and food was undercooked. Lost power and water during the 24 hour storm. Obtaining a drink at any of the 4 bars was near impossible. Minimum of 20 people at all times waiting for service from the 1 bartender per bar. Drinks were horribly watered down. All three of us had the same complaints. We're not picky or like some people can be. I'm perfectly happy with a bologna sandwich and a tent on the beach. It's just that we all agreed that the only, ONLY, thing we enjoyed about this trip was each others company and support given the mess we'd gotten ourselves into. We've all traveled w\/Apple before and had marvelous trips! I love Apple and their staff who are very professional and so friendly. But this trip, this place...was terrible! So very very disappointed!!!
