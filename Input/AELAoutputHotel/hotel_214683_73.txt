{"text":"Loved our stay here. A beautiful hotel on the beach. I stayed at the Marriott Beach resort in Waikiki in January 2008 with my wife and kids. We loved it. It is located right on the main strip (accross the street from the beach). The rooms were quiet (no street noise) or party noise from any of the floors. It takes less than 10 mins to get from the room to the beach. With so many hotels in the area, it was well worth the money to have a hotel that is a quick walk from the beach.The staff were all very friendly,and very willing to answer any questions. The rooms are beautifully decorated, included flat screen tv, soft beds, duvet, and in room fridge. There is a parking garage ($20\/day parking fee), which comes in handy due to the lack of public parking in the area.This resort is large, having two towers, 5 restaurants, 2 pools, a spa, etc. After a day or so, it is easy to navigate your way around the grounds.A couple of things to note. The restaurants are very expensive to eat in (breakfast buffet at the Kuhio Grill was about $35\/adult). Also, the staff at the recreation counter are more than happy to make reccomendations on things to do. The problem we found was that they only refer you to certain tour companies (the ones that were the most expensive). Ask around and shop around for better deals. The ABC convenience store staff (in the lobby) gave us the scoop that only the locals know.
