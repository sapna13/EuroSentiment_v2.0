{"text":"Pure Luxury We got a great price through Hotelconnect for this 5 star hotel in Berlin, and we stayed from Saturday to the following Thursday morning (the only thing is having to get a VERY early morning flight back to Belfast on Easyjet). The hotel is spotlessly clean, staff are very friendly, and can't do enough for you. We found that they all spoke English, and every member of staff greeted you when passing. We didn't dine in the Michelin starred First Floor restaurant, as a 3 course meal (without drink) was going to be around 250 euro, but would probably be well worth it, we just didn't budget for that!The pool area was lovely, especially after a hard day's shopping!The hotel is situated very close to the Ku'Damm, which is the main shopping area, and there are lots of cafe's from which to people watch.We got room service on two nights, and the food was beautiful (club sandwich with loads of french fries, and a massive burger with fries - how classy!!!)We would recommend dinner at Reinhardt's which is on the right as you walk up the Ku'Damm, part of the Kempinski Hotel - the steak there was out of this world, especially with their 'secret sauce'. Also recommended is Dressler's across the road, and the Wintergarten cafe on the 7th floor of the Ka De We department store. The desserts in this place are unbelieveable - take a look at them on display on the 6th floor food hall too.As for the Palace Hotel, the room we had was on the 9th Floor, and was very quiet. The room was big, the beds very comfy (very comfortable big pillows) and the bathroom was luxurious.To round it off, a big fluffy bathrobe and slippers were just the ticket.We cannot fault this hotel or the staff, and everything was efficient and well organised. The breakfast was fantastic, a large buffet with anything you could possibly want.Would definitely stay here again, well worth 5 Stars!!!!
