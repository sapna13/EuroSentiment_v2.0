{"text":"Few things you need to know Planning to take your vacations at Grand Paradise Bavaro? We would like to help with our advice, as we have usually found other people's advice very helpful: Grand Paradise Bavaro is a 3 - 4 star hotel. We would give it a plus 4 for the room standard, although we heard that in other parts of the hotel the rooms were not as good as ours. The beach and the pools are excellent. Facilities are generally good. For us, there were two major problems: 1.The hygene was horrible. In the small bars near the pools and the beach they served drinks with plastic cups. These plastic cups were re-used. When the bar ran out of cups, one of the people working there ran around quickly and collected used plastic cups - in the sand, on the ground, everywhere. They were taken somewhere behind the bar and, voila, they appeared in a minute, nice and clean. I don't think there was hot water or any kind of chemicals to help disinfect them. Later we came to understand why so many people in the resort had brought mugs from home. Three out of four of us got sick with poisoning. (For the record, we have been in several other resorts, and we have got relatively strong stomachs.)2. However, the poisoning might have been from food, and not from the cups. The food was the second horror of the resort. Poor variety, and not very well cooked. Over circulated - food from previous lunch and dinner appearing next day. Except from the first day, there was no yogurt in any of the restaurants. There was very little variety of fruit. Sometimes, you couldn't even find bananas. And the choices in the buffet were very limited. At times we found it hard to convince the waiters to bring us water. It was easier to get beer, though. 3. Doctor's service was good. Unfortunately, we saw a lot of it. We wish you never have a chance to need it.
