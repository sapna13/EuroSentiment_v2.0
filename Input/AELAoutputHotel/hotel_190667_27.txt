{"text":"Fantastic boutique hotel If you're heading to Amsterdam, treat yourself to this luxurious boutique hotel. You won't be disappointed. The Dylan is listed among The Best Small Hotels of the World for good reason. I'm a regular business traveler who's stayed at some pretty amazing places, but this was right up there with my favorites. First, the location is perfect -- perfectly picturesque. The Dylan sits on a quiet street facing one of Amsterdam's flowing canals. You're just a short walk from most major attractions -- incredible museums (like the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum), the historic Anne Frank House and the famed Red Light District. The small alleyways nearby feature plenty of nice shops, pubs and cafes. My room at the Dylan was small but appointed beautifully. I walked in to a classical music serenade and immediately slipped under the sheets to rest up from the transatlantic fatigue. The room had many conveniences -- great bath products (I'm a sucker for Molton Brown), fluffy towels and a nice sound system. For about 40 more euros a night, my colleague enjoyed somewhat more lavish accommodations (her room was larger and looked out on a lovely courtyard), but there doesn't appear to be a subpar room in this hotel. We visited the city on business and benefitted from the free wireless Internet access throughout the hotel. The restaurant is lovely, but I hear the food doesn't measure up to the decor. So, skip the meal, plop down on one of the lounge's cushy sofas and enjoy a cocktail. It's a great way to unwind after a busy day in one of Europe's most beautiful capital cities.
