{"text":"AbsolutelyLoved Hotel Montecarlo My best friend and I stayed at the Hotel Montecarlo on Las Ramblas for 5 nights in September and absolutely loved it! Its at the top end of Las Ramblas close to Placa Catalunya Square (2 min walk) - which made it perfect for catching the Tourist Bus and bus to and from the airport.The hotel is one of, if not the most, beautiful building on las ramblas - loads of tourists took pictures of the building. The staff are incredibly helpful and very friendly. We arrived early and the team gave us a welcome pack full of things to do in Barcelona and looked after our luggage whilst we went and grabbed a bite to eat while our room was getting ready. When we got back our luggage was already in our room, complete with a welcome pack (gorgeous chocolate key, lovely welcome note and gorgeous goodie box). (Top tip though, don't struggle up the steps with your suitcase on arrival - if you go in to the reception desk theres a lift that will take your cases up to the ground floor reception room).We'd asked for a room overlooking Las Ramblas in our email reservation and got one - definitely worth asking. Gorgeous iron balconies, but these do tend to be shared with the next room, but are sectioned off. Once the sliding doors are closed you wouldn't know you were staying on Las Ramblas it was so quiet.The mini bar is restocked often - and is as cheap as anything around the hotel with a good choice of drink for both pre-night and morning after thirst requirements!!. There's a cd player and tv. The beds were remote controlled so you could raise the top or bottom end of the bed to suit. The shower was amazing - a whole room of its own, with a huge jacuzzi bath. There were also complimentary bath robes and slippers (not all out luxury, more of a day spa robe - but a really nice touch).Also - do make the effort to pop up to the roof terrace as the view over the city is lovely.Initially we were considering staying at the 1989 (if thats the right name) which is situated just opposite the Montecarlo. Yes the hotel has a lovely pool at the top, but you really wouldn't miss it. The Montecarlo has a much more relaxed and friendly feel - I can't recommend this enough!
