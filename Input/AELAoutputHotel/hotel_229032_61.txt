{"text":"Its the Best!!!! This was our first trip to Italy. We began by flying into Rome Airport and having a pre arranged car service drive us to Florence. Coming direct from California it made for a long 30 hours of travel. However, when we arrived in Florence we could not have been more thrilled with the Plaza Hotel Lucchesi. Although it was not smack in the center of all Florence, it was within EASY walking distance to everything. It was minutes from the Basilica of Santa Croce, the Uffizi and other locations we visited. I liked staying outside the core of activity because it is quieter and you get to see what life is really like in the local area.This was only our second time to Europe traveling with a family of 5 (a 17, 15 and 7 year old). I spent hours on the internet looking for the perfect hotel and we found it in the Plaza Hotel Lucchesi. The hotel accommodated us with two very clean adjoining rooms overlooking the Arno. The bathrooms were clean (my daughter just informed me they could have been a little cleaner) and large. I appreciated the wood flooring because I know how carpeting tends not be vacuumed or cleaned as often. The only draw back on the wood floors was the one night the guest on the floor above us seemed to be sleep walking in high heels for a few good hours.In our opinion the breakfast was terrific! There was a good selection of croissants, breads, jams, eggs, fresh juice, American coffee, cappuccinos, champagne and fruit among other items. Cloth napkins and attention to detail by the servers was appreciated. It filled our needs prior to getting our day started. And the servers were just as helpful as can be. Traveling with five people, we tend to watch our budget more closely so we did not eat dinner in the Hotel restaurant. The hotel was nice and comfortable and they had a bar in the lobby. As we traveled the week before Christmas, there was not much activity in the bar or lobby seating area - which is one reason I like to travel in December.The wireless internet in the hotel was good but could only be accessed from the hotel lobby which was not a problem for me. I brought my laptop and so it made it easy to use. The wifi signal was always strong, but the server it accessed was horrible. It either tossed me off or I could not get beyond the hotels wifi connection. The WiFi service in our Rome Hotel was a lot worse as I had to pay for service and then was not able to use it because the servers never provided me access onto the internet. Oh well, I did not come to Italy to work anyway.The best pizza we found was at a little Pizza only cafe on a street called Corso dei tintori. You buy by the slice and they have about five or six varieties to choose from. I wish we wrote down the name of it.We visited most of the more familiar museums and churches - Uffizi (the hotel concierge arranged for the tickets, but in the winter time I think we could have saved ourselves money and bought tickets ourselves because there were no lines to get in). Some of the most incredible clean and nice restrooms were located in the BASEMENT of the Uffizi. Other bathroom locations were in the nicer hotels in central Florence. My son convinced me to climb the 436 steps of Doumo. For six euros per person, it did not seem like a big deal. Let me just say the view was well worth the advanced aerobic level exercise of climbing those stairs.We spent four days in Florence and saw all the sites. One of the days we purchased train tickets and went to Lucca for about 4 hours and hopped the train again to go see Pisa where we spend about two hours and then headed back to Florence. It was a great side trip.I want to thank all my trip advisor friends (reviewers) for their candid and honest opinions of this hotel. I solely booked the Lucchesi on their reviews and comments. Thank you!
