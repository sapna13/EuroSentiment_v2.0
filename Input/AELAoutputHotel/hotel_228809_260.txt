{"text":"Excellent in every respect I booked this hotel after reading the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor. I took my fiance and a couple of our friends to Paris for my fiance's birthday and we spent two nights at the hotel. I had emailed the hotel beforehand a couple of times to make some prior enquiries and arrangements and Yohan and Flore were always prompt in replying and giving me the information I needed. Upon arrival, Yohan greeted us at reception and knew who we were instantly, which was a nice personal touch. He also upgraded us at no extra cost to a Junior Suite room which we found to be very nice, clean and spacious. The room was very nicely decorated with lovely decor and the bathroom was a perfect size with lovely clean towels, bathrobe and handy little bottles of shampoo, shower gel and some nice little bath salts. On the evening of my fiance's birthday, Yohan and his Manager (sorry, I cannot recall his name!) recommended to us a lovely Brasserie about 5 mins taxi journey from the airport and went to the trouble of booking the restaurant and taxi for us. Yohan even joined us on his night off at the end of our meal for dessert and helped us sort out a minor problem at the restaurant when they attempted to rip us off by charging us for something we did not order - our French not being particularly good, Yohan was able to rectify this with the waiter!Breakfast was an additional 12 Euros per person but we preferred to venture out to find small cafes for breakfast instead, purely because we wanted to get out of the hotel quickly in the mornings to do our sightseeing. I am told that this hotel has recently been refurbished and you can definitely tell. The decor throughout was very sophisticated and tasteful and I particularly liked the leopard print carpet !Overall we could not fault the hotel in any way, okay maybe the lift is a bit on the small side, but this would not affect anyone wanting to stay there, unless they are just plain fussy! The staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. The location of the hotel is also ideal, the nearest metro being just five minutes walk and right near the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. The area is extremely quiet and we did not experience any noise from the neighbouring properties.We will definitely be returning to Paris in the Spring\/Summer of 2007 for another short break and will without a doubt be booking the Royal Magda for our stay.
