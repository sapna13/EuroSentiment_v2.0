{"text":"You get what you pay for The stay at the hotel was fine. The room was fine for overnight stay or business travel, no frills. I knew that parking was in issue in San Francisco so I called to ask specifically about the rules. I was told since I was a guest of the hotel as well as using a meeting room I could park prior to being able to register as a guest. The room package I chose included a day of parking and I was informed if I went past the 24 hour period I would be responsible for the additional amount. When I arrived I was told by the parking attendant I could not park until 3 PM, check in time no matter I had a 9 AM conference in the hotel. I had to find another parking garage and pay an additional $25 dollars. At 530 PM I was able to move my car to the hotel where I had prepaid for parking. The next day I was told by the same parking attendant I would have to remove my car by 1 PM or be forced to pay additional fees. This was clearly less than the 24 hr parking I was promised in my contract with the hotel. The parking attendant was very rude and emphatic none of that mattered because he did not work for the hotel and the hotel did not control him. After some discussion with hotel management I was able to leave my car until 4 pm when my business was done. Again I would possibly go back to the hotel but only if I did not have to deal with the parking situation. ","annotations":[]}
