{"text":"Five star budget hotel If there is such a thing as a five-star budget hotel, the Hotel Constanza is it. Stayed there this week (Jan. 07) for 60 euro a night. That is less than many Motel 6 locations, for the folks in the U.S., and this hotel is in the middle of Barcelona, not the boonies.The room was nice, spacious, and beautifully furnished, as nice as or nicer than some Hiltons \/ Westins \/ etc. The staff was attentive and very helpful. The location, for me, was perfect. There are several Metro stops nearby, including Catalunya, Passeig de Gracia, and Girona, all of which are within a 5-10 minute walk. It's easy to get to with luggage from the airport or Barcelona-Sants (train sta.).It is within walking distance to ALL the sights except for Parc Guell. Catalunya \/ Ramblas is about 10 minutes away, Passeig de Gracia (Discordia, Pedrera) is about 10-15 minutes away, and Arc de Triomf, Ciutadella, Barri Gothi, and the Montjuc funicular are a little bit farther, but still walkable.There are many good places to eat nearby (though somewhat touristy) and several supermarkets, groceries, bakeries, and fast food joints. I liked Tapa Tapa and Fraggi (delicious, pricy ice cream) on P. de Gracia, and there are two all-you-can-eat joints nearby (FresCo and Lactuca) if you're into that sort of thing. For what it's worth, food is relatively cheap in Spain, and the difference between all-you-can-eat and a regular joint isn't that much, with a step up in food quality \/ selection; but if you're really really hungry, it may be worth it. There is an Internet place two blocks away if you don't bring your laptop with you.All in all, two big thumbs up, and without a doubt, would stay there again. Given the value, this hotel should be listed #1.
