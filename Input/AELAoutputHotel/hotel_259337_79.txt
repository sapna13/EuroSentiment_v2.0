{"text":"In a nutshell fabulous First of all I must say any one that has anything negative to say about this resort, you have to be the type of person that nothing makes you happy or you happen to have a run of bad luck.I will keep this as short as possible as not to repeat same info givin in other reviews. My partner and I stayed here March 1 to March 8. We are both in our late 40's. Resort was more beautiful and clean than I was expecting and l did much research before choosing this resort. From the marble in the lobbies which carries into the rooms to the beautiful well kept grounds simply amazing.Tip your room staff and you surely won't be disappointed. The young man who refilled our bar fridge never missed a day and always left us extra of everything. Was the same woman who did the housekeeping every day did a great job. As I had read they don't supply face cloths, but the first day I asked her for one than she left me two everyday for the rest of my stay. The fresh flowers everyday in the bathroom area was a nice touch.Room was large, king size bed which was quite comfortable.(remember you are not at home here) As in a review I to recommend you bring alarm clock, they do have a wake up call service but never slept well a couple nights when I new we needed to be up early for an excursion and had to rely on the wake up call.Even though we booked the Bavaro section we were more in the Palace section, which was perfect for me as the Casino was a stone throw away(where I ended up most nights and did come home with 635 dollars in winnings from the slots) Internet cafe was just across the street (used twice and never had to wait more than 5 minutes) as was the Palace reception(where we got picked up for our excursions) and one of the buffet restaurants. I was pretty much right in the middle of the complex and it was perfect for us. Villa 6904 very short walk to the Palace pool and an even shorter walk to the Punta Cana pool area,(30 second walk) which had a 2nd pool and another buffet almost on the beach, which we liked the pool here the most.Ocean and beach were as perfect and breathtaking as everyone discribes. The towel on chair game was ridiculous but we always managed to get lounge chairs at the beach and pool area. And as stated in an earlier review you know who you are and should be ashamed of yourself and I do hope management puts a stop to it some how or at least double up the amount of loungers around the pool they could use more and there was lots of room for more. Food, not one complaint. A la Carte did 3 and were all fantastic. Spanish was so good(plum sauce means gravy by the way).Mexican was also very very good. And the steak and seafood was fantasic. T-bone was huge and NOT undercooked. I don't do lobster so can't comment on that. If you can't find enough tasty food to fill your belly in the buffets you are way to picky and serious food issues. The breads we the best along with the pizza. Fried chicken a must have. Never bothered with burgers and fries was to much other great stuff to choose from. Dominican night was my favorite with the roast pig and all the Dominican flare. Breakfast, lunch or dinner was always yummy.Drinks were very good, and also enjoyed the wine and beer, always nice and cold. Excursions did 3. Zip Lining was thrilling, a must do. Reef Explorer was also a 1\/2 day trip and was worth the 90 bucks a head. Swam with sharks and stingrays, snorkelled the reef, even got a massage and lunch while there. Parasailed and the speed boat ride to the parasailing boat was just as fun. I booked with itravel2000 on line and was perfect. Air Transat was great like the last time I booked with them. And our rep there did a great job.Punta Cana and Bavaro beach was my best vacation I have had yet thanks to the Grand Palladium Resort and their great staff.
