{"text":"Royal Service All the way Royal Service... May 8-15.2008We have two children, 2, and 12 years.. Good..The pools, views, the pool bar, and room service are great.The staff. There was one by the pool that didn't help you if you didn't give her a tip.Hokkaido, and Dominican Restaurant were great.Rest stop for the excursions has cheap liquor...The maids turn down your sheets at night. Scuba Crew and the boat ride...The pool bar -hot dogs and hamburgers that was great... We loved the cart for Royal Service to get around.Walks are not long once you learn short cuts.Bad..Cool Club for teens.If there isn't any other children for older kids to play with staff won't babysit. Mine was the only one. Kids in Baby Rock club were in hot sun with no water. We watched as kids played and polite staff just talked to each other. Not really interacting. They stayed in the shade. Bed bugs... Hard to see. Trust me they are there..No night life or real entertainment for guests or decent clubs. Hot water not always working. Lights go out time to time. Food.Ma Maison.French. So pretty but sorry it was not good. ***Yes reservations only. Once it was not done. We had small children. That was not good. Or you are stuck with the buffet.No tour of grounds when you upgrade, but they will offer by the pool. That turned out to be a long demonstration for a time share. Please bring wash cloths. We did thanks to reviews.. If you don't get Royal Service you will never know how different the place is....I am sorry... I didn't like the food. Lots of kids but they didn't really entertain them.Ok..Mexican RestaurantThe kids arcade had playstation 2. Two pool tables, hockey table, chess, but it was a small room. That's the extent of the child care at night... My opinion is it not average... But I wouldn't go back... P.S Have your own vacation.. GO Club Med..Pay more or choose another resort...
