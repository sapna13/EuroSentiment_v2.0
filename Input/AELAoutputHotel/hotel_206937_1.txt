{"text":"decent room, good breakfast, good location I will focus more on details, as major things are ok - such as location etc.I made reservation for a queen bed double room. Once i got to the hotel there was only 1 room available in the conditions required. The room was no larger than 12 sq meters, bathroom another 10 sq m. The window was facing a close building - 2 m away - so no possibility for natural light in the room. So I went to the reception and asked for another room, even with 2 separate beds (altough we were a couple). They offered us a room in the building right close to the hotel - an apartment building owned partially by the hotel. The room was actually a junior suite at 1st floor, nice large windows facing the street and pretty spacious - at least 40sq m. Pretty clean too - but i was interested only in the sleeping details of the room as staying in Barcelona in a hotel room was not my objective..:) The city is great - you feel you could stay out there day and night.The bathroom was pretty poor - the sink being clogged in my case. The bed sheets and towels need to be changed - as they are pretty old and probably over used - you could smell the extra chlor used for washing.The personnel was ok, they gave us directions and info requested - but nothing out of regular stuff.The breakfast was the best service of the hotel i think (except location). Very reach buffet with cold and warm dishes. Strongly recommend this buffet.The price for the room in this conditions is pretty high, but once again - location is the one that really matters.
