{"text":"still not over it! okay, sooo first of all this was our first vacation as a couple. Just us. both myself and my boyfriend are latino. when we arrived the hotel service removed our bags from the car and without a ticket or name placed them in a room. they told us to go inside to check in and that the bags were safe. with some hesitation i went to check in. my last name is a very common latino name. but i do not speak spanish. i am brasilian therefore i speak portugese. when i began speaking english the woman who was helping us looked at me like i was crazy then answerd me only in spanish. when i replied in english she ROLLED her eyes and continued to speak in spanish to my boyfriend. i was so angry, but i just walked away and let him handle it. when we went to get our bags they told us to just go into the room and take them. so much for security didn't even watch what bag i took. one thing i will say the beach was amazing and if you know how to make the best of any situation you'll be fine. after my horrible check in other things were just as bad. the food was't good at all. and you ate on schedule. open and closing times for breakfast lunch and dinner. so don't get hungry after late night dancing. tough luck for you. th eone night club mangu was cool. but the electricity went out while dancing at around 1:30. needless to say we had to leave, but directing drunks out of two exits can get messy. but like i said just make the best of it. luckily we had candles so a romantic on our balcony was perfect. we spent everyday at the beach. so we didn't have to deal with the speak english when convienant staff. i had an amzing time with my love and will NEVER GO BACK!! not only to grand flamenco but Dominican republic. i like to travel at least once a year. i work hard and like to enjoy myself. this is the first time ever did not enjoy my vacation. both my brothers are married to beautiful dominican women and they are the ones who suggested our vacation. i still love them. but like i said NEVER AGAIN!!
