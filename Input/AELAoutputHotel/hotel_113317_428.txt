{"text":"Loved the Casablanca! We stayed in the Casablanca from the 22-26 March 2007. I went with my two parents and my sister. It was our first time at the Casablanca and I had done a lot of searching on Tripadvisor before booking anywhere. All I can say is that the reviews about the fantastic the staff are completely true. Our first encounter was with Mike, who booked us in after a tiring flight from Ireland. He arranged a table for us at Tony's Restaurant (next door) and advised us to rest our weary bones upstairs in Rick's Cafe with a nice glass of wine until the table was ready. I shouldn't single Mike out though because everyone was so nice to us when we were there and all the men at the lobby were equally friendly and helpful. The ladies who served the wine and cheese (complimentary from 5-8 each evening) were lovely and great fun. By the way, the complimentary breakfast and the wine and cheese evenings are a great bonus.My parents particularly liked the safe, friendly, intimate environment of the Casablanca as it was very laid back and fun.The rooms are great - clean, big bathrooms, a safe, television, dvd player, alarm clock radio, and a mini-bar (if you dare!)It is so central - literally off Times Square. 20 minutes walk in one direction to the Empire State Building, Macys, etc. 15 minutes walk in the other direction to St. Patrick's Cathedral, 5th Ave, Central Park. Great restaurants and bars are literally on your doorstep. Overall staying at the Casablanca was a fantastic experience and I couldn't recommend it highly enough.
