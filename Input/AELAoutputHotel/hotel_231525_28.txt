{"text":"Fantastic hotel, great location, family friendly. Me and my husband and our 8 month old son stayed 4 nights in this really lovely intimate, clean hotel, with friendly staff.If you can afford this place it is worth it. For the best features was the location and our little balcony where we could sit and enjoy the street and enjoy the wiew of the Pi cantendral in the end of the street witha a glass of cava.The street was busy in day time and in the evening but at night it was totally empty and peacefull as there is no bars on the street just shops.Mind all the rooms have not got balconies or any view at all, so you should make sure to request it when you book the hotel.It was also really family friendly and the baby cot was good. Bathroom was spacefull and clean and the bath tub had a jacuzzyi feature.We got easely up to our floor with our baby buggy in the elevator.The brekfast buffet is fantastic with lots to choose from, and the staff really friendly and our litlle baby son got lots of positive attention. In our deal it was included in the room price but in general it coast 15 √à√\u2020√ü?per person per morning.The location could not bee better, with only a minutes stroll to wonderfull piazzas with many eateries both in and outside.The room had got all the required fasilities, TV, minibar, hairdryer and so on.I found this hotel trough this site, and agree with all the positive things that others have experienced.Might be that your search is over. The only bad thing is that we noticed that it is quite full booked, even in off season. So you should book well ahead or have good luck. There is only 37 rooms available.Family from Finland ","annotations":[]}
