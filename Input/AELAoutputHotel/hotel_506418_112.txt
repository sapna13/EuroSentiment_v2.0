{"text":"Beautiful Hotel We travelled to the Hotel Vitale as part of our honeymoon and really enjoyed our stay there. On arrival we found the staff friendly and when we got into our room we found a bottle of Champagne on ice, a box of chocolates and a card congratulating us. We also found that we had been upgraded to a corner room which had two floor to ceiling windows looking across the Bay Bridge and the Embarcadero. The room was lovely and relaxing with plenty of room and there was a relaxing christmas CD playing on arrival which was a nice touch. There was no bath in the bathroom however I think other rooms do have baths and there was a huge shower with lots of lovely smelling toiletries. There were complimentary yoga session on the roof every morning (I never got up in time to attend!) and the overall feel of the hotel is trendy and laid back. We ate\/drank in the hotel bar on Thanksgiving day and the service and quality was excellent. Location wise I really liked the hotel but it might not be for everyone as it's in the financial district and not in the tourist end. We found it easy to walk to most places and the sightseeing buses actually drop off\/pick up quite near to the hotel so that would be a good option to get around. If we could change anything I would have liked to have had tea and coffee making facilities (though there are plenty of coffee houses around) but altogether we really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Vitale.
