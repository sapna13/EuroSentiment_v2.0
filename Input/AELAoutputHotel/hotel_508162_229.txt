{"text":"Our stay at Dreams Punta Cana We arrived @ Punta Cana on Wednesday, July 2. It took us a little over 1 hr. to get to our hotel. We got to Dreams between 5  6pm. Check in went smoothly. When we got into our room (in building 4), it was musty, muggy,  warm. We dropped our stuff off, went back to the main lobby,  let them know that the AC wasn't working. Someone went  repaired it. We then noticed that the AC  fan work on a scensor. If you're not in the room, they shut off, same when you're asleep (not too pleasant). Anyway, we changed into our bathing suits, checked out our little balcony (which was nice, had a little table  2 chairs), went to the pool  saw that the pool closes at 7:30pm (a bit early for us). We ended up just going to dinner at the Seaside Grill which was pretty good, walked around a bit,  went back to our room.The entertainment was excellent  they give you a daily schedule with the activities  food schedule for the day which is good. Food was pretty good. Breakfast Buffet was good, as well as lunch @ the World Cafe, the Himitisu Japanses Restaurant (we ordered from the Chinese menu),  the Bordeaux (French Restaurant) was OK. Not a big fan of French food. We did have the romantic dinner on the beach  the food for that was great (bread, seafood ceviche, clam chowder, steak  shrimp, creme brule,  wine). Room Service menu was edible but not the best.The beach was nice. They have little tiki huts w\/ lounge chairs underneath which keep you in the shade. The beach was sea-weedy but overall it was very nice. The pool  swim-up bar were the best part of the resort. We got sunburned our first day wearing SUNBLOCK! I would definatley visit the Dominican Republic again but I would not stay @ this resort. We wanted to go Dolphin Swimming  do other things but all of the activities were at least 45 mins away. We did have a minor ant problem in our room  our remote disappeared after room service came in. It took us 1 day to get a new one. Our cell phones had absolutely no reception (not a big deal) but they do have internet service ($4 for 15 mins). Oh  a small bottle of Aloe Vera  a stronger Sunblock cost us $30. Watch out for the sales people around the resort. They are VERY persistent  a total rip off. Take alot of singles for tipping. We enjoyed our stay  being fluent in Spanish made our stay easier, but we were looking forward to going home on Sunday. I give the entertainment  food 4-5 stars but the room gets 3. Good luck!
