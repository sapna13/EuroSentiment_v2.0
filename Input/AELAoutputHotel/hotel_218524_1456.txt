{"text":"A little bit more then a Secret or Excellente Me and My husband stayed at Secrets Excellence for our aniversary. Let's start with the review:Hotel -The hotel was beautiful as we pulled up√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√§iffrent types of animals and nice landscaping that they are trying to keep from going downhill. The front desk was very courteous to us as we checked in. Paulina was great. RoomsThe rooms are really nice. We were in room 9107√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√∂here is a lot of Misquitos at this resort due to foliage and trees. the next morning we had ants in our room, but it is the Caribbean , expect bugs they don't bite. Pool  Beach -Loved it. The swim up bar was really nice and there are plenty of empty beds during the day. we never had a problem getting one, but a raft was a diffrent story. I should of brought my own like some people. The water was warm and clean. The beach was beautiful. We went in a couple of times.Food -What to say beside this was the worse part of the hotel. First day there we went to the World Cafe for dinner since it was the one someone recommended. Well YUCK!!!!! The food their is a little to be desired and if you like pastas just sitting out with no refrigeration then you can eat it, I won't. The only thing really to eat during the our staywas either the pizza or ribs. Dinner was alittle better in the Oceana and the El Patio- We had our romantic dinner there and the mosquitos joined us. we never ate so fast in our lives. You have to be careful what you eat here or you will be buying the $10 medicine out of the pharmacy. It will keep you off the toliet for a little bit.Alcohol -The drinks were watered down from the ice melting so quickly, you had to bring insulated cups(we did). The bottles of water had a chill on them. They did not have premium drinks their. You could get all the rum punch and Copacana's you wanted but no Hennesey or Grey Goose. My husband drinks MGD and he was able to get that at the lobby bar or in the casino. Entertainment -It was amusing. The hotelentertainment staff is great Inez, Maria and IsrealSuperman. Micheal Jackson and the magician were a good act to.I would return to secrets again, just not the one in D.R. I am glad I got a chance to see how it is there.
