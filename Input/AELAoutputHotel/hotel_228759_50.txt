{"text":"Oh-la-la la-la! The Mayfair is tr√Å√\u2022¬¥s magnifique Our family stayed at the Mayfair for four nights at the beginning of August as part of a two-week Europe vacation booked on go-today. There were eight of us and we occupied four rooms. The staff was friendly and helpful at every turn. Some in our group had basic French, however, all staff were able and willing to speak with guests in English. Each of our four rooms (a combination of double twin and king bedded rooms) were classically decorated, comfortable, and super clean. The high step into the bath tub was a bit of a challenge for one of our travelers who is in her 80s - but that should be anyone's biggest issue would be a blessing. The common areas are also well decorated and clean. They are limited in size as the hotel itself is plut\u2030?√\u2020t petit. The continental breakfast was bountiful. We were careful about avoiding the meats and cheese from reading other reviews and upon check-in the desk clerk did explain this little quirk. The hotel even has a business centre with reasonable access fees via a pre-paid card system purchased from the front desk. As for location - well, as they say in real estate location is everything and this is a tremendous place to be when visiting Paris for your first or fifty-first time. Quick walk to the Metro and many other places you just have to visit while in the city including Le Louvre, Op√ã√\u2022√ñra National de Paris, the Champs-√ã√ë¬∞lys√ã√\u2022√ñes and almost everything else!
