{"text":"Unsurpassed My daughters and I just spent a week in New England and started our trip at the Copley Plaza. I had never stayed there before and now I will never stay anywhere else in Boston! I haven't enjoyed such truly outstanding, caring service, in many years. We arrived at 5:30 a.m. in the morning after a red-eye flight. We were assured that not only was our room ready for us (on the Gold floor), but we had been upgraded to a suite for our stay. The suite (the Boston Symphony Orchestra Suite) was a treasurehouse of photographs, posters, and scores from the Boston Symphony and a beautifully decorated suite with a view of Copley Square. Breakfast on the club floor is amazing. The first morning I went down very late and the lovely young server cooked us a beautiful breakfast to order well after normal breakfast hours. Similarly, our waiter the next two mornings not only served us beautifully but took extra care to find out what my daughters wanted to do in Boston and to give us map guidance, restaurant, and shopping suggestions; then inquired how we had enjoyed everything the next morning. Every staff person we encountered was outstanding. On the last day, as we loaded our suitcases into our rented car for our car trip through New England, the doorman retrieved our bags for us and then guided us across all lanes of traffic so that we could safely turn onto I-90. We also felt that Katie, the local black Lab, lent a sweet, homey touch to the lobby, which is elegant and relaxing.I just can't say enough good about this hotel! Now everything else will pale in comparison!
