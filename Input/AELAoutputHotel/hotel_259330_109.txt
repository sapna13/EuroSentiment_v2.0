{"text":"AMAZING TIME! -dont listen to bad reviews I just returned from grand paradise a week ago, at first i was kinda scared with all the bad reviews, but i was so impressed!we stayed in the club section, which was amazing! they are still building bars, restaurants etc when we were there so they should be ready in no time! while we were there tey rebuilt a whole new spa! ROOMS-when we first got up to our room our air conditioning was making fun noisies so we called front desk and they came up and fixed it right away and offered us a new room. Also there was no clock in the rooms so in a way that kinda sucked. Other than that the rooms were very nice and clean!STAFF-the staff there is amazingg and so friendly, ALWAYS smiling, singing and offering anything you may needFOOD-the food was good... we only ended up doing on a la carte which was good (asia). I have a very weak and sensitve stomach so i was kinda sick but that would of been a number of things. i sitll enjoyed the food and the buffets were good!BEACH- most amazing beach ive ever seen... constantly cleaning it...we walked down the beach and i found ours to be the best beach it was awesomeePOOLS- there is 4 pools, 2 in club and 2 in the other section all of them are very clean and niceENTERTAINMENT- we went to the shows every nigh and they were a lot of fun and entertaining, they sometimes get the audience involved which is funafter the shows we would go to the disco (which is good) or down to the beach bar!overall i loved this resort it was very big so you meet a lot of people and its a great time!
