{"text":"Amazing! Couldn't fault it! Stay here Having read previous reviews of this hotel on TripAdvisor I had high expectations - which I can safely say were met and exceeded! Everyone going to Hong Kong should stay here!Hotel Location: 5 mins walk to the MTR (tube) station. 5 mins walk from ladies market and sports market, 10 mins walk to goldfish market and flower market. Roughly 15mins MTR ride to Star ferry and Kowloon area.Hotel rooms: very luxury, clean, everything you could possibly need and more! We paid the extra for a Club room and it was worth it - although I am sure the other rooms in the hotel were just as nice. Rooms have massive flat screen tv, wireless access, ipod docking station (in Club rooms), rain power shower, complimentary water and chocolates\/slippers by the bed at night! Floor to ceiling windows had a lovely view of the city. Room also had a free of charge safe for guest use.Club L facilities: free of charge drinks (alcohol included) all day\/night plus snacks and continental breakfast. Internet access with computers, library, DVD library and personalised check in. I thought it was worth paying the extra for the free drinks and snacks, plus the internet access was handy.Hotel food: Room service was excellent value and prompt. We also paid for the full breakfast (Club breakfast was continental only) and this was an amazing selection (e.g. english,omlettes, pancakes) and very tasty. If you are happy with continental only then don't bother paying the extra for this! We went to the chinese restaurant in the hotel which was of a very high standard. We also ate in The Place which serves a buffet style menu in the evenings which was again delicious.Other hotel facilities: Hotel roof top swimming pool and jacuzzi was absolutely lovely and just what you needed after a day of sightseeing! Chaun Spa was most relaxing too - I recommend! The shopping centre next to the hotel was great and very big, so take some time to go around it all!! Its great to just walk back over the bridge to the hotel to drop your purchases off!!Other tips for HK overall: 1.Buy an Octopus card, you can use this for all bus\/train\/MTR travel including the Peak Tram  bus to Po Lin Monastery.2. Go on the free Mongkok markets tour the hotel offers - a lovely lady took us round and gave some great tips. One of which is to visit the sports market near the hotel - lots of trainers, both for casual and sports wear - at good prices.3. Go to Stanley market on the other side of Hong Kong island.Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here, the staff at the hotel were so kind and professional, it makes such a welcome change to have such a high standard of customer service. The staff really do predict what your needs are going to be before you even ask them!!
