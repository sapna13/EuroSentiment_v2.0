{"text":"Close to perfection in Barcelona This must surely be amongst the very best hotels in Barcelona. My boyfriend (a hotel snob it must be said) booked this weekend away as a surprise and boy did he earn brownie points for this hotel. Only about 15 minutes from the airport means it's perfect for short stays. Situated just off La Rambla we had reservations that it would be noisy - we couldn't hear a thing when the doors were closed. Our room had a private terrace and I think it is definitely worth the extra expense for that - it meant we had our (fantastic but quite expensive) breakfasts sitting in our own private dining room outside. I reckon room 528 must be the best though as it has it's own pool and is on a corner site - next time...I used the air-conditioned gym (sad I know!) each morning and the cellar pool is just heaven (although respect to anyone who actually manages to recline in the spa loungers in the pool). I appreciated the free bottled water and towels downstairs too. The pool on the roof is also just heaven - need a few more loungers but the views are fantastic and the extra breeze up there is very welcome. Would like to have seen them serve food on the roof terrace as they do have the tables and chairs for it but at the moment it's just bar service. Our room was immaculate and the bathroom was very cool (I'm a huge fan of a good bathroom!) - shower is confusing at first but we got the hang of it after a while. Air-conditioning is the quietest I've ever experienced and works brilliantly. Daily maid service was excellent and it's worth noting that the mini-bar prices are not silly so you don't feel too guilty at raiding it. I would have preferred a double bed rather than two beds put together but then I'm British so we like that kind of thing. Couldn't really fault this hotel at all - if I could go back tomorrow I would - it's a slice of heaven in a very cool city. The only you'd change about Barcelona is to make the shop and waiting staff friendlier - they all appear a little off-ish and stressed and I speak Spanish so they don't have that excuse! If you get the chance go to Hotel 1898 - I'll be hugely jealous.
