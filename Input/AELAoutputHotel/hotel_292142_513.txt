{"text":"Affinity Dumont will amaze you if you have ever stayed in other NYC hotels. This place was incredible! I can't believe the price, less than half other hotels' single rooms for a junior suite! There was not a single smell in the room (my pet peave), the room was huge with a kitchen  sitting area. Great view on the 21st floor through the many windows in the room. Room service was lightening fast and food was great. Lots of treats in the room (for a charge, but still great to have). The staff was so friendly and regular. The cleaning woman was sweet as can be. Valet parking. I hear they have a great gym though we didn't use it, and a great restaurant. There is a deli just next door to get juice, coffee, cakes, sandwiches. And lots of restaurants nearby. We can't wait to go back. We usually stay aroung 42nd street and 5th, but that is so congested and noisy at night. This area was really nice and quiet and near the East River too. Oh, and the best part? There were these really bright reading lights over each side of the bed for us baby boomers who need lots of light to read! The whole room was well lighted with dimmers. (I am so tired of these dark hotel rooms!) Oh, the other best part? They are pet friendly! I can't believe it! Everything you could possibly want in a hotel. We were toying with the idea of getting an apartment in the city but now we think it would be nicer and less expensive to just stay at the Affinity Dumont when we go down. You will NOT be disappointed.
