{"text":"Good for your Granma who likes JELL-O Maybe it was the time of year, but it felt like I was in an old age home! And JELL-O to top it off. Lots of large groups from Germany and Russia. SITE: Liked the grounds and configuration of hotel which made it seem smaller than 447 rooms. Construction? What construction? A saw a few workers here and there but nothing about the noise others wrote about. Ok I was in building 5 overlooking the Ocean Blue Resort but... On weird thing: there are no stools at the bars, only lots of tables which make it harder to meet people.FOOD DRINK: Some choice, but lots of food in sauce... Worst thing: no real espresso machine! You could only get some powder espresso starting at 8:15 in the lobby from an automatic distributor. Drinkable, but by no means satisfactory for those of us who like good strong coffee. After a while, you get tired of local alcool too which all taste the same. Grab yourself a bottle of nice wine at the duty free coming in, you'll enjoy it compared to the wine they serve there. I went twice to La Proa - the seafood non inclusive restaurant. Good food and excellent service. BEACH: clean, lots of chairs and palapas but water a little murky due to the constant waves.STAFF: Most are nice and friendly and do deserve a few dollars of tip (which they don't seem to get very often due to the type of clientele). VENDORS: Beware the constant nagging by vendor INSIDE the resort. Anything from timeshare (they grab you at the buffet restaurant) to dominican night. You can't take a few steps without being asked where you're from and come see my stall. ANNOYING. In Plaza Bavaro there even worse!This was my 1st time in DR and likely my last. I'll keep going to Cuba where the people are nice, the music is soothing and you can really relax on your vacation!
