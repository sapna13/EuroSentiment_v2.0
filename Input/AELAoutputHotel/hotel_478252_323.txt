{"text":"Fantastic Resort Just got back from the Bahia Principe Punta Cana and to sum it up in a word it was Fantastic. My wife and I got spooked by some of the negative reviews but we were so pleasantly surprised when we got there. We were a group of 9 people, 5 adults and 4 kids and all of us had a great time. Overall the resort was great, we would definitely go back. Some of the down sides to keep in mind are that this is a large resort so it takes time to get to see everything, if you prefer smaller, more intimate places on the beach this is not the place for you. Our room was a bit humid\/damp and when I asked to change to another room they accommodated me the same day and it was better. There are mosquitoes so remember to bring the bug spray for everyone. Here is a quick recap of our experience there:Resort √à√\u2020\u2022?5 Star √à√\u2020\u2022?The grounds are incredible, lush, tropical landscape that is professionally designed and maintained. The resort is very large but it has more that enough room and facilities for everyone, a grand lobby, 6 huge pools that are great for kids, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ spotless and the service is friendly.Food √à√\u2020\u2022?5 Star √à√\u2020\u2022?The buffets are large, fresh, kid friendly with lots of variety. The a la carte restaurants are great; my favorite was the Italian because of the antipasto and the lobster.Beach √à√\u2020\u2022?Beautiful for miles, the water is a bit rough for small kids so we put their life jackets on, no problems. Weather √à√\u2020\u2022?Incredible, 28 everyday with 10 minutes of rain on 3 of the 7 nights. There is a constant breeze that keeps you cool.Hope you enjoy your stay there as much as we did!
