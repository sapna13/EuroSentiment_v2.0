{"text":"A great time in PR Not sure where the negative people stayed but I know I stayed at the InterContinental San Juan Resort, Spa  Casino. It would be really helpful if people rated a hotel, service and their overall stay with a little more objectivity.We just returned from 8 days and 7 nights at the IC and had a wonderful time. Here's my objective ratings based upon numerous stays at hotels ranging from the Four Seasons to Holiday Inn Express.The InterContinental San Juan Resort, Spa  Casino is not a Four Seasons but then again I did not pay Four Seasons rates. It also not a Holiday inn Express - the IC is much better.The reasons people go to the Caribbean - sun and fun!Weather 4.5 stars - rained one day with a few showers on two other days (no big deal). Other than that the weather was outstanding - not too hot just right.Pool - 5 stars - 99.5% complete with a little grout sealing being performed, however, it was not intrusive at all. We had as many towels as we wanted and the chairs were very comfortable and clean. Drinks and food at the pool and beach were very good. Nice place to seat after dark if you like the sound of the surf as you have an after dinner cocktail.Beach - 4 stars - there was a lot of seaweed in the water for about 25 feet. The beach was clean but there were a few sand fleas. The hotel provided bug spray. The water was warn and clear once you waded past the seaweed. The restaurant was a nice place to sit after dark if you like the sound of the surf as you have an after dinner cocktail.Hotel staff service - 5 stars. Everyone was attentive and very helpful.Hotel property in general 3.5 stars - public areas clean and well maintained. Rating was impacted down a little due to the quality of the rooms (see below).Hotel rooms 3 stars - adequate (how much do you really stay in the room). Need to be spruced up. Bathrooms adequate but really needs to be updated. Not sure how they can be since they are small and there is no room to expand.Food at the hotel (beach) - 4 stars (again this is at the beach not a 4 star restaurant like the Palm's - need to but everything into perspective).Concierge - 5 stars - all recommendations for dinner were excellent!Overall 4.5 stars!Hope this helps.JAT ","annotations":[{"endOffset":420,"mention":"Four Seasons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Four_Seasons_Restaurant"],"startOffset":408},{"endOffset":515,"mention":"Four Seasons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Four_Seasons_Restaurant"],"startOffset":503},{"endOffset":515,"mention":"Four Seasons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Four_Seasons_Restaurant"],"startOffset":503},{"endOffset":515,"mention":"Four Seasons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Four_Seasons_Restaurant"],"startOffset":503},{"endOffset":557,"mention":"Four Seasons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Four_Seasons_Restaurant"],"startOffset":545},{"endOffset":1088,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1084},{"endOffset":1432,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1428},{"endOffset":1432,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1428},{"endOffset":1432,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1428}]}
