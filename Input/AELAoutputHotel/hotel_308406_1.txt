{"text":"Very nice, but communication lacking. I stayed in a deluxe, ocean view room at the Grand Mirage over Christmas\/New Year on the all-inclusive, 'gold', √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂\u2020nternet special' package booked directly with the hotel.The room was very good (more ocean 'glimpses' than 'view') with a nice balcony overlooking the pool. Housekeeping kept it spotless; and in general, the bar, food and laundry services were excellent. However, it seems they have two types of all-inclusive 'gold' packages: the internet special (which I booked), and the regular, 'gold' package (which does not include as many amenities\/'perks'). For example, part of my package was a full day, island tour with lunch. When I enquired about booking it, I was told tours are not included. After much discussion and showing the assistant manager the website, I got my tour... only to find out on the tour that the guide expected me to pay for lunch (I didn't but the guide had to make many phone calls to get it straightened out). Cigarettes were also included, but every time I went to get a pack, I was told they weren't - this went on for my whole, ten-day stay. It seems the staff (and even some management) were not informed there are two different types of 'gold' all-inclusive packages. At times, it was quite frustrating!In hindsight, I would not book an all-inclusive package again - there's no incentive to leave the hotel and do things. All-inclusive is convenient but expensive - you have to consume a lot (even at inflated 'hotel' prices) to make it worthwhile.Would I stay at the Grand Mirage again? Sure... but only in a 'room with breakfast'. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":286,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":282}]}
