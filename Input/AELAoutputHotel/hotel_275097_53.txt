{"text":"Great hotel in a great location I booked this hotel for our three night stay in Barcelona partially because of the reviews it received on this site. My husband and I were not disappointed! I had some slight concern about getting a room bordering the atrium\/courtyard because I didn't want to be bothered by the noise some discussed here (there is a basketball court, soccer field and other areas for children to play in this courtyard). I requested a quiet, non-smoking room, and did end up getting a room on the courtyard . When we arrived at the hotel on Friday afternoon, the courtyard was loud with children playing. All activity in the courtyard (soccer, volleyball), ended by 9:30 p.m. that night, making the room VERY quiet for sleeping (which was what was important to me). Activity did start again on Saturday morning around 9:30 a.m., but we managed to sleep in until 11 a.m. anyway! After the Saturday morning activity, there was none for the rest of the weekend, making our room quieter than if we had a room with traffic buzzing below.Our room was exactly as it appeared in the hotel's Web site photos. I was pleased with how well-kept and clean the room was. It also offered nice amenities like bathrobes and a small sewing kit. We took advantage of the hotel's nice business center to use the free Internet. The reception staff was very helpful at check-in\/check-out, with wake up calls, information on bus and metro schedules and sight-seeing ideas.As others have mentioned, the location is great! You can walk to most major attractions, and there are also metro and bus stops nearby, We would definately stay here again!
