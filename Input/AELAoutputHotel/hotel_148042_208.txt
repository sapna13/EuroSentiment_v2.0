{"text":"Great Hotel Experience; OK for a Ritz Carlton We just returned from a 7 day stay at the Ritz Carlton. The hotel property was beautiful in true Ritz style. The entry way was grand and the gardens surrounding the pool area were stunning. The pool itself was a nice size and the temperature of the water hovered around the chilly mark. The beach was nice with plenty of chairs, umbrellas and hammocks. The workers for the pool and beach area were always very helpful with the exception of the waiter staff for serving up drinks. They were in short supply and we frequently went to the outdoor bar ourselves for our drinks. The spa and fitness center were very nice with full days of scheduled workout classes by the hour starting at 7:00am. The biggest disappointment was that several of the rooms on the property did not have balconies. We were told it was due to the close proximity to the airport and the extreme noise from the planes. We heard only muffled sounds from the airport in our room. However, we heard our neighbors kids and conversations quite clearly in the connecting room. The hotel was very accomodating and moved us right away into a new room. At the Ritz, we dined at Il Mulino which we would highly recommend. The food was good and the service was exceptional. We also dined at Mares which was ok but expensive. The service was not very good. We also dined at the 3rd restaurant, a NY Steakhouse, BLT.The food was good, the price was high, and the setting was not nearly as intimate as Il Mulino. We would recommend the restaurants, Pamela in Condado and Tangerine in Isla Verde for dinner. Also, the bar in the San Juan Beach and Sand Hotel called Liquid was a nice roof top venue which overlooked the ocean and beach.
