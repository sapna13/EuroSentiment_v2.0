{"text":"What can I say, it was FANTASTIC We just got back from Iberostar Bavaro, I was with my husband 3 eighteen year old girls, my 23 year old son and his girlfriend.We all had a great time, the hotel is spotless, the landscaping breathtaking, the beach was beautiful clean warm water, swaying palm trees. We never had a problem getting chairs with shade at the beach, you did have to get up by 8 to get a shade unbrella at the pool. Food was great, we all had a touch of upset stomach, but that is natural when eating in a different country.. HINT: squeeze lime on your food, a native told us it settles your stomach when eating food cooked different than you are use too.Staff at hotel very friendly, my ONLY complaint is the Guest Services Desk, not friendly not helpful. Rooms were spotless and very very nice and roomy, we had a beach view, I recomend you ask for one in the 2300 very nice and close to pool and beach... the men complained when you had to wear long pants at night for certain restaurants, it was VERY hot. Drinks were good and plentiful. the girls had a blast at the lobby bar, and the disco, the night time shows were good, some better than others... we did not do any off resort tours it was just toooo hot!! they did do parasailing and banana boats and had fun.I truly recomend this resort and I plan on returning soon hopefully..
