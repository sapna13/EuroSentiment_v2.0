{"text":"This is a hotel which you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l either enjoy very much, or hate. We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe all seen those shows where they kick someone out of their dingy apartment, and over the next 48 hours they give it a major facelift using a lot of imagination, some nifty handiwork, and a somewhat limited budget. That√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ what this hotel is.The bed was very comfortable, the linens and towels very nice. The d√ã√\u2022√ñcor was colorful, - my room, # 303, looked exactly like the picture on their website. It was spacious and reasonably well equipped, with a fridge and safe. Plenty of nice touches included the range of L√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©?ccitaine bathroom supplies and a number snacks in the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢onor bar√à√\u2020\u2022? Free wireless internet is a big plus for me, and they even have a PC in the lobby for guest use.However, for all these upgrades, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ still undeniably a former cheap motel in a neighborhood that had me somewhat nervous when I was searching for some, any, form of retail establishment to get some food. Maybe I just walked in the wrong direction, but it seemed a strange place to build a hotel.Other comments: They have a chauffer service, but it doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ pick up from the airport so that taxi cost me $30 plus tip. They told me over the phone that they would be able to take me to my downtown meeting in the morning, but it turned out my 9am meeting was √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢oo early√à√\u2020\u2022? so I needed another taxi for that. The restaurant was closed due to flooding, √à√\u2020\u2022?but I see it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ been like this a long time. Shame as it would have saved me cruising the neighborhood on foot, and when I booked through Hotwire I was thinking (for 3.5* !) I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° end up with a nice bar\/restaurant to hang out at in the evening. Breakfast in the lobby was down to crumbs by the time I came down.On the plus side, the front desk staff was pleasant and did I mention free wireless internet? Finally, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ impressed that the management is willing to brave these review sites. √à√\u2020\u2022?and I did enjoy my stay and slept very well.I wish the owners luck, we need more imagination and color these days.Whether it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ for you or not depends upon what you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e looking for, and some (including myself) do get directed here unfortunately without a full disclosure of this √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√áoutique-type√à√\u2020\u2022?establishment, √à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√≠ittle wonder one ends up with negative reviews.Ps, you need a new favicon √à√\u2020\u2022?unless you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e using it to promote the Jupiter Hotel in Portland ","annotations":[{"endOffset":581,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":577},{"endOffset":1698,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1694},{"endOffset":1698,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1694},{"endOffset":1698,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1694}]}
