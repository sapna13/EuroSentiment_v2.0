{"text":"Raving Reviews! Loved It! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Intercontinental during our 3 night trip to Puerto Rico Oct. 17th - 20th. We really enjoyed our stay here. It was a quick ride from the airport, costing us about $15 with our luggage, and when we got there, the bell guy who greeted us (Ramon) very warm and friendly. We checked in early and our room was not ready, but they held our bags and encouraged us to walk around and view the facility. The pool area was very nice, and just steps beyond that was the beach. The landscape of the pool area was awesome and the swim up bar was a definite plus. Since we were traveling in the off season, there weren't many people there and so it was easy to get service. All the staff members were extremely friendly, curteous, and professional. I have nothing but the best to say about them. David, the bartender, was the best! He gave us wonderful recommendations for food and was always available with a helping hand. The room was a bit small, but it was functional. The bed was comfortable and we had fresh towels everyday. The only bad thing was the bathtub took so long to drain -- by the end of the shower you'd be standing in 3 of water. The hotel lobby was nice and bright and I enjoyed their casino as well. We won the first night, but gave it all back plus some throughout our stay. I would definitely go back to the intercontinental and would recommend this hotel to anyone. ","annotations":[]}
