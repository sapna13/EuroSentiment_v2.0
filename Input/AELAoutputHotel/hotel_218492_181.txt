{"text":"Resort was Good, a few issues though We just returned From Grand Oasis Bavaro Suites Cameleon. The staff there was excellent. Our room was a Junior suite and was in Building 10, 3rd Floor ( really need to get that elevator built). The Room was clean and comfortable. Our maid did a good job and after a little tip we went from 2 beers in fridge to 6. We ate mostly at the Agua restaurant which is a buffet for breakfast and lunch and then a la carte for dinner. Food was good. We did the Italian restaurant once and it was very good and we did the Tex-Mex once and it was more than adequite. Service was good everywhere on the resort. The food does become a little repetitive by the end of the week but _No_Montezumas Revenge for either of us. Always found more than enough to eat and Variety was OK.We stayed almost all the time at the Adult pool and Nicolas and Nico did a great job making sure that the drinks were never empty.( Thanx guys). We also had a great bunch of Canadian people and 2 couples from Baltimore that also hung there most of the time and made for a fun time at the pool, except for a small European invasion on a couple of occasions. For the most part was a great time at the pool.The entertainment was OK, nothing fantastic, but not bad either. The entertainment staff did a good job trying to get people involved but most of their activities were around the main pool.The beach was great as ussual and the staff did a good job trying to keep up with the sea weed problem. I would like the thank the doorknob that left a broken wine glass on the beach instead of picking it up. The wife found it with her foot and really appreciated the fact that she did not have to swim for 2 days. I would like to thank the Doctor who came down to the beach and tended to her and again the next day in his office.Over all it was a good trip. The building still has a few minor growing pains but nothing to ruin a good holiday, but you have deal with the minor problems. The whole trip was a good value for the $$$ that we spent. The airplane food on the flight there was pitiful. We did appreciate the fact tha Nolitours paid our $10 to get into the country and our $20 to leave. This was our 3rd trip to the Dominican and we would definitely would come back here again.
