{"text":"Beautiful Resort My two friends and and one of their mothers and i stayed at the iberostar dominicana for 6 days. When we got in the hotel we were amazed by its beautiful apperance. The lobby was huge and gorgeous and the ground keepers kept everything so beautiful and clean. We were able to get rooms in the little bungalow village and that was amazing because it felt like we were in a tropical jungle and we were far enough away from all the noise of the resort but still close enough to go to and from the main rooms at night. The food was good, we were nice to Esther the lady that books the dinner reservations and we were able to get 3 different reservations even though we should of only had twp.The buffet food was pretty good, we really only ate the pasta and breaad. The dounuts in the mornings were amazing and the coffee was very good as well.We were always able to find charis at the pool and at the beach and didnt find it to be crowded at all, but many people had left just before we go there so maybe that is why we had such luck.Most of the workers are so friendly and my friends and i were able to make friends with many of them and we knew each other by name. The health bar by the pool is awesome if you want a fresh drink, but the waitress that goes around the pool to bring you drinks isnt fast enough. we waited about 1 hour to receive a drink, it would have been easier just walking to the buffet.Even though our trip was amazing we did have many of the workers making sexual comments to us and following us which we found very inappropriate. Also alot of the workers didnt speak english and if my friends and i didnt speak some spanish we would have had a more difficult time getting from place to place. The resort was a little confusing in the sense that sometimes we would end up at bavaro or punta cana when we wanted to go back to our main hotel. They need to hang signs in front of the different hotels to find out which hotel you are in.I recommened to exchange some money into pesos because the gift shops do not give you back american cnage and they only accept dolalr bills which was aggravating at first because they would give us gum in exchage for american change which we found to be ridiculous. The disco is what you make of it. Many of the wokers from the other resorts came to our disco and danced with many of the tourists. The music was not good at all and many men would come up to my friends and i making rude comments, but we expected that in the club. Overall i had an awesome experience and would go back. As the days went on my friends and i became really good friends with many of the tourists and staff and felt very comfortable. the experience at this resort is what you make of it because everything was included and everyone was there to help you.
