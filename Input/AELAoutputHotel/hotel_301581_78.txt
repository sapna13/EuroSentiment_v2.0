{"text":"wow! excellent stay and benefits although this a belated review, my husand and i stayed there for our 10th anniversary (a little late, but we got there) in 2004. a lovely experience from start to finish. we booked through qantas holidays, and received the club floor upgrade, which, when we looked back at all the extras we recieved, was superb value. check in was efficient. staff gave the air of being well trained and polite. i found them at all times through out stay to be very friendly also.breakfast was in the club room, with no kids, and efficient service with a smaller choice than downstairs (which was tried once for the variety however was too noisy) but still marvellous. lovely coffee and the food was of excellent quality. pastries were superb! what a surprise when we arrived for the afternoon cocktails and canapes! in fact, i still rave about them three years later! veuve cliqot champagne, top shelf spirits and as for canapes, no soggy cheese and biscuits here, there were hot canapes, french cheeses, juices of all varieties, all sorts of cold canapes, beautiful desserts plus more, and well, we certainly gave the champagne a good go! in fact, we only ate out twice at night when we were there, and regretted it as we were so full from the food at the hotel! the room was lovely and we were given a note congratulating us on our anniversary, lovely fruit, and chocolates in wooden boxes (which were superb, i'm a raging chocoholic and i still have the boxes!) each night, along with turndown service of dimmed lights, linen folded down and soft music playing, which was just amazing. plenty of bottled water was supplied each day. the marble bathroom was divine with a fantastic rain shower and excellent toiletries. the location was terrific, having a shopping centre attached to the hotel complexes. visited the vertigo bar next door at swissotel (where i stayed in 2007, see another review) a tip - go during happy hour (singapore people seem to arrive much later) and the bar was crowded with aussies, poms and kiwis. the cocktails while a little expensive are reasonable during happy hour and are fabulous. the view is recommended!.(we also visited raffles for a singapore sling. expensive, but am not sure i thought raffles was any better than where we were) the pool was a welcome retreat in the heat of singapore. quiet when we were there and wonderfully clean.getting taxis was not a problem as they were waved down by staff and we never had to wait more than a very short while. we did not find the location a problem, as singapore is not a very large place and i felt everything was in short reach. chijmes was around the corner and has several terrific eating places and shops there.check out was as check in, with marvellous staff and no problems. they even tried to locate something i wanted to buy, nothing seemed to be any trouble.in short, the best hotel i have ever stayed at in my life. nothing so far has topped it - (but surprisingly the swissotel, whilst not as flashy, is almost as excellent). a lovely ambience, terrific staff, excellent facilities, superb service, terrific location, a very classy well run feel all round.just a joy to stay at.i have told my husband i want to go back!
