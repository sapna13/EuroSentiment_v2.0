{"text":"You cant beat this Hotel!! Ok I have looked far and wide for hotels in Miami and took a chance on this one. It was great for $110 a night. You are close to everything in the Grove, plus ins central so South Beach is 10 minutes away. The rooms were not that big I had a normal king bed in a standard room woth no balcony. However for 20 bucks more a night I could have...Im just cheap.The room service for breakfast was amazing and well worth it. The staff was on top of anything I asked for. You have to have a drink outside by the pool on the 7th floor, its really cool.Dont valet your car! There is a parking garage right next to the hotel (actually connected) its usually 6 bucks for 24 hours...only if there is an attendant then is a 12 buck maximum (1.50 an hour).My suggestion is look around there are lots that charge 5 bucks for 24 hours..use them since the hotel charged 19bucks a night for valet. Oh and here is a trick, if you pay your parking stub from the garage next to the hotel at those automated machines..you have 8 hours to use the stub to get out....get it? I paid $1.50 at the machine and didnt have to use the ticket to leave for another 8 hours saving me a lot!!! Youll see those machine when you drive into the garage.....warning though, on the weekends the garage gets crowded with club hopping nuts..not safe to venture in there alone if your a girl. Just use common sense or ask the concierge to have security escort you which they will do. But the hotel is the only hotel I will use from now on. Book on the sonesta web site, and click on florida resident discount...its cheaper than the pulished rates and they never check..LOL!!
