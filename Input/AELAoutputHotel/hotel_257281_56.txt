{"text":"Bad Experience I had used the Avillion to house myself and company staff (I buy about 5,000 room nights a year), so was happy to take my mother along for a stay on her way overseas.The room we were allocated was unlike any I had stayed in previously. Extremely small, dirty carpets, torn curtain, dusty with drainage problems.Here is an example of how important the front staff are to a hotel - when I called to see if there may a room in line with others I had stayed in on many occassions, the front desk member insisted that all rooms were the same size. I drew to his attention the fllorplan on the back of the door, but he insisted I had not stayed in premier room but a suite (I stay in hotels at least 8 months a year so know the difference).I did receive a call from the Rooms Division Manager who was very upset about it. I did say I would call next time I stayed which I haven't doneUnfortunately as we were trying to sleep, at about 1am there was screaming outside the door by a drunk guest, then a 15 minute struggle with the police resulting in a very disturbed sleep. A cold, substandard breakfast followed the next morning.I detailed this in a hotel survey, but have not received a response. I think the Rooms Division Manager should perhaps become the GM!I have stayed for one night since in a better room, but noticed again stained carpets. ","annotations":[]}
