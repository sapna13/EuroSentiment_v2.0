{"text":"Fab time at the Ritz! Don't listen to the nay sayers about this hotel it's beautiful and worth every penny. The airplanes were no bother to us at all. Could not hear them at all in the room and barely noticed them outside.Before we could check in our kids were asking if we could come back next year.We were greated as soon as we walked into the hotel. We arrived at 1:30 and was taken right to our room. The Bellhop brought our bags up as soon as we were opening the drapes to admire our beautiful view. We change and went to the pool where a nice guy set up our towels and umbrella for us.My husband and kids swam every night as the pool is open for 24 hours! The the way the pool is lit up at night just takes your breath away. I sat outside and lounged on the chairs as many folks did each night.Our room was clean twice each day. Guest Services email me before we arrived and asked if we were celebrating any special occasion while staying with them, I told them my husband's birthday. On our second day there while we were out night swimming, we returned to a lovely dessert feast and a happy birthday card from the Ritz. We felt pampered the entire trip. We live in a beautiful home in NJ and only stay in nice hotels and was happy this one lived up to our standards.That was our best vacation ever!!!
