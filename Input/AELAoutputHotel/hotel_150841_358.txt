{"text":"Couldn't have asked for more!!!! THANK YOU TRIP ADVISOR!We spent days reading and re reading reviews. We decided on this hotel due to the raves of other travelers. It was all that! We spent the first week of March there. Took Apple and as others saidIberostar does it right and so did Apple. Updated room, location, food, entertainment, management..........everyone wanted to please. We took the Trip Advisor's suggestions and sent an email in advance requesting a specific type room. Got it! When we got there we requested and received additional ala carte meals. Got them! Food was everywhere and good. If you didn't like one dish go back\/or ask and get a dozen others. Drinks were fine and their champagne was chilled and very decent quality. The weather, the ocean, the pools, the landscape...........stunning, and especially the wildlife (exotic birds) everywhere! There was always plenty to do and see. We couldn't even imagine the hours and manpower it took to keep this hotel sparkling and it was. Very clean! They were constantly doing repairs, cleaning and maintenance. It seemed like - tell them - and they fixed it. The air went out for a few hours and saw men digging in the dark - sure enough the air was fixed shortly after. We let them know an ice machine was out - one day only. Our ironing board broke, had a new one w\/in hours................ we think they sent someone to the store........and who really wanted to iron anyway. The few things that were not perfect were minor. Instead of king bed, we pushed 2 full size beds together. The toughest part of the trip was a very bad wait at the airport to get thru the USA 3000 line. The airline did a good job w\/ everything but this. We were also confused (and still are) if you can take any liquids at all in your carry on - so at the last minute we threw them all into our checked baggage.The vacationers did dress well. We should have taken a few more nice outfits. There was an air of class w\/ out attitude. We are from the Chicago suburbs and in our 50's-it had an bit of an adult feel and that was great for us. We felt it was good for a number of age groups, but liked the fact that we were not tripping over a lot of children. I read on this site - not to wait for this resort to go on sale...and we didn't. It IS worth every penny and a great value! We did feel this was by far the finest of the 3 hotels - and loved spending time checking out the others. The shops in the complex even had some great values. (Don't forget your cameras- $25 for a disposable).Awesome trip! GO GO GO!We now read these reviews (w\/ a grain of salt) and make our decisionsw\/ the travelers help. We will cont. to make future plans this way - so again Thanks to All for writing!!!! And thank you Apple  Iberostar Bavaro! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1926,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1922}]}
