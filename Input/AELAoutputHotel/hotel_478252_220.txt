{"text":"Trying to keep up with the crowd The resort is huge and there are obvious signs of problems caused by the size of the property and the number of people. When we were checking in (2 adults and 2 kids) the clerk at the reception told us that there are about 5000 people staying at the resort at the time !Obviously the management is failing to keep up with such crowd and there is definite lack of facilities. This was the first resort whenI see people turned down from making reservation at the spa because there were no availability. Our room which was requested in advance to be quite was instead right at the rear end of the theater and there were no way to change it to something quieter because resort was constantly overbooked. If you really into spending vacation at the very busy place then this place might be up to your taste. My wife said about the lobby that it looks more like a Chicago Union Station some years ago with howling noise, smoke everywhere, swarms of people with piles of luggage. But please be warned that this resort is not going to give you promised an expected to 5 or even 4 star service. For example try to enjoy your desert with the coffee or tea at the dinner and you will see that its quite impossible to accomplish.Apperantly, coffee and tee are only served for breakfast and desert is only served for dinner and of course you cant take any food from the buffet to the lobby and you cant take any drink from the lobby to the buffet !? And yeah, try to get some food from the beach snack shop 2 minutes before official opening time evenif the shop is open and some food is already there . Its not allowed by the rules of resort - this phrase was something new to me to hear at the all-inclusive in Dominican.  Other than that, enjoy your vacation, dont mix a lot of mamajuana and sun and use spf50 sun lotion. Last thing, try to avoid first floor - tiny ants are little buggers.
