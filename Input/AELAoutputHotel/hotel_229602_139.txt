{"text":"Great apartment, professional staff We stayed 5 nights at the one-bedroom apt managed by the hotel. The apt's half a block from the hotel on a very quiet street on the ground level. It's lovely decorated with a outdoor patio. Unfortunately, we didn't get much use of the patio due to the weather condition in November. The size was more than adequate and amenities were better than expected with the DVD and CD players. We didn't stay in one of the hotel rooms and therefore unable to comment on the quality of the room. My impression from the lobby was that the d√ã√\u2022√ñcor was a little outdated and didn't look well maintained. I did like the fact that there's a PC\/internet available for guest use.The location of the apt\/hotel was excellent; just one block away from the Tour Eiffel. The neighborhood is mainly residential, quiet and upscale. I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking to stay at a place that's busy and happening. Most of the shops close early in this area. The front desk staff offered adequate service for a 3-star hotel. With that said, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° like to command the hotel staff on their professional and courteous way of handling problems. We encountered a problem with the apt lock upon check-out. One of the keys was stuck in the lock and we were unable to open the door. The hotel manager and staff calmly helped us check out and allowed us to leave for airport. We were told that the deposit would probably have to be forfeited if the hotel incurred costs in fixing the situation. I was not optimistic that I would be able to get much of the deposit back. However, the hotel emailed me after a couple days and let me know the cost was 30 euros. I was relieved to learn that it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a costly problem and the hotel staff handled it promptly and kept us informed. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° go for a hotel if it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ your first time in Paris and prefer to join tours and visit the city in a well-planned out way. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° recommend the apartment to experienced travelers who are adventurous and willing to find their ways around Paris. Staying at the apt is a bit more costly than staying at a hotel but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ all worth it. It was very nice to be able to come back to a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢ome-like√à√\u2020\u2022?environment after being out and about for a long day. ","annotations":[]}
