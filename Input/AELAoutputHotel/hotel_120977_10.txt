{"text":"Beware of Copley House We've just come back home (in Montreal, Canada) from a three-night stay at Copley House, in Boston.This place is in a very nice sector of Boston, close to public transportation and all the major hotels and the business area. First of all, you should know that the pictures on the Copley House website are pretty misleading. Actually, they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e very misleading! We √à√\u2020\u2022?my wife and two kids √à√\u2020\u2022?had booked a one-room unit, which is supposed to be the most luxurious one they have. Ouch! If you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mind the missing paint on the walls, the moldy smell, the dirty carpets, the so-so beds and sofa beds, and the slimy showers (just to name a few √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°eatures√à√\u2020\u2022?, go ahead and ask for unit 100 in the basement of the 239 West Newton Street building... right next to the laundry room!!That being said, when we saw our unit, we asked to be moved and were given two separate rooms for the first night (11  14-year-old kids weren't too happy about sleeping in a different room that their parents, but it was better that being in the basement...), we then had to go back to our smelly basement on the second night, and we were given a nice one-bedroom unit for our third and last night. That√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a lot of moving around for such a short trip! We were in Boston with a few other people who stayed in another building (first floor of St. Stephen Street building), and their rooms were fine.I think I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° go back to the Copley House because of its affordable prices and its tremendous location, but I would ask for specific rooms, i.e. rooms 104 (which has been completely renovated and which is very nice) and room 109 (a one-bedroom unit) in the 239 West Newton Street building. I would also stay away from room 103 (and 100 of course) in this same building.While I wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ too impressed with the Copley House, I must say that the staff were all VERY helpful, understanding and accommodating. I really appreciate what they did to make our stay more enjoyable. Finally, they gave me a substantial rebate, which was also greatly appreciated.
