{"text":"Fantastic stay but let themselves down on breakfast A fantastic modern hotel with extremely friendly and attentive staff. The rooms themselves, although no view from my room at least, as overlooked a certral courtyard \/ roof area (room 242), was lovely with all the mod cons as described. The free DVD \/ CD library and all other little attention to details items in the room were truely fantastic.I ate at the City Cafe restaurant in the evening and although alittle pricey, it was well worth it as the food was superb - liver. I didn't expect the service charge to be automatically added to the bill at 10%, which it was and would have liked the option to give the tip as I felt appropriate. This trend also re added service charge was throughout the hotel even in the bar where I had got my drink from the bar myself! I didn't really mind though if I'm honest as the experience was worth it.My only dissappointment of which I warn others not to get caught out as I did - if there is a queue for the breakfast main area, DO NOT allow staff to direct you to the upstairs alternative dining area. The choice of foods was very minimal and you had to serve yourself - whereas in the main restaurant, it was as you would expect, waiter\/waitress service and comprehensive breakfast menu - complaint gone in today re this.Overall, I would stay again definately as was a lovely hotel.
