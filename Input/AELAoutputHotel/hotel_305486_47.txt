{"text":"Avoid the Golden Landmark. We have just returned from an extremely unacceptable 3 night stay at the Golden Landmark Hotel, Singapore booked through the hotels.com website. On arrival we were warned that there was refurbishment worktaking place on the upper floors, and there would possibly be some noise during the hours of 0900-1800. The hotels.com website statesRenovation Notice. The Executive Club rooms will be undergoing renovations until the end of April 2006. We had booked and paid for a renovated Executive Club room on the upper floors for comfort and relaxation. On entering the room we were welcomed by loud building work noise. This wasn't background noise, it was loud and very close -one floor below I believe. As we had just flown long haul from London we were hoping to rest, but the noise made this totally impossible. We immediately asked Reception for a room change and\/or a refund but were told that only non-renovated standard rooms were available on the lower floors and no refund could be offered as the booking was made via hotels.com. We asked the Duty Manager why the hotel offeredexecutive club rooms to well paying guests, knowing that building work was taking place in close proximity. His only reply was that a lot of guests are sightseeing or out on business during the day. This is obviously not the case for people who are on holiday, have just arrived exhausted after a long haul flight, and are hoping to rest in a quiet and comfortable room during the heat of the day! When pushed, the Duty Manager offered us an alternative day room for use during the day only. Each morning at 0900, tired after being woken by the noise, we had to present ourselves at reception to collect the key and return it again in the evening. The day room was uncomfortable, unclean and stank of cigarette smoke - it was barely used. Our stopover in Singapore was supposed to be a stress free and relaxing holiday, and also incorporated a birthday celebration. The situation at the Golden Landmark completely ruined the experience for us both. When a formal complaint was made to hotels.com they offered us a smallrefund that did not even equate to one nights stay. We advise travellers to avoid the Golden Landmark and the hotels.com website.
