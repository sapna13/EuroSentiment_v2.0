{"text":"Great hotel! We booked this hotel three days prior to our arrival and did not expect it to be such a clean, friendly, upscale property. Our original accommodations fell through and we were frantic trying to find a place that would be comfortable, affordable and in a good location. Based on the many prior reviews, we booked one of the executive suites and were so very happy with the room. You check in at the executive club\/lounge which is so comfortable and quiet and so great after a 14 hour flight. They can answer any and all questions as everyone up there is fluent in English and can provide maps, suggestions for restaurants, etc. All of the executive suites have views of the city as well as huge bathrooms. The sitting area is great for resting after a long day of touring and the wall mounted CD player is an added bonus. Breakfast is served up in the lounge for those in suites but the restaurant has more options including an omlette bar. The workout room is fabulous and you don't even need your iPod because all the cardio machines face the city and the harbour and the views are breathtaking. I found this hotel on many sites but decided to check their website hotel specials and found a rate of about $200 U.S. for the suite incl. breakfast. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel and I have never written a hotel review before but I thought this was such a nice hotel for the price and hopefully someone will benefit from my review.
