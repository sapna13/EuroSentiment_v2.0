{"text":"Great Location, Clean, but look for a deal. My partner and I stayed at the Bellevue for 2 nights. The room was clean and ready at our arrival.The location can't be beaten for the price (if u manage to get a good deal - which we did) - right opposite the canal boat launch as soon as you exit Centraal Station.The only down sides (if you could even go so far as to say that) is that we had no top sheets: just a doona (duvet) and bottom sheet; the rooms are very modern, which also means very minimalistic: no array of toiletries, no coffee maker, no fridge or mini bar....but if you are visiting Amsterdam, you shouldn't be hanging out in your room all day. Also, there is no internet facility in the hotel, though they do have wi-fi, and there is an internet cafe within 50m of the front door.The rooms can be a bit noisy as you can here doors closing from the other side of the hotel on your floor, but the outside noise\/street was minimal from our rear room.The only other thing is the common trend to have a shower with no recess,(at least in the hotels I have stayed at in Amsterdam) which leads to water flowing onto the bathroom floor in some\/a lot of cases, though ours was quite minimal.If it is your first visit to Europe, don't be alarmed at the size of your room: they are ALL small. Experience the country and culture and all it has to offer, not your room.All in all The Bellevue is above par for a moderately priced hotel in Amsterdam, and i would definitely stay there again.
