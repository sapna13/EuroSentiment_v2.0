{"text":"Loved this Hotel We stayed for a week and i could have stayed a lot longer. Location: This was my favorite thing about this hotel. This hotel is ideally located in Old San Juan. It is the only major hotel right in Old San Juan. You can walk to everything in the area so a car isn't necessary. Beware if you do get rent a car, it is $20 per day to park. A car is not necessary unless you travel past San Juan itself. A cab should cost you only around $50 round trip with tip to go to the airport or the new San Juan area. If you are adventurous, take the bus. It is 50 cents and not all that bad on a raining day. Directly outside the hotel is where you can catch the ferry to the Bacardi Factory. the cruise ships dock right in front of the hotel so at times it can be a busy area. When the ships are in there are plenty of street vendors and local foods. Every type of restaurant is available in the area and they are all trendy with good foods and fair prices. Outlet shopping is also available within walking distance. Senor Frogs is literally outside the side door of the casino. Hotel: Casino is great. Friendly staff and the free sandwiches and beverages are delicious. It was clean although it could use some new carpet. The rooms were very clean but very basic. All you need is in the room but if you are looking for luxury, try a hotel in New San Juan. Some rooms have a water view. The rooftop pool is small but clean, comfortable, quiet and a view to kill for. Room Service was great. Food was very good. A decent amount of channels on the tv. Staff very attentive. FYI this is a non-smoking hotel. You cannot smoke anywhere, even the casino. Puerto Rico in general is smoke free. A couple of disappointments was there was no bar or a hotel shop, if you should need buy something such as toothpaste, toothbrush, etc. in a pinch. There is a walgreens in the area. There is no beach so if you are going there for the beach, you have to drive. I will definitely be going back and staying at the Sheraton.
