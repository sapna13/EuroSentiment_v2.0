{"text":"Don't do it!!! If you are planning to visit this Resort, DON'T DO IT, GET YOUR MONEY BACK NOW or change resorts.My husband and I are not high maintenance. We arrived this resort, Saturday, 7 July. We paid way too much money for this (all inclusive) trip, at over $1500 each, we expected better service. Upon arrival, we go to our room (VIP suite), the bedpost was broken at the head of the bed. We called 5 times before someone came to see about it, then he began fixing the door to our patio which nothing was wrong with. He didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ understand what the front desk told him because they obviously didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ√à√\u2020\u2022?understand us, but they said they understood our complaint. We called the front desk again to ask them why the person is fixing the door when we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ call about a door. Eventually, after us doing sign language and showing him the problem, he then turned his attention to the bed. After which he called for help because he could not fix it. Beds were very uncomfortable for your back, like as slab of wood with awful pillows. Bed dressing was awful. The table in the room was full of ants, we asked to exterminate the room, no one did anything about that. The phone didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ work in the bedroom, we had to run in the bathroom to answer or make calls, no one responded to this complaint. The towels are dingy and no one should ever use them or put on the dingy bathrobes hanging in the closet, which were suppose to be luxurious . Out of all the people working there, 1 or 2 could understand our needs and we had the hardest time getting the simplest questions answered or problems solved. We continuously called about the TV which had very few channels and it took them until Wednesday to come and load the channels. There was a broken tile in our room, it had been cemented back to the floor but this was just tacky. The maids never really cleaned, they just tidied up. The toilet and tub was not fully cleaned the entire time we were there. We asked for another suite and they refused us that. I wish there was a way to recoup some of our money back. I will not ever refer anyone to that resort. It was nothing we could do about it, so we sucked it up and made the best of it. The food was OK, activities are great and the pools and beaches are fun. We wanted all around service and we did not get it. We understand this is a poor country, but it was very expensive for what we got. Be sure to bring what you need because if you buy anything out of the shops, everything is overpriced. Be careful when you go shopping off the resort because the vendors think all visitors are rich and they remove the prices from the merchandise and then tell you to get everything you want and they will give you a good price. BEWARE, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOU ARE GETTING A DEAL, BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRICE IS. ","annotations":[]}
