{"text":"Melia Benoa-Fantasic My wife and i stayed at the Melia Benoa for the final part of our Honeymoon. When we arrived we were greeted by the staff with neck flowers and drinks. We had previously emailed the hotel asking for a possible upgrade as we were on honeymoon. We never heard anything back from them but as we checked in the staff congratulated us and presented us with a gift and upgraded us to the Gold Package which included an upgrade to the executive suite. The staff were extremely polite,courteous and friendly no matter what time of day or night and they really couldnt do enough for us. The food in any of the 3 seperate restauraunts was outstanding with theme nights on the beach front every other night. As this is an all inclusive resort there is no need to worry about anything but if you wish to spend some money on small gifts there are a selection of small shops located within the Hotel Complex. Entertainment is provided throughout the day and a caberet show happens twice a week, there is also a house band that will walk around in the evening asking for your requests which they will then sing for you. The beach is not from the set of a Bounty Advert but it is still a beach!! One tip would be to get to the sunloungers on the beach early (when you go down for breakfast) because they most saught after loungers go very quickly. Overall this was a perfect place to finish off what was allready a perfect honeymoon for us. Would i recommend it Yes ","annotations":[]}
