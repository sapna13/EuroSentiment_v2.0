{"text":"Distance from pool annoying We had been to Bali about 10 times, and were looking for a change when we chose the Padma. Previously we had stayed at the Santika in Tuban, among others.After being assured by our travel agent that we had booked a poolside ground floor room we were annoyed to find our third-floor room was 485 metres from the pool. We soon learnt not to forget anything as the return trip from the pool to our room was nearly 1 km! Of course, that is more a complaint about the travel agent's advice than against the hotel.The pool was crowded, and there were insufficient sun lounges - although top marks to the pool staff who responded promptly to guest complaints that people had placed towels on the lounges before setting off for a day's shopping. The indignant lip-trembling that went on when they returned after four or so hours to find their reserved lounges were occupied had to be seen to be believed!As always in Bali, the staff were superb. The deluxe room was fine and well serviced, but there was no view worth looking at, and the balcony wasn't worth having. Breakfast was served in a great barn of a room that was absoluely packed. If you sit at an outer table, nearby smokers can be irritating, but it's not a major issue. Breakfast was great value, but definitely not an intimate experience!I agree with other comments that the hotel is very well located vis a vis restaurants, money changers etc.This is a large property with a bit of distance between its various facilities. Don't go there if you want the traditional Balinese experience. If you are set on the place, the garden villas are much better located than the hotel-style rooms.We have tried quite a few properties in Bali across the whole range and now know that we prefer the smaller, more intimate hotels such as the Santika. However, we spoke to other guests who had stayed at the Padma many times before, and they loved the place. ","annotations":[]}
