{"text":"Amazing Amstel Visitors often have an advantage over the local residents, for they get to try some of the best hotels in any given area; locals tend not to stay in local hotels for obvious reasons; we live here.But last weekend my partner and I decided to stay at Amsterdam√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Grande Dame Hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?the Amstel Hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?in which we have eaten and drunk many times over the years, for it is close to our Amsterdam apartment. Staying as a guest was just amazing; very sumptuous, great service √à√\u2020\u2022?almost regal but never stuffy! Luggage was whisked straight from our car to the room √à√\u2020\u2022?and we had a beautiful view of the River Amstel below √à√\u2020\u2022?while we supped champagne cocktails in the bar. Check in was very civilized and the receptionist accompanied us to our room, and explained the usual workings.The room was excellent; good strong Wi-Fi, the most sumptuous towels ever seen; wonderful rain shower we did not want to get out of; impressive lighting and a wonderful view. Also very quiet.We ate in the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ 1 Michelin star Restaurant La Rive, and it was delightful; the sommelier is excellent in our view and not only knows his wines, but he enthuses over them. His recommendations were spot on! The food was delicious, and it was good to see that the fish course came in small and large portions, so you could easily have a fish course (which we did!); only the souffl√ã√\u2022√ñ disappointed a little as it was more mousse than souffl√ã√\u2022√ñ we thought.Breakfast is choice of a buffet or full English √à√\u2020\u2022?though after dinner the previous night, we were hard pushed to eat very much. Complimentary newspapers were also available.Check-out was a very civilized 12.00 noon; plenty time to chill and pack to leave.The Amstel Hotel is well situated; trams are close by and the taxis arrive promptly, and the hotel just oozes ambiance and luxury. This was unlikely to be our last visit to our local favourite hotel!!
