{"text":"Unbelievably beautiful I spent just over a week at the Ayodya Palace with my wife for our honeymoon and it was a fantastic week from every aspect. Also, due to a misunderstanding with our travel agent -which was resolved in a matter of minutes- we were initially checked in at the standard Ayodya, not the Palace, so I had the opportunity to see both types of rooms and compare. I must say both hotels are beautiful but it is definitely worth paying something extra to upgrade to a room at the Palace. In addition to everything else you get a more luxurious room and the chance to use the Palace's private pool where refreshments and snaks are served all day free of charge. You also get to have breakfast at the private pool which is pretty cool, plus the Palace is the closest you'll ever get to the beach. It even features a private Spa, just for Palace guests, although due to our excursions at the island we never had time to try it. Besides the palace, the whole setting at the Ayodya resort is magnificent, with a huge lagoon and a traditional Indonesian theatre in the middle, where there were shows almost every night, a masive pool and fantastic restaurants, all within the resort. We also had a chance to arrange for a private romantic dinner at the beach the last night. The entrance to the resort, with its massive fountain lakes and stone dragons, and the huge lobby is very very impressive, and the staff are very polite and friendly. Another plus is that the Bali Collection, a beautiful shopping and dining complex at the Nusa Dua area, is only 10 minutes' walk from the resort which makes for a very pleasant evening walk. I haven't seen the other hotels at Nusa Dua but I would definitely recommend this one, especially the Palace.
