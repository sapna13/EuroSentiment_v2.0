{"text":"Great all-around We didn't want to leave.I chose this resort and surprised my wife with the destination. I was meticulous in my search and read a host of reviews from this site, travel coordinators and brochures. I felt it was risky to go to the Dominican Republic over a standard resort vacation, say to Jamaica. But I wanted something different with equal quality. My wife was ecstatic to find out before boarding the plane that we were heading to the DR, and throughout the ensuing week, our expectations were met and exceeded. The rideIt was bumpy but bearable. If you have motion sickness, take some medicine, as the infrastructure suffers from formidable potholes and the shuttle chauffeurs suffer from lack of steady driving technique. But it's a chance to enjoy a beautiful, lush countryside, so not so bad.ArrivalThe Excellence Club is worth the extra money, I'd say. You have private check-in and access to a snack bar that is nearly always filled with fruit and other delectable dishes. The staff greets you with smiles and cool towels that makes the road trip all worth it. The Club also has internet connection, a lounge, and a waiter who is always floating around to supply you with drinks or espresso for your coffee or almost anything you'd need.The eatsWe loved them. Take advantage of every course (get your money's worth). Agave and Chez Isabelle were probably our favorites. The buffet breakfast at Toscano was more than you need and pretty tasty. The salads and fruits were always fresh. The wine tasted magnificent. The service was impeccable--every waiter we had seemed so eager to serve.The poolUmm...amazing. The main pool is huge and resembles a lazy river. It has a swim-up bar with helpful bartenders. The landscaping, sunbathing spots, and overall atmosphere of the place made it paradise. The shoreThe first 3-4 days boasted beautiful, calm water in a secluded cove dotted by palm trees. We were able to wade deep into the water. But the latter half of our stay wasn't so sublime. The wind and waves picked up and many beach-goers were stuck to the sand, as hotel staff called waders in from the water. Other than that, it is still beautiful, but if you are dead-set on swimming, this shore may be a risk you don't want to take as it is not typically calm (according to locals and many of the prior reviews).Mint for pillow?Room service was slow, but terribly friendly and often the food was great in quality. Breakfast was good one day but not the next. The pizza is thin but flavorful. The desserts are good, according to my wife. We got room service every night (because we could). But don't harbor great expectations in this area.ExtrasThe mini-bar in the room is always stocked with coke, beer, etc. and you can make special requests. The jacuzzi in the room is sweet. The whole room is just really nice. Not elegant...just really nice, and unique. It is comfortable...bed slightly hard but very comfortable. We had the oceanview junior suite, which overlooked both pool and ocean. It was pretty much heavenly.The shows were good, but we didn't see many of them. The ambience at night was romantic and we enjoyed just taking walks. The spa massage was good...pretty standard back massage, I think. The spa area is really nice and they have many options.OverallThis is a great resort. It was fun and relaxing and had everything we could want. Now I have a new picture in my mind to associate with paradise. My wife speaks fluent Spanish, which made coordination\/communication more smooth, but speaking the language is by no means necessary.Those at the resort I talked to who had been to Sandals resorts said they enjoyed this one more. I came away very satisfied with my decision, and my wife loved it, which accomplished my main goal.
