{"text":"Great hotal Stayed 3 nights in June. I`ve just re read the previous reviews and rather than re write it all I will just say that I agree with them.You`ve probably decided to book by now so instaed of a review here are a few tips. On leaving Anton Martin Metro ( an unlimited toursit pass for 3 days is 9.5 euros and covers trips to the airport , a must) walk downhill on the right and look out for the hostal, its not far and we walked past it .The area may appear a little grubby but its really ok and nothing to worry about . There are some tappas bars over the road down a side street called Fuker street ( thats correct) most were fine but 2 bars took advantage charging way over the odds for 2 wines ( going rate was 2 euros but these bars charged 8 and 10 ) . Some push raciones ( big plates of food) although the tapas are free. Strangely, better tappas bars a short walk away towards the city centre.Basic toiletries and towels are provided so need need to pack these if on a short stay .Off licence a few doors up for cold drinks and there was no fridge in the room .TV. If you press anoulougue on the remote insted of digital you find english speaking CNN, I figured this out on the last day !Our room was double glazed so dont worry about the noise. On the last day we found cable cars to a small theme park in Madrid , if this is your thing google before you go or when there like I did thanks to the free wi- fi . Happy Days.
