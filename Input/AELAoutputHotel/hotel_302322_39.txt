{"text":"Could be good, but some issues Situated in Hung Hom on Kowloon, so a bit out of things. Bit of a pain in the evening; have to get a taxi into the main Kowloon area, or ferries to HK Island. Be aware that harbour view rooms have a harbour view, but not a view of the city. Hotel courtesy shuttle service was unreliable (if the bus was full, not another for 30 mins or an hour) so my advice is don't rely on it. Taxis are relatively cheap but take a dual language hotel card, there are lots more mainland Chinese there these days, and they speak little or no English.Rooms are pretty good, but we didn't have hot water for 2 days, and the second day had gritty brown water instead. Hotel apologised but no compensation offered. Considering we had 2 harbour view rooms this was unacceptable, and spoiled an otherwise Ok visit. Just highlighted the overall view on customer service: apologies but no real action or focus on the customer.Hotel food was generally good. Evening buffet was expensive but good and breakfast buffet is the usual international style buffet. Perfectly adequate, just make sure you don't pay a lot for it.Views from the roof top pool are sensational, worth a visit to see them.Beware of prices for electronics etc.; we did some research online whilst there and found we could get SLR cameras and equipment much cheaper in the UK than in HK.HK generally - found that since my last trip 10 years ago, language has become a problem; far fewer people spoke English, guess its the influx of mainland Chinese. Particularly bad on the local buses, and one driver in particular just simply ignored us. Also didn't feel safe there this time, especially in Aberdeen, so not sure I'd go again. Didn't help that my son's PSP was stolen out of his hand luggage at HK airport. Singapore feels a lot safer and is much easier to get around, so we'd stick to there as a stopover point in future.
