{"text":"Very nice hotel I just returned from an eight day stay at this great hotel and I would highly recommend it. However, before you go to this hotel (and Oahu in general) be sure that it is what you are looking for. Oahu is much more commecial than the rest of Hawaii, but in my case that was the major advantage. I took my 9 year old daughter to Oahu and we were never at a loss for things to do. Waikiki Beach is great, there are great snorkeling beaches nearby, and at night we had a blast just wandering around downtown Waikiki. Be sure and set aside a couple of days to visit less populated (and very beautiful) parts of the island and to visit Pearl Harbor. We rented a car for half of our trip and that is proabably about the right amount of time - while you are lounging at Waikiki there is no point in paying for a car (and for $20 per day parking). At check-in, we were convinced to upgrade to an ocean-view room (a bit more hard-sell than I would have preferred, admittedly), but I am very glad that we did. If you stay at this hotel, be sure and request the front tower (the back tower is a bit further from the ocean) and an upgrade to an ocean view room. I would not recommend eating breakfast at this hotel. There are tons of places nearby and the buffet in the hotel restaurant is very pricey (for example, Duke's breakfast buffet down the street is much better, is located on the beach, and is about half the price....there is also a McDonalds a block away that my daughter wanted to eat at a couple of mornings). Save your money for a nice dinner (there are two nice restaurants for dinner here and many nice restaurants within walking distance). If you are on a honeymoom or such, this may not be the hotel for you. It is a very large hotel with lots of guests, but I have to say for the size Marriott does a great job of making the hotel seem inviting. It is quiet, clean,and we never had to wait long for an elevator. The pools so seem a bit small for a hotel this size, but even that makes sense considering we spent very little time at the pool since Waikiki Beach was across the street. One negative for me was the quality of the room service. I tried it a couple of times and I don't think it is on par with the quality of other Marriott's room service; however, considering there are many dining options nearby that is not a major issue. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel.
