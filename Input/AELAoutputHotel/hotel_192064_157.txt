{"text":"I'll Be Back Again! I love this hotel. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ above my budget, but in a year√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ time I hope to be back for another short stay. I felt so pampered while I stayed there.The management and staff are bursting with pride in their facility, and it shows. The place is immaculate. Everything that can be polished, has a high sheen. The rooms have everything that a hotel guest can be anticipated to need. In my room, everything worked well, from plumbing to air conditioning to lights. (I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ tell you the number of times I have stayed in a hotel and found light bulbs out, or balky A\/C.) When I had a bit of trouble with the in-room safe, I called for assistance, the engineer came within 5 minutes, and in another minute the safe was working. The guest toiletries were worthy of a spa and were renewed daily. The bed had the perfect balance of cushiness and firm support. The restaurant employs highly competent cooks who turn out perfect meals, and wait staff who ensure you are happy with your meal. There is Internet connectivity in the guest rooms. For those traveling without laptops, the hotel has a high-speed Ibahn Internet portal. If you don't use all the Internet minutes on the Ibahn card, you can expend the remaining minutes in the next 12 months. I expended mine at an airport hotel later in my journey.I found the staff had a highly-developed service ethic. Any help I needed, I only had to ask. I was astonished to be able to have my room by 9:30 AM, although I had assured them I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect a room to be available at such an early hour. (My good luck. No one should expect that.) Even before my arrival, the concierges had patiently corresponded with me by email to find a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√\u2020ood√à√\u2020\u2022?seat at a West End play, and they endured my fickleness with absolute courtesy. (√à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬£o, that seat is behind a pillar. No, that one is near the end of the row and has a poor view. No, I want the Royal Circle.√à√\u2020\u2022? In the end they booked me a great seat. They booked my pick-up and transport from the airport. To my surprise, they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ send me a Black Cab, but a chauffeured Mercedes, for only a few pounds more. After clearing immigration and baggage claim, I presented to the arrivals area. Although I was a half hour late, the driver was waiting for me, holding up a sign-board with my name on it. What a welcome sight for an exhausted traveler at 5:30 AM. That same excellent driver was available later to take me to my play and whisk me back to the hotel afterward. The concierges helped me to locate specific stores on a street map and gave me clear directions that made it easy to accomplish my shopping. Each time I returned, shopping bags in hand, they asked me if I had found everything. At all times during my stay, I was treated like a VIP.As a lone female traveler, I felt extremely safe at this hotel in the lovely Mayfair district. It is only a 5-minute walk from Green Park tube station, convenient to any number of Central London shopping areas, and within walking distance of some theatres.In summary, yes, the prices in Mayfair are high, but you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l receive value and service for your money at this hotel. In the past, at other hotels, I have paid more and received far less. If you are a female traveler coming alone to London and want to treat yourself, do shopping and take in a play, I highly recommend you book at the Chesterfield Mayfair. ","annotations":[]}
