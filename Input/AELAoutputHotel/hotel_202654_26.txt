{"text":"great city great hotel This was a lovely hotel which was very clean and welcoming.Rooms were spotless and modern and had a kettle hairdryer, tv, mini bar, 2 easy chairs and a desk\/dressing table. The mini bar price was very cheap for a 4* hotel. 70cl bottle of wine was only 11 euros. Beds were extremely comfortable. perhaps some nice toiletires would have improved it even more. They only offered the usual body wash\/shampoo and a tablet of soap.Breakfast offered loads of choice. A small sample of what was on offer was cereal, fresh fruit, every kind of bread\/roll imagineable, cold meats and cheeses, smoked salmon, eggs. bacon, sausage, strudels and pastries. One of the best hotel breakfasts that we have experienced. We got it included in our package price which by the way was only 70 Euros per room per night for bed and breakfast (early bird offer from hotel itself)The lobby area is small but impressive as it is open all the way to the top of the hotel (6 floors) and the rooms are off a gallery landing around it. The bar is in this lobby area and be warned is only open from 6pm onwards. Complimentary coffee seemed to be available in this area from breakfast time onwards but was never there when we arrived back from a day of sightseeing. Reception staff were exxtremely helpful and efficient. they soon brought us extra pillows and a towelling bathrobe on request.The wellness area is welcome at the end of a day of walking the city although not as impressive as it looks on the pics. It has a sauna and steam room but the inviting lookin jacuzzi is in fact a freezing cold plunge pool. This area was mixed so dont be suprised to find naked men and ladies around.The location is great. we transferred from schonefeld airport by s and u bahn within an hour. We also then walked to many major attractions from here such as the brandenburg gate checkpoint charlie, parliament buildings, berlin dom. There are bars and restaurants within a 5 min walk. Reception staff will direct you. We ate at the indian immediately over the road on our first night due to apalling weather and had a wonderful meal.We would definately return to this hotel again and recommend it to anyone.
