{"text":"Best Hotel Ever We stayed here as the first part of our honeymoon (a stop off on the way to Australia). We arrived feeling a little dejected as the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬Æorlds√à√\u2020\u2022?favourite airline√à√\u2020\u2022?managed to lose our luggage for what turned out to be our whole 3 day stay. We were very impressed with the reception area and when we were booking in we were then asked if we would like to upgrade our room (it worked out at about √ä√£¬¢30 per night extra). I thought I was getting the usual spiel but I was that fed up, I accepted. All I can say it is the best √ä√£¬¢30 per night extra I have EVER spent. We were given a large suite, rose petals on the bed in the shape of a heart, cake, Chinese tea, the full works. When the hotel found out about our luggage situation we were given a complimentary clean T Shirt and a wash bag. The upgrade also gave up membership to the Horizon Club. This was a private members area on the top floor. Complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea, internet access and phone use (essential for us at the time) and a huge lounge. Imagine a business class lounge at an airport and you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e almost there.We ate at the Line restaurant. Very stylish and excellent food (and value). We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ use the pool but it did look very good.This mush have been the most friendly and efficient hotel I have ever stayed in and wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hesitate to recommend it to anyone ","annotations":[{"endOffset":679,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":675},{"endOffset":688,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":681},{"endOffset":692,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":689},{"endOffset":878,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":874},{"endOffset":968,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":965}]}
