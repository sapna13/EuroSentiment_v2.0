{"text":"Paradise We stayed at the Melia Bali Garden Villas for our honeymoon in 2006. After a very long and tiring flight, we arrived to this beautiful hotel.Check in was very fast and efficient and we were shown to villa no. 7(Nakula) . WOW!!! We had our own plunge pool and stunning garden - which is completely secluded. Staying in the villas gives you many perks e.g. own private area on beach, separate breakfast room, choice of bedlinen every night and fresh fruit\/ pastries\/chocolates left everyday. Inside your private villa area as well as your pool, you get an outdoor eating area, a massage bed, a relax area with a large chess set, 2 very large sunlougers and parasol, secluded shower and a fish pond with Koi carp. Inside you have a kingsize four poster bed, entertainment system with 28 inch tv, stereo system and DVD player and a desk area with your own personalised stationery. Then you have his and hers walk in wardrobes complete with free robes, slippers, sarongs, hats and handbag. Your fridge is stocked with drinks and snacks. Next is the large wet room, big enough for 4 people, next to that is a large sunken bathtub big enough for 2 and then a large sink area with 2 sinks and storage.All restaurants serve fantastic food - we especially liked the Italian and the Chinese. The service was always excellent.We hired a taxi for the day and was taken to traditional villages to look at different art galleries. We then went to Mount Batur - quite breathtaking. We had lunch here overlooking the volcano.Our last trip was to a tailors where we had various items of clothing handmade. Two leather jackets for √ä√£¬¢50.One evening we went to Kuta where you can buy anything from a picture frame to a Versace bag - the shopping is fantastic - plenty of places to eat and drink too.This is by far the best holiday we have ever had and plan to return (hopefully) in the next 3 years (need to save a lot of money - especially if you want a villa).
