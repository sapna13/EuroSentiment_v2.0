{"text":"Just loved it !!! My husband and I booked the Montecarlo on the basis of its ranking on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. The hotel turned out to be far more attractive then it appeared on the photos and it was bliss right from the moment that the doorman\/security guy nods his discreet welcome. We were given a room overlooking the Ramblas with our own private balcony. It turned out to be incredibly quiet because of the thoughtfully installed double doors. The bathroom was luxury itself, with an enormous jacuzzi (read small swimming pool), bathrobes, slippers and all the modcons you could wish for. The beds were great for resting after a long day because they could be raised to a seating position or to drain your legs. The staff were incredibly polite and friendly. Quique in particular gave us excellent restaurant recommendations and was very welcoming with a wicked sense of humour. The hotel is perfectly located on the Ramblas (we could people watch from our balcony), close to the Plaza de Catalunya and great for nightlife in the Barri Gotic. Barcelona is culture, culture, culture bursting with museums and incredible gothic, modernista and contemporary architecture. Don't miss the MNAC (museum of Catalunyian art) and its wonderful restaurant with a view called Oleum. The hop-on buses are an excellent way to get to all the top cultural sites. It is worth booking a ticket for two days rather than one. Thank you to all the past reviewers of this hotel for pointing us in the direction of the best hotel possible! It really made our holiday!!
