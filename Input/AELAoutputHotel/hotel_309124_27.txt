{"text":"Huge roomy great facilities but impersonal  We stayed 15 nights at jayakarta in the private residence.We booked private ones thru the interent so they are not hotel owned. We had heard that these apartments are far more superior to the hotel owned rooms and the rumours were true.We could not at all fault the apartments. They are beautiful, very well set out, completely furnished with very comfy leather lounge, and beds and pillows were the best. The kitchen was fully kitted out with all you could need. The fridge is a good size with freezer and a water dispenser is in each kitchen and the cleaner will replace with a new bottle when it becomes low. Each room had its own individual controlled aircond so you could set your own temp and they worked perfectly.There is really not any views to anywhere from your balcony but it was good to have a balcony to sit on in evenings and early mornings and to hang wet things on.!!The residence block is apart from the hotel blocks of rooms. The whole complex is huge and sprawling and that was my only complaint.It is just too big. The residence is at the beginning of the hotel near entrance and then the other hotel room blocks are down closer to the pool in vaious different postions. The residence is a LONG way \/ walk to the pool and most days in the heat none of us could be bothered with the walk once you had come in from shopping or day trips.We used the pool 4 days out of 15 and each time there was absolutely NO pool service. Not once did I see any wait\/persons going around ordering or delivering food or drinks and that is around all 3 pools. That was very disappoiinting. There is a hut you can go into for massages but I didnt use it as i was usually watching kids swimming. We ate at the hotel for breadkfast twice and it is very expensive and the variety not great. There was only 1 choice of cereal and it looked like cornflakes but did not taste like them. No kids cereal choices at all. There was an egg man to make you what you desired, but no pancake cook. There were ready made pancakes and the usual array of hot foods and toast, breads, danish etc. The restaurant at nights was mostly deserted but there are so many good ones nearby that i imagine you would be crazy to pay hotel prices when a 3 min walk will get you to plenty of other eating places.The pools were very clean and well maintained and the location is perfect for all the beach side restaurants and many others. s all in all I would have to say only average with nothing really to get you exited and yearning for a return visit. Whilst I wasnt hugely disappointed ( as the rooms made up for any negatives)I wasnt satisfied with my choice either and I would not choose to stay again. I do prefer somewehere with a good pool service and more personal touches.
