{"text":"Decent hotel, not great This review is an american take on the place...Rooms: -smelled disguistingly like cigarette smoke, we brought a candle but only disguised the stink.-sheets were scratchy, we had to double up the sheets from the other bed. The pillows were thin too. the whole room decor outdated.-they did clean the room eveyday ($2 tip each day)-we had to call for more water, beer everytime we ran out, they would not just replace it. ($1 tip each time everyday)-the maid annoyingly turned off all the power in the room so we had to reset the clock each day (annoying)-shower had very low water pressure-safe was hard to closeGrounds:-beautifully maintained, great piece of property...the beach was the BEST beach of any other hotel within a mile either way of the resort. This is the selling point.-all the bars are sort of outdoor and the whole entertainment area is outdated and in need of sprucing up with paint and such.Bars and food:-Outside of your room, where you only get a couple bottled beers a day in your fridge, they only serve tap beer in small little glasses. Its kinda gross aftertasting noname beer too. That was a huge disappointment...I was looking forward to Presidente beer in a bottle. The mixed cocktails were gross too, the pina colata was too sweet and not really frozen along with all the other mied drinks. They did have Stolii vodka and Johnie Walker which we did drink with club soda.Food: gross by american standards. Although the omelettes were really good. The Europeans seemed to like the food but its just not up to snuff with american standards. We went to the caribe grill at the Macao hotel next door for dinner twice and it was marginally a step up, but not by much. The italian was gross, steakhouse gross, but probably better than buffet. They served disgusting wine in beer pitchers so you knew it was bad wine.Service:very good, nice people in domincan republic. We tipped the waiters couple bucks for a dinner meal and noticed europeans don't tip really.Entertainment:Mostly in Spanish but we got used to it, very good dancing.Guests:-Mostly non english speaking europeans. They came from all over: Poland, a lot of germans, english, spainish. They were topless on the beach and every single one of them smokes, its really disguisting. In fact, at the stage watching shows, we couldn't breathe all 1000 of the guests were lit up.-Europeans were a little pushy in the buffet, it was annoying, like they were used to the idea of it and the food was gonna run out. The beauty of the euros was that they didn't bother to talk to you, it was actually a good thing, you could truly relax.Overall:I would not go back but people there did love it.Americans expect better though.3\/5 stars ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1417,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1413},{"endOffset":1417,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1413},{"endOffset":1417,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1413},{"endOffset":1885,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1881}]}
