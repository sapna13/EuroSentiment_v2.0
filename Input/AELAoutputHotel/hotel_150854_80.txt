{"text":"Great hotel (picked bad weeks - Spring break!) Hi, Booked 2 weeks starting 3 March 08 for Myself and Girlfriend.Had been to Riu before on North of Island and fancied a similar experience but new surroundings so booked in for Macao. Hotel was Excellent throughout. Very Friendly staff whevever we went, Hotel was simply laid out and access to bars restaurants easy during day and night. We Tried speciality restaurant once but was really just same food as from buffet so we ate there for rest of Holiday, which was only food let down. Lots of different food on offer everyday and lots of fresh fruit and salad which was always well prepared. Waiters very attentive and constant supply of water wine and beer on tap! Only BIG dissappointment was we didnt know it was Canadian Spring Break when we went and if we had known would have changed holiday dates. Our first few days were lovely, mainly couples and small groups enjoying peace and quiet but then loads and loads of Large Parties of Canadians turned up and took over pretty much everything at full volume for rest of break. There were lots of nationalites there, Spanish, German English mainly but Mainly Canadians. The bigger the group the louder and many had a small army of young children which turned restaurants and pool areas into a bit of Childrens Camp, lots of sreaming, shouting, kids charging round and then Very Loud Canadians shouting at kids. We ( along with others I noticed) had to often move along beach or bar areas just to hold conversation between ourselves as When Candadians get going about how much money they have, how many dirt bikes they own or how big there Yacht is, everyone within a 50m radius gets to hear too! If you are a couple looking for a beatiful hotel, great rooms, fantastic Beach and attentive staff this hotel is definately the place to go, but Please check your Dates to avoid dissapointment when you get there.
