{"text":"A room with a view to die for.....! My husband, son and myself arrived expecting the very best-we were not disappointed. This hotel was chosen carefully for the reviews, situation, room views of Hong Kong island and proximity to shops and cultural visits. The rooms-even whilst having a bath, you can look right at over the Hong Kong skyline! I cannot describe how hypnoptic and compelling this view was-day and night-we left the curtains open all the time! I have never slept in a more comfortable bed and the room was well equipped and serviced. We ate breakfast-huge and varied array for all tastes, cultures-worth being adventurous! The hotel is perfectly situated-shopping mall attached, transport networks 2\/3 minutes away, local 7\/11 stores for wines (expensive in comparison to GB, beers etc-hotel prices high as you would expect). There are loads of places to eat nearby. Even in the Mall there is good local cuisine and very cheap.The hotel staff were all very polite, helpful-we asked for a change of room as our son had got an even better view-no problems-done next day. The elevator girls are delightful in their pink costumes. The roof top pool-views-what can I say! The spa is so clean, relaxing and fully equipped-all needs pampered. Imagine a Gym overlooking Hong Kong-42nd floor-treadmills are never this exciting in GB!We had no delays check-in or out. All very efficient-excellent. We all agreed that this was an amazing hotel and it made the holiday. We are not always so impressed-would go back tomorrow-alas another year of saving up to go on holiday!! ENJOY-we did!
