{"text":"Great Location I ended up staying at the Le Meriden because my first choice, a private resident near the Central Station immediately turned out to be a bad choice: The private residence I had originally booked was smaller than advertised, on the busiest and nosiest street in Barcelona (and lacking the double pane noise proof windows you normally find in Paris) and the internet did not work. I packed my bags and left for a more expensive but rewarding hotel stay at Le Meriden. For the average traveler Le Meriden Barcelona is an EXPENSIVE hotel at lowest $350 average per night. But the location is a gem. Close to public transportation (the Catalunya railway and metro stations are but a 100 meters from the hotel) and right at the doorstep of La Rambla, a long series of streets that lead from city central down to the harbor filled with restaurants and shops and entertainment venues. La Rambla is a wonderful place to people watch as city workers and locals mix with tourists. The building itself has the reserved modernist style of its 1950s origins but the interior is composed of that unique Barcelona strain of decoration that includes ultra modern furnishings with Catalan colors and styles with a retro sense of history.  My room was large with a wonderful bed and everything was very clean and professionally prepared for my arrival. Internet in the business center and for laptops was free, a great find as most European hotels charge extra for internet access. The staff was friendly and professional.  Because of the central location to art museums and tourist attractions, La Rambla, the harbor and subways and buses this is a highly recommended hotel. ","annotations":[]}
