{"text":"Poor Service I booked an Executive Suite for my recent trip to Sydney as I was quite happy with the room and service when I first visited last year. Unfortunately, my recent stay contradicted my experience in the hotel the year before. First of all, I was made to wait for my room until 2:20pm (check-in is at 2pm) because there was a problem with key cutter, and when I finally got into my room I was a little put off by the muggy stench of the room. I went straight to the balcony to get some air in but when I tried to open both (slimline) doors they were both stuck and wouldn't open at all. And to top it, my view was in fact a brick wall and a half demolished building. Despite my growing annoyance, I then turned on the LCD TV to check out the news, thinking they would have CNN and Bloomberg (as indicated by their site) and all I had access to was Sky and Fox Sport. I specifically returned to this hotel for access to an opening window\/door and these business TV channels, so of course I was not happy. I contacted the front desk and a concierge was sent up to check the door and he too had great difficulty trying to open the balcony doors. He managed one and said I had to open it with some technique. I'm still not sure why maintenance was not contacted by the concierge. To cut a long story short, I eventually cut my Saville stay to one night instead of 3, for the sheer fact that I couldn't stay in a hotel where the service and accomodations are certainly below the 4.5 star standard it claims to be (LCD TV or not). On my departure, reception didn't even bother asking why I was unhappy and moving to another hotel. This, I thought was quite disturbing. At the room rate available at the Saville, you may as well stay at Four Points Sheraton which is only slightly more expensive but well worth it, when you're treated like an actual guest.M.
