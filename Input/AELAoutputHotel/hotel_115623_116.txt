{"text":"Great Experience -- book Club Level !!! I am currently staying at the Mark Hopkins Intercontinental with my 2 1\/2 year old. Everything has been wonderful, from the check-in staff to the doorman. I STRONGLY advise paying extra to book club level, though. Here is why:I booked on the internet with the pre-pay option. Club level was only about 30 dollars per day extra. It is worth the money four-fold. Here are some reasons why:A private Club Lounge off the lobby with tables, couches, large TV, water bottles, soda, and snacks.There is food available in the Club Lounge from 6:30 AM to 10 PM. Continental Breakfast (including imported cheeses, smoked salmon, breads, berries, etc.), Fruit and Snacks during the day, Afternoon Tea (with cakes and scones!), Cocktails and Hors D'oeuvres in the evening (premium brands and champagne), and cookies and sweets in the evening. You could actually eat in the lounge and never spend a penny on food. The lounge is also located where my kiddo can watch the California St. cable cars come and go.The best rooms are given to club level members. There were no rooms left on the Club Level when I checked in, so we were upgraded to a junior suite on the 12th floor. The most I hear is some occasional water pipe noise, but no noise from adjoining rooms, etc.Free internet for club level members.Attentive service. Complimentary overnight shoe shine service. I sent my Clarks clogs just for fun.Complimentary pressing of 2 items per day.So you can see that Club Level pays for itself. I highly recommend it.With regard to the big hill, yes, Mark Hopkins is on a big hill that you won't want to walk back up from any direction. My advice is to take the cable cars. I bought a 3 day pass and the California line cable car stops right in front of the hotel. I have had no trouble getting on it with my daughter, even when she and I were laden with Chinatown purchases.This is one of the best hotel experience I've ever had. As far as costing too much, if you are looking for a bargain then San Francisco is the wrong destination.
