{"text":"Decent Hotel, Small Rooms Location: If you're looking for nightlife you can walk to, don't stay here. Since it is in the financial district, there is not much to do after business hours or on the weekend. I made this mistake - thought everything was hopping everywhere in San Fran. Not true for this neighborhood. However, it was a quick walk to Pier 1 which has a great farmer's market and a good selection of restaurants. There are plenty of places to eat\/get coffee during the day.Rooms: I reserved a standard room. It was tiny, tiny, tiny! It was like a shoebox and there was really poor air circulation - it got quite stuffy. If you stay here, try to get an exterior room and ask if they have any spacious rooms.Decor\/layout: This hotel is pretty clever in this arena. While it's small, it makes the most out of it's space and provides modern furniture and fixtures. The front desk is attractive as is the common sitting area. The bathrooms are modern and clean. Ironing boards and irons are housed in a cabinet by the elevators for all to use and then return - there are several and I never had a problem getting one. The hotel also provides complimentary water bottles and filtered water to grab whenever you need.Extras: An Irish restaurant\/pub is just on the ground floor so that's convenient. They have a large menu. Food is decent. A laundry room is provided - it's darn cheap. Free internet.
