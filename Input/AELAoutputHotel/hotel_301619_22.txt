{"text":"As expected but with two experiences with sour taste.... This is my hotel of choice when I go to Tokyo on business because it is relatively inexpensive, is very conveniently located and very well known. I usually come away reasonably satisfied despite the age of the hotel and size of the room. I stayed for 4 nights this time round and overall, it was fine but there were 2 issues worth mentioning:1. The shower partition which is supposed to deflect the water in the bathroom just does not work. Everytime one uses the shower, the water goes everywhere. The bathroom has the appearance of being redone but not enough thought was given to try to make sure the splash is contained. For Japanese who tends to think of everything, this is off the mark.2. A more serious concern was the attitude of the girl who arranges the airport limosine. She appears to be Eurasian and her English is therefore good. But she was impolite and unhelpful when I asked her if I could get a ticket from TCAT to Narita (instead of from the hotel to Narita). Her attitude changed for the better when I expressed my displeasure. Her service was below par and compared poorly with hotels in the Asian region, let alone the high standards of service in Japan.That said, this will not deter my return to Okura which is a good value for money hotel, but will definitely avoid dealing with her. Big hotels like Okura are living off its old reputation and sooner of later, if they do not catch up, they will be left behind. ","annotations":[]}
