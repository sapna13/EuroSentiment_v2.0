{"text":"Wonderful hotel We've just come back from a 4-night stay at the Gravina and have to say it was a memorable experience.The staff were excellent, friendly and accomodating, and went out of their way a number of times. We were in a sixth floor room in Gravina 2 (620) which had its own balcony that we made full use of. The room was at the end of the corridor which meant it was quiet and plenty big enough for our needs. It was cleaned daily - in fact the whole hotel was pretty spotless.The location of the hotel is ideal and very close to the tube stations, but equally in easy walking distance of Las Ramblas and many other attractions - and of course there are loads of them in Barca. It was easy to wander out of the hotel at night time too, and it was certainly safe.We'd recommend a visit to the Sagrada Familia and the Magic Fountain - they were amongst the highlights of our trip. Also Pi square was pretty cool and a great place to chill out.Avoid - the Port Olimpic area for food, unless you want to get chaved up and watch Brits abroad! This wasn't our taste, as was the paella down there!We did eat well at Biocenter on Carrer Pintor Fortuny, and Mama Cafe on Doctor Dou. (And only one of us was a vegetarian - both were equally excellent.)We had no problems with pickpockets, and we found almost everyone to be very friendly.
