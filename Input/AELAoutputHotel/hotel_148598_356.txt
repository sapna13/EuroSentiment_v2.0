{"text":"It is as its billed Just came back from a 5 night stay with my wife and 3 children. They are ages 1,4 and 9. The hotel was fine it is not as nice as some in the states but we had no complaints. The service at check in and out was great everyone was nice and helpful. We had the Kids for free package which worked for us. The kids really enjoyed the pool , the beach, and the kids club. The food was good a bit pricey but its a resort so it's to be expected. We rented a car from the airport on priceline and ended up with avis. It turned out to be a super idea because the direction to the hotel were clear and it only took about 40 minutes. The shuttle cost about $27.50 per person one way. The Hotel does charges $15.00 per day for parking but because we had an avis car and they have an avis office on site we only paid $5.00 per day. Having the car also let's you get off the property to eat at local restaurants. The conciegere will suggest off property dinning places.The beach was nice and lots of room great jet skiing. They have a casino and game room for the kids both were useable but Vegas it's not. The rooms were clean and decent size. I didn't play golf but the course looked well taken care of and laid out. If you have kids it's great. If you don't it's great too. Renting a car will help you get to night life if that's what you're looking for. Atlanta, Ga.
