{"text":"Stay at the back or not at all OK, the good points are great staff, clean and very spacious rooms, free internet in lobby.Bad points are the rooms facing the front have pretty thin windows and allow street noise in quite badly. Also there were metal security shutters in front of the windows with no instructions how to raise them. They act as curtains at night as no curtains other than net curtains. As I was only there 2 days and out all day I left them alone. Street is not noisy but the scooters are when one goes by every 20 mins at night. Hotel should get better soundproofed windows.Breakfast very poor for 110 Euros a night rates - just cereals, croissants and bread. No fruit, vegetables, eggs or meats.Hotel is too far from centre of town. It would be OK if you weren't spending the day walking around anyway, but as a tourist you're on your feet. I took the buses 14 and 31, but the stop where you get on is not near the one you get off due to the 1-way system so it's confusing on first arrival. To get bus into town, turn right out of hotel and head for the trees at end of street. Bus stop sign with bus numbers on is small and near the intersection on the new street you arrive at with trees running along it. To get to hotel from town get the orange buses from the bus station next to train station (on right of train station when looking down at map) (don't confuse it with long-distance blue bus station on left of train station where i got a good bus to Siena 75 minutes away.) Buy a 24hr ticket at bus station and put it in ticket machine when get on bus first time you use it, or just buy tickets at hotel reception and punch each time on bus.I asked for 13.00hrs check-out to shower after gym in town but was put off in the nicest, politest way! If the hotel can guarantee you a room at the back before you arrive, stay here it'll be good and worth the walking.Michael,London ","annotations":[{"endOffset":665,"mention":"croissants","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Croissant"],"startOffset":655},{"endOffset":675,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":670}]}
