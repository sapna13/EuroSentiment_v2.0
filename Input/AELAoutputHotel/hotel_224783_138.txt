{"text":"We would happily recommend the Hyatt The Grand Hyatt was our arrival point during a recent trip from Australia to Canada and Alaska. Check-in was quick, even though we were initially allocated a room with twin beds instead of the requested king plus rollaway. The error was corrected immediately and we were shown to a pleasant room with city views. The bed was comfortable and made up with very good quality white linen, which is always nice. The rollaway bed for our son arrived very quickly. The spacious marble bathroom had double basins, a huge shower  great water pressure and was stocked with products we actually enjoyed using. We found our room to be uncomfortably warm at night, but we later discovered this to be the case in more or less every hotel we stayed. We are from Queensland, so maybe we keep our air conditioning too cold at home!Our tariff included access to the Regency Club, which provides keyed entry to an attractive private lounge on the 27th floor. The lounge served breakfast each morning, complimentary all-day drinks and evening canap√ã√\u2022√ñs. The food was well presented and the selection offered was good. All the staff were professional and courteous and any queries or requests were acted upon immediately. The Hyatt is very well located close to the main shopping precinct. It also has the usual suspects located within the premises, including of course, a Starbucks (which was handy, because we can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stand the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√≥reamer√à√\u2020\u2022?they supply in US hotels, so we never use the coffee machines in the rooms) The only jarring note was the rather Orwellian set-up with the mini-bar. The fridges are equipped with pressure sensors, and you are changed for a product as soon as you pick it up, regardless of whether you put it back down again or not. It might make restocking easier for the staff, but it is totally user-unfriendly for guests who simply want to chill their own bottle of water. Taxi-fare from the airport was around $40 including the tip, but the hotel also has a shuttle that stops right out front to take you to the (clean, bright, and well serviced) airport. We tried the shuttle on the way out and it worked out fine, and way cheaper than a cab. We loved Seattle. The Pike markets and the waterfront lend it its own unique personality. We felt perfectly safe, and it was very easy to find our way around. The Grand Hyatt is essentially a stock-standard member of the 5 star accommodation monoliths, and it doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a heap of personality as a result. Once inside, you could be anywhere in the world. Of course, you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e only a room number to them, but who cares √à√\u2020\u2022?this one still √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√¥oes what it does√à√\u2020\u2022?very well indeed. Variety being the spice of life we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l give the Opus a try if we ever return, but we would happily recommend the Hyatt to anyone visiting this very attractive city.
