{"text":"More than a 3 star in many ways The Piet Hein is a hotel I would certainly like to stay at again. It is a very modern-style boutique hotel, very well presented, and reasonably priced. They bill themselves as a 3 star. In a sense they are because it is relatively basic in facilities (such as no minibars), yet the overall impression is of a higher caliber. Call it a 3.5 star.My first night, I was on the top floor back, which is very quiet, overlooking a commons and the back of other buildings on the block. Personally, I rather like that sort of view. The room was a bit small, but had a nice bathroom and a nice double bed. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the heating system, so I was upgraded to a wonderful front room for my second night. It was larger, with bay windows overlooking Vondelpark. On the downside, the front rooms do get some street noise (cars, trams, buses), but it dies down after midnight. The beds were comfy, not quite as firm as I like, but fine. The rooms are modern, with some nice non-hotel feeling furniture, so in spite of being modern, there is some character to the rooms. There seems to be a nautical theme running through the place. The lobby is attractive, has a bar, a sitting area, and free internet access. If you are a business traveler without heavy demands, you will like this place. In fact, a lot of business travelers seem to stay there. I didn't try the breakfast, but it appeared to be a standard simple cold breakfast selection of bread, cereal, fruit cocktail, cheese, meats, hard boiled eggs, etc. Freshly toasted cheese and meat sandwiches were offered, though.I can't say enough good things about the staff. Anything I needed or wanted to know, they were on it. My only negative comments have to do with the bathrooms. The toilet paper dispenser, in my room anyway, was a bit of a reach, and the control fixtures in the shower were counter-intuitive. Being modern, it took me a few minutes to get the hang of them. One knob is for water flow, the other is for temperature mix. But now I'm prepared for the next time I stay there :-).The Piet Hein is in a great location, 10 minutes or less walk from Leidseplein, the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and high-street shopping. So you are close to everything, or can take a tram or taxi if you need to go farther, like the Central Station. I also want to recommend a really great Thai restaurant not too far away at Leidseplein. Its the Royal Thai at Lange Leidsewarsstraat 94.
