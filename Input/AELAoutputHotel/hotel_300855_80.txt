{"text":"Poor rooms and shocking service! This hotel is shocking, we arrived at the hotel at 4am, no porter staff around to help with our bags so we had to struggle up to the 4th floor where we found the reception. It felt like the hotel had switched off the air conditioning as it was very hot in the lobby. Check-in took a very long time 30+ mins and we certainly didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get that normal Singaporean welcome that I always receive at the Sheraton Towers. So at about 5am we struggled up to our room on the seventh floor only to find that the room was dirty and had not been serviced from a previous guest. So we walked back to the front desk only to wait another 30 mins before begin allocated another room, the reception staff were so unhelpful and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even apologies for any inconvenience. So we went up to our new room to find that it was a double room with 2 single beds, instead of the king room that we had booked. (Why didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ the staff ask if this was ok?) I called down to reception a third time only to wait another 15mins while they played around with their computers to be told that this was the only room left in the hotel. By this time it was approaching 6am so I told the manager that I was not paying $200+ for a room for 2 hours just to take a shower. All he offered me was 15%off. I told them to forget it and cancel the room and I ended up staying in a friend√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ room for the few hours. If my friends were not staying here I would have departed and gone to the Raffles Plaza or Ritz, so the next morning I checked in again and was given the original room on the seventh floor that had now been cleaned, on close inspection the room was very tired and in need of renovation and a really good spring clean, dirt on the carpet, marks on the bed cover, hair in the bathroom, mold in the shower and items missing from the mini bar. I returned to the front desk again and spoke with the manager, he said he would upgrade me to a premium deluxe room with a city view but could not give this to me until 1pm, I also managed to get free breakfast out of him for 2nights. When I returned at 1pm it took the incompetent reception staff another 15mins just to give me the key to my new room on the 15th floor, the room was really no different to the original one and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a city view like promised. I spoke to the manager again and a few hours later I was moved to a city view room. I will never stay at this hotel again, putting aside there false claims of newly renovated rooms, there customer service is just so poor, to get anything out of them was such a mission and were do these hotels get off charging $25+ for the internet.
