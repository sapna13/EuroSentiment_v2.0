{"text":"Above  My partner and I stayed at the Omni San Francisco for 8 nights. I knew about this hotel from when I lived in San Francisco and worked in the Financial District. We booked an entire vacation on Hotwire and paid a little more to stay at the Omni only because I'd always wanted to stay there. Little did I know what an experience we were in for.We checked in on Saturday night. Crystal at the front desk immediately upgraded us to a concierge floor room. She was genuinely friendly, professional and outgoing. Check-in was quick and easy.The room was elegantly furnished. The only drawback was that it seemed small. We were there for eight nights and we found that it lacked storage for all of our clothes. I think for a shorter stay, the room would've been absolutely perfect. From the bellman to the front desk attendants to the valets to the doormen to the room service people, the service was nothing less than spectacular. Everyone remembered our names, what room we were in, had our car waiting for us in a timely manner. We had breakfast at Bob's Steak House one morning. The french toast is to die for and the portions are big. Though the food seemed expensive, the portion size made up for the price. The room was appointed with a plasma TV, king size bed with down comforter. We had turn down service nightly with water and fresh fruit waiting for us when we returned from the day out. We had drinks of our choice and newpapers waiting at our door every morning. The hotel was originally a bank that was gutted and rebuilt in early 2000's. It was beautiful on the inside and out. It didn't seem overcrowded at all. As a matter of fact, it seemed nearly empty most of the time we were there. It is located on California Street @ Montgomery, on the California Street Cable Car Line and in the heart of the Financial District. I liked this location because it was out of the way of all of the tourist traps and it was nice to come home at night to a quiet, much more relaxed environment. Though we are planning to move back to San Francisco in the coming year, I do believe that I will stay at the Omni again before we move and I will definitely, definitely suggest it to anyone coming for a visit.
