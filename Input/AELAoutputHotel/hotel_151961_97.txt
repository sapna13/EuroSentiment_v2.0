{"text":"Good Experience at Hotel Milano We just stayed for one night at Hotel Milano after being on Culebra for a week. We were a large group and had 3 rooms. We found the Milano to suit our needs well. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful at check-in. One of the rooms in our group had been booked separately, so they didn't know we were together. They made sure to put us on the same floor, which we really appreciated. We were in the front of the building and yes, there is some noise, but the a\/c blocks most of it out. The beds are very soft and bouncy, so some people may not like that, others may love it. Rooms are small, but very clean. The rooftop restaurant was nice and had a good view. Breakfast, as has been said, is basic, but adequate to start the day.We only had 2 problems. The a\/c in our friends' room got very cold, to the point of being too cold to sleep. The a\/c is not adjustable, so it was that or open the windows and have the noise of the street. The 2nd thing is more of an issue than a problem. We wanted to print out our boarding passes for our flights home, but they didn't seem too eager to do this. After asking a couple times, we finally got to go into the office and a gentleman working there had to stop working on his computer so I could print out our passes. He was not too friendly about this, but I don't know how much I can blame him---we were disrupting his work! It would be great if they had a small business area where this could be done without disrupting any of the employees.Other than that, it was a great stay! We would definitely return!
