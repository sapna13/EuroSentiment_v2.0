{"text":"Average First off let me say that the location was very good - almost right next to the Duomo and the room sizes were fairly good ..... They were the positives.Negatives (you may want to get some popcorn)The view we had from room 507 \/ 508 (can't exactly remember which number now) was that of a wall, and not of a particulary exciting wall at that either. I think it was yellow. The view from the roof terrace was not that much better, unless you happen to break the 8 foot barrier height wise which niether myself or my 5 foot girlfriend did or had in your possesion a step ladder, which she forgot to pack.The staff ....... Mmm, very average at best. Not very chatty, a bit weird looking maybe, didn't ask us about our stay or any of that malarky. We even got told off for drinking Champagne on the roof terrace when no other person was around. The reason. Health and Safety!!! .... This is Italy, they don't do Health and Safety, there's probably not even a word for it in Italian!!! - They just wanted us to buy their own Champagne me thinks, but I'm just guessing. Word of advice overall, don't pay for anything by credit card in Florence (or in Italy in general) if you can help it. I only used my card twice. Once at the cash point almost next to the Hotel (near the knickers and bra shop) and at a crappy rather expensive restuarant in the middle of the one of the squares (can't remember which one) and between them, I managed to get my card cloned . I cried like a little girl, it wasn't a pretty sight.If you have a choice of Hotel, then find somewhere else. If how ever you're like me and it was a present from your girlfriend \/ misstress what ever, then just smile, pretend you liked it and pat her on the head for making such an excellent and informed choice.Rant over.
