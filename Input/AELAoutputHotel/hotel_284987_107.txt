{"text":"Went for our Honeymoon and was very disapointed. I am a little late writing this review - Last year we took our honeymoon here. The place was beautiful, only thing is there was so much construction going on outside by the pool. I think they were building a new bar or something. Every single day we went out by the pool all we heard were jack hammers and on the other side they were building new condos. So between the jackhammers and the forklifts we didnt really get to relax to much. We tried to voice our opinions about this but the staff didnt seem to care and only tried to sell us timeshare properties. Which would have been great and we would have been interested in but why should we buy if we are not getting treated right? We met some friends while our stay there and all the other couples we met were not happy at all with their stay. Its ashame because it was our honeymoon and I thought this place was going to be so relaxing - but was not. In the past year I have been traveling and have recently become a travel agent - I just wish I could recommend to my clients this place but since the staff did nothing for me (like TONS of other places have when there has been issues - like noise) I cannot and will not recomend this property to anyone. It just would have been nice for them to do something for us instead of ignoring us. ","annotations":[]}
