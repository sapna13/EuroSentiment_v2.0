{"text":"Faultless Every since using Tripadvisor to help select hotels, we've not had a bad stay anywhere and the New York Palace was no exception.We stayed for 4 nights in early January and could not find fault with any aspect of our stay there. It's a very plush, grand hotel, which is in a great location and all the staff we encountered were helpful, very friendly and courteous - true pro's! Despite not asking for one, we were given a room on the 26th floor with that amazing view of St Patricks and the Rockefeller Centre. The bed was just enormous and was a treat for our aching limbs at the end of each day. The rooms are a great size and provide good extra's such as a proper hairdrier (not one of those contraptions that looks like a vacuum cleaner that needs the button permanently depressed to make it work!!) plus iron, ironing board, robe and slippers, free safe and a massive flat screen tv.The menu was outside what we prefer to pay (we got a fantastic package deal on hotel and flights thru lastminute.com hence selecting the hotel) so we choose not to eat there and can't comment on food. But there are so many great eateries in the city, that it didn't bother us. For those Europeans that wake up at 5am every morning before adjusting to local time, you get a newspaper hung on the outside of your door each morning. Sit back in the massive bed, plump up the cushions and relax!Will be back again one day!
