{"text":"Wonderful stay at the Casablanca Booked two nights here in March for a quickie, mid-week spring break getaway with kids. Can't say enough nice things about this hotel. Rooms are not huge, but are stylish and very clean. We had a king size bed (very comfortable) and a sleep sofa (as comfortable as can be expected; for kids, just fine). Location, steps away from Time Square, short walk to Theater District - fantastic for those eveningswhen you and 800 other people are trying to hail a cab after a show! No room service, but ordered dinner one night from the Italian restaurant adjacent to hotel; a menu is in the room. Came quickly, huge portions, something for everyone, and I think the bill was less than $50 for 4 people. Took advantage each evening of the free happy hour - wine, champagne, I think beer also - cheese  crackers and other snacks; a really nice touch and a great way to relax after pounding the pavement all day. Continental breakfasts include severalchoices like yogurt, bagels, cereals and fruit. There is a coffee\/cappuccino\/hot water machine for use all day long, my kids loved making hot chocolate or tea whenever they wanted. Lounge area is comfortable and nicely furnished; there is a piano, and a computer for checking email etc. Our train didn't leave until the afternoon our last day; they were happy to store our bags and let us bring back lunch and hang out in the lounge area. Staff is incredibly helpful, engaging, knowledgeable and just plain nice. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
