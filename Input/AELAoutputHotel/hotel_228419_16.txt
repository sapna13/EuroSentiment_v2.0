{"text":"Not worth it! This Hilton is not worth its rating or high rates. Thankfully we stayed here only 2 nights for my wife's business meeting, so it cost us nothing. Our first floor room was at the back of the hotel overlooking the nicely manicured park with palm trees, so it was quiet, but I would imagine the rooms up front on Av. Diagonal would be rather noisy. The decor of the lobby seemed mismatched and cheap. The decor in the room was downright budget. It reminded me of a modern youth hostel and had a very institutional feel. The carpet in the room had an odd texture and was not very clean. There was not quite enough storage in the room, and the lighting was a bit poor. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was very nice, aside from the ugly brown marble tiles. The location of the hotel was convenient to a metro station and shopping mall, but little more. The breakfast was decent, but the coffee of rather poor quality. The staff was very accommodating and helpful and spoke great English. One staff member in particular, a gentleman named Yves, was extremely polite and helpful. The staff indicated to me that this is a well run hotel, but one that is in dire need of a remodel, a price adjustment, or both. Do yourself a favor and do not stay here if travelling to Barcelona as there are many nicer hotels in better locations with lower rates.
