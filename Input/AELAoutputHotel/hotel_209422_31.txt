{"text":"Excellent position near Waikiki Beach We booked this hotel after reading the reviews on this website and they gave a very fair assessment of the hotel. The hotel is in an excellent position only one block from the beach and very close to bus stops to take you in either direction round the island. The island has an excellent bus service with a journey only costing $2 whatever the length that it is.Our bedroom was lovely (on the 36th floor) with views to Waikiki Beach. There was some noise from the floor above where the workmen were refurbishing the executive lounge but that did not really bother us. The beds were very comfortable and the room was maintained to an excellent standard - spotlessly clean. The layout with the wardrobe in the shower room (there is no bath) we found a bit strange! To use the lift or to gain access to the pool on the 10th floor you always have to use your room keycard so security is tight. The pool was very nice with plenty of towels that you could use either by the pool or take with you to the beach - so no need to take your own beach towels on holiday. As the executive lounge is temporarily on the lower ground floor it is quite a trek for breakfast but again that did not really bother us. I do agree that the lounge was always very busy but we thought that the continental breakfast was very good with plenty of fresh fruit, bagels, pastries, yoghurts etc. If you are looking for a hotel with a 'holiday feel' about it then this would not be the hotel for you as there are a lot of business people in the hotel but perhaps that is why the pool is never crowded! We certainly enjoyed our fortnight's stay at this hotel and would not hesitate in recommending it to others.
