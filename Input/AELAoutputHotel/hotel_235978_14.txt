{"text":"Worse Than Terrible! Do Not Stay Here! We were a family of 8 traveling together and spending a full week at this hotel. We reserved 4 rooms. Upon arrival only 3 available rooms. They refused to work with us or speak to travel agent. Even worse the air conditioning in the hotel did not work and the staff refused to provide fan's in any of the 3 rooms. Even after the air conditioning was fixed it still did not work in our room and the staff pretty much called us liar's before they would send someone up to look at the unit. The staff was not helpful and quite rude the entire time. Wait that is not the worst of it. Upon our return we noticed they charged us $1500 too much. The way the work the books! It is 4 months later and to date we have only been refunded $200 of the $1500 over charge. I am still working with my bank to get the remainder of the money. The staff is rude and not helpful. I would never recommend this hotel. Even though the location is good it is not worth 2 times what they claim they charge. Watch your credit card charges or better yet if you insist on staying there pay cash and don't give them a card. Otherwise you may be sorry!! I cannot recommend this hotel under any circumstances. DO NOT STAY at the ALBERGO FIRENZE FLORENCE it is the worst hotel experience I have ever had. ","annotations":[]}
