{"text":"Excellence was Excellente! We just returned from a week in Punta Cana and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ ready to book my next vacation. The Excellence Resort was better than anything I could have imagined. The staff was nice and friendly √à√\u2020\u2022?every resort employee would ask √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022\u2022√ã¬\u2022?mo Est√ã?¬©s√à√\u2020\u2022?and they seemed offended if I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ answer √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022¬Æxcellente!√à√\u2020\u2022? Here√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a breakdown:Resort property: The resort is HUGE - everything was spread out so that it never seemed crowded and it is clean and constantly maintained. We enjoyed walking through the botanical gardens and seeing all of the resort √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬©ets√à√\u2020\u2022? The large, open air lobby is beautiful and you immediately feel like you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e in paradise.Rooms: Our junior ocean front suite had a beautiful canopied four poster bed and a large jacuzzi tub and the view was amazing. It was cleaned daily and bed was turned down each evening. Mini-bar was stocked daily, however it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stay very cold. We were in building 11, which we liked because it was farther away from the activities and very quiet, although it was quite a walk to the restaurants. Beach\/Pool: The main pool was very large and nice because you could also see and hear the ocean. We spent most days on one of the cushioned beds poolside (you had to get up early to get one). The beach was beautiful - crystal clear, blue water, but a little rough (could have been the lingering hurricane Gustav). We never had a problem finding a chair or towel at the beach or pool.Food: I read several reviewers complain about the food and I honestly don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get it. All of the 5 restaurants we went to for dinner were wonderful. Agave (Franco was the best!) and Spice probably our favorites. We skipped Lobster House and The Grill because we heard they weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ very good. We rarely had to wait more than a few minutes, except for the French restaurant, where the service also wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ spectacular (maybe part of the French experience?). The breakfast and lunch buffets were very good and they changed things up almost daily. They had a grill station where some items were made to order. You have to remember that this is a foreign country, so it isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ going to be exactly like home. And if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ speak Spanish, there is a communication gap - if you are picky and special order something, good luck√à√\u2020\u2022?Beverages: They were plentiful. It started every morning with the mimosa\/bloody Mary bar at breakfast. The fruity drinks were very good and they had a good selection of liquors - not top shelf, but well brands and several to choose from. There were plenty of bars and the service was fairly quick (remember you are on island time). Activities\/Entertainment: We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ do much at all, but it looked like there was plenty to do if you wanted to. The track in the botanical gardens was nice if you can run in the heat. The gym was well equipped. We really enjoyed the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√πree√à√\u2020\u2022?horseback ride. If you know how to ride, they will even let you run down the beach (if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e lucky enough to get a horse that will run). I saw some reviews that the horses were not well taken care of. As a horse owner, I can say most of them looked very well fed. It seemed the skinny ones (including the one I rode) were just old. The evening shows were very entertaining. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ miss the Circus, 70√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂\/80√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ night and the Michael Jackson show!! Get there early for MJ to get a good seat!! Other tips: Yes, the bugs are bad at night, but I never had a problem if I wore bug spray. One night I forgot and I was eaten up. The ride from the airport is long and bumpy, but really not that bad (no worse than a typical NYC cab driver). If you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ handle it, trust me, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ever go to St. Lucia. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ do the excellence club, but I would agree with other reviewers that it doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ seem worth the extra money.
