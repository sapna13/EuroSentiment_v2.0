{"text":"Good value, Good location, happy with stay I stayed at the Charlesmark for one night, as I was doing some research at Harvard. The price was the best available (I paid $169.00 on Orbitz) and the location, as others have said, can't be beat--right on Boylston Street, across from Library and one-two blocks from Copley Place and other shopping. 1\/2 block from the T stop. I agree that the rooms are really small--mine was 604, and I agree with the person who stayed in 504 that this is probably the smallest room on each floor, so consider that when you check in. I also agree that there was some sort of background noise that I couldn't get rid of--probably the A\/C outside. Finally, I could see the bar was very trendy and popular for the elite Boston set, and that may appeal to some people, but for me it just clogged the lobby (which is TINY) and made me feel like the conspicuously alone, unhip traveler that I am.BUT the room was new, spotless, very comfortable, and had free bottled water, scads of TV channels, free local phone calls, and a stereo w\/CD changer, if you like to listen to music. There was also a guide to Boston in the room--not a magazine, but an actual guidebook--for us during one's stay. I've not seen that at other hotels. I found the staff very friendly and appreciated the free internet in the lobby (though it was in high demand, and one of the two computers was broken). overall I highly recommend the hotel for single travelers, esp on short stays, who like to be centrally located and who don't need a lot of space (and who like trendy digs).
