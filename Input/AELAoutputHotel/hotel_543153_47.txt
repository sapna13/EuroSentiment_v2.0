{"text":"Fantastic stay- highly recommended We stayed here for two nights based on the Tripadvisor reviews and weren't disappointed. Take the airport bus from outside arrivals to the last stop Place Catalunya- only 5 mins from the hotel which is located down a little street about two blocks from the Ramblas (look for the little side street Bon Success just before La Poma restaurant on the left of the street). The hotel is very modern, stark but not soul-less either. We arrived early and a room was available although we had read it was better to get a room on the 5th floor so decided to wait for one of those. V. helpful staff (excellent english) kept our luggage for us and advised us on where to visit until later that afternoon. The room itself was quite big with dark red walls and black slate floors and faced onto a funky vertical garden of plants and the roof terrace. There is a tv and radio in the room, just across the corridor is your sitting room which is small but cute and overlooks the rooftops (from the fifth floor). The bed was really comfortable and the shower excellent. Just beyond the lobby is the eating area where food is available 24\/7 (no additional charge as already included in your room rate). It's mainly healthy eating with a selection of salads, sandwiches, yoghurt and deserts. There is a breakfast chef who will make your eggs or pancakes to order. There is also free internet access and a library for guests. The hotel location is perfect- right in the centre of the city. If you are in BCN for a wend, there is very limited shopping on a Sunday but all of the tourist attractions are open. We took the bus tours and really enjoyed them. It was a great way to see the city- it gets cold on top of the bus so bring a jacket. We also visited La Roca Village (outlets)- big names were Zegna, Gant, Versace etc. There were no great bargains to be found though! We really enjoyed Casa Camper and would highly recommend it.
