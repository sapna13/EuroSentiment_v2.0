{"text":"London Bridge is falling down I read the reviews and expected a nice stay. It helped that on the hotels website they had a special weekend promo rate that for London seemed generous. I arrived from NYC after a 14hr. flight (mechanical problems) but was in great spirits. Check-in seemed ok , but not overly friendly, warm or professional (just how much experience does the staff have?). My executive king room was large by London standards, but the design made the room seem very clutured. A king bed, a large conference table with 6 chairs, a sitting chair and small ottoman, a couch and a small coffee table.Too much. Little open space to walk about the room. Then the pounding noise started, like something heavy was being dropped - one could feel the noise as well as hear. The response from the front desk staff was one of indifference. The next day the same noise. Perhaps they said it's coming from the gym next door. Again no real concern for peace and quiet. No resolution was offered. The mattess was thin and extemely soft, more like a futon really. Breakfast is no great deal either, even the Full English is buffet. My only positive is Paul the head concierge, who is absolutely wonderful and warm (the way one expects from a 4star hotel.)and also James and Omar are helpful and pleasant. They are the exceptions but not enough to not warn others to heed the bad reviews and stay at your own risk. I am a seasoned traveler and this is one of my most disappointing stays anywhere in the world. It feels like nothing more than a tourist class hotel.
