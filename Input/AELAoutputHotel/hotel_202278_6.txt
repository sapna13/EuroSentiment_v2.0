{"text":"Clean  The Steigenberger is a large hotel situated in the Frankfurt Airport complex, just 5 minutes from the airport itself.You are greeted by a door man and shown to reception where you are welcomed in perfect English and checked in quickly and efficiently.On the ground floor are a numberof places to eat. I ate in the Faces bar which served food until 01:00 ideal because I'd arrived late. It is the usual hamburger, curry and steak affair. Reasonably priced and good quality.The Five Continents served an excellent selection for breakfast the following day including cooked items, colds meats and cheeses, breads, cereals, fruits and yoghurts. My only complaint was that there was only UHT milk for tea and coffee.Colleagues used the gym and pool although I did not have time. the hotel also has plently of parking in an adjacent block.The hotel itself is huge. The public areas are marble downstairs and reminiscent of a shopping centre. Very clean but rather clinical. Upstairs, again clean and tidy. No complaints, just a standard large hotel style and feel.My room was 913 on the 9th floor. This was a 'superior' room but was actually just a standard hotel room, a little small but there was a desk, tv, mini bar and plenty of hanging and storage space if required. The room was freshly decorated, crisp clean linen on a comfortable bed. I had a nice view of the runway but apart from a few noisy aircraft was not particularly concerned by the air traffic. The room had airconditioning which meant that I could keep the windows closed.The bathroom was sleek and modern, nice hot shower and good quality towels and toiletries.I enjoyed a very comfortable trouble free stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a stopover in Frankfurt.
