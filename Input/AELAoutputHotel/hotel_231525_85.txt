{"text":"Nice little hotel Having stayed here last week for 3 nights, I have to agree with the other reviews, we didn't bother with a taxi and just got the aerobus from the airport, (3 euros 75) which dropped us off at Plaza Catalunya, and the hotel was about 5 minutes or so away. Again, agree with the checking in, we were offered a glass of cava which was really nice. The free tea, coffee etc are available after 1pm, and run all night., there are only about 3 tables to sit at, so could be a squash if a few people wanted to sit there. We had the breakfast there, which was fine at 50% discount at 7 euros each. We went to Mikos on Las Ramblas the other mornings, and you could get an 'american breakfast' with with coffee for 6 euros 20, but we tried the traditional type,(same price) bread with tomato rubbed on it with serrano ham and cheese, with fresh orange and coffee.I agree about the church bells, it was quite warm when we were there, and I asked at reception about the air con, as there didn't appear to be any, but it is typical Spain, they can't understand why we want to be cold in the winter! We ended up opening the window, so could hear the bells, which didn't bother us too much during the night, but you could really hear them about 8am or 9am.Our bath was very small, I'm 5'2 and I couldn't lie down in it! Nevertheless, everything was nice and clean and in good repair.Again, agree Taller de Tapas was quite expensive, it was good quality, but quite small portions. We ordered clams and beans, which cost nearly 7 euros, and we counted 6 small clams! Good service and good wine though.Excellent location!
