{"text":"Wonderful My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel in October as part of our Honeymoon. We had booked it after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor and weren't disappointed. We advised the hotel beforehand that we were visiting on Honeymoon and were surprised when we got there that they had upgraded our room from a standard queen room to a suite on the 28th floor. It was perfect!! They also had left us a bottle of champagne and a letter saying that if we needed anything we only had to ask. The staff were all perfectly helpful and friendly and couldn't do enough for us. The Concierge staff were excellent and helped us get reservations last minute to see the Lion King and also dinner reservations for The View restaurant.The hotel was beautiful and the room that we had was wonderful, with views to the Empire State Building and Chrysler on one side and on the other side of the room there were views of the Rockerfella Centre.The location of this hotel was excellent, only a few minutes walk to Times Square and Broadway and virtually on the doorstep of 5th Av....perfect for shopaholics like me!We had no complaints about noise of any sort from building work or street noise, and we slept perfectly on the most comfortable beds ever! Some people that have written reviews on this hotel obviously are those kind who always have something to complain about instead of enjoying their holiday.All in all our stay at the Sofitel was the best and made our honeymoon memorable and wonderful....I can't say enough and would love to return one day when we visit New York again.
