{"text":"disappointed with El Convento My family and I (2 children) stayed at the El Convento post cruise. We arrived at the hotel at about noon. We were dropped off at valet parking, and had to carry our bags across the street and into the hotel. Check in was at 4:00 and they held our bags for us until our room was ready. It wasn't ready until 4:20 . It seemed like forever with 2 kids after an exhausting trip. Our room was wonderful, however they lost 2 of our bags. One was found and brought up to our room, but the other remains a mystery. It contained our prescription medications, 3 pairs of shoes, and several articles of clothing. We frequently checked back with the front desk who assured us they would find it, but everytime we checked back they didn't know anything about it and would try and give us some one else's bag that was in their store room.We had an early flight the next morning and still no sign of our luggage bag. We completed the guest questionaire which supposedly goes directly to the manager, but still have not heard anything from the hotel in a month. Very dissapointing. Also, the hotel charged our credit card an additional $12.00 10 days after we checked out with no explanation. My husband called once more and was told it was a municipality tax, but we were never told about it at check in or check out. We booked the room via hotwire and were asssured that all taxes were allready paid.They seem to have poor follow through to resolve any conflicts.Certainly not what we would expect from a luxury hotel.
