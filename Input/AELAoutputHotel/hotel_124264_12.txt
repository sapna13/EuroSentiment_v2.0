{"text":"Nothing is Perfect I had stayed at this Hotel 2 years ago to go to the Bumbershoots Festival and so I knew it is a nice, convenient location and somewhat almost affordable place to stay for 2 Queen Beds($130 night). However, this past weekend, when my sister and I visited Seattle for a Mariner's game we encountered several problems:1) They were revamping the water heating system and so no hot water on Saturday morning (all was well later in the day).2) The continental breakfast is always nice, everything well stocked but one of the waffle makers start button was broken\/missing (the next day it was fixed). 3) For whatever reason the front desk remained very ambivalent (or maybe embarrassed and didn't know what to do) as they had under booked the shuttle services for the game goers and 2 large groups of Cruise passengers. We almost took a Taxi to the game (some other impatient fans did) because we were forced to wait about an hour after scheduled shuttle (for a 10 minute ride at most). The cruise came first I guess - angry mob vs. like 5 easy going Mariners Fans and 2 Cleveland Indian supporters. Mariners lost the game, but at least they picked us up when they said they would!This is why I would recommend this hotel to anyone who can accept things as they come. Nothing is perfect. Maybe we just showed up on an off-weekend. The location is convenient and easy to find, just a few blocks from Seattle Center\/Space Needle\/Monorail and interesting restaurants within walking distance. They have a lot of amenities which makes you feel comfortable like internet access on 2 computers, warm cookies in the lobby, pretty courtyard with fountain, underground secured parking, and a fairly quiet neighborhood in the middle of the City.
