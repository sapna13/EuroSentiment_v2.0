{"text":"Love the Chancellor We have stayed at many hotels in Union Square and prefer boutique style properties for the character, charm , history and more personalized service they can offer.The Chancellor has all of that and much, much more.The Management and Staff here are not only efficient in their job but give that little bit extra and always with a relaxed and friendly smile . Nothing was too much trouble with any of the staff we encountered. I cannot remember everyones name but Steve and Rory on the front desk, Susan at the Tour Desk, Yuko and Mao all were great.Apart from all the above the hotel is in an absolutely perfect location on Union Square and all the rooms have been recently refurbished. The amenities in each room are all you need and although the rooms are on the smaller side being an historic hotel I really do not think they are all that bad. I have encountered rooms in Europe and Asia a lot smaller .I would urge anyone staying at the Chancellor in future to use the restaurant.Breakfasts here are the equal (my wife says better) than other well promoted places nearby and I know you will not get the excellent service with a smile we got from Mao each time. That's an added extra at no cost.What else can I say.This is a great little hotel in a great city.Do yourself a favour and give it a try and I guarantee you will be back.I know we will.
