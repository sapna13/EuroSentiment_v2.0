{"text":"Everything we wanted for our Honeymoon The Hotel staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming. They really made it seem a pleasure to serve us. We had an oceanfront view room that was beautiful. The beds were very comfy and falling asleep to the sound of the ocean was nice. The pool was great, the hot tub was nice(although it wasn't hot the first couple nights). The beach is great. They bring out chairs and umbrellas for you. The ocean is like bathwater, although you have to be careful with the waves. The drinks and food are very pricey so we ate at a place called Dannys(left out of the Marriot and down a block on the corner) and their food is very good and very inexpensive. We were a little disappointed that the swimup bar and the beach bar closed so early. The beach bar is only open until 7. The concierge was very helpful and saved us a lot of money by suggesting renting a car instead of taking a tour to the rainforest. I really can't understate how the friendliness of the staff made our stay enjoyable. As far as eating, we ate at the Cherry Blossom right next door, which is a Japanese restaurant where they cook the food right in front of you. It's very good but expensive. We also ate at Yerbe Buena(right across from Dannys) which has very good food. We ate at Dannys every day for their breakfast. Their fried egg sandwhich on a hoagie is phenomenal. There's also a place called The Burger Joint which has one of the best hamburgers we've ever had. Take a right out of the Marriot and it's only a few blocks down on your left. We got a little tired of Puerto Rican food so this place was great.The Rainforest was nice. I recommend going to the top trail with the tower. The view is spectacular. Note, when you get to the top of the first part, look for the sign that says Wildlife Viewing Area and take that trail to the tower. The other road doesn't lead to much of a view.We also went to Old San Juan and it was a lot of fun. There's a really beautiful walk that goes right by the ocean around the city. We went on the Bacardi tour which we both thought was a waste of time. It's basically two hours between travel and everything else to get two free drinks each. The rest is a big commercial for Bacardi.The location of the Marriot is great. Starbucks is right across the street and there's a Walgreens a block down for anything else you might need. If you want to find beer or wine, take a right out of the Marriot and there's a store on the left side down a few blocks which had the cheapest and widest selection. We heard a lot about how it's dangerous in Puerto Rico but we never had any problems or felt unsafe. The people there are extremely friendly and offer great advice(such as, 30 SPF suntan lotion isn't going to cut it.)Between the weather, food, staff, room, and view we had a great time and can't wait to go back.
