{"text":"Wonderful Time \/ Beautiful Property My wife, two children (8 and 10), and I just spent one wonderful week at the Rincon Beach Resort (02 √à√\u2020\u2022?08 July). The Room:We stayed in room 307 (double queen) so we had a view of the pool and beach. The room was very clean and the housekeeping staff did a great job straightening it up for us every day (no matter what time we strolled out in the morning or afternoon). The room was very comfortable and accommodated the four of us very well. If you are used to numerous amounts of fluffy pillows you may want to bring some extras. If you plan on coming back to the room wet, you may want to turn down or turn off the A\/C before you leave because it works very, very, very well...brrrrrr.The Staff:Every single staff member from Manager to handy man was extremely friendly. The front desk staff was extremely helpful, attentive, and always cheerful. The young ladies working the Pool Bar were really top notch and friendly, even though they were constantly being soaked by √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºwim by√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂√à√\u2020\u2022? The same young ladies rotated duties at the Pelican Grill right by the pool so the wonderful service continued. The staff at the Brasas Grill were also very friendly and accommodating. Resort Management was always on hand and constantly patrolled the area to ensure everything was running smoothly.The Property:The resort grounds were very beautiful and manicured. Just a few steps from the lobby was the pool and the beach just a few steps from that. The pool was very comfortable and had a great range of depth for all ages. The beach area was very clean and the water was calm and inviting, great for the little ones. There were plenty of lounge chairs for everyone. Although there were limited recreational water equipment we still did some paddle boating (you better have a team oriented family for this one) and kayaking. The Food:Our intent was to go out and explore the Puerto Rico so we only ate at the local facilities a few times, but the few times we did we were very impressed! We had dinner and breakfast at the Brasas Grill. Dinner was amazing, the Caribean themed food choices really hit the spot. I had the filet and my wife had the seafood mofongo (she is Puerto Rican and loves mofongo and she was surprised that this may have been the best she ever tasted!). They even had a kids selection which although sounded familiar (cheeseburger, chicken, mac and cheese) was not dulled down in anyway. The mac and cheese my daughter had was really good and my son's cheeseburger had some real substance to it. We also ate at the Pelican Grill once. We had the appetizer mix which was great and I had the burger which was huge and delicious.All in all we had a wonderful time at the resort and the surrounding areas of Aguada. This was a great place to just lounge and relax or if you want to explore the island and use it as a base camp. I definitely don't agree with any of the negative comments about the resort and hope that my review helps.
