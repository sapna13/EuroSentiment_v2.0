{"text":"Not quite Saint Martin Lane London This hotel is about as far from a quality boutique hotel as you can get. You arrive and it all looks ok and then you meet the staff. Unfortunately, they think they own the place. A blank stare greets you. I don't know about you but I'm ready to slap any front of house staff that takes that tone. Don't arrive early because you will be promptly told to go for a walk until a room is available. Ok I understand that the rooms may not be available when you arrive at around 12.00 noon but normally you're politely asked to take a seat and relax until the room is ready. Why do these new boutique hotel always allow photo shoots to happen in their lobby when paying guest are arriving and would like to use the seating provided. The film crew had taken over the whole lobby and there was no where to sit. The rooms have nothing to do with S.Dali. He would roll over and die again if he knew his name was attached to this place. Dali's art was clever and resolved. The room we stayed in was silly and had been decorated by a uni student who liked the idea of creating some crazy. The restaurant operator is obviously not attached to the hotel. The breakfast was quite good. Yes the muesli is excellent. They should clean the domestic espresso machine though because the coffee become incredibly bitter if they are not pulled apart and washed thoroughly often. I've got the same one at home and if don't do this the coffee is terrible which was the case at the Luxe. Stick to the English Tea. We booked for 2 nights and got the hell out of there after one night.
