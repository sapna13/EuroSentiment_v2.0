{"text":"mixed - good but would stay elsewhere next time We stayed for 3 nights early august with a one year old, so we requested a suitable room and were allocated a great sized room with a sliding door between the sofa bed\/dressing area and the main bedroom. unfortunately we had no view but looked at the adjacent room on the corner of the building which therefore had 3 windows with views over the street and beyond but a) it wasn't available and b) it was smaller so we stayed put.my family tried to arrange for flowers to be delivered as it was my birthday but unfortunatley there was some confusion and the hotel did not accept the flowers as our room was booked in my partner's surname not mine. the member of staff i spoke to about it was rather abrupt and unhelpful not even apologising. Where in contrast other staff members were very helpful and when one day we told them our room hadn't been cleaned all day (on my birthday!) they offered us complimentary champagne as apology.the rooftop pool was small and crowded but nice for a quick dip or lounge if you could find a spare lounger.the location was OK anout 10-15 mins from the Ramblas but along a rather grubby street with homeless and drunks. there are definatley better locations and next time we'll be staying in port olympic area.this hotel wasn't great for children - although on request they did very quickly provide a cot and a non-slip mat for the bath, but the breakfast room had no highchairs and staff there weren't friendly or helpful.We expected a better choice and varity of breakfast foods for a 4 star.
