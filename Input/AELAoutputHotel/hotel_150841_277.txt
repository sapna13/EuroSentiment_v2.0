{"text":"Loved the resort, although construction andstar friends more than overwhelming Just returned from a week at the Iberostar Bavaro. There were eight of us altogether and we had a good time. The rooms are nice but are showing signs of age. They really could use some renovating. If you book a room, make sure you request rooms which are closer to the Dominica side of the resort. There is construction going on next door to the hotel on the right side and the noise is overwhelming. Don't plan on sleeping in. The banging starts at 9:00am and goes on all day until 5:00pm. The beaches are just breathtaking and the pools were awesome. Food was great! Highly recommend the Japanese restaurant. Buffets had so much food, it was difficult to decide what to eat! The staff was very nice, but look out for the star friends who provide the daily entertainment. They don't know how to take no for an answer. Beware if you go to the lounge early before the evening show. I'm sure they are told to try and get the guests to dance with them, which is ok but if you tell them no, they will harass you all night. You have to get rude for them to leave you alone. They also did this during the day with the few outside activities they had during the day. Overall, we all enjoyed ourselves and had a great time. I would recommend this hotel but look out for the few negatives. ","annotations":[]}
