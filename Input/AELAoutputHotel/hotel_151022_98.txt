{"text":"Fabulous time at Natura Park! My husband and I just returned from Natura Park for our second honeymoon and we had a great time. We had never travelled to an all-inclusive resort before so we have nothing to compare it to, but we were quite satisfied with our experience. I was a bit wary after reading many of the reviews on this site, however the positives definitely outweighed the negatives. We booked through a CAA agent with Sunquest and paid around $1700 per person.Check-in: Quick, staff were helpful. We didn't get a safe key at first since they had run out (hotel was over-booked), but we got one the next day no problem, and they offered to keep our passports overnight in the hotel safe if we wanted to. Rooms: Pretty good, we were in the first building next to the buffet and bars, so at night it was a bit noisy, but we're sound sleepers so it didn't bother us. Since the hotel was so busy, we didn't bother trying to change rooms. We had a king-sized bed and the air conditioning worked well. There were a few things in need of minor repairs (shower head, toilet paper holder), but you spend so much time outside, who cares???? Maid was good-we tipped her $1 US a few times and left small gifts. Food: Overall very good. There was good variety at the buffet for every meal, if you couldn't find something you liked then you must be pretty picky! The fruit and wellness buffet were good, as was the beach BBQ for lunch, the pasta bar, omelette bar, and the mexican restaurant (have the tenderloin!!!!). Desserts were good too! We never went hungry. I got a bit sick after the seafood restaurant, but I was eating everything (fresh salads, cut fruits, etc) so I wasn't surprised really. The resort uses filtered water for washing food and making ice. Go early for the buffets to get the freshest\/hotest food. The restaurants are all open-air, so there is always going to be the challenge of keeping food hot\/cold and fresh for several hours. Grounds: Beautiful! Very well taken care of. Lots of critters to feed and watch (birds, fish, turtles, etc), lovely trees and flowers. Pool\/beach: Beach was great, go early to get a chair (before 8 am when it's busy and the weather is nice). Didn't spend much time at the pool since the beach was so great. There is some seaweed, but it gets raked up everyday. You can walk for probably 1.5 hours to the left before you reach the next resort, good swimming and snorkling spots along the way. Entertainment\/Activities: We really enjoyed the evening shows, and the daily activities were pretty good too-hard to get people together for a VB or soccer game since most are older or just there to bake :)Service-Very good. We never had to wait for a table, and they were very efficient at the a la carte restaurants.The resort was very busy, but we never had trouble getting drinks or food. Don't expect to be waited on hand and foot-and remember the staff work long hours and get paid very little! Many travel over 2 hours to work every day. They do their best and are always smiling!We went on the Caribean Festival and 8x8 monster truck safari tours and had a great time on both-make sure you leave the resort for your shopping! There are vendors that come in a couple times a week with stuff, but they are very overpriced and aggresive. Watch out for fake amber and larimar! Be early for the buses that pick you up for tours since they'll leave without you if you're not there ;)If you are a very picky eater, used to being waited on hand and foot, and anything going wrong will spoil your vacation, you should just stay home because the rest of us don't want to hear your whining! Remember, you're there to have fun, relax, and enjoy the sunshine-which we had no trouble doing at Natura Park!
