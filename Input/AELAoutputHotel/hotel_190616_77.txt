{"text":"Great Location but some concerns I stayed at this hotel in the beginning of June with my husband. It's located in a central location where it's easy access to many shopping areas and tourist attractions. Hotel staff are generally friendly. The roof top pool is small but it's well worth an afternoon spending up there. The breakfast was well worth too - great selection and comfortable environment. Two issues with my stay - first, the floral arrangments that were displayed throughout the hotel in the first few days of my stay were made with strong scent of lilies. Some people might be allergic to that - I personally had to cover my nose when walking in. A more thoughtful selection on the flowers might be a good idea since guests travel from all over the world and allergy is quite common in some countries.Second, we brought a periodical on the plane to read and put it in the bathroom when we got to the hotel - it's a weekly paper that my husband had collected over 15 years, not one single issue was missing. Two days before we checked out, we found that a corner of it was torned. We thought it was just an accident by the maid. Then the day before we checked out, we found it missing. So the next morning when we checked out, we notified the front desk and the staff there had us write down our resident address and said he would check with the maid. I was disappointed that no one apologized or showed any regrets about it - we are still waiting to see if it can be found and mailed. ","annotations":[]}
