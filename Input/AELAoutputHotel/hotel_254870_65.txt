{"text":"Great location, good breakfast, staff is nice Have just returned from a 3 day stay at H10 Montcada, very good location (a few minutes from Las Ramblas, on nice large street Laitana, a few minutes from the harbour and MareMagnum), very close to Metro station Jaume 1.I sent a mail to the hotel a few days before my arrival, asking for a high floor room, and got one on 7th floor, not a great view but plenty of light, and decent size. The staff is nice, the breakfast offers choice, and quality, in a quiet environment. I recommend this hotel, and would return to H10 Montcada.Tips on restaurants: - dinner 1, went to TROBADOR FERRAN, close to via laitana, on the way to Ramblas, before reaching Plaza del Ayuntamiento: good service, enough choice, the food was good, I would return.- dinner 2, went to QUINZE NITS on Placa Real (pass by Trobador Ferran, on the left before Ramblas), queued there for 40 minutes (restaurant no opened yet, staff waiting in front of the queue for god knows what!, got in around 20:45). Low price but: NO service, VERY BAD FOOD, would NOT recommend! Hardly no spanish dishes, I tasted the Paella Mixta, the worst paella I've ever eaten in Spain (spent several months in Valencia and Barcelona in the past, have had much better paella!).I've read good reviews of this restaurant before going, I can't understand why! If you're on a low budget, better go to a bar (not on Las Ramblas) and get a few tapas portions, you will have a better experience for sure!!
