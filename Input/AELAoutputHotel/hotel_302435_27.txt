{"text":"Super High-tech room in the Main Building! I have stayed at this hotel a few times. I got very luckey once and they upgraded me to a nice room in the main building, although I was paying for a single room in the tower building. While the room in the tower building is very decent, the renovated room in the main building was amazing. The room had two queen size beds with bench at the end, couch, coffee table, flat screen TV, fax machine etc. You could open\/close the curtains by pressing the button on the night stand (actually, everthing is controlled by the panel on the night stand). There is a digital control panel on the wall for AC, and air purifier. The bathroom came with a tub that filled automatically to the temperature you like, and played a little music when it was filled, and oh, there was a small flat screen TV over the vanity. The room was so spacious it's almost as big as my apartment without the kitchen. The room service was excellent. I called for breakfast and it came within 5 minutes. Front desk personnel are always helpful with any request. Be sure to sign up for Imperial Club, if you are a foregin business traveler. That way, you can use fitness center for free, discount on dry cleaning etc. I've stayed at other hotels in Tokyo, but this one tops my list for location, service and comfort. I also like to run, so being close to a good running course like the loop around Imperial Palace is always a plus.
