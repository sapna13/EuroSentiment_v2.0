{"text":"Amazing! I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ a little late in writing this, ok so its well over a year, but it would be rude if I didn't mention this wonderful hotel. I stayed here with my girlfriend (who I would be proposing to on this trip) After months of research and very careful planning, our trip was almost disrupted due to high security problems at Heathrow airport last year. We were extremely lucky to have even flown out. Due to the problems at Heathrow we did not receive our luggage and all we had were our passports and our cash cards. That was all!! The Terrass was so helpful managing to provide us with t-shirts, toothbrushes, cleaning products etc. If this wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ enough they even upgraded us to a junior suit (if memory serves me correctly it was room 704). The room was exactly as I imagined it to be, if not better. It was clean, neat and very spacious with a clear and uninterrupted view of Paris and the Eiffel Tower. The bathroom was very large and well kept. The location is perfect. Tucked away in the traditional French streets, surrounded by cafes and small shops, although busy it becomes quiet towards the evening so do not worry. By foot you could reach all the main streets leading to the main attractions this should take around 20 minutes. Do not miss the Moulin Rouge. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ an amazing show and a must on any trip to Paris. Again the Terrass helped by booking the tickets. Due to the smart dress code we needed to buy clothes at short notice. The Terrass couldn't have been kinder by drawing a detailed map to all the local shops were we could get as dressed up as possible. All in all this is a wonderful hotel which I cannot wait to visit again. A must if you are to stay in Paris.  if you're wondering she did say yes! ","annotations":[]}
