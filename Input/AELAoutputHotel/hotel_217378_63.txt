{"text":"Not worth the price Just returned from 10 days at the resort. It was okay but not worth the money. $4200.00 for 10 days.The walls are paper thin and we could hear the 2 guys next door fighting all the time.we had a water view suite, which actually was 2 older rooms with an adjoining door and called it a suite. The view however was awesome.There are no safes in the room on safety deposit boxes located behind the front desk. It was really busy when we were there and the front desk always had a lineup so accessing your money was not the most convenient way but it worked.The pool is okay if you get a chair before 7:00 am. There is a extra balcony by the restaurant which I highly recommend trying to get a chair there as there is NO SUN after 1:30 by the pool due to 2 highrise condo buidlings next door. Even if you go to the beach when you get down there go to the right as the sun stays out the longest if you go farther past the 2 buildings.The locals will charge you 5.00\/chair to sit on the beach but get there early as they did run out 1 day when I went to the beach after swimming in the pool. There are also jet skis for rent and they charge 70.00 for 1\/2 hr.The breakfast was good but again expensive. Your normal basic plate - 2 eggs and meat, potatoes, toast was $11.00,the buffet was 19.00. Kids 12 and under are 1\/2 price so that worked out for our 1 boy who loves to eat.Otherwise we spent New Years at the hotel and the meal was terrible. It was a buffet and was no good. We did not eat there again except for breakfast.Valet parking is 22.00\/day. I recommend not renting a car and either taking the bus - which we did or a cab.If you are a Dolphins fan like I am do not go to Shula's steak house unless you bring alot of money with you. 2 adults and 2 kids and it was $330.00. OUCH!!!Feel free to contact me if you have any other questions.Lisa ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1274,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1269}]}
