{"text":"3rd Time in this hotel and will always return! We have stayed here 3 times now. The first time was at Xmas 2006 where we were upgraded for free to a superior room. It was truly quite a big room and a huge comfy bed. We then returned in August 2007 for a week, again a great stay. A slightly smaller room this time, but didn't bother us because the bed was huge like the last time. We booked a superior room this time and paid for it because having the free upgrade the first time, we didn't want to be dissappointed. Although I'm sure the Classic Room is just as great.We returned in June 2008 for a long weekend. Because my partner smokes, they only had a few smoking rooms left due to the Smoking Ban that came in July 2008. They had redecorated 99% of the hotel rooms and cleaned them from smoke so they only had 2 available. We tried the Junior Suite, but found this too noisy because it overlooks Dam Square. It was a great big room, but no good because the trams were so loud. I would request a room either at the side of the hotel or in the inside of the hotel, you get a lovely peaceful sleep then. Never again would I have a room that overlooks the Square. It also had huge big windows with no Blackout curtains, this kept me awake too!We moved the next day to a different non smoking room, which was great. The Hotel Staff brought us up to look at rooms so we had the choice of the room we wanted.There is also a fire exit on each floor that allows you to smoke without having to leave the hotel, this was handy for my partner. So request a room near the fire exit if you want a smoke. Also, I was told theres 2\/3 hotel rooms with balconys that you can smoke on. You will need to request these rooms, but they are on the front of the hotel, overlooking Dam Square.The Dam Plaza is part of the hotel but fairly expensive, the food is outstanding. I'm so fussy but there was not one thing I could fault with that food. Burgers, Chicken, Steak, Fish - all gorgeous. The Room Service is spot-on too. The Dam Burger is very srcummy!The bathroom is very nice, modern and clean. You can listen to the TV in the bathroom as it has speakers. Great Bath and shower. Sheets are changed every 2 days. Fresh towels when you want etc.The Dam Plaza also have a small Bar now, which was only put in this year, 2008!Because we are planning to go back this Xmas, the receptionist has given me her email address so we can book a room through her, she is going to save us a really nice quiet room with Blackout Curtains. I love my sleep.I wouldn't dare try any other hotel in Amsterdam. It's not cheap there to stay, but I'm sure you will have a great stay.
