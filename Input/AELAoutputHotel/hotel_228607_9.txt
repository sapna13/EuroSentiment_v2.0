{"text":"Better than expected I had to go to Barcelona on business and my sister joined me as a tourist. I booked this hotel because during the period of our stay most of the central hotels were fully booked or were asking crazy rates (above 400 Euros\/night), but I must say that I was a bit concerned after reading the previous reviews. It has been a nice surprise! Rooms size is acceptable even for 2 ladies spreading all their stuff around, same is the bathroom. Very clean with a maid always ready to leave us extra soap or towels. We also liked the wooden floor (much better than carpets that normally look dirty) and the opening window. Only negative point was airconditioning not adequate.Breakfast is fairly expensive if paid on site, so next time we'll try to get an inclusive rate because all the coffee shops around open late. We found the people at the front desk extremely nice and they helped us a lot with restaurant suggestions, public transport information, directions, and even allowed us to leave the car into the garage after we checked out.Garage was really a plus, safe place to park the car at a reasonable cost, instead of the packed streets around where you hardly find a parking and your foreign plate is catching the eyes.It is true that the hotel is not in the city center, but very close to the sea and a very short walk to the olympic port. We walked there and back at night without any fear. If you don't feel confortable at night you can always get a cab which is not expensive. The tourist bus stops around the corner and so is public bus n. 41 heading to Plaza Catalunya. A very positive experience ","annotations":[{"endOffset":347,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":343},{"endOffset":804,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":798}]}
