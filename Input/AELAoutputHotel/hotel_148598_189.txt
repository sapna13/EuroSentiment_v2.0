{"text":"Great Anniversary Trip My wife and I spent our anniversary at the Rio Mar and had a wonderful stay. We got a great deal from Priceline (which included the 20% resort fee, I was surpised to see). We were very pleasant to the front desk manager, and she upgraded us to a really nice room on the 6th floor. I cannot thank her (Elise) enough- they didn't care that we got a cheap rate from Priceline. Most of the reviews I saw describe this hotel fairly well:-The grounds are fabulous- large and beautiful. You can walk for miles on the beach (if you go west)-Get a rental car. This is relatively far from San Juan. If you want the big city nightlife, stick to Isla Verde or Condado. We paid $21 per day at Thrifty. Get a small car anyway, it's a lot easier to park-Restaurants are expensive and some are not open in the low season. We loved the food we ordered- it was not mediocre. The waiters were very friendly.-We drove out to the local restaurants. Antojitos is good and so is Don Pepe (the owner is a great guy, and a great resource for tips)-The rain forest was the highlight of our vacation. It was beautiful.-Just a comment on Puerto Rican culture, in relation to friendliness of staff: They will treat you with as much respect as you give them. I have been to many hotels in Puerto Rico and have found that wherever you go, you get the respect you give out. Don't expect to be treated nice if you yourself have an attitude. They don't play by the same rules as in other countries. We had a great time and were treated very nicely throughout the hotel grounds.'-If you are a tennis buff, this is a great place. We signed up for the tennis clinics for $35 per person, and ended up being the only ones there, so we ended up getting a private lesson. The local Brazilian pro (Joao) is a nice guy who can teach you a lot.Bottom Line: Go, if you want a nice romantic getaway. Don't go if you are on business in San Juan or want to be in the big city every night. This is a good place for kids, too, but with very limited fast food choices to keep the budget down.
