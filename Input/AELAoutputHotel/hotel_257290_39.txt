{"text":"Great stay - worth every $ I stayed at the Wynard travelodge when travelling on business and if you can't afford the Four Seasons but want to stay near the harbour for a reasonable cost this is the place for you.I stayed up on the 21st floor at the front of the hotel - with a view of the park and the York st buildings. Decent sized room - big for Travelodge - and COMPLETELY refurbished - everything in this room is brand spanking new - shiny tiles, shiny sheets and towels even a shiny new soap holder. A large rainforest showerhead, pretty standard\/ usual toiletries, brand new flat LCD tv, broadband internet connection, ironing board, mini bar, HEAPS of storage, block out blinds - GREAT firm pillows. The only thing was that there was a vending machine outside my room door and things in there were half the price or less of the mini bar prices. Room service - pretty standard but OK. The gym room was empty of all equipment - but the TV was operating - so I suppose you could it on the floor and watch the 24hours of continuous TV in a big empty room.Being up high I had very little street noise and despite being practically on top of Wynyard Railway there was no train noise. Taxis and buses literally at the door. Service can be a bit hard to get - it's nice but at checkout in the morning there was only 1 woman and a long queueWhat can I say - great price, great location, great stay ","annotations":[{"endOffset":129,"mention":"Four Seasons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Four_Seasons_Restaurant"],"startOffset":117},{"endOffset":129,"mention":"Four Seasons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Four_Seasons_Restaurant"],"startOffset":117},{"endOffset":129,"mention":"Four Seasons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Four_Seasons_Restaurant"],"startOffset":117},{"endOffset":129,"mention":"Four Seasons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Four_Seasons_Restaurant"],"startOffset":117},{"endOffset":129,"mention":"Four Seasons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Four_Seasons_Restaurant"],"startOffset":117}]}
