{"text":"Do Not Stay at The InterContinental San Juan - Not worth the money..... I recently stayed at Intercontinental San Juan Resort and was thoroughly disappointed. I am familiar with the hotel brand and expected alot more from the hotel. I arrived at 5pm on 08\/02\/08. My room was not ready. My room was not available until after 8pm. My reservation was for a Laguna View and was made back on May 3. I received a regular room with no explanation. Upon entering the room, I noticed the bathroom was filthy. The bath tub was dirty and the bath mats were dirty as well. The refrigerator was molded and stained. The comforter was stained. I dropped a pen beside the bed and night table. When I leaned down to pick it up, there were old cookies in the floor that apparently had never been cleaned up. I was thoroughly disgusted. I didn't even unpack. I immediately went downstairs and asked for a manager. The front desk told me there was no manager available. I explained to her the situation and told her if that was best your hotel could offer at your prices I would rather find another hotel. She just stood there looking at me like I was crazy. She then told me I would have to pay for a night stay and a 100.00 penalty even though I received none of what I paid for. We stayed and our stay continued to get worse. Housekeeping left one towel an one washcloth for two people. We asked for extra towels for the next day. When they cleaned they took the extra towels we requested. The towels left were stained. While we were on the beach a worker comes over to us and tells us they start collecting the beach chairs at 5:30. The sun is still up and if you are paying $200 plus a night you should be able to stay until sunset at least. I will never stay there again.I previously stayed at the Howard Johnson and Embassy Suite much better rates, cleaner, and better staff.
