{"text":"Great value in an area with good amenities We stayed 3 nights for a wedding anniversary trip after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. Hotel appears new, modern and clean. Our room was fine (no. 400 twin beds pushed together, even though listed as a double) - if a little plain, with comfy beds, hot powerful showers. Free internet access in reception is useful for researching sights, checking e mail etc. We arrived after 10pm and asked reception about the best place to head for something to eat. We were given a map of the local area and directed toward Simon Dach str (just head out of the hotel, cross the road and turn left along Kinzigstr. When you come to the busy crossroads go diagonally onto Grunberger Str and you will come to it - about 10 - 15 minutes walk). There are loads of good value restaurants, cafe bars, and corner shops for your bottle of wine to take back to the room! You've got to try a kebab - not greasy like in the UK, lovely salad and sauce. Breakfast is usual continental standard - cereals, rolls, continental cheeses and meats and is served until10am which means we had a nice lie in each morning.All reception staff we encountered were really helpful, English speaking and pleasant. There is a left luggage room which is a bonus if you have a later flight back.Overall I would recommend you stay in this hotel for its location to local amenities (underground station 3 mins walk, and aforementioned places to eat\/drink ) and for its great value rooms and service, but its not for you if you like a picturesque stroll of a night as the street lights are dim and there is a lot of graffiti (althougth not as much as Rome).A final note on transfer from Shoenfeld Airport - if you do use the trains and U Bahn (underground) when you get off U line 5, exit in the direction of Kinzigstr. and Colbestr and then turn into Kinzigsrt. at the junction with Schamweberstr. turn left and you will be 10 mtrs from the hotel entrance. We used German Transfers for a return taxi to the airport (approx 40 mins each way) cost 46 euros.
