{"text":"Highly Recommended We have just returned from a four night stay at the Westin and we were both very impressed. We contacted the hotel before arrival via email to state that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and were contacted within a day or two to say that a corner room had been reserved. Our room was on the 37th floor and what a fabulous view. The lifts were on the floor within seconds - mind the ears! Huge room with plently of storage, hairdryer, great tv, coffee maker and last but not least the fantastic comfortable bed, we slept like babies.I've read other reviews which did worry us before we went but most of them are from fussy nit pickers! I would definately return here again. Location is great, just off Times Square so not too noisy. Breakfast is recommended down one block on 9th Ave turn right, fabulous diner with great priced breakfast. There are lots of well priced bars and restaurants on 9th Ave and the streets surrounding, as if you go back into Times Square area you will pay lots more. Walking towards Times Square along 8th is a lovely Pizza Diner with a Stone Oven which was worth a visit, not just for the great food but a lovely place to warm up on a winters day.Hop-on Hop-off Bus tours highly recommended. So is a walk around Grand Central Station - unbelieveable. Don't worry about the other negative reviews for this hotel, we have been to many high class hotels over the world and this was very nice. Locals told us that the rooms were the biggest in Manhattan and in the best location. Happy holidays.
