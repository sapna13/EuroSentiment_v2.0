{"text":"Close to all sites Upon recommendations through TA, I booked two nights here for a weekend in Florence. Staff were very knowledgable and assisted as much as they could. The rooms were decent sized, and very clean and comfortable. The bed was a surprise! It was very big, and I managed to have enough space for myself with my partner (who usually takes up 3\/4 of the bed). The room was equiped with a small LCD tv, and plenty of storage (I don't know why one of the previous reviewers were complaining about lack of furniture?). The bathroom was a bit on the small side, but very clean as well. The only small criticism we had was the water pressure, it wasn't weak, but it wasn't at full pressure either. We had a room that was facing the main road, but because of the double glazed windows (multiple layers of it too) we were not distracted by noise at all!Location wise, this hotel is very close to the Accademia (literally 2 blocks away!), with plenty of restaurants behind on the street parallel. Also if you walk straight down the other direction, you reach the Duomo, about 1.5 blocks down, and one block past Duomo is the Uffizi. There is a lot of buzz around this area, as well as shopping. Just be careful, as there are quite a number of gypsies around, and people selling counterfeit\/black market goods that may harrass you. One more thing, stay away from a self service restaurant at the corner opposite the Duomo square. Food is horrible at tourist prices - they literally just microwave your chosen dish!
