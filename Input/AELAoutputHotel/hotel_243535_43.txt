{"text":"Excellent Hotel for the right traveller! I read all the reviews before coming, and found them overall good, with a few exceptions I thought I could live with for $65 a night. I booked the 7 night for 5 night special and looked forward to it, cautiously. I was pleasantly suprised. Being a boutique hotel and not a bland and boring chain, it has a small but stylish lobby. Since I'venever once spent time in a hotel lobby while travelling I couldn't care less. What really blew us away was the absolutely perfect location of this hotel. When they say it is 2 blocks from the BART, streetcar and bus, they mean the two tiniest blocks in the world. The trolleys are 1 of those tiny blocks away. It is surrounded by excellent restaurants, coffee shops, and all the shopping and amenities a person could want.It neighbors very expensive hotels and is by far the easiest location for getting to Chinatown, Alcatraz, Fisherman's Wharf, the Castro, Haight, Financial District, and the Mission. There is no better location for a vacation to San Francisco! I love the Fusion and will definately stay here again.The entire hotel underwent an extensive 2 year renovation that completed just last year and it shows. There is beautiful granite everywhere, a very modern elevator with little tv's to watch while youwait (though it never took more than 2 minutes). Our room was tastefuland comfortable with a comfy bed, clean and well lit bathroom with an exhaust fan, and a flat screen TV with a DVD player built in. Our roomwas one of the smallest in the hotel, judging from views of other rooms as we saw them cleaned, and I wished for a dresser instead of a desk, but I did find the furnishings comfortable and nice and I was able to put our suitcase on one of those stands and live out of it. I wouldn't come here expecting a room the size of a football field, but I would expect it to be very nice.The hotel offered a continental breakfast of fruit, toast, coffee, croissants, muffins, milk and juice, and an exercise room we never used. Every room has a fan, ironing board, and iron, fairly affordablesnack bar (that we never used because the Walgreens drugstore was 1\/2 a block away), a coffee maker, hair dryer, nice towels, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and soap. If you are used to staying at bland chains you might find the possiblity of a smaller room in such a greaturban setting odd, otherwise, I woud recommend this hotel for your next trip to San Francisco.As a note too.. the hotel doesn't HAVE air conditioning, so the compaints about it's not working and it's noise are puzzling...check out the weather and maybe avoid the hotel if you require air conditioning in the hottest months of the year.
