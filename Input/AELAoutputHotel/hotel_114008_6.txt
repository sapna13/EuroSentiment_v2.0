{"text":"Lovely Property, Nice Staff, Lacking in Several Areas We just returned home from a visit to Hawaii that included a four night stay at the Kahala. Now, let me admit, I am spoiled. I like to travel and travel top of the line. We chose the Kahala because a colleague of mine was there last year and raved. We originally booked a beachfront suite and were moved to the hotel property because of rennovations. The suite we wound up in was lovely and beautiful and full oceanfront. No complaints there. However, when I received the letter from the hotel in August advising of the room change, I immediately called to question the rennovations--not wanting to be bothered with noise, dust and inconvenience. I was assured that the rennovations were a soft upgrade and that coupled with the room change we would not be affected. Well folks, they lied. Not only were the disclosed rennovations loud and disruptive, they were also installing barricades on the balconies in the building where we were moved. Drilling, pounding, scaffolding, YUCK! I called to complain and the manager on duty was more concerned about who I spoke to in August than my concerns. Shame on them.Also, be aware that because the hotel caters mostly to Japanese tourists, the pool is kept very, very warm. Not cool, not refreshing. Not hot enough to be a spa, just overly warm.The concierge did very well with activities suggestions, but completely missed the boat on off site dinner suggestions. All of the restaurants on property have a heavy asian emphasis, one night we were looking for something different, and the only suggestions were Thai, Korean or Vietnamese. I guess technically different--but not very.Staff are generally very efficient, and the food is tasty and well presented.My roommate participated in the dolphin program on site and had a spectacular time. We highly recommend it.
