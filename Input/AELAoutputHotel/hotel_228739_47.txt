{"text":"Fabulous Paris Hotel! My husband and I wanted a little getaway before Christmas so we decided on Paris. We were looking for a reasonably priced, little hotel that had non-smoking rooms and was fairly central located, but not on a busy street. This hotel was perfect for meeting all of our criteria. We arrived in the afternoon on Tues. 11-Dec and checked out on Sun. 16-Dec. We booked our room online where we found they were offering a winter special rate - we paid apprx 950 Euros for 5 nights, which we felt was a good rate. The hotel is located in the Trocadero area which an affluent, primarily residential area which is very quite and within walking distance from the Tour de Eiffel. The hotel staff were absolutely fabulous! They were very welcoming and helpful....cannot say enough good things about them.The entire hotel has been refurbished in 2006 and is all non-smoking. Additionally it has air-conditioning for the summer months. Our room was modern, well appointed, and good size by European standards. The comfort of the bed was acceptable (definitely not the Heavenly Bed at the Westin) - would have given 5 stars if the bed was fabulous. The bathroom was new and clean. They provide you with L'Occitane en Provence products (shampoo, conditioner, soap, and body lotion). There is a flat panel TV in the room and their cable service offers two English speaking channels √à√\u2020\u2022?CNN for news and a general BBC channel with various prgms.The hotel has a restaurant for breakfast √à√\u2020\u2022?14 Euros per person. We tried their buffet once and it was ok and suitable if you are short on time and require breakfast in the hotel before you leave. They offered the usual breads, cold meats, pastries, yoghurt, fresh whole fruit (e.g. apples, oranges) and canned fruit (e.g. pineapple). They also offered scrambled eggs and bacon. We had much better breakfasts from cafes in the area √à√\u2020\u2022?much better value for money as well. Overall this is a wonderful little hotel and we would definitely stay here again.
