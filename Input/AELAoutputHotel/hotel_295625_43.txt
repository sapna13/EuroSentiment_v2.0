{"text":"Avoid this hotel We had two rooms, the first was on the street side Nationale Street. If you like sirens, motor scooter engines, and loud drunks all night across the street in the park, then you will enjoy this room. Even with the window closed, it was very loud.The second room was on the backside of the hotel and we paid extra for a view. What a joke, the view was of old Florence apartments with hanging dirty laundry and dumpsters. To see the Duomo, you would have to lean way out of the window and strain your neck.The rooms are small boxes and allow no sitting area except sitting on your bed. The breakfast is mostly prepackaged items from the dollar grocery store down the street. the location is within walking distance of the hotel ONLY if you have no bags. The street sidewalk is very narrow and you will not enjoy stepping into the street to walk with your luggage. If you get a cab, know this :CAB DRIVERS IN FLORENCE ARE THIEVES.We have rented taxi's throughout Europe with no problem however if this hotel calls a cab for you, the meter starts at the time the hotel calls. It could take 10 minutes for the cab to arrive and you paid for it. The drivers also claim to not speak english which is absolutely incorrect. I suggest that you agree to a price BEFORE stepping into the cab. I wish someone had told me this info.Check your bill at check-out, we had some incidental charges that were not ours and had to be adjusted off the bill.It is obvious that this hotel knows their guest clientele stays only once and never returns. Don't fall for this hotel, you will thank me later. ","annotations":[]}
