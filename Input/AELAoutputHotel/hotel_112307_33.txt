{"text":"Great stay at the Rex We tacked on a visit to San Francisco before attending a conference at Stanford in Palo Alto. We picked the Rex primarily because of the solid reviews it had, but also because of the chain it belongs to, and because of its library theme. We were happy with the results.Our first night didn't go too well -- on arrival, we were told that the hotel was overbooked (actually, one guest had asked for an additional night). The Rex sent us to a nearby hotel -- about 15 minutes walk -- for the night, and paid for a taxi and breakfast the next morning. The substitute hotel - the Galleria Park - was fine. The next morning, we walked back to the Rex and checked in. For the first two nights we were in a very comfortable, quiet room at the back of the hotel, but with a Queen bed. For the last three nights we switched to a bigger room with a King bed, but it was noisier.In both cases, the rooms were comfortable and well maintained. The bathrooms were generous, and each room had a CD player, which was a nice touch. Admittedly, we didn't spend much time in the room but late at night, when we got back, exhausted, it was a comfortable place to rest up.We spent a little time one afternoon reading in the lounge and lobby, which was very comfortable, atmospheric, and full of books. We ate at the attached restaurant only once, for breakfast, and it was very good. There are plenty of other restaurants nearby.All in all, an excellent stay, with attentive, friendly staff. We would definitely stay there again. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1028,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1024}]}
