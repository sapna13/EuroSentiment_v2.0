{"text":"Kudos to Excellence PC My husband and I traveled down to the DR for two weeks to celebrate our honeymoon, 40th birthday, graduation and a promotion. So as you can see we had a lot to celebrate. We arrived Nov 22nd and our taxi driver (arranged by a local on trip advisor) was waiting with a sign (our names on it). He whisked us away to paradise. The road is a little funky, but I have been on worse. Yes it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ about an hour to get there, but it is cool to look around and see the area before you get to your hotel. Get your driver to stop for Cervezas on the way.Upon arrival you are greeted with a welcome home, and we were upgraded right away to a beautiful room overlooking the cascade pool.I won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go on and on about the service, you are going to have to take my word. It was fabulous. I can honestly say I have no complaints. Thanks to all staff (amazing crew), I will mention Benjamin, Ines and Jenny for there outstanding contribution to making our trip that good. The dinner on the beach for $150.00 extra was well worth it. We did this for my birthday and what a great memory. Before dinner we went to our room to shower and change to find the hotel had gone in and ran a Jacuzzi, had balloons, candles, banners and a birthday cake waiting for me. How cool is that!!!!!!!!!Information - don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be alarmed after a week sometimes the key card needs to be re swiped, takes 2 minutes to run to the front desk to get that fixed. Our last night the safe wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ open, so we called the front desk and someone was there within 10 minutes. That is service, and in most hotels in Canada you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get service that quick.√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®√î??\u201A√á¬®?The resorts food was some of the best I have ever tasted at an all-inclusive resort. My personal favorites were Chez Isabelle√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ and Spice. For all you that like to have the occasional romantic evening in the room, the room service was fabulous and they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mind delivering extra beer.The beach was beautiful, very well groomed daily. There was a red flag everyday, but that never stopped us as we had a riot playing in the waves. Watch the sand flees as those little things bite a lot; unfortunately you will not know you have been bitten until later in the evening.Note: Please remove your sunglasses and body jewelry. We saw many people lose there stuff to the ocean.The only excursion we did was the Caribbean festival; it was fun to swim with sharks and rays. The trip is over an hour to get there and honestly wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ do it again but we still had fun.Suggestions to bring:Soap - bodyShampoo and conditioner √à√\u2020\u2022?you will want your ownMulti vitamins √à√\u2020\u2022?you will need to replenish your bodyHydrocortisone √à√\u2020\u2022?for any bug bitesAdvil √à√\u2020\u2022?for those morningsClamato √à√\u2020\u2022?for you CanadiansSmall first aid kit for those bumps and scrapes √à√\u2020\u2022?mostly bandages and polysporinBug spray √à√\u2020\u2022?min 30 deetLots of suntan lotion √à√\u2020\u2022?at least a 30 and I travel a lot and needed itThe most important thing of all is to bring a great attitude.We brought our sippy cups but honestly never even brought them out. The cups are nice sizes and your drinks seem to get replaced every time you even got close to the bottom of the glass.Other guests - we met people from all over the world (to many names to mention) and I must say thank you to all of you for contributing to our vacation and memories. It was an honor to meet you all.I would highly recommend this resort to anyone.I forgot to mention how nice it was not to have to worry about children!!!!!!!To all traveling have a safe and relaxing trip wherever you go.Please don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hesitate to PM me if you have any questions or concerns.CheersSmiley ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1260,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1256},{"endOffset":1260,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1256},{"endOffset":3153,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3149}]}
