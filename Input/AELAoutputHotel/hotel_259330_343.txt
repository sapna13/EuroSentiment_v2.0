{"text":"We had a very good time We were there from January 24th till January 28th.I was a little worried after reading the reviews, because my friends wanted to go to the Tropical Princess and my agent recommended Grand Paradise. We were 3 couples and we had a fantastic vacation. Nothing went wrong from the minute I left home till I came back and I think this is the difference beetween a good review and a bad review.In 2000 we went to Iberostar Dominicana in Punta Cana and in 2001 and 2004 I went to Cuba. I have nothing to complain about this resort.The big difference I see beetween Iberostar and Grand Paradise it is the buffet. At Iberostar we had more choices but the wine was not good. For the rest, it was almost the same. Oh at the Iberostar we had an elevator.Airport : No problem there. It took around 30 to 45 minutes to get the suitcases and an other 40 minutes to get to the hotel.When we arrived at the hotel, we asked to be together and Jose check and gave us what we asked for. So we were in building 6. We were closed but not beside each other and it was OK with everybody.The rooms were very clean, I had towells, faceclothes, water, coke and I asked the made to have one extra pillow and diet coke. She got me 3 extra pillows and a 2l of diet coke the same day I asked. The hair dryer was not working, finally I told her on wednesday and the same afternoon it was working.Everything we asked, we got it. We had hot water and pressure everyday at every hour.Yes the room are old and so what, we are there to sleep.We did not see any bugs or otherthing in the room. On thursday they fumigate the rooms for the bug. you can accept or refuse the service.The buffet was good and enough choices for everybody. We ate salad, meat, dessert etc...My husband was sick one day, but it was because of the heat and may be to much cerveza :) He didn't drink enough water. He drank Sprite for one day and was ok.The wheater, the beach, the pool, the scenery, everything was perfect. Sorry if I made mistakes in my english, but I'm French Canadian One of the review said that they were a lot of French Canadian, yes it is true, but there was also a lot of English, German, French from France. My first language is french but also speak english . If someone is annoying you, find an other place or have an open mind. After all you are there to relax.What I think is, no matter where you go, you can have the best or worst week of vacation. If you read the reviews of the 5 stars hotels, you will also have very bad comments.Have a nice week and don't worry be happy :).
