{"text":"Skeptical but pleasantly suprised! I think most of the reviews I read were written before the renovations so I was a little apprehensive about staying here. But I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The days prior to my stay, I was at the Sheraton in Old San Juan for business. Then I switched to the Condado because it had a nicer pool, a beach area and it was less expensive. -The hotel lobby and rooms are very trendy, brand new and beautiful. - The beach area is small and overlooks a highway, but it's nice enough. I wouldn't suggest going to this hotel if you are a beach person rather than a pool person. The pool area is wonderful and clean.-The staff is, overall, pleasant. They spoke better english at this hotel than at the Sheraton Old San Juan.-Beautiful gym, business center and other communal areas.-Don't bet on using the free wireless internet in the rooms. It is sh*t.-The hotel restaurants were OK (I would suggest walking down the road a little to more quaint and authentic restaurants). First day, I went to the Italian restaurant upstairs for a sandwich which was OK - next night went to StripHouse, the steak restaurant. It was a nice meal, although the steak was not cooked the way I wanted. StripHouse was very pricey considering the quality and service. -While it seemed like most of the construction was done, there were some areas that still have construction ongoing, specifically outside. The Laguna Tower, where I stayed, seemed to be finished. It was beautiful.-Casino is OK. It's what you would expect of a small hotel casino in San Juan. It's on Vegas or even Atlantic City...Overall, good stay! I would suggest staying here!
