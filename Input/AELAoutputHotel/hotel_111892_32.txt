{"text":"A bet that paid off My wife and I, along with our 4 year old daughter, escaped the cold weather of the northeast to spend a few days on south beach and bring in the new year. We had read the mixed reviews on TripAdvisor, visitedthe Marseilles' website (which we were impressed with), and spoken with a few friends who travel to Miami Beach frequently. Our well-informed gamble paid off! From the moment we pulled up to the hotel until our much lamented departure (it's tough putting away sandals and bathing suit, knowing you'll soon be donning gloves and a scarf), we felt like VIP guests. One of the bell boys helped with our bags and rental car (valeted intoa gated lot 1 block away) while another entertained our daughter long enough for us to gather loose items and get our bareings. My wife and daughter had a seat in the tv lounge near the bar while I checked in.Our ocean-front room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. We were frustrated with the lack of a balcony (fotos from the website led me to believe the rooms had balconies)... and the fact that the windows would not open, so I called down to lodge my complaint. It was explained to me that they do in fact have rooms with balconies, but that they are slightly more expensive luxury suites and only have a partial view of the beach, as they are not beachfront rooms. The hotel was at full capacity, but the gentleman at the front desk explained that he would gladly show me one of the rooms, but that while he would try his best to move us if that's what we wished to do,he couldn't promise that we could make the move. Feeling sure that I wouldn't want to cough up the extra money even if we could get the room, I took him up on the offer to see it. Long story short, we dealtwith the lack of a balcony, but now I know that the next time my wife and I want a romantic getaway, we will call the Marseilles and book one of the suites (big jacuzzi, nice stereo system ... and the balcony!). So, what else did we like?1) tasty breakfast on the outdoor patio in front of the hotel, providing an enviable spot for people-watching on Collins Avenue. Something about the patio gave the place a bit of a bed  breakfast like atmosphere, where we ended up having interesting conversation with folks from all over the globe virtually every morning. Because of the convenience factor, not to mention the reasonable prices of thefood, we only slipped away for a splurge on Lincold Rd once. 2) given our daughter's lack of affinity for sand and salt water, we spent a lot of time at the pool, and the awesome little hammock-laden area at the back of the property near the gate to the boardwalk. Our daughter played with friends on the playground (basically a small exercise complex\/jungle gym) while we sipped mojitos and relaxed in the nearby hammocks. The pool was adequate, but nothing to rave about.3) the outdoor bar ... and bartender. Although the food menu is very limited, we thoroughly enjoyed the burgers, buffalo wings, and fries.The waiter\/bartender we always dealt with was an Ecuadorian fellow by the name of Moses. He took care of us, and seemed to be keeping everyone else happy as well. During the weekend and on New Year's Eve there was a dj out by the bar playing music that was a little louder than we cared for, and not necessarily our style, but the younger crowd, especially the Europeans, really seemed to be enjoying. Over breakfast the next morning we were told that the dj kept the crowd going and growing until finally pulling the plug around 3am. I'm assuming that was a unique situation, as we never heard the dj during evening hours on any of the other nights of our stay.One piece of advice: if you happen to be there on one of the rare nights when it is actually cold in Miami Beach (it got down into the 30s during our stay), don't look for the heat switch; there isn't one!We called down to ask for an extra blanket, which we quickly got, and found out that they have a limited number of space heaters for such occassions, which served us well until the cold spell passed! Almost forgot - I got a great massage in one of the cabanyas out by the pool area. The room was a little stuffy, but the massage therapist, whose name I didn't catch, was excellent.
