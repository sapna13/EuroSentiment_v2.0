{"text":"Not a chance we'd go back As honeymooners my husband as I stayed at Secrets from June 25-July 2.We stayed in an ocean view room near the cascade pool-the smaller pool. The weather was so hot and humid almost unbearable to lay out in the sun without getting sweat drenched, we should have known booking something in July!I am not one to lay out in the sun or lounge all day. I need action and activities. We did participate in some of the daily entertainment but I got tired of volunteering and participating. So we took the outback safari excursion one day, it was a time filler. I would have liked to be able to shop or tour around but this was not the place. If you are looking for no shopping, complete seclusion, then this is the place for you. The food was okay. I didn't starve by any means. My husband and I didn't care for the Mexican restaurant, our hometown place was much better. We ate at the French restaurant twice, not that impressed, the food was saltly and just okay. We enjoyed the Japanese restaurant and ate there three times, the sushi bar was great. We also enjoyed the seafood place and ate their twice.We didn't go to the Italian place or the Dominican place, just didn't appeal to us. My husband and I both got sick for a few days during the trip. We didn't drink the water so we aren't sure what caused it. All in all the place was very nice, we enjoyed the evening entertainment, the staff was very nice, but I wouldn't go back. ","annotations":[]}
