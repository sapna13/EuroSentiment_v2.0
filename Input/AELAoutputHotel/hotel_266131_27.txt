{"text":"Hotel with a view outside the city center I stayed at Hotel La Florida for one night on September 18th, 2007. As a Leaders Club member I made my reservation through Leading Hotels, the rate for a standard room was 246,10 Euro taxes and breakfast included.There are many nice but also some negative aspects so that I rate this hotel in total with three stars (=neutral\/average compared to other top class hotels).But in detail: On the good side were- a prompt doorman service, luggage transfer, personal check-in with a glass of champagne,- guidance to the room with nice introduction to the hotel facilities and history,- upgrade to room no. 501 with Barcelona view and a spacious bath with impressive shower stall, tub and separate toilet,- personal welcome card in room (in my native language), a complimentary bottle of water, fruits and a welcome gift (Zen candle stick),- very nice and clean spa with indoor-\/outdoor pool,- cozy atmosphere in the whole hotel and plenty of staff,- restaurant L'Orangerie with good value for money (solid six course tasting menu for 64,20 Euro),- turn down with additional bottles of complimentary water,- free internet access and many copies of international papers in the lobby.On the other hand there were some negative aspects:- the hotel is located in the nowhere of Barcelona, a complimentary shuttle service runs a few times a day but all seats for all shuttles during my stay were already booked when I checked in (at about 3 pm - the maximum capacity are six seats per shuttle only!),- one finally has to use taxis when going to downtown Barcelona what takes first about 15 minutes until a taxi arrives and furthermore costs about 30 to 40 Euro for a return trip to the city center in total (the taxi drivers bill the arrival as well so you start with an amount of 5 to 6 Euro),- there was no clock in the room - not even in the TV or telephone display - and the staff wasn't able to organize any watch or alarm clock during my stay (I had this unusual experience one night before at Casa Fuster Hotel, they finally provided a clock but failed in other things),- there was no shoehorn or any shoe cleaning item in the room and a shoe shine wasn't done overnight (although I placed my shoes outside the door at about 11pm),- annoying minibar pricing: a Coke (0,2 l) costs 8,56 Euro (!) and you won't find any other shops or foodstores in the neighbourhood,- there was no DVD player available, not even on request,- there was plenty of young staff, very friendly but inefficient (e.g. no help with the clock, not even a response\/ the headwaiter at L'Orangerie first showed a half board card which wasn't valid for me, came back with the regular card and after request with a tasting menu offer but didn't know what was included in the tasting menu\/ the cutlery wasn't replaced as there were no towells replaced in the spa although there were up to four employees around...)Anyhow a nice hotel but not a leader in the hotel business. When you accept the mentioned disadvantages and be prepared staying outside of Barcelona it might be okay.
