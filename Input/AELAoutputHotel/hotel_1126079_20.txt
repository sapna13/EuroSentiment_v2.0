{"text":"Compared to the Sheraton... We like to stay near the Schiphol terminal the night before our flight, it makes traveling so much more relaxed.So far we stayed in the Sheraton as it was the only hotel within WALKING distance. Now citizenM was built almost next to the Sheraton.Because of the much cheaper price, we tried the citizenM this time.My husband (68 years of age) doesnot want to return to citizenM next time. He dislikes the smallness of the room; the minimalist cupboard space; the tiny sink; the absence of an easy chair or table; the wall to wall bed, that needs one partner to climb over the other to leave the bed; the toilet that you can visually separate from the bed with a curtain, but that is definitely not SOUND proof; the overly complicated way (one remote) to adjust lights and temperature and tv and alarm!!! and curtains and.... with MANY not very well ducumented options.I (50) would consider comming back because of the price.Both hotels are well insulated against noise from outside the rooms. The Sheraton has a direct connection to the terminal whereas from citizenM you have to walk the pavement but this is mostly covered by a canopy.Breakfastbuffet at the Sheraton is very good indeed and the d√ã√\u2022√ñcor in the breakfastroom was fascinating (although there have been transformations they say), but is expensive. Breakfast at CitizenM is expensive too, and cannot compete with the Sheraton. The dinner\/snack options in the canteen are not very clear and overpriced.For (other) meals we usually use one of the very many venues in the terminal, but the cheapest and cosiest way is of course, to buy your own groceries at Albert Heijn in the terminal, and picknick in your room! You definitely will have crumbs in your BED at citizenM though! ","annotations":[]}
