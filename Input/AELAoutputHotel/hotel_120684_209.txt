{"text":"Really enjoyed it! My husband, son (19) and I just returned from Honolulu at the end of last week and had gone to Turtle Bay Resort for the first part of the trip and then decided to spend 3 nights in Waikiki at the Outrigger. We really enjoyed ourselves. The service was excellent in the resort as well as in Duke's, the restaurant, on the premises. We ate breakfast there one day, dinner their one night and lunches every day. You couldn't beat the ocean view from Duke's. Our room was a partial ocean view. It was fine except there wasn't a full bathtub--only a half-bath with shower. Everything was very well maintained but could do with a facelift. The lounges around the pool were a little tired and unfortunately there were no umbrellas around the pool if you wanted shade. You would have to rent them on the beach for $50U.S. The location on Waikiki Beach was perfect. Lots to look at in the evenings after dinner--shopping etc. One of the things we appreciated most about the Outrigger was that they gave us a room to shower and get ready for our late flight on our last day. We weren't flying out until 1:30 a.m. and had to check out in the morning so they stored our luggage and when we were ready to shower and leave they gave us a room for 30 minutes to get ready. This was wonderful. Would recommend this resort for those wanting to take in Waikiki Beach! ","annotations":[]}
