{"text":"Very nice hotel, helpful staff We stayed at the Royal Magda for a friend's wedding in October. Overall, we enjoyed our stay there thoroughly and were very happy with the helpfulness of the desk staff. We would stay there again in the future if the prices do not increase (we did have the benefit of a group rate from the wedding).The hotel has recently been refurbished and has genuinely comfortable bathrooms, at least in the suite where we stayed with our 2 year old son. Breakfast in the room at the same price as downstairs was a plus. For a 3 star hotel in the center of Paris, the prices are not bad at all. The location is very convenient to the metro and to the Air France CDG bus. I do wish that we had taken them up on their suggestion of the little brightly red painted french restaurant next door open since 2000 painted tongue in cheek on the outside. The in room safe was vulnerable to reprogramming by our two year old son (what would not be?), but despite being very busy, the hotel staff was able to make an emergency visit to unlock it for us so that we could dress for the wedding. Aparently they were ranked number 1 in Paris hotels on tripadvisor prior to the unfortunate incident where they had to relocate a guest due to the illness of a baby staying at the hotel. The desk staff explained that the incident resulted in an unavoidable inconvenience for the other party who had reserved the room. As a parent, I'd have to say that I side with the hotel on that decision. I recommend this hotel.
