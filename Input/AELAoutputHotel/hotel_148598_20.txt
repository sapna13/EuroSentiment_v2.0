{"text":"Great resort, lousy food and service We stayed here for a conference\/family vacation. The resort grounds are very nice and well kept. We were always in the family pool and enjoyed it, although I wish there was a swim-up bar. My 3-year old enjoyed the pool and feeding the iguanas a couple times. The beach is not clean at all, but the water was clear and the lounge chairs are nice on the beach. We had an ocean view suite, and we could barely see the ocean. It was so damp in our room that we asked them to either fix it or move us, and they sent someone up to look at the room. That person recommended we just turn the temperature down lower. The room was quite disappointing, given that we paid more than $300 a night. It was small and outdated. The food at the hotel was ABSOLUTELY horrible, except for the pizza and burgers. We ate at 3 of the restaurants and were not impressed at all. We enjoyed Los Antejitos though, which is only a 5-minute drive away. The only thing worse than the food was the customer service, which was completely absent. We rented a car and drove into Old San Juan, which was fun, and went to the outlet mall, which was very nice. We also went to Amigo to purchase water and snacks and I would recommend that, as prices are high in the hotel.Overall, this hotel is overpriced and the service was terrible. The grounds were very nice and the weather was great.
