{"text":"Alot of contradictions! Third stop in the Islands after stops in Maui and Big Island. First the hotel itself - nice hotel, parking is a challenge and they charge you $24 a day to struggle with this very narrow parking garage. rip off! The breakfast buffett was okay, but they did something very smart. Waikiki is full of Japanese tourists and the restaraunt put the Japanese breakfast favorites on their own table, with labels in Japanese. Our room was very nice with two balconies. However, we had a large screen TV - it was High Def - but fuzzy channels. Why bother? Honolulu itself was a huge let down. First - Waikiki beach is beautiful and right across the street, but it is covered with homeless people. We saw a homeless man peeing right in the middle of the major thoroughfare. Some were quiet and minded their own business and others made everyone very uncomfortable. These people are clearly mentally ill and need help and Honolulu does nothing. Traffic is terrible there. You can see the highway, but they hide the on-ramps. Also - they dont really believe in road signs either, because we would miss exits since they gave no indication that these exits were upcoming. The best meals were found at the Ala Mauna mall. Went to Hawaii and had to go to the mall to get a decently priced meal!Pearl Harbor was good, but you are better off watching something about the Arizona on the History Channel. We went to the Missouri, which was awesome and you can see the Arizona easily from the decks of the Mo. However, at noon, we were told the Arizona trips were full for the day. Seems you have to get your free tickets very early in the morning. Get out of Honolulu and go to the North Shore. Amazing scenery ","annotations":[{"endOffset":115,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":111}]}
