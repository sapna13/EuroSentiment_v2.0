{"text":"Loved This Resort We just got back from this resort. We went there to get married and brought 31 guest along with us. This resort is very big but accommodated our guests very well and gave us all different things to do and places to go.The pools were beautiful and we always found a group of lounges.The restaurants were amazing.We had our wedding at the Garden grill and that was the best! The steak was great and the meal and service was excellent.I also enjoyed the japanese restaurant.Many of our guests loved the French too.I enjoyed this resort and would recommend it to anyone.The trolly is always running but if you stay Club Diamond the walk is nice most of time as that's what we choose.It is sort of between the beach and the main lobby.If you would like to get married there it was amazing.Marianna and her assistants were so helpful and I am so happy with everything.Our wedding was beautiful and Jorge did a great job on our pictures .The ages of our group ranged from 27-70 so it was a wide aged group and everyone's reviews were great reviews from our group!This resort was the best i have stayed at and we enjoyed every second!The trip home was another story.Beware if you fly at nght with Skyservice.If they are late they will land and lay you over if they were late to pick you up and your airport has a noise by-law..always double check that..we were to fly in at 12:59am if we were on time, but they were late so it was 2am and Montreal would not except us.We stayed for 6 hours at the hamilton airport before boarding the same plane and did not return home until 2 pm Sunday back to Montreal.We had left the Punta Cana airport at 9:15pm..Beware of Skyservice and late departures.We had no idea this happens.
