{"text":"Not a Good Option the Grand Paradise Bavaro We book this hotel through Yahoo Travel, we knew it was not a 5 stars hotel but, the reviues were not bad. The experience was terrible. 1) Hotel buildings and growns are really nice, the beach is wonderful, the main swiming pool was clean and nice gardens were very well keep2) Rooms: Basic dont ask for more than a bed (not good) just a table 2 chairs not in good conditions TV very old and you have to ask for tvcontrol at lobby, frig empty have to give some money to the maid to put some cokes in it, and they just give you 2 per day, for towels we need to be calling room service to bring them, we didnt got hot water, lights were minimun it was more like been in a cave3) Meals: terrible I m a chef and I can tell you all the food was the worst I have had in a long time. The main buffet was oughhh really terrible bad options, it look as the food has been waiting for long hours, basic options, all the things done frites were dark and tasted bad as the oil has been used for long time, bad pre ntation bad taste, bad by all means4)Restaurants: you have to really go fast for bookings if not you are out to get them, at the reservation desk they dont have the menues, they tell you to go and see them by yourself to know what they offer, that means you have to go all arround the buildings to see what they offer, when you go back to the reservation desk is cloose.5)They dont have any map for the hotel instalations so you dont know where things are6) If you dont keep moving arround you dont have any information about the activities going on, when you get to know them you arrive late or they are cancel because there was no people to do them. The show we shaw was really terrible we are still trying to undestand what it was.7) Front desk: was not bad they tried to do their best but didnt had all they need to work. They keep trying to fix problems all the time so they are overdone with problems and can give a good reception. 8)All the staff at the hotel are quite to friendly this brings to an unpleasant way of treatment as they sometimes goes for more than just good service, they are like flies all the time arround you ofering more then the hotel service. They are allways claiming for tips. If you tip them all the time things get better, they offer you better food, better drinks better rooms, better internet, better , better. What it sufers is you wallet, if you like this better bring quite a lot of small bills to get arround9) There are new building call The Club it is been said there are better but there are far from the beach, the pool there was really nice and the instalations there new bars, casino and buffet look better then the others.10) If you dont like stairs, better request for rooms on groungfloor, as there are no lift for the upper floors, and you have to walk arround a lot to get from the boulding to the restaurants, buffets and attractions, it is not a place to go is you have health problems.11) You you dont eat suggar bring some subtitues as they dont have many arround. Diets drinks are not very comon for them, just Diet Coke when they have it12) Pay if you can a little more and go to other hotels there are a lot arround and well that is what we do We change hotel we prefer to loose some money but get better stay in other hotel, we went just for 4 nights 5 days, the second hotel was wonderful really we are plaing to go back next year.
