{"text":"No French TV, no room-service and breakfast from 7am On the positive side was the friendly lady when I arrived, the room was clean and I slept very well without being disturbed by trafic, despite the fact that the hotel is close to a grand boulevard.I arrived back at the hotel at 9 p.m. and asked for room service as I had not yet eaten. I was informed by a less friendly male receptionist there there was no room service, so I had to go out and get something elsewhere. Not a big problem, even though it was raining, but I went out to get something to bring back to the hotel for a TV dinner. I was surprised that 4 star hotel does not have any French TV channels (in Paris, France), but only CNN, Skynews (which in themselves are good) and 2 Spanish and 1 Italian channel. Having my train in the morning, I was again surprised to find that they start serving breakfast only at 7 a.m. Most hotels, having business men and travellers as clientel usually start at 6 or at the latest 6.30.When checking out, the same male receptionist was again not very friendly and there were no questions or concern whatsoever about whether the stay was pleasant or if everything was satisfactory. When waiting for the credit card transaction to go through, he was looking through other papers and again paid no attention to his guest.Again, I did sleep well but other than that, a very mediocre experience.
