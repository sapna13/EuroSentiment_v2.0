{"text":"Like a second home My husband and I, my elderly parents, and another couple booked rooms at the Hotel Colomba for five nights in October, 2008. I stayed there with my daughter two years ago and knew I would go back if I ever had the chance to travel in Italy again. The hotel is close to the Medici-Riccardi Palace, the Duomo, the Accademia, and San Lorenzo and there is a bus stop just outside the door for several local bus routes. I remembered the rooms were airy and spacious, and meticulously clean. The breakfasts were great and the conversation over breakfast with our hosts was even better.The owner\/ managers of this small hotel succeeded once again this Fall in making our experience of Florence better in every way. They picked rooms that suited the needs of my parents for quietness and accessibility, helped us send laundry out when necessary and translated the mysterious messages on our Italian cell phones for us when we couldn't figure them out. Their attention to our needs went way above and beyond the expected.The support staff were equally eager to help whenever they could to make reservations for us at museums, call cabs, and suggest restaurants. They even helped with finding a doctor who could make a visit (same-day) to the hotel when my mother fell ill during our trip.We were in and out all day long when various people in our party needed to rest and every single time we came past the desk we were greeted by someone with a smile and an answer to a question if we had one. If you are looking for a place to call home in Florence you could not make a better choice than the Hotel Colomba.
