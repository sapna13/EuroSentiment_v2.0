{"text":"Our Honeymoon was Excellent! Our honeymoon at Secrets Excellence was great! After reading some of the reviews on this site, I was a little nervous for our trip, but the resort was great, and we had an excellent time. Top reasons to go to Secrets Excellence:1) The beach is awesome, and definitely the best part of the entire resort! The beach is very wide and very clean. The ocean is a beautiful tropical blue-ish, green and there were waves - but the gentle kind of waves that you could jump and not be knocked over. We only had one day when there were alot of bugs... and that was just because the wind changed directions.2) The employees at Secrets are some of the nicest people I've ever met. They enjoy when you attempt a little Spanish (even if you only know how to say bien or excellente). If you say, Thank you, they always respond with It's a pleasure.3) It's completely relaxing. After the exhausting few weeks leading up to our wedding, we were excited to just lay by the pool and the beach and take long naps in the afternoon. This was definitely the place to do that!Things you should know before you go:1) You don't have to tip, but the staff appreciates it when you do. It's totally up to you.2) You can't drink the tap water because it isn't treated - it's only for showering and brushing your teeth. The resort uses bottled water in all the restaurants and it is available at any bar.3) We were told to limit our intake of the fruit each day. Our travel agent told us that too many fruity cocktails or too much pineapple, bananas or coconuts would cause an upset stomach - we limited our intake and we were fine. (This is because the fruits are treated differently [chemically] than the fruits you are used to in the USA.)4) The Excellence Club and the Honeymoon package are worth it. The staff in the Excellence Club were extremely helpful and kind. When we checked in at the normal check-in, we were told to wait and within minutes a concierge from the Excellence Club met us, gave us a brief tour, and took us for private check-in. We were greeted with champagne, appetizers and a cold cloth to cool down. Our bags were waiting in our room when we got there. 5) The private dinner on the beach is totally worth it. The steak was the best piece of meat we ate the entire time, and again, the staff serving the meal was great.6) If you are a pool person and like to float in the pool, get up early to claim a raft. There are a limited number, and were usually taken by about 9:00 AM.7) The mini-bar consists of some soda and four beers (El Presidente and Budweiser). There is no hard alcohol in it. Bud Lite is available upon request at many of the bars.The only thing that could have been better about our trip was the food. It's not that any of the food was bad, it's just that it wasn't great. There were plenty of options, and we didn't get sick from any of it. Like someone wrote in another review, if you want your favorite meal from your neighborhood restaurant, go to your neighborhood restaurant. It was actually sort of nice not to be served the obscenely large portions you usually get in the U.S., they serve normally sized portions at Secrets.We would definitely recommend Secrets to other honeymoon couples. Hope you enjoy your trip as much as we did!
