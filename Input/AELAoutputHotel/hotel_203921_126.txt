{"text":"I'll stay here again I'd give everything about this hotel high marks. It's location is perfect -- it's far enough outside of the bustling tourist center to feel like a refuge, but within easy walking distance of the Duomo, Uffizi, and other major sights. The hotel is also a short walk from Piazza Michaelangelo, which provides some pretty spectacular vistas of Florence. Our room was comfortable, quiet, and nicely appointed, and I loved the deep bathtub (perfect for a long soak after walking around all day -- although you should note that not all rooms have bathtubs. We just got lucky). In the morning, there's a huge spread for breakfast (included with your room cost) with cakes, pastries, coffee, juices, cereal, fruit, meats, and cheese. Staff will even make you a cappuccino if you ask. In the evening, there's a lovely set-up with free wine and snacks in the common room. Other nice touches: free wifi in all of the rooms; courtesy umbrellas by the door that you can borrow if the weather turns; a cozy common room with a fireplace; lots of periodicals and novels lying around for you to read (quite a few in English -- and good stuff. I saw both National Geographic and a Jose Sarramago novel); and a little bar off to the side where you can get a glass of wine or cappuccino for one euro any time of the day. The staff was also friendly and helpful -- they'll make your reservations for the Uffizi and Academie (to see David) upon your request, and on our last day, allowed us to leave the car in the parking lot after we checked out so we could see a few more sights without having to deal with the hassle of moving the car (and the risk of parking it in a public place w\/ our luggage inside). A spotless, comfortable room and top-notch service -- I'd definitely stay here again.
