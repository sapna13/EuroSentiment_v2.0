{"text":"Great hotel, good location I travelled to Barcelona with a friend, and we chose this hotel mainly because it looked very different from your average hotel, we liked the boutique-style, and we got a very good deal on it through the airline.Had read some negative comments about the location, but to be honest, I don't know what they're on about. The hotel is on Plaza Espanya, you can see the metro station from the entrance, and using that, you get anywhere within minutes. We usually went out to eat in the Passeig De Gracia area, and walking back from there was no problem, it took us about 20 minutes, just following the Gran Via.The hotel decor is really something else, they've really made it look like something a lot more expensive than it really is. the bathrooms are quite something, we actually had to phone reception and get instructions on the shower taps. There were a few minor things like some scratches in the flooring and a couple of loose threads on the bedspread, but all in all the room was spacious, comfortable, well-presented and CLEAN.The overall feel of the hotel is that they do try to make an extra effort, for instance the toilets in the public areas all have real towels instead of paper tissues, and free internet access is provided. The rooftop pool is also quite something.The breakfast is not at all bad, but included more sweet pastries and cakes than real food, so most days we just had food from nearby cafes, or from the supermarket practically next door. We stayed for a week, and I'd be happy to go back at any time.
