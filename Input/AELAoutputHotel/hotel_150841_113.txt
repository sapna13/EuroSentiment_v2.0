{"text":"Excellent stay. Highly recommend We vacationed at the Iberostar from May 25th - 28th. For those on considering this property...just go. My wife and I went for our anniverasary and had a wonderful time. The reviews are correct. Very clean, staff very friendly, food choices plentiful and good. Drinks abundant. It is a large property and it appears that during this time the occupancy was about 50%. Recommendations: Do email the hotel in advance and dont be shy. about a request. We requested a second floor, oceanview, away from construction, with a king bed. When we arrived the desk person had the email and we had an awesome room assignment. I think it was 2363 (still fuzzy from the drinks!)Lunch buffet in the main restaurant was almost empty with great choices while the pool buffet was more crowded.Tip $2 dollars a day and beers and waters will fill your fridge.Choose Bavaro over the other properties This was noticeably an upgrade from the other two iberostar properties.Lobster salad at the gourment restuarant was awesome.Massage was actually very relaxing - $25 for 1\/2 hour. Ignore the porters at the airport unless you want them to transport your suitecase 20 ft.Drink the pina coladas in moderation since they are made there with cocunut milk and serve as a laxative to some. Just advice from one of the staff there.Stick to bottled water but you can brush your teeth with the room water.You can have a busy vacation with all the activiites...archery, spanish lessons, volleyball, step classes etc. or you can drink like a fish and sunbath under an umbrella all day long.The beach is beautiful and great for walks. many topless women which may offend or excite some. Gentlemen, no Carmen Electra or Pam Anderson running on the beach so dont get your hopes up.Pick this resort for fun, relaxation, clean quality accomodations and to be around nice people.
