{"text":"Great ambience, friendly staff but room #1 is tired-looking We stayed for 3 nights during the last week of March, 2 at the standard room #1 and 1 at the duplex with jacuzzi (#14). The std room we were in was clean but needed some urgent upgrading. For USD35 however, we were not complaining.We actually arrived late at night (9 p.m.) but the check-in was fast. The front-desk staff took us to our room and spent at least 10 mins letting us know about the services made available by Tegal Sari. Great service, really.The surrounding of the hotel is nice too - so many past TA reviewers already talked about the rice fields, great views from the balcony etc. so I am not going to repeat those comments here.The duplex at USD60 is worth it if you are spending a lot of time in your room. The layout of the room however is a little strange. On the first floor, when you open the main door from outside, you will be greeted by the open-plan bathroom (by this, I mean the toilet bowl). It's therefore not very convenient for you to use it if you have ordered room service :-) The fridge (the size of those we have in our kitchens back home) is NOT in the room, it is instead outside, at the terrace. In addition, the stairs to the second floor (when the bed is) are rather steepl. Before we left, we tried to see if we could have a look at some of the newer rooms (super wooden, etc.) but were told that the guests were inside the rooms. What a pity!All in all, a pleasant stay. I will return to Tegal Sari for the location is great and the staff are really friendly.By the way, the Lemak is a great restaurant with great food and nice ambience. They will also send you back to Tegal Sari in their very own vehicle! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1629,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1625}]}
