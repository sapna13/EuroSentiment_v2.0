{"text":"Great, Relaxing Stay at the JW Marriott Overall, we had a great stay at the JW Marriott Resort in Desert Ridge. Since our stay was over Memorial Day weekend, we thought we would have some hassle checking in, etc. However, it was smooth and quick and the woman who checked us in was very pleasant.The room was wonderful with a beautiful view of the pool, golf course and desert landscape. The bathroom was a good size with a separte walk-in shower and bathtub. The service we appreciated was the nightly turn-down service which also included refreshing the towels if needed. We travel quite a bit and unfortunately have encountered nice resort hotels which have the worst sound-proofing . . . however, we slept through the night without having to endure any outside noise. Having kids, this is a plus.The pool was great and is where we spent most of our time. Being 100 plus degrees outside there were plenty of umbrellas (we had no problem finding chairs w\/ an umbrella in the morning, however, it did get crowded by late morning). Also, there were staff members handing out pitchers of ice water and popsicles throughout the day. The food you can order at the pool was good and the service was quick. There is also a great kid's menu (we were not given the kid's menu and had to request it).There were a lot of activities at the hotel during our stay including a movie shown by the pool every night, a cowboy camp night with s'mores and a native american family who performed traditional dances.The fitness center could be a little bigger. If you want to go on the treadmill or do weight machines it's not a problem. If you do mat work or free weights, first of all there are no mats and secondly there is very limited space to work out.The Desert Ridge Marketplace nearby has something for everyone. There are several restaurants including California Pizza Kitchen, Rock Bottom Brewery, the Yardhouse and Macaroni Grill. Great restaurants for kids. There is also a movie theater and the outdoor mall had a lot of your typical mall stores. We will definitely return to this hotel!
