{"text":"worst riu hotel ever! the RIU bambu - needs a refurb and staff to be trained!we have stayed at many RIU hotels without a problem and 5 star service hence booking into the RIU bambu.The hotel is rated a 5 star, rated a 4 star with our tour operator but iin reality its a maximum 3 star!! If you are english or american i would not reccomend there are loads of very rude french  italinans guests never heard of a waiting lineThe rooms - on arrival we were givena room which was damaged - lampshades, floor tiles, tv, you name it as well as bein very damp. We were then moved to another which had similar faults but not to the extent of the previous and then were told that it was the best room available bearing in mind the hotel was only half full! 4\/10The staff - Staff are very rude, well thats unless you are older and can be taken of advantage easier. Restaurant staff were a mostly a joke - very sleezy with the women and constantly taking advantage of older guests. they have one thing on there mind and thats TIPS! which is the reason they favour the older guests. Along with them being very rude and you have probaly half chance of them ever getting you a drink at dinner (they are the worst staff i have ever had to put up with). 2\/10Bar staff - many are rude and can hardly understand english expect to recieve the wrong drink a few times on your stay 6\/10cleaning staff- great FAULTLESS! 10\/10garden staff - lazy, sleezy and all round rude. they go around swinging there machettis which is a bit of a joke. trying to impress. If they were just using to cut the bushes all would be fine but acting the joker! NO! Also were generally asleep under the stairway on many occasions. but did keep the place tidyish!entertainment - very rude, very sleezy and walked around like they owned the place! shows were similar to a episode of benidorm! talentless!!!! lalso there is a transvestite entertainer which is not goodd for the kids or anyone for that matter, caught the freak in the toilets puting his lippy on what a joke! My advice pay extyra to go next door to The RIU PALACE PUNTA CANA! Really nice hotel and good staff, except christmas day (the waiters dont wanna be there)hope this helps!!! - im going to write up a few reviews for the other RIU's i have stayed in which are all positive!
