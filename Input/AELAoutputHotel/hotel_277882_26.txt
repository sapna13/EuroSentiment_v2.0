{"text":"A Wonderful Little Hotel in Lower Manhattan! We stayed at this delightful little hotel (a real find in NYC in our view) during Christmas week of '07 (just last week!) and would return here in a heartbeat. While the rooms and closets are definitely small, this being NY after all, the hotel itself is an excellent value for the city. The beds are extremely comfortable and the bathroom is quite large, and always well-stocked. There is free internet connection in the room, and a flat-screen TV on the wall, and local calls are all free. Every business day there is free delivery of both the Wall Street Journal and USA Today!The breakfast buffet is quite okay, though my wife being vegetarian would have welcomed some hot meal options for her. Every day there are two hot meal choices, usually sausages and eggs, but otherwise the bar is well stocked with fruit juices, bagels, bread, fruit, cereal, and tea, coffee and hot chocolate is availabel 24 hours a day!The hotel is also in a safe neighborhood adjacent to the South Street Seaport and about a 5 minute walk from the subways, both the A train that connects to JFK thru the Air Train and the cross-town 1,2,3 trains for the rest of Manhattan. We walked the streets quite safely even after 10pm at night, and returned home after 1am on New Year's Eve, and it was quite safe. Within walking distance is the Financial District, Battery Park, and Ground Zero, and the rest of Manhattan in minutes thru subways.The staff at the hotel is excellent, from room service to the doormen and front desk, especially Jackie who checked us in very efficiently and with a welcoming smile, and made sure our entire 8 day stay was well taken care of!
