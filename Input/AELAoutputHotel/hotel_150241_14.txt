{"text":"Great Stay Just returned from a quick trip to PR with mom to celebrate her 60th. Love the place and the people. We took a jr. suite facing the pool. We had 2 double cloud 9 beds and a large tv in the bedroom. A nice kitchen area with sink, coffee maker, microwave, and mini frig. We also had a living room with couch, chair, desk\/table with 2 side chairs and a large tv. All was clean and very nice. Continental breakfasts w\/ 2 hot items (eggs\/sausage) were provided until 10 am and coffee\/tea provided 24 hours. The breakfast made it easy to get our day started without figuring anything out.Pool and jacuzzi are nice with fluffy towels provided.Staff is friendly - recommending buses, restaurants and even having a few menus on hand. Location is very convenient to the airport and you can walk to the beach in a few minutes (ask staff where best beach is since access is limited due to private bldgs and homes). If you take public bus route A5 into Old San Jan as we did expect at least a 1\/2 hour ride with a close up experience to PR and its wonderful and warm people.Great restaurant deli across the street - I know it looks like a diner but it is good. Metropol on the other side of the cockfighting arena next door had wonderful cuban fare and drums located in the Isle Verdre mall (2 o'clock from the Hampton front door) had a wonderful red snapper special as well as PR appetizers.
