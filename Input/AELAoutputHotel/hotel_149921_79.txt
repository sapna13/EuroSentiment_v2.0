{"text":"Heaven!!! A+++ Best Hotel Stay Ever!!! Where do I begin, from the moment I stepped foot out of the taxi to The Caribe Hilton's dramatic and expansive open-air entrance...I was met with the warmest of welcomes! First of all, this self-described NYC Sex and The City gal is not used to Taxi drivers jumping out and opening the door for her but in PR, that's how it goes and it was...LOVELY!Where do I being...Israel, the Bellman that helped me when I arrived was eager to grab my belongings and help me settle in, you can tell that the entire Bellman team enjoys their positions and that they are a happy team. Miss Maity (the Pre-Arrivals Manager) made sure that I had accomodations on the Exec Level floor and was as lovely in person as she was on the phone. That Front Desk area is quite the pressure cooker but she and the rest of the Front Desk team handle things well and really try to make the guests' experience the BEST it can be.The Executive Lounge was the BEST, BEST, BEST!!! Mr. Omar helps keep things as smooth as possible and besides being extremely easy on the eyes , he is a very good manager... if you go to the Execd Lounge and see a man that looks like a Latin movie star in a custom-made Armani suit - THAT'S OMAR! Omar helped make it possible for me to extend my stay another two days and treated me like a VIP. Another Exec Lounge associate worth mentioning is Miss Annia who is both super-professional and sweet as sugar and is a real asset. The lounge is just a great place to enjoy a delicioso cafe con leche and meet other nice travelers in a calm setting. The Continental breakfast is lovely and the servers are quick to keep things tidy; there's a certain code of conduct you see up there from the staff and they are all lovely people con clase.The best part for me outdoors is the hammock area; imagine swinging in between two huge Palm Trees for hours - it's this sort of experience that blew me away because despite the grand size of the hotel, there are still...quiet...places...for...simple...solitude.Chef Pagan at Lemongrass (on premise) is a big star; a likeable guy that has created the most beautiful Asian fusion restaurant overlooking the Hilton's Tropical Gardens. Try his Cardomon Ice Cream - fantastico! Sit in the open air sofa area and have a Mango Martini and some appetizers (blue fin tuna on top of plaintains served maki-style). Just wonderful.Also, the Housekeeping Staff is lovely and get ready for the BEST BED OF YOUR LIFE!!! These beds are UNREAL. I even went on [--] to buy the pillows!!!One last note, my friend and I found beautiful branches on the beach that we wanted to bring home but someone suggested that we have them lacquered - well, I asked a bellman about this and within 5 minutes, someone from Engineering came to my room to do this for me! Can you say SERVICE! I stayed here after a 4 day stay at Las Casitas at the El Conquistador and I can say without hesitation the the Caribe Hilton and its' pride-filled staff will exceed your expectations to the point that you will invariably R=E-L-A-X like never before. It's private beach, close proximity to Old San Juan and EXCELLENT Customer Service make this the best hotel experiernce I have EVER had (and I've stayed at The Breakers in Palm Beach, The Williamsburgh Inn. etc)I am going back in a few weeks and taking my best friend - it was THAT GOOD!Two more things: There is a bus near the hotel that'll take you to Old San Juan for 75 cents, it takes 8 minutes and it is 100% safe. FYI, stores in Old San Juan basically close at 6PM. Restaurants close by 8:30 or 9PM. Have a cup of coffee at La Bombanera during the day!!! HILTON BED = LA BOMBANERA COFFEE!!!ENJOY YOUR MAGICAL STAY!!!
