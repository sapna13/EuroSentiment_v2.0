{"text":"Close to Perfect Hotel We stayed for 2 nights in Mid-May 2008. From the Narita airport, we took the Airport Express (about 40 minutes) and then changed to the metro which took us to Shimbashi station. It was only a few minutes walk (completely underground) to our hotel. The hotel staff was indescribably professional. The entire hotel, including our room, was spotless. The decor was very modern. The room was on the small side, but it was what I expected in Tokyo! The bathroom had all new appliances and was very clean. The toilet even had a bidet. We were able to access the subway that was just below the building, so we were able to go everywhere in Japan for just a few bucks on the metro. In the evening, we had drinks in the lobby in cushy modern seats while listening to a live jazz band. My only complaint was the breakfast in the hotel. Our stay did not include breakfast, so we paid for it out of pocket at $25USD per person, and it wasn't very good at all. Not much of a selection at too high of a price. However, we discovered that at the building across from the Shiodome Media Tower (which is where the hotel is), there is another building that has tons of affordable restaurantes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Finally, on our last day, the hotel arranged an Airport Limo to take us to Narita. It costs $30USD per person, but it was worth the convenience. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel, and I plan to stay there again on my next trip to Tokyo. ","annotations":[]}
