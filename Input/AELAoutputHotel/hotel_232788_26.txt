{"text":"Do not stay here!!! Dreadful. Do not stay here! I booked this hotel because of its location and reasonable price; do not be tempted by either! In the first room, 256, there was a terrible rumbling noise, maybe from the air conditioning (even when turned off!) or pipes, I requested a room change and was told there were no more rooms available, the receptionist was very rude and extremely unhelpful, after an argument he found - with no apparent problem! - another room, 374, I waked in and walked straight back out, the stench from the bathroom was sickening, I went back to reception and asked for another room, again he said there were none available, after another argument I was given room 362, it was lovely! Well, as long as you don't mind hearing every single footstep or word spoken in the hall outside! Why didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ I just walk out and find a better hotel where the staff are polite and helpful??? I should have!!! The following morning when I was (as I have done in countless other hotels!) going back to my room after breakfast with a cup of hot water, the receptionist let rip!!! I won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go into the gory details but I was mortified, he was so confrontational and aggressive and all this in front of other guests that were either checking in or out at the time, apparently hotel rules state you can not take a cup of hot water out of the restaurant to your room! Well there is a way to tell someone and there was his way!!! I could not believe his tone, his manner, I was a paying guest in the hotel. I felt like I was committing the worst crime known to man! He was beyond reason! Do not stay here, do not be tempted by the great location or the reasonable rates, the hotel was maybe lovely once but now it is in need of a major overhaul and big clean up. As for the receptionists√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√∂hey were the absolute rudest, most unhelpful, most confrontational, condescending, rotten people I have ever encountered. Dreadful. ","annotations":[]}
