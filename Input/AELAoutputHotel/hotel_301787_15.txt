{"text":"Brilliant For our honeymoon, we had given much thought on where to go. And this hotel certainly didn't disappoint!!! As with other reviews that you have read, the hotel is spotless and you won't get staff this friendly anywhere else in the world!!We arrived at about 10pm, and the rep that collected us from the airport dealt with our check-in etc while we took in the hotel with a cup of iced tea (well at least I think this is what it was) and cold towels....nice touch. We were made very welcome even thanked on many occassions for coming to their country!!!Our room was fantastic, hugh big bed that had a heart made from flowers carefully placed on it (our bath tub had rose petals in it also). We also had complementary biscuits, chocolates and water. We had a great pool view, but then with water almost surronding the hotel, I guess nearly if not all the rooms would have.We booked the hotel on a room only basis, and did therefore find that it was a little expensive to eat in it. We did so for the first few days and the food is good again with friendly staff, but on our third day we found 'the Bali collection' which is a 5-10 min walk out of the hotel to the right. Here you have at least 10 restaurants to choose from with a hugh big supermarket. We chose to go down here on in the evenings (little bit more happening)During the day we felt no need to leave the hotel, it is directly on the beach, with enough sunbeds for everyone, though you do still get the 7am early birds hogging the beds in some areas of the pool and beach, good thing is though the staff were lifting some towels if other guests couldn't get a spot at the pool and the beds were empty for more than an hour. So you never needed to stress about going down to get a bed.On the beach you do have the 'traders' wanting to sell you jewellery, sunglasses, clips etc, but simply be saying no thankyou they left again. It was excellent in that sense. Also they were selling watersports which took place less than five minutes away (water too shallow outside hotel) here you could scuba dive, banana boat etc.This hotel is absolutely perfect, if you want a beautiful hotel in a beautiful area of bali. And if during the day you want the option of doing either nothing or watersports. The very very small downside is that in the evening we found it expensive to drink in the hotel and there were no nice places neaby outside to go and chill, listen to music and have a few drinks. But this is no reason not to go as you will find enough other things to occupy your time with.We did very little with being on honeymoon, but there are sooooooooooooooooo many trips that you can take to go and see some culture. We left the hotel on twos days only.......but we will definatley be back to go see some more.
