{"text":"Very good place to stay We stayed here for a week in february, 2007 and loved the place. we did not have any complaints. here are some random things.- The hotel staff were very friendly. They spoke good english and were very helpful in giving directions, making reservations and with any requests we had. - The room we stayed in was very clean and was decorated well. About size - well, it is Europe. - When making a reservation online, pay attention to the currency in which the price is quoted. Mostly it will be Euros, but sometimes it is also charged in GBP. It happened to us.- There are about 3-4 breakfast places very close outside the hotel. The breakfast in the hotel itself is a bit pricey. But you get more food.- There is not much to do around the hotel itself at nights, other than a very pleasant walk by the Eiffel tower. May be next time we might stay closer to Notre Dame on the other side of the river. But it is quite at nights.- There is a super market right across the road for water, beer etc. - Note that there is a good view of the Eiffel tower from the 5th or the 6th floor rooms. But they are all smoking rooms. They do not have any non-smoking rooms in their top floor. That was quite strange. The view from our room was of the street, which was interesting as well.- There are some good restaurants next to the hotel. Not very expensive and good food. There is one special restaurant next to this hotel - Le Florimond. It is on the right when you exit the hotel. It is very small and mostly caters local crowd. You definitely need reservations for this place, which the hotel can help with. Only the manager spoke english. But he was patient and translated the full menu. The dish with duck was awesome.- We stayed in the second floor (or Ground + 1). We could feel a slight rumble from the subway beneath the hotel early in the night. But it was not loud enough to disturb our sleep. ","annotations":[]}
