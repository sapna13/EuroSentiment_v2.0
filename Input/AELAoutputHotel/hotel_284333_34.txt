{"text":"Checked out early I read all of these positive reviews and believe that we must have gotten one of the undesireable rooms. We booked this location for 4 nights on an RCI exchange. We stayed on the 3rd floor (Rm 306??). It was an efficiency unit.  I must say that we were uncomfortable from the moment we checked into our room. We spent most of our time figuring out how not to spend any time in the room. First , the layout of the room: You open the door to the room. The headboard of the bed was right next to the door as you open it. About 3 steps later to the left is the bathoroom\/closet. We came to be more horrified with this design when we actually utilized our bathroom. The bathroom has zero ventilation (if you get my drift)!!! No ventilation fan, no bathtub, just shower with shower curtain. Toilet is about 2 feet from the wet shower curtain. And your clothes share your bathroom space!! There is somewhat of a slatted door on the closet. The other side of the room consisted of a sofa, kitchenette and balcony. There is air conditioniong. However, when you opened the balcony sliding door, the door bangs against the air conditioner. f you sit on the balcony, you get to listen to your and your neighbors' air conditioner. The kitchenette was nice, not in the bathroom. (Sorry, couldn't resist the humor). However the tightness of the room and the co-mingled space, literally makes you not want to deal with food in the room. The carpet was an old fashioned dark green color. It's ok when you first check-in, but as the hours go by, you notice that this color shows every grain of sand, every light colored speck, etc. Too tight of a space. Dated surroundings. Didn't feel that the room was clean. My husband misplaced his glasses. We still laugh at how horrified we were that they might have fallen under the bed. Neither of us wanted to check under or behind the bed. Luckily we found them before needing to do this. I'm sorry to say that we checked out of this hotel after 2 days. We're not hotel snobs. Our vacation just wasn't worth the hassle. I woke up both days thinking How can I spend as little time in this room today, as possible? Due to other positive reviews, which I relied on, my advice is to try get a good room. If that guarantee is not possible, I would not risk my vacation time being uncomfortable. Book something that you can be sure about. I didn't see any of the other rooms.On a positive note, the hotel staff very hospitable. Starbucks is close by. Galaxy Restaurant is also close by and has a great breakfast special ($2.99).
