{"text":"Great location, lovely hotel, welcoming staff Booking a hotel in Paris for me, my daughter (8), my Father and his son (11) was almost overwhelming - we could have stayed at something more expensive but might have missed the charm of Paris. What we were looking for was something reasonably priced, but as we were only there from Friday to Monday was ideally located for the sights, open top tour bus stop, easy eats, and offered a straightforward way of getting to Disneyland Paris and Gare du Nord. This hotel ticked all the boxes. Just a hundred or so yards from an exit of Charles de Gaulles Etoile station this provided us with a minimum of fuss at the start and end of our days. (Buy a Paris Visite ticket before you go to give you full access to central Paris transport). Booking directly with the hotel via e-mail was so easy - immediate replies to questions and to the booking. When we arrived it was obvious why - there was always a member of staff around the reception desk ready to say hello or to wish you a nice day, or to answer any questions you might have. One thing stuck in my mind - a small thing perhaps, but underlined the care that the staff of this small hotel takes. All tables were busy for breakfast one morning, so we waited around the corner in the reception area. Every couple of minutes the receptionist popped round to check if a table had become free, until shortly they showed us to a free table. This attention really makes a difference - we felt welcome throughout our stay.The hotel is situated near the Champs Elysees and a couple of hundred yards away from the Arc de Triomphe. Walk 50 yards up the street and you can see the Arc and the Eiffel Tower sits in the distance. Open top bus tours (we went for L'Open Tour and weren't disappointed) stop within a few hundred yards. Disneyland Paris is 45 minutes away on the RER that runs directly from Charles de Gaulle Etoile station, so catch that 1 hour before park opening and you'll be knocking on the door of the park at just the right time. Be aware that you will need to ensure you have tickets for the right zones to get to Disney. We bought 1-3 Paris Visite tickets and separate tickets to get to Disney. (We used www.allofrance.co.uk for our tickets so that we didn't waste time when we got there).The rooms we stayed in were small but clean. I was particularly pleased with the bathroom. During our stay I didn't once find anything I could fault regarding the cleanliness. Breakfast, as already mentioned, was simple and at √à√\u2020√ü?2 a little expensive but spend a little time over your muesli and yoghurt, croissants, bread, cheese and meats, fruit and coffees while deciding on your plan for the day and it was wholly worthwhile. Across the side street was a sandwich shop that made sandwiches and salads to order, and McDonalds was 50 yards away from the hotel - one night we took it back to our room as we didn't have the energy to dine out. The Italian restaurant at the end of the road and across the street was very good, and because of the location there were many other eateries to choose from.All in all, I left with the satisfaction that I had managed to pick out a winning hotel from the many, many hotels on offer in Paris. Suffice to say that a similar trip in years to come will be much easier as I'll simply book again! And if friends want to visit Paris, I'll be confident in recommending this little gem.
