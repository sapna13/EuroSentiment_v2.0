{"text":"Good and bad Background...Mom  2 daughters (14  16), 1st time to DR, have visited many Mexican resorts in the past, booked with Apple, we can speak Spanish, wanted to book a 7 night deal for less than 1,000 pp.Most of the reviews reflect what we experienced July 11-18.Pros...beach, not alot of walking involved, the plaza area outside the lobby with coffee shop, sports bar, and live entertainment, gift shop was small but very well stocked, book and magazine exchange, 30$ massages by the pool, internet also by the pool 5$ for 30 minutes with AC, vacation price (900$ pp including air from Chattanooga TN) .Cons...drinks, bartenders, rats, lack of garbage cans  ashtrays, cable tv down for 2 days, crowds of Dominicas on the weekends, all games are on the beach  none by the pool. I had to keep my eye on my daughters ALL the time, tuna and corn pizza at the snack bar, dated furnishings in rooms, the casino. Tips...take a float for the water (gift shop will blow them up). Donate your books\/magazines to the game room by the pool snack bar. Use the coffee shop for breakfast when you are tired of the buffet. Take an umbrella. We might try the Dominican again but, we think it is difficult to beat the resorts that we have visited in Playa del Carmen Mexico. All of the other Apple visitors we talked to agreed. This hotel really lacked focus as far as the type guests it is targeting.
