{"text":"Not a good hotel Checked into the hotel from the very close train station with a semi-friendly staff. Got a super small room on the 1st floor right next to the elevator. The bed was right up against the wall we barely had room to move around. We did like that the hotel offers free internet access which was the only hotel on our trip that did. We accepted are small room until we found ants by the window, desk, and on our pillows and bedframe. We complained although it was late at night. A maintenance person came in and sprayed ant spray and had to wait for the fumes to go away. In addition, the air conditioning was horrible and had a warm room the the mist of a hot sumer in Florence.The next morning, the hotel did re-assign us to a renovated room on the top floor with a balcony to make up for it. The room still appeared to be old and the balcony was very dirty and the windows has white paint smearings on it. In addition, the air conditioning did not work and I woke up several times as night sweating! Beware that the 5th and 6th floors have wireless internet and did not work for us. We complained and were only told that there was problem some network problem. We had to go down to the nice and chilled lobby to login the wireless internet where it worked.Additionally, we rented a car for 1 night and had to park it at the hotel. We asked to have the 20 Euro fee waived since we had problems, but the refused to credit it back to us.Overall, we were disappointed with this hotel and will not stay again and not recommend it to anyone.
