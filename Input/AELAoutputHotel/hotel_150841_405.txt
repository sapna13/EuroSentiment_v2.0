{"text":"Awesome Amazing!!!! Ok so my boyfriend and I read alot of reviews before we went on our vacation, and now that we are home I am reading more just for curiosity sake! I've read about the food being bad, the wind, blah blah complain, complain, and as I look at the source it occured to me, well of course, I'll give you a hint these complainers are not from Europe! It seems to always be the same people that need to complain, if you wanted your Budweiser  apple pie you should of stayed home! The hotel is absolutely beautiful, the staff are very sweet, the entertainment is very fun, catalina and Michael especially, the pool is beautiful, be sure to book a renovted room, white sand beaches with ocean water the color of eutopia, when I was in the ocean the floor was very soft by the way! No problem ever finding a spot on the beach, a little harder at the pool, but I wasn't going to cry into my margarita because of it! The drinks are free poored by smiling, singing staff, so I thought they were just right. Very fun night club at the Iberostar Dominica, lots of latin, hip shaking music! I would recommend this hotel to anybody, now if you want an adult only this isn't the hotel for you.That said my boyfriend and I had a very romantic, fun, relaxing perfect vacation. Ps Eat at the Gourmet restaurant for sure! Pss We found the buffet just lovely, everything you could ever want! Ola!!
