{"text":"Treated us like royalty I spent a lot of time trying to decide where my bride and I would stay during our honeymoon. I did a lot of research, torn between wanting it to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience and not depleting my savings account. In the end, I chose the Hilton and was able to use points for a free stay. I made the decision with a bit of trepidation, worrying that I was choosing savings over the memorable experience.I need not have worried. The hotel lobby was pretty, the room was nice and the sauna and jacuzzi downstairs were spectacular. Best of all, the staff treated us like kings. They put us on the executive floor, which gave us access to free breakfasts and free food and drink in the executive lounge. A couple of nights, after a big lunch, we simply stayed in, eating a snack in the lounge while drinking decent champagne. Not bad!Another night, we had a terrific meal in the cozy ground-floor bar\/restaurant. The waiter treated us like stars, serving us dinner even though they had officially closed the kitchen 15 minutes earlier.During our stay, the concierge desk answered all of our questions authoritively and with good humor.To top it off, when my wife left behind clothes in the chest of drawers, they hadn't disappeared. Instead, the hotel (for a fee, which was fair), sent the clothes to her.In sum, the Paris Hilton and its wonderful staff left us with wonderful memories of our honeymon stay. ","annotations":[]}
