{"text":"Good times at Gravina We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights as our honeymoon. We were a little wary after reading a mix of reviews but are pleased to say that we had a great trip and would go back to this hotel.The communal areas eg reception, breakfast area and restaurant were very luxurious looking. Our room was not quite as special but at the same time there was nothing to specificially complain about - it had decent facilities and was spotlessly clean. The hotel has 2 different sections - we were in 'Gravina 2' - this part would not be suitable for people with mobility problems. There are lifts but still several steps to deal with.The service we received was excellent , the staff were all very friendly and helpful with a good understanding of English. There is 24 hour free internet with printing facilities based in the lobby.  We would strongly recommend paying the extra to include the breakfast buffet - the food was excellent. I wouldn't bother paying extra for the luxury upgrade - the bathrobes, bottle of cava and 'nice suprise' (chocolates) kind of paled into insignificance when you see the tapas bars and patisseries!The best thing about this hotel was the fantastic location... turn right and you are at Place Catalunya and a 2 min walk from La Ramblas and turn left and you straight into the gothic quarter. There is the metro and aeroport bus stop right at the top of the street that the hotel is on. Perfect.
