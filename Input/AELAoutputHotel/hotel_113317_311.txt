{"text":"An oasis but a bit claustrophobic This was a first time in NYC. We dithered about hotels - in or out of Manhattan, big or small, gym or no gym, etc. - but plumped for the Casablanca on the basis of TripAdvisor reviews. First off, we were really impressed by reception staff (Nick in particular) - both from e-mails prior to arriving and whilst there - the big chains could learn a lot from this attention to detail. We'd expected the room to be smallish, and it was, although we had been upgraded to a 'deluxe king'. But given the proximity to Times Square, there's always going to be a trade-off between size, quietness, view, and so on. Our room was facing the inside of the hotel, so the view was down to the small patio of Rick's Cafe. This meant that there was no view to speak of and it was rather dark. If one was staying there for just a few days that'd be fine, but after six days, it did start getting a bit claustrophobic. That said, the room was scrupulously clean and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was served in Rick's Cafe on the 1st floor. This was a European-style continental breakfast, with a reasonable variety but unvarying from day to day and a lot of competition for a limited number of tables. Rick's Cafe also offers complimentary wine and cheese from 5 - 8 pm every evening. This was a real bonus and just what was needed before venturing out into the noise and chaos of Times Square for an evening meal. The Casablanca also offers a free gym pass to the New York Sports Club, which is on 42nd street and proved to be just what we needed to work off the calories of the Casablanca freebies.
