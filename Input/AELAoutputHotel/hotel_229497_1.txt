{"text":"Great renovated rooms - horrible construction and smell issues The main problem with this hotel during our stay was renovation and construction work constantly going on inside and outside the hotel. The noise was unbearable, especially waking you up early in the morning. The work has been ongoing for a good part of this year. I imagine it won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be possible to get this hotel on priceline at a reasonable price once renovations are complete, and it is only because of the current problems that rooms are available for 150 USD. I was shocked to see some Europeans pay almost 400USD\/night while we were there. I would have felt very angry if I was paying this much for such a stay, with this level of disruption, noise, and odd smells. My rating is strictly based on what I got for the price I paid and my imagination of how the property would be rated after the renovations are finished.... For the price I paid, and what rooms were going for in Amsterdam at the time, the problems were bearable.Location:This hotel is in a convenient location, where you can easily walk to and from the Central Station. Its also quite a short walk from Dam Square. We could not find the entry, however, due to the many construction areas. Things may have changed by now.Rooms:The smell of paint and chemicals on most of the renovated floors was unbearable for us, and we moved a few times. The smell never really went away √à√\u2020\u2022?I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know if it was carpet glue, or paint. It differed in strength depending on the floor or the room. The renovated rooms were tiny, but quite lovely and comfortable. While the linens, pillows and down comforters were heavenly, the mattresses at this hotel are of the extremely √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºoft√à√\u2020\u2022?feather bed variety √à√\u2020\u2022?any kind of weight above 150 pounds and you will dip down rapidly into the bedding. I realize some folks (especially very light people without back problems) will absolutely love this kind of soft bedding, but I prefer a firm mattress. Everything else in the bed was top notch. I found the choices made for carpeting, curtains and duvets very pleasant and modern and I really liked the lighting choices in these rooms and all the small decorative touches. Huge flat screen TV with good channel choices was also a nice plus.Bathrooms:Very nicely renovated, with great amenities, hair dryer, robes and adequate shower pressure. No hot water problems.Lobby:This is a very small unwelcoming lobby. You will not want to spend much time here. During our stay the sewer smell in the lobby was so unbearable, you wanted to run through it. I think other reviewers had noted a similar smell as well.They do supply free water bottles and coffee in the lobby in the morning.Staff: The staff at this hotel were extremely nice and friendly and went out of their way to help, supplying advice, umbrellas, and whatever else was needed. Check in and check out were not as efficient as they should be in such a hotel.
