{"text":"Great hotel, but doens't live up to Grand Hyatt standard The hotel grounds are LARGE and look absolutely fabulous. Very well maintained! I really liked the Grand Club area, which really has a private feel to it. When sitting at the Grand Club pool, I didn't feel like I was in a 650-room hotel. The beachfront is great and large with nice warm seawater. Beware of the locals on the beach who try to sell you all kinds of things, they even woke me up from my sleep to offer me massages or something :-\/The Grand Club lounge is very nice, although the service at the lounge doesn't live up the standard I'm used to at for instance the Grand Hyatt Singapore or Bangkok. The staff take each others orders, try to serve multiple tables at once and almost never managed to correctly bring us our entire order the first time. We were with six persons, and almost always at least one of us didn't get what he\/she ordered.The same goes for all the restaurants at the hotel. They all look very nice, but the service isn't top-notch as I do expect from a Grand Hyatt. The restaurant staff isn't particularly quick: when we were seated, it took them on average about 15-20 mins. to come and ask what we'd like to drink, something that should be done right away in these types of restaurants.We spent new-years eve at the Balinese restaurant, which was very nice. Both the food and the ambiance were very good. Unfortunately, the new-years eve programme at this restaurant ended at about 21:00hr and we were being asked to move to the lobby, were we had to enjoy ourselved for another two and a half hours before the actual new-years eve event started. This is what I disliked most: there should have been a full-evening programme for the enormous amount of money we had to pay for this.My mom and grandma went to the Kriya spa, which they found to be absolutely fabulous. It looked great and the treatment was very good. On the other hand, they also went to the beautysalon (not part of the spa!), which they found to be dirty and old.I went to the gym, but it is quite small compared to the gyms I've seen at other Grand Hyatts. Good thing is, they have two indoor squash-courts, large sauna and outdoor pool at the gym.In general, the staff is very nice, very attentive and were always smiling. I can only review the Grand Club rooms, but they were very nice and clean. I particularly liked the enormous shower and the kingsize bed.All in all, it was a very nice holiday but if you visit Grand Hyatts around the world more often, don't expect the same service in Bali...
