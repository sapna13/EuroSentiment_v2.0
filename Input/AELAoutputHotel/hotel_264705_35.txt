{"text":"Great view of teh Eiffel Tower We stayed at the Hotel Innova for 5 nights in June. Three of us shared a triple room, which was a bit cramped with all our luggage (we had a lot of luggage).We were pleasantly surprised to have an excellent view of the Eiffel Tower from the top floor. (They only have a few rooms like that) We didn't order an airconditioned room but didn't need one in June (coming from a warm climate). The room was clean, and about average size for Paris. The bathroom was modern and a reasonable size for the price. The Day staff couldn't have been more helpful, but there was just one guy (who worked nights) who had an attitude. The breakfasts were good, but basic. The breakfast staff didn't speak English, but receptionists all spoke good English. It's in a nice enough part of Paris, and very handy for facilities. There is an excellent Patisserie across the street, and a good bar\/ bistro at the corner just down from it (service was lightning speed). There is also a laundry about a block away. We tried most eateries in the area (including fast food) and didn't have any complaints). The crepes were beautiful. They have just one busy internet computer at the hotel, but there is an Internet cafe one street down towards the Pasteur Station (turn left and it's a couple of blocks). Watch out for the motorbike lane when crossing the Boulevard Pasteur !We'd stay there again.
