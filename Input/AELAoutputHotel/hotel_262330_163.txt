{"text":"A pretty nice hotel Generally when visiting NYC we use points to stay at the Waldorf-Astria, but since they've changed to seasonal rewards and the Millenium Hilton had really reasonable weekend rates we thought we'd give it a whirl. We were upgraded to a corner suite (Diamond status), were issued breakfast coupons on checkin (the breakfast here is 10x better than the Waldorf's) and there are several subway lines there that makes it very easy to go through the city - and oh yea, there aren't 101 tourist walking all around like times square (but the tourist aren't too bad by the Waldorf either). The hotel is much nicer than I thought and pretty up-to-date including large flat-panel TV's (but I hope you didn't come to NYC to watch the tele) - I think it was fully refurbished after Sept 11. The elevators to the high-floors are super-fast. This is a compounding effect. Because the elevators are so fast you get to your room quicker, which means it can make more runs therefore less people per elevator ride, which means less stops on your way to your room, which means you get to your room even quicker. We're independent travelers, so don't use services from the hotel staff much, but we experiences some wonderfully positive and knowledgeable people, and some staff that we're so keen either of those qualities. The only other would be that there is no free wireless in the lobby and no wireless (paid or otherwise) in the room - they do have a LAN line. ...next time we stay in NYC, we might just stay here again...
