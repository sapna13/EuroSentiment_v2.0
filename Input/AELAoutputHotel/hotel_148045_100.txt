{"text":"Awful Service My husband, myself, and our three year old son just returned from a five day stay to the El Conquistador. Although, the resort has been recently renovated, the service is in need of a major renovation. In all of our travels we have never experienced such poor service.Upon getting to our room we found the safe to be locked. It took five hours and a couple of phone calls before security managed to come up to the room. As soon as we checked in I requested extra pillows so I could put them on my son's bed so he wouldn't fall out. Once again, it took numerous phone calls. Finally someone from housekeeping showed up approximately six hours later with one pillow. He couldn't understand why we were so upset. Upon speaking to the head of house keeping, additional pillows were finally delivered. We knew that we were going to pay resort prices for food so we were prepared. However, the service in all of the restaurants, especially Otello's was beyond awful. It took approximately 45 minutes for them to bring out a plate of chicken fingers. We always eat on the earlier side to avoid any crowds and delays when we are out with our son. This is in fairness to him and to everyone else in the restaurant. However, you can't expect a three year old to sit for forty five minutes patiently before a meal arrives.We knew the hotel was not inexpensive and we didn't have any problem with that. However, we expected to get far better service than what we received. Everyone who we spoke to said the same thing. Many of the people we met would not return because of the poor service.
