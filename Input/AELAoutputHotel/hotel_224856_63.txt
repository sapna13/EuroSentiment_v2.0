{"text":"Great location We have stayed at this hotel several times and keep coming back, due to the quiet, large suites, shuttle service and lake views and usually friendly staff.However, this time we stayed for one night . We were given a great two bedroom suite, second floor, wrap-around balcony, BUT in the morning the front desk staff would not give us an extension from the noon time to 1:00 pm, which is okay. BUT they made sure we heard them talking about us at the front desk reception when we left the room at 12:20 pm (I waited with our luggage in the lobby area while my husband got the car). The manager should know better than to criticize guests in front of everyone and not have the courtesy of 1) phoning us to make sure we were leaving soon and give us a warning of an extra cost if we were not; 2) not to talk negatively about any guest in front of others. Behind our backs the manager stated that he was considering charging us for the 20 minutes we took to leave the room! If he was so desperate for the extra expense, then why didn't he contact us by phone???? No warning, nothing, just plain rude. This left a very bad taste in my mouth.The main thing to remember is that the rooms are clean, large and comfortable. There is a free breakfast, a pool and free parking around the corner, if you don't want to pay for parking. Overall, staff are frankly, quite friendly and do their best to accommodate their guests. This was one unfortunate visit. ","annotations":[]}
