{"text":"Relaxing hotel, central location We enjoyed our stay at the San Juan Marriott. We have 2 teenage girls and promised them a few days at the beach. We had full sun each day and came home very tan. We got an umbrella on the beach each day and tipped the chair guy - we did not get charged for the umbrella.Check-in: Our room was not ready when we arrived (3:30 p.m.), but they ended up upgrading us to an oceanview room, and that was worth the wait! It was fabulous to keep the door open  fall asleep to the waves every night. We also got $100 off the room for the delay. Get a room on one of the top floors!Disliked: If you want to sit by the pool, you will either be in the shade or need to move your location throughout the day. Full sun area was only on the beach during our stay.Staff: They were helpful to us on nearly every occasion. The only snag was the concierge area...the hotel was sold out during our stay so if you wanted their help for dinner, you would probably have to wait. The bellmen, front desk, housekeeping, etc. were very responsive.Food: We only ate at the La Vista once, upon arrival when our room wasn't ready. Pricy but decent. The rest of the time, we either went to Old San Juan for dinner or walked to the numerous places along Ashford Street, and enjoyed our meals every time.Tip: Stock up on beverages or grocery items across the street at Walgreen's...
