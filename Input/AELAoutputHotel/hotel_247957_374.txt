{"text":"Not a 4 star, more like 2 star I booked the trip through cheapcarribean.com, because it had the cheapest rate, all went smoothly in terms of booking, flights, airport pickup and drop-off, hotel reservations, etc. The biggest disappointment was the hotel. It was not 4 star hotel at all. They need a major renovation. They try to promote their VIP royal club, which is the exclusive area for more $, but even their royal clubs were not that great to be 4 star.- Rooms : Spacious but not clean, smelly, bathroom is dirty, TV is small and very old, AC didn't work well, ANTS!! there were so many little ants every where in the room.- Service : Great on the first day, and it dies out through out the days and become avg. service over all. People there know you once you are there and if you don't tip them well, they will mark u as no-tip and it's so obvious that they treat you worse than yes-tip people.- Beach : Nice but it gets crowded. need to grab your spot around 6am every morning, otherwise you will end up in the no-shade for the whole day, only 1 towel per person and towels need to be returned by 6pm and line up to get the fresh one every morning.- Food : Worst of all. 1 kitchen food for 7-8 location options. when we went, we had only 2 restaurant options for dinner and u needed to be on line at the front desk to make each night's reservation at 8 am. when we went there around 9am, it was all booked so we had no options but eat at the main buffet restaurant. we went those dinner restaurants for two nights, 1 asian and 1 mexican, they both tasted the same and we just stuck with the buffet restaurant for the rest of the trip.Overall, although this hotel and bad reviews in the tripadvisor, we wanted to believe that everyone's diff. in their taste and opinions, but it is some what true what this site tells you. Maybe DR's hotel rating might be different from other destinations, but this hotel was more like 2 star for me. I travel a lot but I never write a review after, but this one, I had to tell you guys. Hope this helped.
