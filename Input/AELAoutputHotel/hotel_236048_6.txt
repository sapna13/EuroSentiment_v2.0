{"text":"Good choice, a bit off the beaten path, and a bit of charm I spent 2 nights at the Atlas. It is a very solid 3 star hotel. The Atlas is not pretentious. It is quiet and personal. What the Atlas especially has going for it is the place itself and the location. It is a lovely converted mansion, I think, and it is literally a few meters walk from Vondelpark. Kind of a wow location in a very upscale residential neighborhood with charming early 20th century homes and apartment buildings around it. My room was top floor, in the front, so under a gabled roof, probably the former attic, so I had a bit of a view of the street. There are rooms down to the basement. My room was small, but that's Amsterdam for you. I have been to that city several times and smaller rooms are usually the case. It had a tight but complete bathroom with lots of hot water. The colors in the room tended to orange, but that's not a big deal. The room felt homey and it had a flat screen TV. The bed was supremely comfortable. I didn't try the breakfast, because there was a nice cafe-bar a minute away.I found the staff very helpful when I asked for transportation information. The girl on the desk pulled out maps, found schedules on the internet, and so forth. Quite a nice surprise.You think the Atlas is out of the way, but it is 50 meters from the #2 tram stop which takes you right into the center of Amsterdam in under 10 minutes, and it is no more than a 10 minute walk to the Van Gogh Museum (and another few to the Rijksmuseum. The only drawback in location is that trams stop around midnight so you need a taxi to get back late in the night. And the night rates start at a ridiculously high 7.50 euros. ","annotations":[]}
