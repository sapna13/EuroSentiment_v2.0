{"text":"Excellent value, excellent service For a 3-day conference at Hynes Convention center, I turned to TripAdvisor to find a hotel nearby that would fit the budget of my employer. I contacted the Charlesmark directly and made a reservation, which was confirmed promptly by e-mail and gave directions to the municipal parking lot where they've arranged a $20 discounted rate, much better than the Prudential Center's $36 a night. On arrival in Boston I parked my car, then stopped in at the Charlesmark on the way to the Hynes and left my bag. When I returned that night, my bag had already been nicely placed in my room. While the room was not large, it was quiet, the contemporary decor was attractive and the space well utilized. Bottles of water were left in the room each day at no charge, there was a stereo, video player, cable TV, and a huge full length mirror. Two computer stations with internet are available in the downstairs lounge. In the morning, there are newspapers, juice, coffee, fruit, bagels and so on, all included in the room rate. Coffee and pretzel-type snacks are available throughout the day. The staff was quite helpful and I was very pleased with the hotel. Those traveling for pleasure might want to ask about room views--my room had a very limited rear view, which was fine for me, but might not work for everyone. This is a nice area for visitors, with plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby on Boylston Street and in the Prudential Center Mall. It's an easy walk to Newbury Street and to the Boston Common, there's a Shaw's Supermarket nearby , and a Green Line subway stop on the corner.
