{"text":"Spend your money elsewhere A great looking hotel with excellent beaches and amenities, complemented by rude and incompetent staff, disgusting food, cheap and lousy drinks and inadequate service. We had a group of 21 people stay at this hotel. Upon arrival, we were greeted by hotel staff who managed to unload our luggage and leave it in the rain. The front desk attendants did not have a clue as to what they were doing and managed to give everyone incorrect room assignments. Many members of our group were young adults who requested rooms with two beds, however, every single room we were assigned had a king size bed. Also, several of the people in the group were elderly, and despite the fact that our travel agent requested first-floor rooms for them, they were inconveniently assigned rooms on the third floor. The resort, meanwhile, does not have elevators. It took us another 3 hours of arguing to get all room assignments corrected for the group, and as a result, all of the rooms were scattered throughout the resort premises, making it difficult to stay as a group.After being assigned rooms, several of our group members had to endure waiting for an hour until their maid cleaned their room. This should have been done prior to the handing out of room keys as it is the customary assumption that once the room key is given to the occupant, the room should be ready for habitation. Other group members√à√\u2020\u2022?rooms had wet floors, causing one of the people to slip and fall, hitting his back, head and arm. Upon filing of an official report with the hotel, we did not hear from any management, and were in fact told that management was too busy to address the injury.On the first night, the entire hotel was without air conditioning, making rooms feel like saunas because of the humidity and the heat. The air conditioning was fixed on the second day of our stay, however, no apologies were offered to us for this horrible inconvenience. Eating choices were very limited at best. All buffets had the same food options and I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ qualify any of these items even as mediocre √à√\u2020\u2022?just plain crap. Badly prepared meat, no fruits, liquid ice cream, etc. Soft drinks are handed out by staff only, making the wait for a simple coca cola upwards of a half hour. We visited three restaurants Italian, Japanese and French. Italian venue was so amazing that we decided to hit buffet afterwards. Japanese had a tolerable hibachi-style show with decent food. The service was superior to that of any other place we visited until then. The restaurant highlight was the fact that they had sake. On the third try (French), our group finished a bottle of vodka before they served us, so food did not taste that bad. Hint: The only way to enjoy food in this hotel is to get drunk beforehand (Strongly recommend to stock up in duty-free before boarding as hotel lacks anything even remotely drinkable). I have to agree beach is excellent. Sand, water, weather √à√\u2020\u2022?everything. The pools were nice. The club was okay on the first night, however, arriving there on the second and third nights, and hearing the same exact music and CD playing got annoying very quickly. Since there were no other entertainment options other than the club, our group could basically recite all the words to every song by day four of our stay.
