{"text":"By Singapore Standards... Pretty Bad I know Singapore hotels like the back of my hand. I have stayed dozens of times in Singapore, in just about every 5 star hotel on the island (and even Sentosa!). I am amazed that Sheraton Towers is so high on the popularity index. I have stayed here about 6 times over the past few years, and have always been disappointed. The only reason I stay here is that the sales staff are very slow at putting up their rates when big conferences are on, which means the Sheraton can be an absolute bargain when other nearby hotels triple their prices.There are two main problems:1. The rooms are small and antiquated by Singapore standards. They are not even in the same ball park as what is on offer at just about every other 5* hotel (e.g. Conrad, Grand Hyatt etc.). The bathroom is tiny and again very old. In all honesty, I have seen better rooms at a 3* Holiday Inn.2. The service is consistently poor, from the front desk, to the concierge, to the room service staff. They just do not care and it shows. The ony friendly person is the guy who opens the door, and he was only friendly to return-guests who he recognised. He completely ignored me when I said hello to him.The only thing the Sheraton does as good as the competition is its breakfast buffet which is out of this world.Overall, I am perplexed as to why people stay at this hotel. Particularly considering it is as expensive if not more expensive than much better nearby hotels. Even Starwood know it is not up to scratch - this hotel was booted out of Starwood's Luxury Collection a few years ago!If you want this area and a name-brand hotel - stay at the Grand Hyatt just down the road. I've stayed there many times, it's much better than the Sheraton. ","annotations":[]}
