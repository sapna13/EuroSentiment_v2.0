{"text":"Fun, friendly, beautiful hotel We loved our stay at the El San Juan. We were looking for a place with a great pool, nice beach, and exciting night life. After doing research, we selected the El San Juan and were very happy with our choice. All staff were friendly and helpful, from the bellboys to the front desk to the pool waiters. The cleaning staff did a good job. Our room was always clean. Yes, the modern rooms are very different from the lobby, but everything worked fine and the beds are very comfortable with lots of pillows and nice linens. THe in room safe was nice. The pool areas are wonderful and the lounging beds are the best I've ever seen at any pool. The beach was very pretty and clean. The hotel offers a great variety of restaurants, though some are pricey. The Palm was wonderful, and we had very good sushi at Yamato twice. We didn't try the fancier Italian place, but the smaller Trattoria and Pizza place was good and not too expensive. We love the atmosphere in the lobby at night on the weekend. The salsa band was great and we had a wonderful time staying up dancing and visiting and watching the dancers. The lobby does have a dress code after 7:00 and rightfully so. It is a very elegant place. If, however, you are returning to the hotel from sightseeing or leaving for a more casual place that is no problem. There are several other entrances\/ exits that are easily accesible and do not require you to walk through the lobby. I never saw anyone being hassled or made to feel uncomfortable. Drinks are very pricey all over the property. If you are looking to save some money, there are many options within just a few blocks of the hotel. We took a collapsible cooler and bought beer and drinks at the supermarket to take to the pool. No one at the hotel seemed to have a problem with that. We also saw others eating food from outside places at the pool and no one bothered them. Just outside the hotel entrance turn left and there is Lupi's Sports Grill. It is a great place to sit outside and watch the people walking on the sidewalk while enjoying reasonably priced food and drinks. Turn to the right and within the next several blocks you will find a supermarket and numerous fast food places (Subway, Wendy's, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Church's, etc.) as well as other restaurants. If you want to experience real Puerto Rican food, take a taxi to Casita Blanca. It is in the middle of a Puerto Rican neighborhood in an old refubished house. The food and atmosphere was great. Or head west from the hotel a few miles to Pinones. There are some beautiful beaches and little food stands with vendors selling what they call tacos, but are more like a fried meat pie filled with beef, chicken, crab, or shrimp. We visited fort El Moro which was fascinating and spent time walking around Old San Juan during the day and again at night (some very cool restaurants and night clubs there). There is a lot of talk about construction at the hotel and this is what we observed. The Veranda restaurant which is outside near the pool areas is being renovated. (The hotel informed us of this when we made our reservation.) They have put up decorated screens to block some of the view of the construction. It really wasn't a problem at the pool because it isn't right beside you and the noise was minimal. With the ocean breezes, fountains and waterfalls, and the pool music we were able to forget about the construction. The biggest disappointment is that the Oval Bar, the centerpiece of the lobby, is having some work done to it's counter tops and other upgrades. The hotel has actually walled it off while this is taking place. The walls have been painted and decorated, so there is no construction to see, but it hides the great chandelier and is strange having a temporary room in the middle of the grand lobby. Other than that, we just couldn't find much we didn't love about this place. This was our first trip to San Juan and the El San Juan Hotel and we can't wait to go back!
