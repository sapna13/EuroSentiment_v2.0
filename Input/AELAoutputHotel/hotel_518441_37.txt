{"text":"Luxury combined with Serenity We went to Bali for our honeymoon and decided to split our stay between Seminyak and Ubud. While in Ubud, we stayed at the Chedi Club and it was fantastic! We were picked up from our hotel in Seminyak by a car that the Chedi sent and upon arrival, greeted by our own personal butler (yes, butler) √à√\u2020\u2022?Sutari. As soon as we walked up the entrance stairs to the hotel, the space opens up to luscious grounds surrounded by rice fields, exotic birds, beautiful statues and architecture. The serenity of the hotel is indescribable √à√\u2020\u2022?each villa is very secluded, decorated beautifully with full attention to detail. Since we were in Ubud for 6 nights, we decided to split our stay with 3 nights in a normal villa followed by 3 nights in a pool-villa. The normal villa is beautiful, with an outdoor bath  shower. The mini-bar and snacks are all included in the price of the room, and Sutari informed us that all laundry services were also included. At night, all you hear are the toads in the ponds that surround the villas and you feel a part of Bali that can only be experienced in Ubud. Breakfast every morning was fabulous √à√\u2020\u2022?served either in your room or in the open air restaurant overlooking the rice fields √à√\u2020\u2022?from fresh juices to pancakes, they have enough selection for everyone. Our pool villa was heaven √à√\u2020\u2022?the room seemed more elegant than the normal villas, and includes an outdoor tub (shower was indoor). We ate breakfast every morning by our pool which Sutari brought and arranged for us. Since we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ use the pool too much (only complaint was the water was too cold), we probably wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ opt for a pool villa just for the pool √à√\u2020\u2022?it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not very large and more of a plunge pool than anything else. Unless you want to plunge in privacy, we would suggest to use the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ pool which is stunning √à√\u2020\u2022?and while we were there, totally empty. The Chedi offers free yoga every morning (we did 1 class and it was amazing), with a true yoga professional √à√\u2020\u2022?they supply yoga mats, towels and is done in a beautiful open air room overlooking the rice paddies. In addition, the free car service to\/from Ubud Centre which the hotel supplies is priceless. All we had to do was tell Sutari what time we wanted to go into town and she would arrange for the car. When we were ready to return to the hotel at night, we would call them from the restaurant\/store we were at and they would provide door to door service. Since Ubud centre is about a 10 min drive from the hotel, this was extremely helpful. The pictures on the hotels website and Trip Advisors website are infact everything you see when you are there √à√\u2020\u2022?they just don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ do the place justice. Similarly, the personal touch that is delivered by the hotel staff and Sutari (she was absolutely amazing) was something that we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe never experienced anywhere else and made our stay that much more memorable. And just when you think you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe left the feeling of being catered to in Bali, upon arriving back to Canada, we received thank you cards from Sutari and the Chedi hotel manager. Needless to say, we would highly recommend the Chedi for anyone who is looking for seclusion and a paradise in the hills of Ubud.
