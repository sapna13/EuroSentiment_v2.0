{"text":"Perfectly Nice Hotel - Great Service I stayed for one night with a group of friends. E-mailed the hotel in advance with some specific requests and all were met. In fact when we checked in they advised that they had given us a free upgrade to a superior room.Room was large and decorated in a very modern style and bathroom great, with all usual items you would expect from a hotel of this standard. Breakfast was great, with selection of cereal, fruit, cold meat, bacon, sausage, eggs, bread and pastries etc. etc. and is served till quite late in the morning. Good if you are nursing the after effects of a night sampling the delights Amsterdam.Location is good for Museums, Vondelpark and Leidseplein, where there are loads of restaurants and bars and it was buzzing.If you are prepared to have a stroll, everything else you may want to see in the centre is easily accessible with a few minutes. Would I stay here again? Yes if I got a similar good deal including breakfast, not sure I would be so keen had I paid the standard rate, but then I always like to get a deal when booking hotels.I can see why some may say this is not a 5 star as the modern style, for me, detracts from the luxury feel of a more traditional 5 star hotel, however the staff couldn't have been more helpful and welcoming. Yes there are one or two small items like the finish of some of the cabinets in the bedroom having a few knocks on them, however these are functional environments. For me a small scuff on a piece of furniture in the room where I can very comfortably change and sleep is not going to ruin my holiday!
