{"text":"Good hotel in convenient location Stayed at this hotel before and noted that it has recently been refurbished. Rooms have been redecorated and have flat-screen HD TV's.Its a large hotel comprising several 'towers'. Basically a business hotel with international client base - lots of UK, US and European travellers use it. Prices seem competitive - my double room cost about USD130 per night.Useful range of eating places, including Yahoo! internet cafe - pay Y500 for an orange juice and use their computers and internet access. A food court on the first floor provides spaghetti, noodles, crepes etc etc - although to be honest I didn't find the overall quality of food to be that great and the area does get rather noisy.Breakfast buffet (ground floor 'Hapuna' restaurant) is not cheap at Y2000, but quality of food is very good and there is a full range of Japanese and Western items on offer. I would recommend it.For cheaper eating there is a McDonalds in the same building complex and a Yoshinoya cafe ('fast food' rice  pork\/beef place - around Y700 for a basic meal) just up the street. Shinagawa station is right over the street and has a big range of food shops, restaurants etc etc.From Shinagawa station you can catch the Shinkansen (bullet train) plus the very useful Yamanote Line train which circles central Tokyo. Tokaido Line takes you to Yokohama inside 30 minutes. The Narita Express (Narex) from the airport also stops at Shinagawa.All in all a pleasant hotel in an excellent location which is handy for tourists and business travellers alike.
