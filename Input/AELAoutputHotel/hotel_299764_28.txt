{"text":"Unbeatable Location and Convenience We LOVED the location of the Courtyard! Right outside the hotel, there are tons of shops and restaurants already. If you walk down to Ginza Korida Street, it's restaurant paradise! Hotel has a helpful map of immediate area. Based on recommendation of chowhound.com and front desk staff, we picked one called Midori Sushi. All the signs are in Japanese, so we had to ask around. But was it soooo worth it! Warm and friendly service with the freshest sushi and it costs two of us under $40. It was packed with salarymen and locals. Sit at sushi bar near Ogura San, if possible.In the morning, you will be able to walk to Tsujiki Market to see the tuna auction (5.30am) and other delicacies. Don't really recommend sushi breakfast there, it was twice the price of Sushi Midori and not as good.The Courtyard has undergone recent renovations. If you stay there, be sure to ask for a recently refurbished room. Room is small but decor is modern and functional. Everthing was brand spanking new! Though we were on the 10th floor, there was NO view at all. The view on the streets of Ginza more than made up for what we lacked in the room. We LOVED the Ginza area, esp. in the evenings....great people watching! We arrived at 5pm in Narita, so to avoid traffic, we took the Narita Express train to Tokyo Station (55 mins) and took a 10 min cab ride to hotel. The next the morning, we took the airport limo bus back to the airport....super convenient and comfortable, less than one hour. I srongly recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't have too much time in Tokyo and want to be accesible to the airport. Much better than staying at Narita hotels, if you ask me! ","annotations":[]}
