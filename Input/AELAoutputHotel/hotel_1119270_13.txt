{"text":"WOW! OMIGOD! The room was beautiful. I travel alot for business, I thought I would get away to San Francisco for the Holiday Week. Of course all rooms were outrageous for a simple room. I found ATH for $120 a day.Yes, like what the other travelers said, the neighborhood isn't rated G or PG13 for that matter, but the rooms completely makes up for it 100%. They were spectacular and incredible.As an epicurean. Let me tell you about Larkin street.(X street) I had one of the most amazing meals there. Pagoluc, a Vietnamese restaurant, served Beef in 7 ways with a bed of exoctic herbs and vegetable. Yummy! Next block down, Bodega, had the best vietnamese noodle soup (pho) and awesome raosted squab with caramerlized onions and raisins. Saigon Cafe and their BBQ chicken sandwiches are out of this world for $2.50! Restaurants are really good around the neighborhood, I was blown away by a few of them. A few blocks away on Polk St. more food. I vegged that week. I went to shows, movie theater is 3 blocks away, Union Square was easy to get to, Transportation was direct and uncomplicated.The beds at ATH were sooo comfy. Clean white sheets, springs on the matress were strong, not lumpy and lobsided, The room had a great scent, uber clean, the bathroom is bigger than my apartment, and get this,the towels were bathsheet size! Slept really well and ate incredibly without breaking the bankI actually felt like I was in my own mordern ashram, because when I left. I actually felt recharged and ready to face the hectic new year. You would love it there, sorry can't say much about the view.
