{"text":"The hotel on the return to a 5 Star Resort My Stay at El San Juan Hotel and CasinoI have recently returned from my annual stay at the El San Juan Hotel and Casino, 2\/7\/07-2\/15\/07. For the past 15 years I have been a regular guest. Upon my return I immediately noticed many improvement from my previous stay last year.The staff was very helpful and polished; the rooms were redone and are very bright and clean. The bathroom was ok, not interested in just a shower, but made the best of it. (No bath tubs, no make-up mirrors, no full length mirrors, things that are a must for females), they could have put more outlets in the room as well. The beds were extremely comfortable.Being a loyal guest of this property, I have seen it at it's best and worst. This year was the beginning of a new face-lift. Thank God they did not touch my lobby, the pool area had changes and improved service. Security was full force and made us all feel safe and ensured us a perfect stay. I return to this property for its location, their warm professional staff, lobby entertainment and rich Puerto Rican Flavor. I hope they don't go to far changing it into a Florida hotel. Puerto Rico has history, culture, passion, music and great food. Keep all of the above at this hotel. I know that they are trying very hard to please all that stay there. Given more time my hotel will again be a 5 Star.To the hotel, remember we come to the Island and to this hotel to enjoy what we can't find anywhere else. I will return and return as long as I can, for I never can get enough of my Beautiful Puerto Rico and this Hotel. Just try to keep room rates reasonable and grant repeat return guest a special rate.For all, come and enjoy Puerto Rico and please stay at this hotel, they will not disappointment you. I enjoy hearing the staff say Welcome Back and if you need anything just let us know. ","annotations":[]}
