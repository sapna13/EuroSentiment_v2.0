{"text":"Staff were Great!!!! Argonaut Hotel;We had the pleasure of staying at the Argonaut for 6 nights in early January 08. I would classify our stay as outstanding. The staff of the hotel was friendly and extremely helpful. In almost every interaction with them, they went well beyond what we were asking about. Check in was quick and efficient. Our rooms were well appointed with free internet access, TV with DVD hook up and what appeared to be a good selection of pay for view movies. The room was very clean with high-end toiletries; the towels etc. of good quality. The hotel hosted a wine reception every evening, which was well attended and lively.The location of the hotel was perfect. One block to the cable car depot and the Buena Vista for Irish Coffee; a short walk to Pier 39 and Fisherman√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Warf; one block to a Starbuck√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ and another short walk to the Bay. Ghirardelli Square shops were easily accessible as well. Access to restaurants was excellent with a very good Mexican restaurant in the Cannery complex and several seafood and Italian offerings right down the street. There was also a great little ice cream shop, Norman√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, just around the corner from the lobby.The sole drawback - the room walls were paper thin. Sound traveled from room to room with pretty good clarity. This did not bother us as we were out and about and our neighbors were relatively quiet but this could be a challenge if you or your children are light sleepers.
