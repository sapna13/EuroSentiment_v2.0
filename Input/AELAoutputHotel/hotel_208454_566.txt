{"text":"Sofitel - go, enjoy and tell ! We choose this hotel mainly because of the Tripadvisor rating and it turned out to be our best hotel stay ever !First, about the location. It is located between 6th and 5th avenue, on West 44th Street, next door to the big gun hotels Algonquin and Iroquois. It is within a walking distance fromRockefeller Center, Grand Station Terminal, Times Square, Broadway, Central Park. You caneasily walk to the Empire State Building and to the West 42 Street pier (at 12th street) whereyou can visit the Intrepid aircraft carrier and the Concord airplane or embark on a Circle Island cruise. Half of the Manhattan at your door. More than that if you want to have a good breakfast atvery reasonable price the Red Flame restaurant is next door.Second, the room and amenities. They are top class, beautiful lobby, enough elevators to get you in\/out in a couple minutes, concierge, 3 free internet access stations in the lobby (which people taketoo much advantage of !). We had a nice dinner at Gaby - very nice staff, good menu, good food and prices in line with the New York restaurants. The room is great, distinctive, with very nice amenities, from the bathroom with separate shower, mini-fridge, iron, safe and very comfortable beds. Always clean, with complimentarybottles of water every day (very helpful when you walk miles and miles in the torrid weather of August).Last but not the least, the staff. We felt like home from the moment we arrived. The staff is very courteous and always ready to go the extra mile to make you happy. In our case they went more than a mile: my wife birthday was during our stay and to our surprise, a nice (and tasteful) birthday cake surrounded by berry fruits was waiting for us in the room, along with a personalized letter from the management. This was on top of the complimentary drinks (any, including Champaign !). We went to many hotels in Europe and North America, including Novotel, Mariott and Hilton which is their main competitorbut we never felt so good as at Sofitel New York. We will not forget this wonderfull experience and we would go back in a heartbeat !
