{"text":"Delightful experience We just returned yesterday from Europe and had a delightful experience staying for seven nights at the Carolus Hotel in Florence. The hotel was clean and attractive, occupying all four floors of a handsome nineteenth century neoclassical villa in a good neighborhood about fifteen minutes' walk from the train station and about twenty minutes' walk from the Ponte Vecchio. We picked it partly for its proximity to our daughter's home-stay location as she is doing a fall term in Florence. It is a five-minute walk to the Accademia (Michelangelo's David) and the San Marco Monastery Museum (world's greatest collection of Fra Angelico works--not to be missed). The distance to other sites is not significant in such a small historical district, but might be discouraging to the infirm or in the rain. We were blessed with splendid weather.An Internet Train location for checking email is one block away. (Turn right out of the hotel, then right again immediately by the laundry on the corner, which, incidentally, will do your laundry for you. The Internet Train is at the end of the long block on the left.) A charming little restaurant, Ristorante del Mimmo, is a block and a half away (turn right out of the hotel and then left on San Gallo), which is nice for that first jetlagged evening.The staff at the Carolus was most welcoming, competent, helpful, and English-speaking. The breakfast was a typical continental buffet with excellent coffee and juice, served in two pleasant, high-ceilinged rooms with large windows. Our room was on the back and was attractive, with a high ceiling, comfortable king-sized bed and such nice features as a locking safe in the wardrobe and a heated towel rack in the clean, modern private bath. Our view included the dome of San Lorenzo Church, which was beautifully lit at night. The hotel was quiet and attracted a nice group of guests, mostly European, during our November stay. Not a backpacker's hotel. We got a truly excellent off-season rate with an additional discount for our multiple-night stay. I recommend dealing directly via email with the hotel.We will definitely stay at the Carolus again.
