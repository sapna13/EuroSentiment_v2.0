{"text":"Family vacation We just spent 5 days at Excellence at Punta Cana. Most of the people who work at the hotel were very pleasant. Jackeline at the desk, Ramon, a server, Libeth, a hostess, Edwardo, a bell person, Christian a server at the beach, were exceptional. The staff is clearly well trained always saying ola and smiling and making room for you in the hall ways and such. The food wasn't outstanding, but, plentiful and good enough with Spice and The Barcelona restaurants being the best. The wine was decent. The nightly entertainment was nice, but after 3 nights a bit of the same thing. The pool is extraordinary in that one really can just roll along on floats nearly the length of the hotel with curves and islands and a swim-up bar. The beach front is magnificent. The water is pristine, the temperature perfect with enough waves to have fun and little tidal pools to make a more timid swimmer feel comfortable. The horseback riding was awesome; it's a nice ride through a wooded area and along the beach. The spa was nice. The marine-scrub massage with Esmeralda was great, but a facial wasn't worth the $$$. The hotel has an open feeling that is very clean and attractive. The rooms were spacious, very clean with very firm beds. Some little things I noticed: a lamp didn't work; a small chip on the counter; stuff to make coffee, but no coffee maker. They were quickly ameliorated if you called the front desk. Internet service was not available in the room and barely in the lobby area. This hotel is an hour from the airport. The ride is not pleasant with lots of pot holes and poor roads. Departure is a bit of an experience; one line after another with hours of standing. Despite that, it was nice to be away from hotel row. You can easily stay 4-5 days here with all the activities, restaurants, beach and bars and have a lovely, relaxing vacation.Tips are greatly appreciated despite this being all inclusive.
