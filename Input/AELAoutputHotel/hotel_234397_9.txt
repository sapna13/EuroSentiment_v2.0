{"text":"Claustrophobics beware I stayed here with my husband in May. This was my 4th trip in 4 years and this is unfortunately the worst hotel in terms of standard of accommodation. The location is brilliant - right on the Plaza Catalunya and seconds away from Las Ramblas, the more refined Passeig de Gracia with its modernista buildings and minutes from the Gothic quarter (diagonally across the square from hotel). But the entrance to the hotel is small and unwelcoming. The complimentary cava at the reception desk was a nice touch. But this did not compensate for the tiny room we were allocated. All I can say is, if you are allocated a room on 1st floor beware. The room (although spotless) was very small. There was no natural light and nowhere to sit and relax other than on the bed. The only way to see what the weather was like, in the absence of a window to the outside, was to leave the room and make your way either to the breakfast room (breakfast was wonderful with lots of choice for even the most picky of eaters) or downstairs to the lobby to be able to look outside. Other rooms must be superior in quality (apparent from other reviews on this site) so we must have been just unlucky that we ended up in a shoebox . It did not spoil our stay - Barcelona is a fabulous city and I will be returning soon but not to the Catalunya Plaza.
