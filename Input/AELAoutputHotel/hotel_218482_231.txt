{"text":"Perfect Romantic Hotel Absolutly perfect vacation. I went there with a girlfriend. We are both in our ealry 20s. the resort is HUGE. The pool is amazing, so big. The beach is to dream for. The food was ok. Always something different everyday. The entertainment team is awesome. They never stop , there is always something to do. We didnt get one drop of rain, not even at night. It was sunny everyday. Almost everyone is from Spain so lots of spanish.CHECK IN: they gave everyone a welcome cocktail and it didnt take long until we got our key. The bellboy brought our suitcase to the room.ROOMS: Big rooms, HUGE tub, coaches, mini bars with pops, beers and water and its filled everyday. We had to leave the air conditioner non stop but it was nice and cool at all times.MAIDS: Annoying!!! Our maid came in our room all the time at 8 in the morning for towels. You just need to put the paper at your door stating you dont wanna be disturb until u get up.POOL: So big and the water was so clean at all times. There is a swim up bar and you can sit around it. There is a jacuzzi in the pool and a big fountain. There is also a kids pool.BEACH: Beautiful!!! There is lots of umbrellas available. People get up early to get them though. the sand is white and warm. the water is warm but there is lots of seaweeds and little sticks. The beach is HUGE.BARS: There is a bar in the lobby which you will use mostly at night when you go to the show. There is a bar in the disco. There is a bar on the beach. Each buffet serves alcohol too.SHOWS: Shows are amazing. A MUST see. Some are damcing shows (GREASE) some are halarious shows!!!RESTAURANTS: WOW I was amazed by all of the restaurants. FRENCH : I had the LOBSTER and it was sooo good. My friend had the chicken and she was not impressed. JAPANESE: We were so scared to try it. They cook everything in front of you. Its a realy live show. The cook is amazing and so talented. I had the shrimp pasta (not recommended) My friends had the chicken and rice (amazing). They sit you with 10 other people at the same table and the cook is cooking on a grill in the middle. Its pretty cool.STEAK HOUSE: WOW and WOW. We both had the cowboy steal. I never liked steak until that day. It was sooooo good. the setting was beautiful. The desserts were so good too. We had the New York cheese cake.DISCO: The disco is beautiful with view on the water and its really big. Big dance floor and lots of place tp sit. All the dancers and entertainer have to go there at night with the guest.KIDS: Lots to do for the kids. there is a kids pool and a kids club. They do a kids show every night where the kids are part of the show. there are high chairs in all buffet and restaurants.SHOPPING: There is no where to go around this resort. the down town is 1 hour away. On every friday, there is a market installed at the resort where you can buy everything you would find down town and you can bargin lots. You can even get your hair braided there.HOTEL: Lots to do! There is a internet centre which doesnt work too well. There is a market on the resort beside the casino. There is a gym and a creperie there too. You have to walk a lot because the lobby is far from the beach and your room will be somewhere in between. You either have to walk lots to go to the lobby every night or to go to the beach every day.CASINO: It sucks. I brought 13$ US and they gave me 13 tokens. I havent won not even one credit while playing the slot machine which would never happen in a real casino. I never went back.CHECK OUT: It went well. We called lots from the room doing collect and using the calling card and they didnt charge foir any connexion fees . I bought a calling card for 20$ US and I had 24 min on it so its so much better to do collect calls.Well I hope my review helped. It took me a while to write it :)take care and have good vacations! You will for sure enjoy this resort. I cant see qhy people were complaining!
