{"text":"Great value for Manhattan I picked this hotel after weeks of reading reviews on this site and others. I decided it offered the best value for money for what I was after and I wasn't to be disappointed. Upon check-in we were upgraded to a corner room on the 30th floor. I had read much about NYC hotel rooms being on the small side but our room at the Millennium Plaza was very spacious. But the main thing about the room was the views - WOW! We had great views over the East River and over Midtown as well. The room was modernly decorated and within easy walking distance of Grand Central Station and the subway. Like others have already done so I would recommend John's Cafe for breakfast and there is also a great 24 hour deli\/store on the corner of 44th and 2nd. My main gripe is that when you are paying $300 a night for a room you would expect to have free internet in your room. This was not the case and we were charged $13 a day for the privelege. During our time in the States we had stayed at other more basic hotels which offered free wifi in rooms. In fact, of the 5 hotels we stayed at in total the Millennium Plaza was the only one which did not offer free WIFI. But all in all for the views and size of room you get for your money, I would say, that by NYC standards anyway, the UN Millennium Plaza offers great value for money and I would certainly stay there again and recommend the place to family and friends.
