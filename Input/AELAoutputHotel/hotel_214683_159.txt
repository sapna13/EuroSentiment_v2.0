{"text":"Nothing to complain about Stayed at the Marriott from 4\/26 thru 5\/2. Checking in after a long day of traveling was easy. The front desk people were very friendly. Had a city view room, but was given a complimentary upgrade to a full ocean view due to my platinum status. Also was sent a complimentary pineapple and water after arriving in the room. The room was great. The view was unbelieveable! Would recommend an upgrade to ocean view! The housekeeping staff was super. They checked every night to see if we needed more towels, and to drop off chocolate....very nice! Everything is within walking distance. Run's, a small sushi bar in the hotel is highly recommend. Read some complaints about the slow elevators. I never had to wait more than a minute for the elevator. Some reviews also complain about the outdated rooms. I found the rooms to be more than acceptable. The small fridge in the room was also nice. The beach is right across the street. Would recommend Roberts for shuttle service to and from the airport. Also Reliable Shuttle for a trip to Pearl Harbor instead of the expensive tours. They run every hour and the drivers are great!!Would stay away from Cheese (space) burger in Paradise. Thought this was associated with the Jimmy Buffett Cheeseburger (note no space) in Paradise chain, but learned it is not. The cashier actually left to watch the last few moments of a basketball game, leaving customers standing there for several minutes. Service was poor, and the food was poor. Duke's Canoe Club was also poor. Never saw a waitress until it was time to pay the bill. Would not return. You won't go wrong with a stay at the Waikiki Beach Marriott!
