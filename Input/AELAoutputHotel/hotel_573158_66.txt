{"text":"Good rooms, excellent service. Poor restaurant Previous reports give details of the well-furnished, smart clean rooms and bathrooms, but slightly out of the way location, which I will concur. We stayed at the Ramada for a week, booking through the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ own website that has long stay discounted rates. These rates beat the prices quoted in various Internet hotel search engines that are based on daily rates. Try to download and print the hotel name\/ address from the Internet before coming, as most drivers do not use English hotel names and we had difficulties with taxis until we showed them the hotel card.The hotel runs a free half hourly bus shuttle service to Airport Express in Central (10minutes away), but you need to ask at the concierge as most guests do not bother to use it, preferring to take the tram that runs every few minutes in front of the hotel. The shuttle bus is useful on the last day, as your luggage cannot be taken on the tram and saves you a taxi fare.If you travel on the Airport Express between Hong Kong and the airport (100HK$ for a single traveller - 70HK$ for more than one traveller) you can check in and deposit you luggage in the city airport counter and then you are free to wander around Hong Kong at leisure with your boarding pass in your pocket. At the airport, just walk through the departure gates.Airport bound buses A10 and A12 (HK$43) have stops almost opposite the hotel, but may be cumbersome if you have heavy luggage.We made a few local phone calls from our two adjoining rooms and to our surprise were not charged for the calls. I also left my luggage in the hotel for 10 days when travelling to China. They stored my suitcase without charge.The hotel restaurant at the ground floor is the smartest in the area and always busy, which normally is a good sign. However we found that the kitchen service was over stretched. At one table a man was shouting, as obviously his orders was not coming. One of our dishes took longer than 45 minutes, arriving after we cancelled it and when it arrived, it was the wrong order. We did not eat it and had problems in getting it taken off our bill. We were charged for the small plates of pickles and snacks brought to our table before the meal, that we had not asked for and thought were complimentary. The restaurant does not have English speaking staff or English menus. There are no toilets in the restaurant and customers have to cross the hotel lobby to use the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ toilets. ","annotations":[]}
