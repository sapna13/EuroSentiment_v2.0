{"text":"Unfriendly staff We stayed in the Grand Hotel Cavour for two nights during a trip to Tuscany. Although the lobby was very attractive, our inital impressions were poor. The doors were difficult to go through with luggage and no one offered to help. The reception staff were unhelpful, unfriendly and rude on occasions. We dropped off our luggage and returned to the hotel to check in at the correct time. We were informed our luggage would be brought to our room and were told breakfast was on the sixth floor. On arrival to our room, the maid was finishing our room - however had put the cleaning products on the bed which had leaked - meaning the bed had to be changed while we were waiting. It then took 45 mins and a phonecall to get our luggage brought up (no apology). Although the room was nice, it was very small and I would not have called it a superior room. On discussion with the staff they reassured me it was a superior room and kept saying 'do you not like the room?' but nothing else. Checking the website on return home the room did not meet the standards listed for a superior room.The room although small was nicely decorated and clean, as was the bathroom. The location of the hotel was excellent.The breakfast was disappointing in comparison to the other hotel we stayed in during our trip. There was no mention of the roof terrace, the room was overcrowded, ran out of hot water for tea and there was no fresh fruit - only tinned and dried fruit. In summary, the hotel was nice and in a good location but did not meet our expectations. The unfriendly staff were the main reason we did not enjoy our stay - ending with the reception staff during checkout asking us three times in a row are you sure you took nothing from the minibar? while we tried to convince them we hadn't. I wouldn't recommend this hotel as a 4* although with friendlier staff I'm sure I would.
