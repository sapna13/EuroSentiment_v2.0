{"text":"Great hotel My partner and I have just returned from a 4 night stay. We had arrived early so our room wasn't ready, but they took our luggage and it allowed us to have a wander around the immediate area and get some fresh air after our flight. When we returned to the hotel, we were seen to straight away, taken to the lift by one of the staff and shown how to use it. It may seem a bit pointless, but we encountered more than a few people that didn't know how to use it. The staff were wonderful and for a hotel that is 'upmarket' the staff in no way made you feel intimidated.We had booked a Business Junior Suite through the hotel website and got a good deal including breakfast. The room although nicely furnished and spotless was just a tad on the dull side and could have done with an extra lamp especially next to the reading chair which at night was impossible to use as you couldn't see what you were reading! My real niggle though was that we had a non-smoking room, and throughout the stay we could still smell smoke which seemed to either come through the air conditioning ducts or just wafted along the corridor from the rooms where smoking was permitted. Breakfast on the other hand was amazing. If you couldn't find something to eat at this spread then you have a problem. We decided to treat ourselves to breakfast in bed one morning and on checkout we were pleasantly surprised to find that the only extra cost incurred was 10 Euros.The hotel itself is in a nice area, although some people have mentioned that the station area down the road is seedy. I suppose that the seediness comes from the few sex shops and erotic museum (lol) in that area, but if you're offended by this sort of thing then don't go down there at night. During the day is fine though as its full of Berlin folk and tourists coming and going from the station.Not many of the sights most tourists will want to see are at hand, but the transport system in Berlin is fantastic. Take a few steps outside the hotel and there is a U-Bahn station that will take you to one that has crossover lines taking you all over the city. Or walk for a few minutes and find yourself at a train station with both S-Bahn and U-bahn lines that will take you to all the major sights around the city. One of the best things about Berlin is that most of the major attractions are within reasonable walking distance from one another.
