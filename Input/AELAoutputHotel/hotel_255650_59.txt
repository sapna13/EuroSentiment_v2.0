{"text":"Loved The Hilton This is a great hotel. It does cater to large conference groups but I never felt lost in the shuffle. Staff are very friendly and attentive. One evening there was a long line up for taxis and I was worried that I would miss my dinner reservation. While staff were trying to help by calling a taxi, the wait would have been at least 15 minutes. One fellow took things into his own hands and ran full speed into the street and returned a few minutes later jogging beside a taxi to ensure that I got that car. I was very impressed.As I booked on points I was able to use the Executive Lounge for breakfast which was very good and extensive. Cocktail hour was quite good as well, but a bit heavy on the fried finger foods. Really liked the fact they didn't charge for internet in the lounge. Dinner at the hotel was very good in a sleek and sexy room. The one bedroom suite was large and spacious but the standard room, while beautiful with the glass walled bathroom, was very cramped. Okay for one person but very small for two. The glass walled bathroom is also a problem if you don't want to wake your partner in the morning which is impossible if you switch on the bathroom light as it floods through the glass wall into the bedroom.Hotel is in a good location, not far from Circular Quay and Opera House and opposite the Queen Victoria Building which has great shopping and little cafes. Even if you're not interested in the shops it is worth a look as it has been beautifully restored. ","annotations":[]}
