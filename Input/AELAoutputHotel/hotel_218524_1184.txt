{"text":"Don't miss lunch on the beach- What Excellence! We stayed at Excellence, Punta Cana, DR from April 7 to April 12 and it was excellent. We did extensive research prior to choosing this hotel and we want others to know that you will not be disappointed.Arrival: We booked the ride to and from the hotel when we paid for the hotel through an agent. After our luggage arrived, we were whisked away by a porter straight to the VIP kiosk. Within 5 minutes we were driving down the street. The ride may have taken a bit of time (45 - 60 minutes), but it wasn't a big deal for us. It gave us a feel for the country. Besides, we came from snow and sun, even through a window, was welcome. Arriving at the hotel, we were greeted with welcome home, a cool glass of champagne, a moist and cool towel, and a fruit kabob. Check in took us about 5 minutes.Our room had fresh fruit and chilled champagne. Our room was beautiful with a view of the pool and a second-story view of the ocean. I think we had found paradise. Tours: We did two bike tours. Find Daniel in the sports bar and ask him for the tour that goes up the hill to the town. It was so much fun we did it twice. Use bug spray and wear comfortable clothing (i.e., gym shoes). We did two horse tours. One was in the morning and was free. The second was the sunset\/lagoon tour. No words can describe galloping through the ocean mist. We did an ATV tour. I would recommend using the tour company with the kiosk in the lobby. We used the company associated with the hotel. The ATV was fun and the countryside was beautiful, but we didn't get much information and were led to a high-pressure sales shop. Beach: Incredible. Very wide and soft sand. Plenty of chairs with shade and some beds available. Altagracia will brave all conditions to provide you with a steady supply of drinks and always with a smile. The lunch on the beach is a must!!!! It was some of the best food in the resort; some of the best food that I have ever eaten. Very fresh with a Dominican touch. I cannot recommend it enough. We have traveled all over the world and the seafood lunch that we received on the beach would have cost a fortune in a seaside restaurant somewhere else. Pool: Fantastic. Lots of chairs available. Towels prepared on each chair in the morning. Shade always available. Lie on beds under thached roofs, lie on beds under trellis, lie on lounge chairs under thatched umbrelleas, lie on chiars in the shallow water, lie on chairs in the sun. Just bring sunscreen and lots of it. Swim up bar was fun and friendly. Food: Pretty darn good. Certainly as good as any place we eat on a regular basis. Food and service comparable to a $60-100 meal in the US. Breakfast is awesome...try the international fare, you might be pleasantly surpised. Service was always impeccable. Definitely better than most U.S. restaraunts.Spa: Every day there is a special. Massage was great. Ask about having your massage on the beach (no extra charge) it was heavenly. Massage tables on the beach are on an elevated platform, with side screens. You can hear the waves, feel the breeze and smell the saltwater. Heaven.Staff: The staff is what made our trip truly excellent. I have never experienced a hotel\/resort staff so dedicated to the happiness of the vacationers.
