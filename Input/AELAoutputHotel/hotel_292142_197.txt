{"text":"Lovely hotel exactly as described Just stayed at Affinia Dumont for three nights 11-14th of April, fantastic! First time in New York to celebrate my husbands 40th and can't wait to return! Like many others we booked the Affinia Dumont because of the reviews. Hotel is exactly as described, no surprises all good! Arrived early evening shattered after delay with Virgin. Reception very quick and efficient, made us feel relaxed and at home straight away, gave us keys and maps and information. We had a one bedroomed suite on the 32 floor, I had asked for a very quiet room as was worried about sleeping and that's what we got, all that could be heard were the distant sounds of the sirens, no noise from any other room and they were occupied. This was a surprise trip and had told my husband to expect a small room (the norm for NY hotels so I am informed). He was amazed when we entered our suite, large room with sofa, two chairs, desk, tv, midi system, books, mini bar snacks etc. Small but very adequate kitchen inc. dishwasher, coffee maker with free coffee! Microwave, toaster, oven and hob, full size fridge\/freezer stocked with mini bar drinks, all the usual plates etc, everything you need! Separate bedroom with very comfortable huge bed and three lovely pillows (chosen from pillow menu). Bathroom good size, full bath and shower, sink and toilet, plenty of soft white fluffy towels and toiletries. The whole suite was immaculate, even the taps and grout, (I had read a lot about grotty bathrooms!) We were on the side\/rear corner overlooking the East river, uninterrupted views! Beautiful to watch the sun rise before setting off for the busy streets! Ordered room service that night as late, huge pizza for √ä√£¬¢7, more than plenty for two adults.The hotel is situated in the lovely residential area of Murray Hill, with local diners including Barking Dog (really missing their food)! and markets (corner shops) with hundreds of beautiful fresh flowers for sale outside! This was the only place we saw this in NY and it added a sense of wellness and sophistication to the area. This is a lovely tranquil area to return to at the end of the day. Checking out is noon but as our flights were in the evening we checked out early and Affinia kindly stored our bags for the day, I knew that they offered this service free of charge from the other reviews, this gave us the whole of our last day free from luggage, we did see many people walking around with theirs! When we returned we had free use of the spa changing rooms\/toilets to freshen up before leaving. They arranged a car to JFK for $65, taxi to the hotel had been $57, so it was very reasonable. Nothing was ever too much trouble for this hotel, the staff were always there for us. I know these reviews are read by the hotel, so thank you Affinia Dumont for a wonderful stay.
