{"text":"Miserable room Disclaimer: I am used to staying in three-star hotels. It's been a while since I stayed in a two-star hotel like this.I didn't get a decent night's sleep the entire four nights I was here. It was miserable and I will never stay here again.The worst was the mattress. It was hard and uneven, with hills, valleys, and springs everywhere.There was no desk lamp. I had a hard time seeing my work area with only the room light behind me (with my body casting a shadow on the work in front of me.) The desk was attached to the wall, so there was no way to fix this.There was no vanity light in the bathroom. The old sink had two separate faucets, making warm water impossible to get. This made shaving extremely frustrating.There was also no vanity counter in the bathroom... not even a shelf, so no place to set toiletries. The hot water faucet shut off if you turned it on too quickly. The toilet would not flush properly. When it did, it would run all night until you jiggled the handle about 50 times. There was a giant glob of dried toothpaste on the wall when I checked in. It was still there when I checked out.There were no bed-side lamps, nor a switch to turn off the room light from the bed. The bed also had nice, sharp corners, so it's no surprise that I cut my foot badly on the bed trying to find it in the dark.The art on the walls is nice, in theory. My room had a giant, scary Madonna (the pop star) head above the bed and Louis Vuitton logos everywhere else. I wouldn't call it art so much as generic gay-themed copyright infringment.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, unless they seriously update the place by replacing the mattresses, adding some lamps, and completely gutting and re-doing the bathrooms.
