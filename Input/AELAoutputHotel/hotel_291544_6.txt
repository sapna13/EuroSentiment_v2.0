{"text":"Perfect From the Moment We Arrived! When you arrive at your hotel after travelling all night, struggling with luggage and finding your way in a new city, it is wonderful to arrive at a hotel that makes you feel welcome and comfortable the moment you step out of the taxi. This was our first trip to Paris (two adults; two teens) and the Hilton was the perfect choice for us. We like to experience as much of the local feel of cities we visit as possible -- experimenting with speaking the language, local cuisine, public transportation, neighborhood pubs, etc. However, having a safe place to land at the end of the day where English is spoken and the accomodations are superb makes the trip all the more special.When we arrived, we were offered a discounted upgrade to a suite, which we accepted. The hotel is beautiful and modern. The location is just a few blocks from the Arc de Triomphe, where you can hop on a bus or metro. The Executive Lounge was an added bonus, serving a delicious hot breakfast, drinks, wine and beer through the day and evening and snacks. Really first rate!One note of caution! If you do not speak French, be sure to take a card or something with the hotel name, address and telephone number with you when you venture out. Our French is extremely limited and we couldn't pronounce the hotel name and street well enough to be understood and got lost a few times. The Paris locals tried to help, but it was our fault for not having the address and name written down. ","annotations":[]}
