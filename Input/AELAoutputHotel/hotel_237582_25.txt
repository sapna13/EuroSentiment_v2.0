{"text":"Great Choice in Amsterdam The Hotel Zandbergen is a clean, comfortable inn-type hotel located just outside the canal rings of Amsterdam. My wife and I recently stayed there the weekend before driving to Germany for business meetings. We were looking for someplace reasonably priced, clean, well run and convenient to a tram line. The Hotel Zandbergen easily met those requirements.The hotel is located on Willensparkweg in a residential neighborhood. This is a high rent district of Amsterdam where very expensive automobiles are commonplace. Neither my wife nor I found this neighborhood to be nearly as busy as some previous reviewers have indicated. The hotel is a two-minute walk from either the Emmastraat or Cornelis Schuytstraat tram stops on Line 2. A tram comes by every 10 minutes and will quickly take you to any place in Amsterdam in 10-15 minutes. If you were so inclined to walk to Central Station, it would take about 35 minutes. The appeal of the Zandbergen is that it is NOT in the middle of Amsterdam where hoards of noisy tourists and traffic rob the city of its charm. (TIP: If arriving from Schipol, take the train to Station Amsterdam South [World Trade Center], get on Tram 5 towards Amsterdam and get off at the Van Baerlestraat stop. Get on Tram 2 toward Sloten [away from Amsterdam] and go three stops to Emmastraat).The Zandbergen is in a typical Amsterdam dwelling with steep, narrow staircases and no elevator. Older or less fit folks with heavy suitcases could have some issues if no one is around to help. Our very clean, moderately sized room had a nice double bed with comfortable linens. The spotless bathroom was medium sized with modern fixtures and bright, clean tile. There was plenty of closet space. The TV had BBC1 and BBC2 and several other channels in English subtitled in Dutch. Our room even had a large balcony measuring about 16 square meters that looked upon a quiet courtyard. Breakfast was always fresh and ample, and the coffee was fabulous.The owner of the hotel, Henk, is one of the more pleasant people you will encounter anywhere. He is the consummate professional and a wealth of knowledge. And he truly understands service. As an example, one morning I came down right at 0700 for breakfast. Henk was still in the process of setting up. He stopped everything just to make me a cup of coffee without me having to ask. I even received an email from Henk a few days after we departed thanking us for our stay.The Hotel Zandbergen is not a luxury hotel. There are plenty of those in Amsterdam if that is what you are looking for. It is, however, a clean, comfortable and quiet place to stay just a few minutes removed from the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam. I found it to be a good value and would not hesitate to return on my next visit to Amsterdam.(p.s. If you are looking for a true culinary delight, then do NOT miss Spring Restaurant. It is a two-minute walk from the Zandbergen on the corner of Willensparkweg and Cornelis Schuytstraat. I eat here every time I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ in Amsterdam and it has always been outstanding. http:\/\/www.restaurantspring.nl) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1585,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1581},{"endOffset":1978,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1972},{"endOffset":2347,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2341},{"endOffset":2857,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":2850},{"endOffset":2857,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":2850},{"endOffset":2857,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":2850}]}
