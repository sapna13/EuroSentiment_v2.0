{"text":"Bali Hi!! We went to this hotel and stayed in a sea view room over-looking one of their numerous lagoons. The property is really well maintained with a great Bali feel to it. The property is BIG, with numerous wings, so do take your time to study the shortest route to your room. We stayed in one of their new rooms, which was really nice and the beds comfy. And most importantly it was clean. The room was spacious and well equiped. However they might want to put in some LCD screens in down the track as my eyesight isn't what it used to be. But I couldn't find any fault in my room.We fed the numourous coy in the pond who readily swim to visit you outside your window and demand food!! So if you have kids or want a relaxing time, get some bread. Sorry to hotel management if you're not allowed to feed them. The hotel does supply drinking water but only 2 small bottles, which really isn't enough, so just popping out to buy a couple of bottles of water is advisable. You can also buy water at the hotel, and it is cheap by international standards, but depends which is the easiest for you. The swimming pool is large and great. The offer poolside service and your order will take about 15 minutes. The hotel does have facilities, but I preferred to stay by the pool and enjoy the sun, beware, you do burn very quickly without knowing it in the bali sun as I found out the hard way!! So I'd recommend SPF 15-30 if you're intending a couple of days out there. The have an italian restaurant on the beach which was nice, and most importantly the food was reasonable and good. We went out most nights to Legian (embargo, sky bar, club 66 ... you can wear shorts everywhere...). The lobby bar at the hotel is also a nice chilled place to start the night, and to get to town, the hotel does offer a taxi service at Rp100K which is reasonable (up to 6 pax), and is the ~going rate at night. During the day, ask them to call you a meter taxi, it will cost Rp75k (~USD8ish) for the 1\/2 an hour trip and is air conditioned. Being the young night owl I am, I had breakfast once in my 4 day trip. And this does need to improve slightly. Service here at the hotel though is amazing, and the staff are more than willing to help. Overall I had a good time at this hotel. I wouldn't recommend it for the luxury boutique inclined, but a getway with friends or family will mean an awesome holiday.
