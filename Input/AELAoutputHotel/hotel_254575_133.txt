{"text":"Great budget hotel in London I would like to say that ALL the nice things that have been said about the Luna  Simone Hotel are true. Found the service is second to none and the two rooms I have stayed in were both very very clean. The area is safe and there are lots of good eateries and a supermarket nearby. Took me a bit over 5 mins to walk to the Victoria Station. The free use of internet is a thoughtful gesture and the breakfast was good.As for some previous comments about the lack of a lift, the staff will help to carry your luggage on request. The steps are not too high anyway.There were also comments before about the fact that you can hear sounds from the next room and\/or from the street. I found that it was true when I stayed in one of the rooms on the top floor. However, there was no such problem when I stayed in the twin room on the ground floor. Just ask for one of the ground floor rooms, which are at the back of the building, if you are a light sleeper and have issues with stairs. This is my fourth trip to London and I have stayed in both higher end and budget hotels. The owners and staff of Luna Simone had definitely made my visit this time very enjoyable and I will not stay at any other hotel when I visit London in the future. If only all budget hotels around the world are that great on service and cleaniness, I would be a very happy traveller.Thank you to all those who have left comments previously. It has definitely helped me to find the right hotel for my visit. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":359,"mention":"Victoria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Victoria_Bitter"],"startOffset":351}]}
