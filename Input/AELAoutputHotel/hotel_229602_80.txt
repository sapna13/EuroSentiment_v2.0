{"text":"Lovely hotel and neighbourhood We checked in on a rainy friday early afternoon for a long weekend break and were delighted that the positive reviews for this hotel were very accurate. I have stayed in a few hotels in Paris before for both business and leisure and have found this one to be excellent value for money and based in a great neighbourhood.The hotel is based in 2 buildings (one behind the other, linked by a small corridor). The hotel is based on a quiet road, just 1 minute from Rue de Cler, a wonderful, bustling, pedestrianised street, full of fromageries, fine foods, fruit and veg shops, and cafes and restaurants (excellent choices for morning croissants and coffee). The hotel is 5 minutes walk from Ecole Militaire metro, which means there is only 1 change (at Srasbourg St Denis) if you are travelling on the Eurostar from Gare du Nord. Furthermore the hotel is only 10-15 minutes walk to the Seine and 2 minutes from Rue St.Dominique, with its good restaurants, boulangeries and shoe shops, that leads you down to the Boulevard St Germain with its upscale swanky shopping options.The hotel rooms are nicely decorated, clean and spacious, and ours, though it was on the top floor in the attic, didnt have a restrictive ceiling height. Our room had a plasma screen with satellite channels and a partial view of the Eiffel Tower (the tower's lights flash for 10 minutes on each hour during the night!) and a well stocked mini bar and tea\/coffee facilities. The bathroom was clean and bright, with lush white fluffy towels provided, with the only mini-gripe being that the water pressure in the shower was rather low.The staff on the desk were very helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations, and very accommodating (they kindly stored our fromage in their fridge on our last day, until we were ready to leave).I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for good value for money and a quiet, central location.
