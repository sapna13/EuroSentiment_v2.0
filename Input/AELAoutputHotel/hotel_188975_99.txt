{"text":"Best Hotel In Europe I travel only a few times a year, so when I go somewhere, I want it to be as special as possible. After reading reviews here and finding that the George V is part of the AMEX Platinum program, we booked a deluxe King for 800 Euros. This happened to be our honeymoon, so I really wanted it to be extra special. As such, I wrote a letter in advance of our arrival. My AMEX rep also made a note in the reservation. Upon our arrival at CDG, we were met at the plane doors by a George V representative, and personally escorted through passport control  customs. We didn't have to wait in any lines or even stop to be inspected. We were then whisked away in a Mercedes van and arrived at the George V in about 45 minutes. I was very disappointed to learn they did not honor our guaranteed upgrade (something about full occupancy due to the French Open). Nonetheless, we were personally greeted by the new hotel director and escorted up to our room, which had a partial view of the Eiffel Tower. There were champagne and chocolates waiting for us, but no rose petal covered bed, candles, or other fancy tricks done by other top hotels for honeymooners. This too was slightly disappointing. The toiletries were BVLGARI brand, but seemed relatively cheap. I much prefer the Aveda or Kiehls products used by other hotels. We ate breakfast at Le Cinq every day (US$50 per person), and had a few drinks at Le Bar (US$33 each). Both experiences were ridiculously expensive, but worth the special treat. We were on our honeymoon, afterall. The spa was lovely, and the indoor pool featured wall murals depicting Versailles. The concierge could read us instantly, and made exceptional dinner recommendations for us. Make no mistake, this hotel will cost you an enormous amount of money. However, it is as close to perfection as you can get on a continent known for small rooms and poor service.
