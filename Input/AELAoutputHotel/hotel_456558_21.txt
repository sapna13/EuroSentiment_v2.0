{"text":"Great place to stay! We had a 9 night√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ stay in this hotel and we spent a good time there. The location is great with 2 subways within 5 min walking. Lots of restaurants and snack bars nearby. Two steps away you find a small supermarket, open till late at night, a little bit expensive but it could be a solution if you do not have toothpaste.As for the sightseeing, it's great. Opera is at 10 min max by foot, where you can catch a red bus to make a city tour. Till Eiffel Tower and Louvre there is a direct subway line. For shopping it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ impossible to imagine a better place, the famous shopping center La Fayette with its chick, very expensive boutiques or accesible fashion brands ( I mean that in any case you will find something to your taste and your budget) is in front of Opera.Now, about the hotel itself. You can occupy the room from 15:00 but you have the possibility to leave the bags at the reception and see Paris all the day. The room is very clean and morden, decorated in bright colours. In our room we had a flat screen TV with ALL channels free, free safe box, hair dryer and ensuit bathroom. The hotel breakfast that we had every day was not bad with good french croissans. The font desk staff is very helpful, polite, they are always available for any explication and speak good english. We recognize, it is a great place to stay. ","annotations":[]}
