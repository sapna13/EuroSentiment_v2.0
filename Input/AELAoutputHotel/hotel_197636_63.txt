{"text":"Comfortable, ideally situated small hotel A nice, small hotel at the Rue Monge end of Rue Lacepede - a road running up to the botanical garden, the Jardin des Plantes, and only a couple of minutes from the Palce Monge metro. The Left Bank is the place to stay in Paris if you prefer the historic, narrow streets of the Latin Quarter and the islands to the more commercial, sometimes tacky, touristy feel of the Bastille area or the institutional monumentalism of western Paris. The hotel was clean, well maintained and the staff cheerful and helpful ( all those at the reception spoke English). The room in the hotel was small (more amply proportioned people may find it, and certainly the cosy lift, a tight squeeze) but adequately equipped (small TV with BBC, mini-bar useful for keeping a bottle of wine) and had nice street views - we stayed on the third floor overlooking Rue Lacepede and enjoyed evenings sipping wine sitting by the window. The bathroom was fine with a powerful shower and efficient mixer taps. It could get hot in summer but we did not find the humdrum street noise from the open windows a problem except briefly on the Saturday night when there was a fight outside the nearby Irish bar, The Iron Bell. The boulangerie opposite and the better known Boulangerie de Monge were both great to pick something up for lunch and also check out the morning market in Place Monge.. For dinner it is hard to beat the restaurants along the Rue Mouffetard and the streets off - under E40 for a three course meal for two with a carafe of wine and coffee - and Cafe ZigZag on Rue Varlet near the Pantheon is a good place for a night cap.
