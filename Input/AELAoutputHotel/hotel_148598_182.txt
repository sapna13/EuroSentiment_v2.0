{"text":"Not my scene I was here for a conference so didn't choose it, but I was looking forward to the beach and some winter sun. The hotel is set in fine grounds with attractive pools and a long sandy beach. However, the sea was very rough and it was not possible to swim in the sea. My main gripe is over the rooms. They are a good size but have two large beds which take up all the room. One king bed and arm chairs would be preferable. The first room I was given was at the back overlooking an ugly roof with loud noise from the air conditioning system. I asked for a move which was arranged after asking three times and was given a room with partial sea view. The air conditioning only blew ice cold air keeping the room at about 62 degrees so I had to turn it off as despite my complaining nothing was done. It was so cold at first that when I opened the door to the balcony the whole room was enveloped in condensation. The other problem was the lack of sound proofing between rooms, and I was kept awake one night until 2 am by next door's TV. All my colleagues were disappointed with their rooms at the back overlooking car parking or flat roof areas. Definitely make sure to book a sea facing room above the third floor.The restaurants were pricey, especially for wine which had exorbitant mark-up, and the food in the Asian restaurant was disappointing, whilst the Palio Italian was good.The location is less than ideal being so far from San Juan so that a car is really essential. The hotel shuttle is expensive and I paid $50 to go into Old San Juan.Overall I found the hotel too big and I missed having anything else in the vicinity which meant being tied to the hotel restaurants.
