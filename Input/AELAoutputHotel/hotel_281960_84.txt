{"text":"Our Altamont Festival Arriving early on a Saturday morning, my wife and I were able to store our bags at the nearby hotel down the street until the Altamont opened its doors. At 8 am Alan unlocked the front door and we checked in.Alan is everyone's dream hotelier; a combination of manager, concierge and confidant. We felt welcome from the start. Of course when a hotel costs half as much as the nearest competition, one wonders what the catch is. There really is no catch. The furnishings are not lush but certainly adequate. The hotel is clean and well run.There is a front reception area which is quite large. It is a sort of combination, living room, lounge bar and billiards area. When Alan is on duty, delightful music from the past is played. Very relaxing.The actual room in which we stayed was not going to win any prizes in Architectural Digest. It was however clean, quite spacious and held a queen-sized bed. There is an en suite bath with a shower. The shower had good hot water and a strong stream and the shower head is highly enough placed that a tall person can shower without having to duck down.There was a TV which seemed to get the standard 5 Sydney stations. The room also had an electric tea pot and plenty of tea and coffee available for waking up in the morning for free. Once one gets up he or she can go out to the front reception area and sit at one of the tables and have some cereal (corn flakes or rice krispies), bread (white or whole wheat), various spreads like butter, peanut butter, jelly, honey, or that Australian spread know as Vegemite. There is hot tea and coffe available (free also). In the evening one can enjoy a glass of wine or a beer there also.The hotel is only about a 5 minute stroll away from the Kings Cross train station. Another 5 minute stroll gets you to the bus stop. From one of these, you can get anywhere in Sydney.The greates thing about the location is that by cutting through the parking lot across the street to Victoria Street, you are immediately in the midst of restaurant row. There are some very fine places to dine there each night and all within 5 minutes stroll of the hotel.I think if I were a consumer magazine, I would rate this hotel a best buy. It has the combination of inexpensive rates (be aware if you are from the USA that Sydney is much more expensive than anywhere in America), excellent management (Alan), and proximity to whatever you want to get to in Sydney.We would stay there again. I hope we can someday.
