{"text":"Loved The Grand Palladium Punta Cana Group of 16 Feb.11-22\/07 Previous trips include: Aruba x2 Florida x3 Punta Cana x3 Curacao x1 Our flight was supposed to leave at 4 p.m. out of Pearson in Toronto but was an hour late taking off. (skyservice very tight seating) When we arrived in Punta Cana there were two overseas airlines disembarking on approaching the inside of airport we were sent to the left side where about 5 lines were pushed into one, a real mess to get through, took over on hour, after this all good. Only 25 minute ride to resort, and relatively quick check in and then on to our rooms. Our room was in the 2000 building which was very close to restaurants, pools, beach, casino and lobby and very, very clean. The resort is very large if you want to use the whole of it, but one could stay in the Punta Cana section alone and have everything they needed. Loved the fact that you could go for a half hour walk around the resort, lots to see. The beach was absolutely stunning and the waves were so much fun, but a bit of undertoe, so beware. The restaurants we visited were delicious and I really don't know how anyone could not have found something to their liking. We came up to the swimup bar about 4 everyday and it was fun to watch everyone. Animation team were never pushy and lots of fun. The only thing I would change is to have more bottled water in the rooms as we were always running out. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, I loved it. ","annotations":[]}
