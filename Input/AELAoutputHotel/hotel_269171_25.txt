{"text":"Do Not Book Standard Room Just back from four nights in this hotel. My only real gripe was that(possibly own fault) was the standard double room that we booked was the worst we have had on any of previous four visits to The Dam. Asked for better quality room but would have had to pay a further 40 Euro per night...besides hotel was full. Had booked this as part of a 50th gift for fiancee and there was no real space in the room. We had paid roughly same price 2 year ago for bed\/breakfast at nearby Hotel Nes and had great view over canal. ROOM in Eureka consisted of very large double bed which took up most of room, thin wardrobe (no drawers anywhere), TV, dvd player, hair dryer, tea making facilities...our room was at back of hotel facing other back rooms, pipes. SHOWER room was small but expected that but hated shower as itwas of the type where curtain goes to floor and drains as floor on a slope...this did work ok but would have prefererred something to stand in. STAFF were very helpful and did explain this was their lowest standard of room and could not fault them as during our stay they were most helpful. As been to The Dam before we found this an ideal situated hotel. In the hotel we thought the stairs and walls, decoration in our room was quite tatty. Breakfast was excellent and free on first morning, 10 Euro the rest. I thought an idea would be good to offer the complimentary breakfast on the last day, especiallyfor those who spend that bit too much and a good breakfast before flight home would be excellent. Overall, you get what you pay for in most hotels, if you get a great room by paying the standard price good on you. We did have this booked since November last year and hade-mailed our requests but got no response. We were on top floor room 45. ","annotations":[]}
