{"text":"Bad, bad, bad My husband and I go to Bali yearly and have always stayed around the Kuta\/Legian area so for a change we picked Seminyak this time. I picked the Pelangi based on the great reviews so I was really shocked when we got to our rooms after a night flight in from Singapore.The long and dark corridor we were led down to our rooms resembled a jail with high-walls on one side. When our porter opened the door to our room, it smelled like mildew and when the air-con was turned on, the musty smell intensified. Who needs a large room when it smelled this bad. When I peeked into the bathroom, it made me really curl my toes as I walked in and saw mould in the corners. The ventilation fan made a funny noise and the towels were no longer white and was spotted with stains! The bad experience continued the next morning. Construction nearby started banging away so we got up and went to breakfast. Even the great location and proximity to the beach did not help. Breakfast was nothing spectacular and in any case, you'll be too busy swatting flies. The pool which looked so good in pictures is really small and narrow with constantly had well-oiled folks contributing to the layer of grease on the surface. I sure did not want to get into that water.We got the hell out of Pelangi and headed to another hotel to salvage our holiday. Mind you, I'm not a prissy traveller. I have no qualms about roughing it out and have paid USD18 a night for simpler accomodations in Bali that's more pleasant than here. What pisses me off is that I paid USD68 a night and it just ain't worth it. ","annotations":[]}
