{"text":"Great location, beautiful lobby We stayed at the Fullerton for 5 nights on vacation. Booked the Easter Special, which was still about $350 per night with taxes, so not cheap. The room was a tad cramped but otherwise very nice. The bed was very firm, which I prefer, but if you like a pillowtop mattress it may be too hard. The bathroom was extremely nice. Try to book a room with a river view, which is much nicer than the sea view which looks over the highway at the harbor, and directly across you see the forest of cranes building the new casino. Also, try to book a high floor. The breakfast buffet, which was included, was extremely nice, with tables outside on the riverfront. The pool and health club are also very nice. I especially appreciated the pool because it is good for lap swimming (25 meters). My wife I would get there at 6am (before sunrise) and have the whole pool to ourselves, which was heaven. Don't have the hotel arrange a pick-up at the airport. It costs about 4x as much as a taxi and we had to wait 20 minutes for the driver to show up (after phoning the hotel), who then complained that we were late. The location is ideal, just a short walk along the river to the Raffles subway stop, and you can walk to lots of great places from the hotel. Overall I would recommend it, especially if you can get a good deal.
