{"text":"Good value The hotel is good overall. The beach is lovely and pool a good size. Food was good quality in comparison to other carribean hotels we have visited. The down side was at the weekends all the locals come in and basically take over. there are no sun loungers, they get very roudy at the bar and i got nervous swiming up to the pool bar for a drink with comments made as you swim past. On the first day they arrived they got so drunk that people were being sick in the pool and security had to drag them out - i didn't see it being cleaned afterwards. They take over the dinning rooms and trying to get a reservation is a nightmare as they appear to take priority over hotel guests. This was one area which drove me crazy, you can make reservations for dinner in a restaurant for that day only. so when you go at 8am (when the concierge opens) they tell you they are fully booked or they have 10pm....?!?!? Concierge we rude, maid came begging a few times at our room which annoyed slightly as we always leave tips a the end of our stay. Evening and activities staff were good, they work very hard but clearly enjoy thier jobs. the dirty dancing\/ micheal jackson show where fun to watch. Casino was an added bonus if you wnated to escape the evening heat - no public areas had air conditioning - non restaurants so it did get very warm.Overall the hotel was nice enough, staff friendliness varied. Dinner reservations are impossible to get the hang off, and the weekends where a nightmare for us. the weekdays perfect! ","annotations":[]}
