{"text":"Horrendous Service We were on a four-night trip in Bali and we stayed for 2 nights at Conrad Bali. Only thing that we can say from our stay is that the service from Conrad is way below par to any 5 star resort or hotel in Bali. We have booked the hotel 3 months before our arrival and the hotel has asked for our flight details 1 month in advance in the pretense that they want to ensure that our rooms will be ready when we arrived. We arrived at 2.00 p.m (our check-in time) however we only managed to get into all our rooms at 5.00 p.m. When we requested for a late check-out due to the late check-in time, hotel staffs were not helpful, and didn't even bother to response or follow-up. Only when we have raised the issue to the resident manager, then they try accommodate that request albeit reluctantly. We ordered noodles from the children's menu for the kids and waited for more than one and half hour before it is delivered. And that is after constant calling to room service to check on the status, the reply that we got every time we called room service was that the food is on the way. (We wondered where do they actually get the food from that it requires more than an hour to be delivered). When the food finally arrived, to our horror, the noodle soup is mixed with chili. When we complained that they have put chili into a kid's food, the reply that we got was that there was none. But upon tasting the food, it was definitely too spicy for the kids. We asked the staff to actually taste the food before they finally acknowledged that the noodle contained chili. So we have to order again. BTW, the hotel didn't even took the initiative to refund the noodle soup. Upon checking out, we were shocked to find that there were extra charges (Service Tips was the description) on our bill. The staffs said that we have eaten in the Suku coffee shop and that we have requested the tips to be billed to our room. (Make one wonders, how could it be possible that we paid the food in cash and the tips to be billed to the room). Anyway, we asked the hotel to produce the signed receipt, since they insisted that there was such a bill consisting of tips only. After searching for half an hour, they couldn't find it and reluctantly removed it from our bills. The impressions that we got from our stay in Conrad was that to pay the kind of money for the horrendous service that comes with it was definitely not worth it. The services that the hotel provides still has got a long way to catch up with the great, nice and clean rooms that the hotel provides.
