{"text":"Wonderful location  We stayed here 3 nights in October and had a wonderful time. The staff was extremely friendly during check-in and we were very pleased with the room. Everything was very neat and clean, although the bathroom was a little strange :) There was no separator between the shower floor and the bathroom floor...just a shower curtain that kept the spraying water all in one area. As long as you realize this before you turn on the water and pick up your clothing off the bathroom floor first it's not an issue at all. There was great hot water and water pressure and a hair dryer in the bathroom, so don't bother bringing one with you.Breakfast in the morning was a typical European breakfast with bread, cold cuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, cereal, yogurt, juice and tea. We had it the first morning but the second morning we went out to one of the numerous cafes that serves English breakfast and had eggs, toast, and bacon.The location of the hotel is what made it really worth it. It's only a few blocks walking distance from the train station and right on the edge of the Jordaan. We were able to comfortably walk to the Anne Frank house, the Red Light District, and the Flower District. The street itself is quiet and the hotel overlooks a canal. We were given a room that overlooks the canal and also backs up to the elevator shaft. We thought this might be a problem but we never heard a thing. They have free wireless internet and the pay movies are also free so you get a few extras for your money.When you leave the hotel you leave your key at the front desk but, as a security measure, they give you a card that you have to show to get your key back. I really liked that :) The staff was always pleasant and when we checked out they gave us a free package of tulip bulbs!We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely stay here again!
