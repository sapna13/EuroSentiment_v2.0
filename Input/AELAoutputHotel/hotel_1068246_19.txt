{"text":"We had a fabulous time at the Elegance My husband and I booked this flight not knowing that the hotel would not be completed when we arrived. After a little bit of stress, we decided not to cancel the trip\/hotel and boarded the plane not knowing what we would have when we arrived. We were lucky and booked the Club Elegance level (which I would highly recommend) and right from the start - our butler Angel took us on a walk through the grounds pointing out amenitites which made us feel welcome. We walked to the beach  into a private lounge where we were greeting with drinks and appetizers and personally checked in. We did have a few hicups the first night with our first room - the drain was plugged in the shower and it flooded our room. The next day they moved us over to the opposite side of the resort and the room was perfect and functioned just as it should the rest of the trip. The bed was new and very comfortable and the bedding was higher end. We found the restaurants great! The best was the Japanese  Steak restaurant. The bartenders were funny and talkative - we recommend asking for the Caiparina. The staff went way out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. They cleaned our rooms several times a day and did extra things in the room to make it romantic and inviting. Tips: you need to ask for the top shelf alcohols. They have them - they just don't give them unless you ask. They also have a really great wine list but they don't have it out. Once again, you have to ask for the Sommelier  the List and they will bring it to you. (extra cost for the good stuff but worth it). Go to breakfast early - the good types of fruit tends to run out by mid-morning - or ask for what you want  they will get it for you. The bar up top on the main lobby makes the best Capuccinos. Pitfalls - this is a brand new hotel so there will be hiccups here and there. Ask to be moved if you are not happy with what you get. Also, the foliage needs a few months to grow up. Overall, we felt we had a wonderful vacation and are planning to come back. We would recommend this to our friends. Get the Club Elegance package!
