{"text":"Beautiful Landscaping, Poor Food We arrived @ the Resort 2 couples 5\/21 to 5\/25. Upon arrival hotel staff spoke little to no English. We were given 2 double beds in each room. Our room the bed was lopsided and a little dingy; I immediately called the front desk to be swapped to a king size they told us 10 minutes someone will be down and it took almost 2 hours before we were switched. We were switched to 41074106 Nice king size walk out to the pool room.We booked with Hotwire so transfers from the Airport wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ incld in the All Inclusive Package; transportation from the Airport was 60.00 for 4 people, equivalent to 15.00 pp . And on the way back we just asked the hotel staff and they promptly made taxi arrangements cost 70.00 in total for us. Had we booked thru an agent the transfers would have cost more than 32.00 pp . The Drive from the Airport is about an hour and quite a rough ride the roads have several huge pot holes, they drive so reckless. Malnourished animals, Tons of Debris on the side of the road. Resort: The grounds of this resort is Beautiful, well kept lots of trees and plants the pool is the BEST travels thru the whole resort , Wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ impressed with beach at all, quite breezy and a fishy odor and the sand extremely hot even when wearing flip flops needless to say the pool is the BEST place to be Casino  Disco both a little on the small side but a wonderful addition to the Resort The Restaurants: The World Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ is pretty much the main dining, the only place you get Buffett Breakfast, Lunch  Dinner (And they were all hit or Miss) Room service is absolutely the worst food ever!!!!! We ordered chicken tenders and fries, thinking they can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mess that up. They did the chicken over fried and the fries were just soggy. The Pizza was the most consistent and the best thing going there. The Japanese Restaurant was great. Unsure what made me sick Thursday think I had food poisoning, I was out of commission for a little over a day√à√\u2020\u2022?I had continuous vomiting and diarrhea√à√\u2020\u2022? After speaking with several people quite a few people had gotten sick. The Drinks are great!!!!!! Make sure you try the Sammie Sousa and for you couples definitely try the MaMaJuana (liquid Viagra) it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ great... So good we bought some to bring back home in the Airport Overall we had a great time the entertainment staff is great, lots to do on the resort However the Resort is pretty much in the middle of nowhere, any excursions take an hour or more to get there The core Zone offers table tennis, Tennis, basketball, Table Hockey, Flat screens all around, They also Advertise the WII on the daily flyer, but when we inquired about it were told it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ broken√à√\u2020\u2022?
