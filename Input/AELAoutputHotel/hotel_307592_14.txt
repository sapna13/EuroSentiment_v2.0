{"text":"another slice of heaven as we said last time about Amankila we would be back .we persuaded my Cousin and her Husband who had never left Aus to join us .we arrived at the airport late at night but the friendly guide was there to greet us collect the luggage ,give us a lovely cold face towel to freshen up then a bintang to enjoy on the journey .We both had booked a pool suite so an early morning swim revived us before breakfast and a tour of the resort.Assistant Manager Yuki met us to discuss what we wanted to do for the 5 days,she had a lovely personality and a great knowledge of the area.For the first two days our cousins kept pinching themselves ,they could not believe there could be such a beautifull place with such exceptional service nestled on a hillside overlooking the sea.we chose a morning cruise with snorkelling around a small reef with a terrific array of colored fish,A hike through the rice fields with a wonderfull clear view of Mt Agung the nearby volcano.The highlight was the Sate dinner in the Bale in the Rice fields. After discussing with James the head chef our choices we had our own personal chef prepare ten different sate courses which were just fantastic.On the last day Tracy (the general manager) who had looked after us so well last trip arrived back from a business trip.She went out of her way to make sure all was well.I am sure her repoir with the guests is one of the major reasons why the resort and its service is just so fantastic .Well done to Tracy and her staff.Like we said last year we will be back.
