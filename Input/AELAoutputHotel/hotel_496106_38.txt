{"text":"Irishcurse This was a last minute stay, only one night on Carrabana weekend. We heard about this hotel from friends of a friend while sitting over cocktails at Mother's in Buffalo, NY. These folks were so excited about this hotel that they actually had it on speed dial. After twenty minutes they had my girlfriend and I so excited that I called on the spot and made a reservation.The Hotel is in an artsy neighborhood, well west of downtown TO. We had drinks in the outdoor cafe while waiting for our room to be readied. To say the neighborhood is eclectic is an understatement, but it is fun.Our room (301) was a Den about 185 sq. ft. and it was incredible, what a great use of space! Hard to believe that there is so much in such a small place, the room itself is FUN. The public spaces were great. We had a great dinner in the Dining Room with a wonderful server named Allen (Al) quite a character. While dining they had a Jazz group playing in the lounge which is on the other side of a staircase that goes to the SkyBar. The SkyBar is the happening place in the area, again all kinds of people, all ages.The employees at this property are outstanding and always willing to help with all your needs. A special thank you to Stephanie the front desk clerk who checked us in and explained everything about the hotel.While this hotel may not be for everyone, be adventurous, go for it, you will not regret it.
