{"text":"Beautiful Hotel I read many of the reviews so I knew what to expect, although the prices still shocked us! The Lobby and hotel grounds are gorgeous. Our room was a nice size and the bathroom was not cramped like many hotels. They gave us the wrong room initially but corrected the problem right away. I went on this vacation with my husband and parents, all adults no kids and I think this hotel is geared towards families. I am glad the pool was large enough that we could stay on one side which was more quiet, while the other side with the slide stayed packed with little ones, and large familes. There are two complaints that I do have, 1) The prices of food, spa services, and transportation were rediculous. 2) The concierge desk were not helpful and many times rude. The advice I would give you is to defintely plan on renting a car and do your research of what you want to do before you arrive. You can drive into Old San Juan and San Juan and eat at some wonderful restaurants, or some of the smaller restaurants that are in Rio Grande. You can also save money by eating a muffin, or bagel at the cafe rather than the $23\/person buffet for breakfast. Get your beer and liquor from the corner store rather than the $10 drinks in a small dixie cup the hotel offers! Eat at Shimas, the asian restaurant in the hotel it is worth the price!!! Overall it was a great time!
