{"text":"A great hotel My boyfriend and I stayed in the Hotel Adagio the last weekend of October 06. We reserved a deluxe king corner guest room, which was on the 7th floor. Compared to the last SF hotel I stayed at (Hotel Triton), the room was *huge*. The Joie De Vivre\/Hotel Adagio website gave a pretty accurate preview and 360 degree virtual tours of what we could expect with respect to our room, the lobby, etc. Our bathroom was oddly shaped, but was also ginormous compared to what you might expect from an older property. (We theorized our room--which was not a suite--was actually two tiny rooms remodeled into a larger one. Again, this isn't a complaint.) If you're an Aveda user, you'll like the complementary shampoo and soap. ;-) The lobby was very chic and modern, spacious, really quiet, and the staff was friendly enough. PROS*The hotel is super-convenient to Union Square, the fancy new Westfield SF Ctr. with a brand new Bloomingdale's, ritzy food court, and the world famous Nordstrom with the curving escalator. Macy's, Saks Fifth Ave., and Neiman Marcus are only a few blocks away as well.*The Powell St. BART\/MUNI station is probably a 7-minute walk to\/from the Adagio. This was key for us because we could board the cable cars at Powell St., or take public transportation to the Castro or the Mission District (via BART) or the new DeYoung Museum in Golden Gate Park (via MUNI).*There's FREE WI-FI in the lobby, and FREE internet in the hotel rooms. (They'll even lend you an ethernet cable if you don't have one!) Since paying for internet connectivity at the other chain 4-star hotels annoys me to no end, I am so appreciative of the Adagio's free internet. Additionally, if you didn't bring a laptop, there are 3-4 computer terminals in the business center (really a quiet hallway behind the lobby) which are free for guests to use.*My boyfriend and I didn't take advantage of them, but the Adagio offers several complementary walking tours of SF with fun themes like hidden local cafes and breakfast spots, gay SF, a foodie tour, etc.*The entire property is non-smoking. Hooray. CONS*Not really a criticism of the hotel, but SF's homeless problem is well-documented. The Adagio is in the Theater District (is this a bona fide SF neighborhood, or the tourism board's spin?), which is only a couple blocks from Union Square--but also only a couple blocks from the Tenderloin. We never felt uncomfortable (we're from Seattle, and there's a noticeable homeless presence there too), but really--if you're staying in the city's most popular tourist destination, you should expect that panhandlers will naturally congregate in that area as well. MY TIPS*If you're a light packer, you can take Air BART\/BART from Oakland to the Powell St. BART\/MUNI station for less than $10 one way. Just be prepared to walk a few generous blocks to\/from the hotel. (Believe me, it's an invigorating walk, not the Bataan Death March. Really.)*The Adagio offers free internet connectivity, both wired and wireless. We like free.*There's complementary tea and coffee in the lobby, or you can go a block and a half east to the Starbucks located directly next to the Hotel Diva. There's a Walgreen's less than a block from the hotel.*In the aformentioned Westfield SF Ctr., there's the *world's ritziest food court*, with a reasonably priced food (for SF) and a Beard Papa's (a Japanese chain selling yummy creme puffs), as well as a fancy-schmancy Bristol Farms supermarket.*We bought a 3-day MUNI passport, which costs $18 and gives unlimited MUNI transport. If you factor that round-trip fare on the cable cars = $10, you're already ahead. Also, my pass was good for $2 at the DeYoung Museum.In short, the Adagio was a very clean, spacious, and--dare I say--hip hotel, without much attitude. My BF and I felt we got our money's worth, and would definitely stay there again next time we're in the city.
