{"text":"Honest Review - Loved The Bravaro BUT We stayed at the Iberostar Bravaro Nov 11-18. It rained a lot that week. But we still did have a good time. A couple of nice days of sunshine. On our reservation we put in the comments: Junior Suite by the pool away from the noise. There is a lot of noise next to the construction. We got there and they put us furthest from the pool and closest to the noise. We moved one day later, Betty is great at the service desk. Anyway we have been to 3 Iberostar's this one is very nice. However we like the Mayan in Rivera Maya better. The food was very good they only allow you 3 restaurants for reservations. Book early and go back each day at 2:30-3:00pm to check for cancellations√à√\u2020\u2022? Friday is the all you can eat lobster. Overall the food was very good. One night we ordered room service pizzas, salad, hamburger, brownie, basic stuff but good. Drinks not really any top shelf liquor. But we found there national drink call mamajwana its very good try some. I drank president beer they have bottled beer also but not at the pool Its OK.... If you only drink bud light or miller you may not like it. If you ask the gardeners or landscape people they will bring you coconuts and take them to the bar and they will fill them with frozen coco locos these are very good. I can't rate the entertainment. or the excursions√à√\u2020\u2022?we didn't go. We hung out at the beach and pool which are both very nice. Lots of daily activities from staff to make it fun. The grounds and resort are kept very clean. We did go to the casino and the shops. Casino very small, but has enough slots and table games to make it fun. Shopping at beach make sure you deal with these guys. Prices all over the place. A couple of important tips. The do enforce the long pants for men, No shorts at restraants but buffets ok. Ladies can wear just about anything. Bring an extension cord. not a lot of plugs in the room to charge cameras and cell phones. We brought a portable DVD player with a couple of movies. Came in handy when it rained. Bring an alarm clock no rooms have clocks, Tip your maid a couple of dollars each day to get bottled water and pop and beer. we always take $100 us singles. However I don;t think we got any better service than anyone else. The staff is very friendly. We also brought air fresheners for the room from reading these reviews(no need) . Both our first and second room we moved to very nice and clean and did not smell. We did not get sick nor the 4 other couples we were with. I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ talk to anyone that got sick. As far as the people complaining about this place I am not sure what they want but the resort is very beautiful and remember you make your own vacation. My advice to all the nay Sayers this is not the most expensive resort I have ever stayed at. It is also not the best nor worst resort I have stayed at. But for the money we had a lot of fun and got tan even with the rain. I also don't see how you can lose weight here. there is food everywhere. But if you want to really be papmpered go to Secrets Excellance in Rivera Maya but 2x the cost... Have Fun....
