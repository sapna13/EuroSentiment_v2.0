{"text":"Please go to the Bamboo!!!! 2 couples aged 22-28. Okay we went to the RIU Taino in Nov 06 and since we are booking our next vacation, I thought it was time for a review... And both fortunately and unfortunately I remember most of it.Check-in: 1 bus full of people and this was at 11pm. Good for us because we ran like [--] to the front desk, bad for the rest because the wait took forever! No one showed us where to go and no one took our bags, and since we were on the 2nd floor and exhausted, I was right angry when I had to carry my heavy luggage up 2 flights of stairs!Food: Good buffet, the pizzeria was fantasic and the chocolate covered bananas were so good a few of us were sick from eating too many! The mexican restaraunt was the only decent a la carte there. I was very excited to get to the steak house but left with the vision of bleeding cows in my head. All fat and blood and I swear they were saying moooo. Beach: FANNNNNNNTASTIC! Weather? 4-7 days overcast and rain, but me and the b\/f made the most of it ;)Pool: SUCKED ROYALLY. The swim up bar was discusting! We headed over to the Bamboo and OMG we were in heaven, the pool is to die for and the service was superb!! Rooms: 2nd floor was great BUT!!!! the sheets were old and stained and were rock hard. They looked like the outside of soon to be shower curtains!Maids: So very nice. Our maid was very pregnant and cleaning our room in bare feet and still had a huge smile on her face. She left us extra towels, pillows and whatever we needed. She was awesome and very appreciative of us tipping her, but she deserved it!NOTE: BRING BUG SPRAY IF YOUR MOSQUITO PRONE LIKE ME!!!! It costed me like 12 bucks US for a bottle of bug spray that lasted me 2 nights!!!! UGH!Hmmm, oh yes and get your beach towels early cause once there out, there out. And save seats by the pool cause they go fast! Excursions: Do not go on the shark one. It sucked royally. Honestly we swam with them for maybe 20 minutes out of 8 hours and most of the time swimming with them you were too busy trying to get out of everyone elses way! It was an awful waste of like 70 bucks Can.Note to the boys: Please do us women a favour and when the bartender at the beach bar asks if you'd like to try something new... say no... because eventually you will end up drinking anything in front of you, get hammered and get sick for 2 days and blame it on the food when really....... you were being stupid. HAHA. Stupid boys and their manliness.We did have a good time because the people who we went with are great. Oh and btw Canadians.... DEFINATELY A GERMAN RESORT. In 7 days we met like 3 canadian couples. I would not go to this resort again but I would definately stay at the Bamboo. That resort rocks and is better priced.
