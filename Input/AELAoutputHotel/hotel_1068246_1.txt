{"text":"4 Star that will be a 5 star in a few months!! My husband and I stayed at the Majestic Elegance from December 28th - Januaury 4th. After reading some of the reviews I think some people completely over reacted to the severity of the resorts problems. When we initially arrived at the hotel we were greeted with a smile and were pleasantly surprised at how much the hotel resembled the pictures in the travel brochures. We checked in at about 2 pm and were told our room wasn't ready so we headed to the Seaside restaurant for lunch and upon returning to reception our room was ready. At first, our room's shower was not completely finished, but after making the front desk aware of this it was immediately attended to. Other than that our room was gorgeous. I have stayed at many resorts and never have I had a room that was as nice. Two nights when we went to shower there was no hot water, but once again after calling the front desk that problem was looked after. These types of problems are very common with a new resort and hopefully they will have these glitches worked out sooner than later.All of the restuarants were great with lots of selection. You could always get something made on the spot. The only down side to the main buffet was that none of the food was labelled so at times we had no idea what we were getting into.The beach was incredible. We could walk in either direction for miles and walked the beach everyday for at least an hour. The pool was also great and went on forever. Some people complained of the pools temperature, but it was nice and refreshing amidst the hot weather. Go here with a relaxed attitude and you will have a fanstatic time! ","annotations":[]}
