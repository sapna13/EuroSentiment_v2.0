{"text":"One of the BEST!!! I spend over 3 months of the year in hotels and this is one of the best I have ever stayed in. We checked in at 10pm were upgraded to a Club room. The oceanview club room was amazing with a large balcony, 2 bathrooms both with showers and a seperate lounge area.The Ritz property is amazing. 3 pools and a private beach. I particularly liked the salt water pool on the cliff. The pool side service was fantastic. You must try and watermelon juice that is served in a full sized watermelon.The service was excellent and staff were extremely well trained. There is so much attention to detail at this hotel and was beyond my expectations. Firstly, at the pool, I was provided with a selection of ipods, each ipod has a different music genre. Secondly after walking up the nasty stairs from the cliff pool, we were provided with cold scented towels to cool off. I did not eat at any of the restaurants but we had (2 of us) room service twice and pool side lunch and the total was approx US$100 which I thought was very reasonably priced. All the food we ate at the Ritz were really tasty. The Nasi Goreng was the best I have ever tasted. The hotel is popular with asian luxury tourist and NOT groups. I spoke to one of the people at the hotel. It is approx 35% Japanese, 15% Koreans, 15% Russians, 10% Taiwanese, 10% Hong Kong, 15% mixed Australia\/ French\/ German\/ Singapore. You will find that most of the staff speaks Japanese. I was told none are groups except for the Taiwanese.Being a popular destination for non sun bathing asian tourist is quite an advantage as it leaves plenty of deck chairs available for sunbathers. The diversity of different nationality also means breakfast was a smogasbord of western, japanese, chinese, scandinavian breakfast available. Yummy!There were 2 locations for breakfast. One was the buffet and the other was a-la-cart. I personally prefered the a-la-cart next to the pool.On the downside, i did notice the thin walls. I could hear next door's tv and some coughing from my lounge room. I also thought the private beach was overrated and the internet was disgustingly expensive US$7 for 30mins.Overall, I thought this hotel is well maintained, well runned and its people are well trained!!!
