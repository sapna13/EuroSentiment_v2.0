{"text":"Poor service... Talk about some good things first...Breakfast is not bad indeed. It is sufficient and fresh...the bathroom and bed is generally clean.For negative...it is TOO much...the worst thing is the attitude of the stuff. They are definitely indifferent and arrogant to the guests. When we arrived, they arranged a room for us. It was small and untidy. The air-conditioner is not worked as well. We requested to change another room. The tone of the stuff is terrible and very bad manner. He needed me to wait, not to handle it immediately and said 'Not you want, you want!' If we were not booked on credit card, I must leave with my wife. They are also not helpful to provide information to us...very arbitrary to answer us. When we leave, we stored the luggage in the hotel..but very bad service! The stuff pretend not to hear our question...when we spoke loud to him...he said he got it and need us to wait for him to finish his work...Actually, he is nothing to do in the front desk. Besides, the hotel is not new as the photo shown. The location is inside a residental building. It is in 2\/F,...and 3\/F,4\/F is living with local people. You may not ease to find the hotel. The lift is old and very small. Two people is max. capacity. So, don't bring too much luggage. Internet need to pay. The room corridor is dim and many miscellaneous. I will not recommend this to friends...I think there would be better choice in Florence. ","annotations":[]}
