{"text":"very average We have stayed here one night only because my husband had some business appointments overhere. At first, we booked trough their website and there is comment because some construction is going on. The noise was terrible. It continued till late at night and at 7.15 am it started again! Check in was not really fluently. We brought our 7 weeks old daughter with us and we booked a crib. It was not in the room so I was checking at the front-desk where it was and the girl said that I didn't reserve it. And it was on my confirmation!!! She wanted to start a discussion with me about it but I walked away. After we talked to one of the (friendly) lady's at the executive lounge the crib arrived.We also had asked for a newly renovated room. The rooms on the club-floor were not renovated yet but it didn't matter to me. But the lady at front-desk she said all these renovated rooms where already occupied without even looking in their system!Also the club-lounge was in one of the meeting rooms at the first level. Very crowded with SQ-airline crew who saw the buffet as their dinner....Also the rooms at club-level (not renovated, very old but even full-price!) where in a hallway which was partly smoking and partly non-smoking. SO the smoke of the smoking-rooms penetrated into the non-smoking rooms! All in all not really a good experience. Location is good so maybe we try the hotel again later this year when renovations are finished.Personnel not friendly! Most of them had very much an attitude. Only the lady's at the club-lounge where friendly. ","annotations":[]}
