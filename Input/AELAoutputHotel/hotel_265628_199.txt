{"text":"Not impressed I have travelled the world, been to Egypt and found better. Went to the Sirenis for a wedding, a total of 36 disappointed people. It was a disaster; they wanted to split half the people and send them to another hotel. Hum....it's a wedding!! We're a gang! Just to give you an idea: 4 children and 2 parents...they got a room with 1 king size bed. Getting 2 folding beds for 2 children in each took hours. One couple got their room at 10:30pm, we got there at 4pm I would like to mention. The couple to wed got a horrible room with a broken bathroom, oh, and their nanny was suppose to be the next room over and was placed 10min walk away in another complex on the other side.As for my room, it was ok. Not overly clean, and my back has been out for the entire stay. The cleaning lady decided she liked my new flipflops...kindly placed them under the bed - in the middle of the under-bed, nicely placed. I couldn't find them for 2 days and then I got the brilliant idea to look there- I guess her plan didn't work. Beware - look everywhere before you leave.Overall, it is my first time that I wanted to get home. The buffet was impressing the first night by it's variety...only to be the same buffet every night. I read beforehand that the reservations are a joke, and indeed, we we're only able to eat twice in the restaurants. I suggest you go to the Mexican one, as for the steakhouse, I had a lovely huge white worm in my single piece of broccoli. Needless to say, I lost my appetite for a few days. The bread, you can trust. To be nice, the cook master felt real bad and offered my something else. I drank baileys coffee.Now for those of you not quite getting the picture, it's ok but by far not somehwere you will remember. Luckily, the beach is nice and the sun shinning. Tuns of chairs - no rush until 10am. Staff that are women are nice, unfortunately I was very disappointed in the overall politeness and attendance of the remainder of the staff. Perhaps one needs children with them. As for activities, nothing happening except for aerobics. Night show is good the first night- a few nights were left to be left alone and go to bed.I have much more disappointments to share but I will leave future travellers a bit of hope if it's too late to cancel. As for I, 23 yrs old looking for a nice time, good food and overall relaxed feeling - I didn't find it there and will never go back. Of 36 people, no one was happy. For all that it's worth, I especially suggest you do not go there to be married. French or english my [--], they were wed in spanish and didn't understand a thing. People from the beach had no respect and overwhelmed our privacy.For sure, a 3 star in mexico beats this event.
