{"text":"Good Am a frequent business traveler (4 stars plus hotels) and spent an unexpected long weekend in Miami in August 2006. Have become very selective about rooms, service, etc. so decided to stay at the Mandarin Oriental - have never stayed before. (First - there are no real unobstructed views of the Bay - all rooms have skyline views although some have more Bay views than others.)Problems started upon check-in - I explained that I wanted high floor, quiet and great views of sunrise - as was off-season was offered upgrade to junior suite for slightly higher rate, accepted, went to room and realized it was handicapped accessible and for some reason had a crib in it, and the only views were of the skyline! They found me another room - not a jr suite - but said could see sunrise and had good views. Next morning, I realized the sun was rising on the other side of the hotel! Called manager and left message to complain, said they would switch my room - they did not call until 8 pm that evening. I said really too late and I may be leaving next am. Trip was delayed 2 days so was working at desk next day when noticed stream of ants around the wastebasket! Called manager again, heard voicemail, went downstairs to speak with manager directly - alerted whoever answered phone I was doing so.When got to desk, manager apologized about all issues and said she had upgraded me to best suite in hotel and could stay for my remaining two nights at current rate. The suite was amazing. They did not have to upgrade to this extent - I just wanted a room with no ants. Found out upon leaving that they discovered there was an ant problem along the same vertical of my initial room - and they were able to take care of the issue.GOOD: Rooms - large, renovated, nice amenities. Manager - really trying with service, manager I spoke with seems very competent - hopefully she can get things turned around in service area - she was excellent. Food - good, quality as expected. Beach area - nice, good service, did not notice any bugs. Location.EXCELLENT: Spa - took full advantage, had two of the best massages ever - ask for Beth - pricey but main reason why I would return to this hotel. Also had pedicure - always feel these are overpriced but this was worth it. Staff at spa were wonderful.POOR: Pool area - small and gets noisy. Service - getting through issues.However, am planning on returning - for the spa.
