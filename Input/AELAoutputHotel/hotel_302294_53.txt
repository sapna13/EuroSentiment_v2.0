{"text":"Ok, but I expected more for a five star hotel I've been to Singapore now a couple of times and tried out five different hotels so far, not only for bargain reasons, but also to be able to compare things. Location: The Pan Pacific is perfectly located to go on an extended Shopping trip as SunTech City and Marina Square are both next door. However the MRT station (City Hall) is still a good five minute walk away, if you want to go to other places.Hotel: The hotel is nice, but for a five star hotel I expected more. The friendliness of the staff has been average. I missed an explanation of the basic things, such as breakfast, Internet access, pool and so on - Nothing! Certainly I could have asked, but I guess customers would appreciate it to get a short overview.The room has been nice, but the level of cleanliness should be improved. During my whole stay the mirrors and the shower haven't been 100% clean as you would expect it from a 5 star accomodation. On my date of departure I could see why, because the room maid thought I had already left. She rushed through the room and used my old towels to clean the shower cabin.The hotel pool is quite nice. I didn't use any restaurant, so I can't review these. Checkout was efficient and correct. Returning home, I realized that I forgot two pairs of trousers in a wardrobe in the room. I used the e-mail function of the hotel's website to contact them; after one week I haven't got any response yet.In general, ok for a 3 or maybe a 4 star, but not for a 5 star. There are less expensive hotels in Singapore which provide the same or even a better service.Maybe the hotel shouldn't sell its rooms cheap on the web. A better way would certainly be to improve the quality. I'm sure customers would spread the word-of-mouth then and help the hotel to fill its rooms.
