{"text":"Well situated, quiet, modern, and clean We are a 50-something gay couple (relatively quiet and retiring) that stayed for 6 nights at the Hotel du Cadran in an exterior standard room on the 3rd floor this past September. We initially heard about the hotel from Rick Steves' Paris 2008 guide and, based upon the preponderance of positive reviews from tripadvisor, decided to book our Paris stay here. Our experience matched those described by previous (recent) positive reviewers: the convenient location (close to major monuments, subways, restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores - without being in the middle of the overly crowded touristy areas); the welcoming, efficient, and helpful staff, the clean, modernized, (albeit small), and quiet rooms, with excellent Wifi access; the unusually complete breakfast (with cold-cuts in addition to the usual cheeses, croissants, yogurt, juices, coffee, cereal, etc... - (I believe no eggs, though). One thing that I didn't see previously mentioned is that there is a convenient self-service laundromat located within a block of the hotel that I would recomend to those that need to wash clothes during their trip. AN ASIDE:There is one thing that I'm somewhat hesitant to comment upon, but am doing so in the hope that it may be of benefit to other gay travelers in Paris. We found that almost everywhere we went (especially subways), that we were greeted with unwelcome, sometimes rude, (uneasy?) stares. Sensitivity to such behavior is, of course, individual, but we were a bit surpised that in a cosmopolitan city such as Paris that we (as a gay couple) would appear to be such 'freaks worthy of notice. Despite this annoyance (which, after all, can be experienced in other parts of the world), we fell in love with Paris ... can 30 million annual visitors to Paris - according to wikipedia - all be wrong? However, I thought I'd just mention this so that others in a similar position are forewarned to this possible reception and can be prepared ahead of time. NOTE: this observation does not apply to the staff at the du Cadran who were all very friendly to us.
