{"text":"Fabulous, Romantic Hotel in a great Location Do not, whatever you do, confuse this gem of a hotel - L'H\u2030?√\u2020tel Aviatic (Saint Germain) - with the other Aviatic hotel nearby. Our taxi from the airport tried to drop us off at the other Aviatic and we were horrified (it lacked any appeal and looked very run down). I have since noticed that some of the Aviatic's critiques have been wrongly posted (the descrpitions don't fit!) onto the H\u2030?√\u2020tel Aviatic Saint Germain's profile - the only explanation for some cutting reviews - because this place (and I reiterate - the AVIATIC SAINT-GERMAIN) is a real find. We were welcomed into the tastefully decorated lobby (greys, reds and dark woods, with a spattering of antique furniture) with genuine smiles and invited to come down at 6pm for a complimentary apperitif in the lobby (a delightful gesture). Our room, although not huge, was beautifully dressed up in tuile de jouy fabrics (tr√Å√\u2022¬¥s romatic!), and had more than enough space for luggage. The bathroom was impeccable - not one speck of dust! It felt more like we were staying in someone's home than a hotel.That evening, after our FREE aperitif, we asked Reception whether they could recommend a restaurant. The knowledgable chap knew the area like the back of his hand and we were surprised to see how very close we were to St-Germain and the River. In under ten minutes we were seated in lovely restaurant (the concierge booked us a table). Overall we were utterly enchanted with the hotel, its d√ã√\u2022√ñcor and its staff. We'll defintely be coming back. The price for the quality is excellent. HIGHLY RECOMMENED by two Brits who are usually difficult to please!
