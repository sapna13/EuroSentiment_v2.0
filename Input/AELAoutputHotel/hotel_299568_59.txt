{"text":"Best in Bali!!! One of the best in Asia A Fantastic HOTEL!!! I am a regular traveller all over asia and although not the most luxurious hotel I have stayed in it is certainly one of the most laid back and picturesque. The staff are friendly and accommodating nothing is a problem for them. This hotel is perfect for a romantic getaway or a family holiday. Unlike other hotels in the area there are no lifts in the hotel and at about 190 rooms the hotel is not crowded like the 300+ room hotels I have stayed in. It is TRADITIONAL balinese style. The online rates they offer are great and the breakfast is great. You can give the night buffets a miss they are a bit over priced and there is plenty of restaurants within walking distance that are far more affordable.However the casual dining at the beach is great and the pizzas and french style deserts are wonderful as is the room service. I have not had a bad meal at any restaurant within the vicinity of the hotel yet!!! I have stayed more than 100 nights at this hotel in the last 10 years on business and for family holidays. I am staying again in March for 15 days with extended family and friends. We have booked a newly renovated Tropical Terrace at this stage these rooms can only be booked through the novotel website. If you are planning a trip to bali stay here. I would not stay anywhere else. I have reccommended this hotel to many friends and business associates and all are now regular visitors. If booking a superior room ask for a ground floor room with a pool view. They are quiet the only downside is you have to cross the road to get to reception and the breakfeast buffet but honestly you get the feeling that you are on your own in the hotel. Happy hour is 5 to 7pm so if you are up for a drink go to the swim up pool bar and order a pina colada (2 for the price of 1). The drink comes in a freshly cut coconut and its the best cocktail I have ever had. Dont have to many you wont make it out for dinner!!! Enough said book the novotel benoa and enjoy. If you book and have a problem look shaun up at the hotel!!! ill be there from the 27th march 2007 for 15 days in a tropical terrace!!!!
