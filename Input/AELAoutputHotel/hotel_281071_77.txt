{"text":"Extrarodinary Hotel Having read several rather negative reviews on TA, I was wondering what to expect for my $1,000 a night Park View Grand de Luxe Room. I have been here for 7 nights with another 5 or so to go, so have had plenty of opportunity to work out the pros and cons.I write this as a regular guest at 4 Seasons, Ritz Carlton and the like and a frequent visitor to Hong Kong which has some of the best hotels in the world.I am lost for words at the excellence of this hotel which surpasses not only my expectations, but pretty much all my previous hotel stay expreiences. This is a truly superb hotel. It is is beautifully fitted out, the service is excellent (possibly only 9 out of 10 owing to some glitches in the public lobby lounge which is not as well staffed as the guest areas) and the overall experience is one of pampered luxury. Contrary to the experiences described in other reviews, the staff have been excpetionally friendly (the maitre'd knew at Asiate knew my name after one visit and made a point of greeting me by name thereafter).There is a wonderful pool. small but uncrowded and wonderful for laps or just wallowing.The views of Central Park (I am on the 52nd floor) are superb, even allowing for the fact that the Trump Hotel blocks part of the view.The hotel exudes an air of oppulent luxury and well-being.There is only one issue, which is the price. Everything is phenomenally expensive (continental breakfast in the room at around $45) and laundry that costs more than it would to replace the items that have been laundered.On this occasion I am not picking up the tab and the prices do not, therefore, disturb me. I think it is the price that probably accounts for a great deal of the dissatisfaciton expresssed in other reviews, as it is hard to imagine how this hotel could ever really deliver what most people would expect for rooms costing upwards of $1,000 per night, when the price is coming out of their own pockets.In summary this is a wonderful hotel, but I would advise against staying here if you are paying for it yourself and will be making a very detailed cost benefit analysis. This is a place for those on expenses, for celebs, for those who are truly hardened to paying for hotels of this class and for those who recognise that they are splashing out a very large amount of money for an unusually opulent treat.
