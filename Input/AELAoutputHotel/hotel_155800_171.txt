{"text":"Once a jewel and now this hotel needs major buffing. Please be advised that this hotel is under construction until April 2007. The rooms overlooking the pools and cabana areas are being guttered for an overall face lift. The front pool area overlooking the ocean is also getting major repairs. This construction project affected our stay due to the early morning drilling and the visual areas that were out of service such as the massage section near the pool. If you're looking for a quiet experiance in the breakfast area, good luck. The noice level and construction crew are working full steam and it's loud and distracting. Overall, the inside lobby, bars, entertainment and restaurants are still beautiful and are not being affected.The room that we stayed in was a cabana w\/king, sofa sitting area. Large, comfortable but the room also needs a face lift.The furniture is worn and tarnished, needs a paint job. The bathroom is a joke, the housekeeping department does a terrible job @ cleaning the rooms. We arrived @ 2pm and checked in to find reminance of hair strands from a previous occupant. The towels are shabby and the tables were dirty. We could not change our room due to a busy Thanksgiving weekend. Housekeeping arrived later on to clean the room which was an average once over. Our luggage arrived 5 hours later. The excuse was, the bell captain would not enter the room if we weren't present. I never heard of such a thing. This hotel is way overpriced and will get much more expensive after the renovations are completed. I have stayed in this property twice a yr for 15 years. I have seen the wear and tear of this once superb hotel. My long lived experiance has come to an end. I will no longer be spending my money @ the El San Juan Hotel  Casino in Isla Verde.My next trip to Puerto Rico, I will be staying @ the Ritz Carlton. ","annotations":[]}
