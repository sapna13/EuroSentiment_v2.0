{"text":"Amazing Hotel Myself and 3 friends (23-32 yrs of age) stayed at this resort from Oct. 8-15. We booked last minute and got an amazing deal. Because of the price we paid we weren't expecting to stay in the lap of luxery. Well let me tell you when we got there we were thrown for a loop. Check In was fast and simple. Luggage was brought to our rooms quickly. No waiting around for a room to become available even though the hotel was fully booked. The grounds were beautiful, nicely manicured. The pools were big and clean. A separate pool for kids and adults. A great activities team that constantly had something for guests to do. (Although not everyone participated). Now the food. Oh my. I travel quite often and can honestly say that the food at this resort is the best I've had. I gained 5 pounds by the end of my trip. There are 3 a la carte restaurants to chose from. Plus the buffet has a great selection and they are constantly bringing out fresh hot food. The rooms in the hotel were big and clean and not once did I even see a bug.After reading previous reviews of people that went at the same time as me I must agree yes there were a lot of people from Spain that spoke Spanish. This time of year is when they take their holidays. Hence the vast majority of people in the resorts being Spanish. There was a bit of a language barrier but if you're patient you'll find that you can communicate with the little Spanish you know and the little English they know. I found then to be quite fun people. I will definatly go back :) ","annotations":[]}
