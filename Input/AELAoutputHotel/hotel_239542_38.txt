{"text":"nicely designed hotel This hotel seems to be getting some mixed reviews, but my overall impression was very positive.This is a trendy, boutique hotel. While the rooms were small, they are well designed and very comfortable. The solid, heavy windows blocked out any traffic noise from outside, and I didn't hear any noise from other rooms or the hall, but I also didn't see many other guests.The large, wall mounted LCD screen provides internet, on demand movies (including adult), and regular TV all included in the room rate. Some of the technology is a little on the new and untested side, however, and my TV turned itself on at 3:20am. Then the flashing blue light on the mini-pc behind the monitor, but reflected in the mirror was driving me crazy and I had to figure out how to power off the PC. There were also problems with picture freezing when changing TV channels that required a reboot.Bathroom was very modern. Excellent water pressure from both a ceiling mounted showerhead and handheld one. Bathroom door is only frosted glass with an unfrosted strip, so anyone that needs to feel privacy from their roommate may not like this. They provide some nice extras like mini toothbrushes and paste, strawberry glycerin soap (I wasn't crazy about it) and lotion.The lounge area looked cozy and inviting, the music was good but there was no one there everytime I passed. It was mid-December, perhaps a very slow time.I didn't need to interact too much with the front desk, but they were very nice on check-in and checkout and always said hello when I came or left.I got a good rate (√à√\u2020√ü?10), and think it was well worth the price.
