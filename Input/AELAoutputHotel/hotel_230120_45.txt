{"text":"Great Location... Wonderful Staff We have recently stayed at Sofitels in Asia and N. America so I'm confident with this chain. They do have the most comfy hotel beds, after its convenient location, that was my #2 factor for choosing this hotel. We traveled by train from AMS airport and we departed also via the train station to Belgium. This hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the train station; less without the luggage! It's in a safe\/clean neighborhood, tram line is right in front of the hotel, and less than 5 mins walk to the DAM. There is a large supermarket in close proximity also. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, 22 euros per person sounds like a lot for breakfast food. Hotels has a basket of apples, tangerines at the counter which is a nice little treat on your way in\/out of the hotel. If you don't have your lab top, you can get an internet card and use their business center. 10 euros for 45 mins and about 13 euros for 90 mins; we got the 90 mins and we were able to use this same internet access card at the Marriott in Brussels (i-Bahn). We got our rooms on the 1st floor adjacent to an alley; you can hear people talk when they walk by! I suggest asking for a room on a higher floor. Rooms are much smaller than expected but maybe considered large Amsterdam stardard. Extra information\/tips not directly relevant to the hotel.....We were there during Dec. 25-28 (all the small businesses were closed).... didn't noticed until the very last day that there is an internet place a few doors over (north of the hotel, same side). We had a dinner meal at this Holland restaurant just a few doors south of the hotel, same side.... we didn't like it. Service was good but I suggest look elsewhere for food near the hotel. We had dinner at this seafood restaurant called Lucius (about 15 mins walk)... it was superb (if you like seafood)! You can easily find info on this restaurant online.
