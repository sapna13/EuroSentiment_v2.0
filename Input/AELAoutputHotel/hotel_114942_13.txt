{"text":"Another hotel that just gets it I booked a basic room at the Adolphus for a weekend based on TripAdvisor reviews and was highly pleased. This is another example of an older property that functions well and is not part of a large chain.The room itself was extra-spacious and everything was in working order. The bed was comfortable. The shower was hot with good pressure. I especially took note of how quiet the room was. I don't know if there just happened to be no occupied neighboring rooms but once I was in my room I felt like I was in a vault. The windows faced an interior court: no view, but for me much preferable to street noise.I had breakfast twice in their cafe and enjoyed it very much. The service was friendly yet perfectly efficient. I commend them for not jumping on the wasteful, poor-quality breakfast buffet bandwagon. I would much rather sit and order something than graze. I didn't eat in their fine dining room but from looking at the menu, peeking in the room and reading reviews it looks like it actually may be a place worth having a $100 meal.Other notables were swift elevators, a computer available for guests to check out online information or print out maps (although this was not working when I tried it), super-efficient check-out and free wifi (did not try to use). I don't usually use concierge services but the doorman helped me find a last-minute concert ticket and followed through as he said he would.All in all the Adoplhus provided a great stay and would definitely stay there again if I were in the area.
