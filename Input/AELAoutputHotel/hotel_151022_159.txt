{"text":"Lush grounds at Natura Park....but.... After reading many negative reviews about this resort, I thought some people do exaggerate√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√∂?RONG..WRONG..WRONG√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√∂?he negative reviews were well founded. My boyfriend and I stayed at Natura on Feb. 20-27. Here is my take on the resort.GROUNDS √à√\u2020\u2022?Absolutely beautiful. Well maintained, lush, greenery, fish in the lagoons, ducks, swans and flamingos..very, very pretty.CHECK IN- Very fast, very pleasant√à√\u2020\u2022?and then..we were greeted by long staircase going down to the bar\/dining room area which is the walkway leading to the rooms. Try carrying heavy suit cases down the stairs√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√Æot pleasant! Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother waiting for the elevators, they never worked when we were there. ROOMS √à√\u2020\u2022?After changing rooms 3x (do not get ground rooms because if it rains (and it will √à√\u2020\u2022?torrential down pours), most of those ground rooms get water-we had 2√à√\u2020\u2022?of water in our bathroom) so we got a room on 2nd floor, spacious king bed, very nice in building XII. We had a balcony overlooking the lagoon, very pretty. But it was a little inconvenient to go to the pool or beach as it was not close. Try buildings X or IX, then you are near the pool..but then you are far away from lobby\/bar\/main dining area. The resort is not too big but it is spaced too far apart (i.e. pool\/beach vs. lobby\/lobby bar\/shows\/main dining area)..POOL √à√\u2020\u2022?Not very clean, small but ok. You have to get up by 7am to get a decent chair by the pool. If you are later than that, good luck getting a chair√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√¥ame goes for the beach.BEACH √à√\u2020\u2022?A lot of seaweed, the grounds people did their best but it was a lot to keep up with. I think it there was a lot of seaweed because it was raining at night so in the morning it had washed up shore.VENDORS √à√\u2020\u2022?If you walk down the beach (where the Allegro Hotel is located) you will find vendors that you can bargain with. Typical souvenir stuff√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√\u2020ut price is ok. There are vendors that come to the hotel 2x a week but they are too pricey. I think it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ just the same guys that are on the beach and the jack up the price just because they come to the hotel. They never tell you what their price is..they just ask you how much you want to pay. I HATE THAT!FOOD in main dining buffet √à√\u2020\u2022?Horrible. I got sick the 4th day I was there and was scared to eat or drink anything for the rest of my vacation. I basically just ate bread with butter. Everything tasted the same√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√∂¬\u2022O TASTE. The breakfasts weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ any better. BEACH BUFFET √à√\u2020\u2022?A lot of people got sick from the food near the beach\/pool area and I can see why. Everything was out in the hot weather. I did not eat anything there except from the soft icecream machine (when it was working that is).A-LA-CARTE RESTAURANTS √à√\u2020\u2022?(Seafood\/Steak\/Italian) √à√\u2020\u2022?Need reservations. Very good. Why can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ they have that type of food in the buffet??ENTERTAINMENT √à√\u2020\u2022?They had a live band that played Dominican music all the time. VERY LOUD, you could not carry on a conversation as the music was very loud. Entertainment was a 4 women, 2 men just dancing to that same music every night. After the 3rd night of drowning out our ear drums, we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even bother going to see the shows. ANIMACION TEAM √à√\u2020\u2022?Not much of a team. I only saw 2 guys there trying to do all the work and not too many people participated in the activities.WOULD I RETURN AGAIN??? √à√\u2020\u2022?No. I would not even return to Punta Cana. I was not impressed at all.
