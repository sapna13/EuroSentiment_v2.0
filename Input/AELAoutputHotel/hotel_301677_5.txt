{"text":"We enjoyed our stop-over here We stayed for 4 days here. Travelled with 2 teenage daughters. We arrived at 7.30am and were in our rooms by 8.00am. We were given connecting rooms (we had not been guaranteed this by the travel agents), so that was also a bonus.We were located in the Plymouth wing, which we found very satisfactory and had a balcony with a pleasant enough outlook. The rooms were very spacious, and very clean. The beds were very comfortable with nice bedlinen. Ok, so the bathroom was looking as though it could do with a bit of redecorating, but it was all clean, and all worked perfectly, so no complaints at all, and the decor of the bedrooms was good.Our kids loved the swimming pool, and it was good to have a small laundry that I was able to use. We didn't use the restaurant, so can't comment, although we did have room service (pizza - ok), and breakfast which was good. It's location is too far from Orchard Road to walk, but there is a shuttle bus service (we didn't use it), and the taxi's are cheap enough. You just have to organise yourself to get snacks when you are out and about in the day to take back to the hotel room, as there are no places to get these within walking distance, and also we ate our main meals when out and about, as the hotel food was a bit pricey for us. Although if you have a chocolate craving, there is a small shop in the hotel!The staff are also very friendly and very helpful.We have stayed in a hotel just off Orchard Rd before with a higher rating, but didn't enjoy that anywhere near as much as we enjoyed the Copthorne Orchid, so despite the fact that it is a bit out of the way, we would definitely stay here again, it's not as if Orchard Road is the only place you will visit anyway!
