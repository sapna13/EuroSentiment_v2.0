{"text":"A hidden gem! My partner and I stayed at this hotel for three nights just after Valentines day. It was absolutely 100% better than I ever expected given the fact it is reasonably priced (for a central city hotel) and some of the, frankly baffling, reviews I'd seen on here. Basically if you want to experience Barcelona like a real European, stay at this hotel. When we arrived we were placed in a twin room with the beds pushed together (meaning one massive bed!), and not one but two quant shuttered balconette windows looking out onto the side street the entrance of the hotel was off of. The bathroom was big enough and there was an English speaking (albeit American) news channel on television (what else do you really need?). The room was spotless, and remained so for the stay as the cleaners did an excellent job. The breakfast was authentic European, with croissants, pastries, toast, fruit, cereal, juice, tea and coffee with some scrambled eggs and sausages if you wished to have them.We mainly just pigged out on everything in readiment for a long day pounding the pavements! There is a bakery directly opposite the hotel entrance that serves excellent baguette sandwiches for you to pack for lunch on the run, and then of course you only need to walk to the end of the road in one direction and you are on Las Ramblas (the main shopping and cafe street) or the other direction and you are in the heart of the Gothic quater with its tiny shutter lined streets, cool clothes shops and restaurants. There is a metro station about a five minute walk away at the top of Las Ramblas that takes you to all the major sights, so of course the location of the hotel is second to none,The best thing about this hotel is the fact that a) it looks so cool and gothic all throughout from the lobby, to the creaky old lift, to the reception and b) the service we recieved from all the staff was friendly and courteous (which I hate to admit you don't expect in busy European city hotels). I probably wouldnt recommend this hotel in the height of summer simply for the fact the rooms don't have minibars for water bottles, and personally if I want a summer holiday I like staying at beach resorts with a swimming pool but for sheer romance this hotel cannot be beaten if you want a culture packed, relaxing city-break.
