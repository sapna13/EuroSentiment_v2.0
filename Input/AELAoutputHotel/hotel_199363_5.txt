{"text":"Very acceptable - ticked all the boxes for the price charged I have just returned from a 3 night stay in the Art Hotel on kudamm, Berlin. I found the hotel to be very acceptable with helpful staff, comfortable \/ well fitted \/ clean rooms, attractive bar area and an unsupassed location for shops (KaDeWe - 5 mins walk \/ Kurfurstendamm - 30 second walk) Transport links (the Zoo' S bhan  bus terminal - 5 mins walk \/ U-Bhan -30 second walk \/ Tigel Aiport - √à√\u2020√ü?520 taxi \/ schonefeld - √à√\u2020√ü?0  35).This hotel provided me with eveything i needed for my stay as when i travel to locations around the world i do so to enjoy the destination, not the hotel (which so many people who have written reviews on this hotel seem to have done). my advice to these people is find a good hotel in their home town and go there - its cheaper and easier. This hotel IS NOT a 7* palace and it does not advertise itself as such. like wise (to the people who question the quality of the breakfast) it is not a michlin starred restaurant. With this in mind, if you want a quality breakfast (whilst not compromising on convenience too much) try the wintergarten (two streets away off the Kdam) - it is a specialist in providing breakfast (rather than hotel rooms) and does so at a similar price to the art hotel. The only justified problem that has been brought up in other reviews is the noise levels in the rooms to the front of the hotel. The walls do not seem to offer sufficient insulation to keep out tire noise which some (shallow sleeping) guests might find annoying. however, there are plenty of rooms which do not face the road and therefore do not suffer this problem. All in all. if you are looking for a reasonably priced, comfortable, clean hotel situated in a very good location; this is the one for you. However, if you want 7* luxury - the Berlin Ritz is also a very nice hotel.
