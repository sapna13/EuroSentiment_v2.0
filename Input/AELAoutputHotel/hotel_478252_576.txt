{"text":"a BIG dissapointment!! I have stayed at other resorts in Punta Cana and ALWAYS had a terrific time; great food, great service, spectacular rooms, beautiful scenery, you name it. But not this time!I had to go on business to Sto. Dom. and decided to bring my son and his friend and add a trip to Punta Cana as a HS graduation celebration for them. Someone tole me about Bahia Principe. I booked three nights and paid extra for the Golden Circle treatment! What a mistake! The staff was rude, which was a great surprise because the Dominican people are VERY friendly and go out of their way to accommodate you. But the staff in this hotel seem grumpy all the time. The food was horrible. They advertise that you can eat at any of their 5 restaurants, what they don't tell you is that you have to make reservations when you get there and by then all time slots are taken. We ended up eating in the main buffet place and the food was canned and ill prepared. We finally got reservations at the MX place and it was mediocre at best. One thing that was awesome was the tours we took. We had SO much fun. The first day we took a speed boat, that you actually drive yourself (for about 45 mins) to get to the a snorkeling area which was absolutely beautiful. Huge colorful fishes that come right up to you. The next day we went horseback riding to a cave that has water whole we could swim in, then we switched out of the horses and into a dune buggy to go to a postcard beautiful pristine beach. We had the most fun ever on the tours! But it had nothing to do with the hotel, you could take these tours at other hotels. I certainly recommend staying anywhere but at the Bahia Principe. We area already planning our trip to Punta Cana for next year, but not here! ","annotations":[]}
