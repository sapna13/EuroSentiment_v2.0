{"text":"A Wonderful Resort My wife an I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Melia Caribe Tropical. What a wonderful resort. From the moment we arrived I was impressed with the facility. I don't think I have ever stayed at a cleaner place than the Melia Caribe Tropical. From the grounds to all the facilities including the rooms the place was spotless. The staff and service was top notch. Everyone who worked at the resort that I encountered was very friendly and always willing to help. The food was well above average in my opinion and there were plenty of choices that it would be quite difficult to not be able to find something you liked. Personally, I preferred the buffets over the restaurants due to the fact that I enjoy having so many choices. Regardless of whether you went to a restauranrt or a buffet the food was not disappointing. If you're someone who enjoys cocktails there were ample bars located throughout the resort including at the pools and near the beach. The beach was gorgeous and so were either of the two main pools. Our room was spacious and very clean. The king sized bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked quite well as did the ceiling fan. No complaints here. What really set the resort apart in my opinion was the way it looked at night. The landscape lighting and the main buildings by the two lobby's were amazing at night. Everthing is open air with beautiful lighting throughout. Simply gorgeous. Needless to say, I would go back again without hesitation and highly recommend the Melia Caribe Tropical to anyone.
