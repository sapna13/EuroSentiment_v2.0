{"text":"Fantastic place We just returned from our NYC trip and stayed at the Affinia. After having stayed at many New York hotels over the years I have to say that the Affinia is one of the best overall values that I've expereinced. We had a full suite - more like an apartment - not one of those tiny so-called suites you find in some hotels, and it was very quiet given it was away from the street. The staff are all a friendly bunch, all helpful, especially Rome at the front door. Ask him if he's from Rome and you'll get a very funny answer. The overall service is a cut above other hotels (and many that cost a lot more money). We asked for two small repairs and they were done within minutes. We asked for a few supplies and they brought them (and more) right away. Every restaraunt choice they suggested was better than average. On top of the large accomodations, nice furnishings and quiet room, the suite's price was equivalent to a room in many less-stellar hotels around town. I rarely leave Manhattan saying I loved that hotel and will stay there again. Well, on my next trip to the Big Apple I know where I'm staying - the Affinia. There's only one small neagative I saw the whole week at this place. The room service isn't in house, but comes from a restaraunt across the steet. It's an Indian place called The Mint. The food we ordered came fast but it was on the equivalent of a bad diner - and a bad diner with very high prices. We didn't order Indian food (maybe that would have been better) but they had a selection of Continental dishes. Speaking of diners, there's a great one (can't rember the name) about a hundred-yards east of the hotel on the same side of the street. Bottom Line: great location (next to several hotels, and conveineinet to Second Ave with more eateries than you could ever make it to), great, spacious accomodations at good prices and nice people working there. That's all refreshing in a city where getting even one of those things is usually considered lucky.... unless you're willing to pay $1,000 a night.
