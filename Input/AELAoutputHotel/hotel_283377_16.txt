{"text":"Hotel Benivieni is va bene! Hotel Benivieni is a wonderful accomodation in Florence, close to the duomo, and to a lively main piazza (but not too close), plus within easy walking distance of the Ufizzi, the Arno bridge, the walkway to the copy of David located on a rise which overlooks the town of Florence and provides an excellent view, plus within walking distance to the Academy which houses the original David. I had actually already booked another accomodation in Florence through a travel agent and had paid in full, but heard that particular pension did not suit a traveler friend of mine's needs. Based on their personal review, I cancelled my reservation (at a financial cost) and booked instead at Hotel Benivieni, which was recommended to me by a friend at work who had stayed there in the summer of 06 with her daughter.I stayed at Hotel Benivieni with my college daughter for three nights just recently and we both loved our entire experience. The interior is very elegant in a simple and lovely style. Also, the breakfast was an anomoly in Italy, and a great satisfaction to us as Americans. Normally, Italian breakfasts seem to consist of coffee and pastry. Not at Hotel Benivieni. I am a small person and don't require much in the way of calories, however, at Hotel Benivieni, I helped myself to a bowl of rice crispies, a yogurt, a small chocolate croissant, two diminutive sandwiches of an egg salad type with tomatoe and lettuce that were so very delicious, plus tea and oranje juice and a piece of fruit each morning. All this was available from 7 am until 10 am and it suited my schedule very well. Also, it proved very wise to have a nice breakfast due to all the walking my daughter and I chose to do in order to explore Florence. The other very welcome trait about Hotel Benivieni was the staff. They were extremely helpful and more than happy to speak English, a big change from some of the other hotel experiences I had while traveling through various areas of Italy.This hotel is extremely modern but with an old world style and very aesthetically pleasing. Nice wood floors, pretty decor, wonderful bath with excellent plumbing, TV in room, plus a menu available 24 hours, and the most delightful staff who were always available to help with directions or suggestions and an excellent little restaurant immediately next door. Additionally, there is a nice loaner library in the reception area with guidebooks for Florence and surrounding areas as well as novels to read (in English). I noticed the internet was available at a small station off the lobby if you needed to access it within the hotel. I am not sure if they have wireless service as I didn't have a laptop or need of wireless. Check with the hotel if you need that type of service. I would stay at Hotel Benivieni again if I ever have the chance to return to Florence. It was the best accomodation I had while in Italy for a two week visit. The price was very reasonable at 180 euros per night for two people and full breakfast included.Just for reference, I went to look at the other accomodation I had originally booked to compare and there was no comparison. I was so grateful I had booked with Hotel Benivieni and not the other place! You will be very satisfied too, I am sure. Enjoy your stay!
