{"text":"Good Weekend Getaway My wife and I travel to the Caribbean 2-3 times per year and we enjoyed our first stay at the Intercontinental San Juan.We thought the ease of flying domestic with self service check in was a large benefit and the hotel is only 5 minutes from the airport. You can definately hear the planes but they do bother you when you are pool or beach side.We had a club level room which we liked as you have your own personal deck and chairs poolside and the club level provides breakfast and a cocktail time everynight.Everyone was very nice and service was great. We spent most of our time at the beach which was never over crowded and you never had to fight for chairs at the pool.The pool bar was very nice with very good food. Food prices are high compared to most other resorts.We ate at Ruth Chris Steakhouse and Alfredo's at the hotel which were good. We went off-site to Marmalade's which was overpriced, slow service, and small portions. We had a good meal at Pamela's which was oceanside.We would recommend this hotel for couples looking to get some beach and pool time. Kids would like the beach and pool but there are no other kids activities on site.Casino was smaller than average but had everything needed to have some low key gambling fun.Overall we would recommend this resort if you are looking for some quality beach and pool time and really do not want to go far from the resort.
