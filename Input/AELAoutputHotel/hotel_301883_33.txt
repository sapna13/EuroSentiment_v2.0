{"text":"Good but not Great Experience My husband and I have stayed in various resorts in Bali. When we came to FS Sayan, we found the location and the architecture very impressive. But, our villa looked tired inside. And, there were spider webs hanging down from the ceiling in our bathroom and sitting area. Our outdoor lounge chairs were so dirty that we did not want to use them. The in-room internet service did not work. We asked for assistance but still could not fix it.As for food, the resort had a big Asian selection while the Western choices were fairly limited and eclectic. But, burgers, sandwiches and pizzas were available. In terms of taste, I preferred their Asian to Western food, but nothing really fine dining experience.Service-wise, it was at times a bit pretensious, but generally as good as other 5-star resorts in Bali though not really exceptional as raved by some of the reviewers. One thing I found it a bit strange was that when we were at the resort, both male and female staff very often greeted my husband by name in the most friendly way but ignored me being standing next to him! This sort of basic manner needs to be improved. A simple greeting Madam (even not certain the guest is a spouse or just a friend) will definitely make a difference.All in all, I would consider FS Sayan one of the nice luxurious resorts in Bali, but do not justify to be rated as the best in Bali by some travel magazines. I personally think Amankila is even better.
