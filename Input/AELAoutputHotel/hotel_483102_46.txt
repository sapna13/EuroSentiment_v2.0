{"text":"Perfect Location We flew into Girona on Ryanair and got a bus into Barcelona which cost about 20 Euro return and the journey lasted an hour. We then took a cab from the central bus station to the hotel which cost about 12 euro.The H10 Universitat is a nice hotel and when we booked it was considerably cheaper than the H10 Catalunya which can charge more because it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ in Catalunya Plaza but if the truth be known they are about a minutes walk apart.From the front door of the H10 Universitat to the top of La Rambla is no more than a five minute walk and so the location is excellent. The staff are friendly and we requested a quiet room and got one around the back and so we had no real view but we could not hear any noise at all from the busy street at the front.The rooms are small for a 4 star but they are well equipped but not too well sound proofed as we found on our third night when a German couple had a drunken domestic at 4 in the morning (sounded like she was right!!!) and we could not tell if the racket was coming from next door, above us or below us. But other than that 10 minute interlude we heard nothing from our neighbours. Breakfast was good and we never had to queue. Barcelona is a great city but be prepared to do everything about two hours later than you normally would at home. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a bit pricey for pavement caf√ã√\u2022√ñ eating and drinking (which Euro city isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ??) but the best paella and sangria deals etc can be found at lunchtime rather than in the evening when popular places can become very busy. The Nou Camp is a must as is the Sagrada Familia. The panoramic city views from either the Castle at Montjuic or The Church at Tibidabo are also well worthwhile. Art lovers might venture to the over rated Picasso Museum.
