{"text":"Gran Bahia is certainly GRAND!! First of all, I must say that I wasn't even supposed to stay at this hotel. I was supposed to stay, along with the other 5 ppl in my group, at the Ocean Blue Hotel, yet they over-booked and bumped us here. Boy, am I ever glad that happened! This hotel was absolutely top-notch in every way! My group was here from 7\/26-7\/31 for a five night stay in the D.R. and found out very quickly that we lucked out at the Gran Bahia. This hotel is utterly georgous in every way, but very large. You have to ride trolleys to get from one end to the other, but if you can afford it, I would recommend going GOLD and staying in the villas closest to the beach. This way you have a pool and the beach right in close proximity, so you have the best of both worlds. The rooms were phenomenal (although did allow smoking...) and spacious, and the hotel staff was wonderful. The front desk personnel were on a first-name basis with us, and when one of the girls in our party was injured the night manager even drove us in his own car to the doctor's office when in need! That's dedication! If you don't know any Spanish it's a bit difficult to communicate with the maids\/bellhops, but the people in all the strategic locations speak English and other languages extremely well. Honestly, there was only one employee that was anything less than spectacular while there, and she worked in Guest Services, so if you must contact them, talk to Edward: he is fabulous! Otherwise, I would recommend this hotel highly; clean rooms, great service, and excellent restaurants! This is the ONLY choice in Punta Cana and I will undoubtedly return! A big thanks to the staff at the Gran Bahia! Muchas Gracias! ","annotations":[]}
