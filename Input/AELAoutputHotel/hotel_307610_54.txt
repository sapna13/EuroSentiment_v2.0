{"text":"Padma Paradise This hotel is located in Legian in a really great spot. Right near the beach, however I personally would choose to swim in the massive hotel pool over the beach there any day! The pool is HUGE, one of the biggest pools I've ever swam in. It also had a great pool bar where you can sit in the pool and drink beers and cocktails for a really good price! Buffet breakfast is fabulous, huge huge range of everything and highly recommend including that as it's the best start to your stay. The rooms are cute, really modern, the bathroom's are nice, the shower was huge, no bath. The airconditioner works fabulously and you basically need it on 24 hours a day. We were located on the ground floor and had a little private sitting area rather than a balcony which was nice. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful, everyone smiles and says hello when they walk past you. Room service menu is GREAT, highly recommend it. We got a bit of a surprise mid stay when we came into our rooms and there were some gourmet chocolates left for us! A nice touch. Airport transfers were complimentary with our stay too. It's one of the more expensive properties in Bali but with the exchange rate it's hardly expensive for the AUD, and well worth it, especially for longer stays. After a hard day shopping in the heat, with the obvious poverty, smells, and dirtiness you may experience in the streets, it's so refreshing to come back to a hotel like this. I would definately stay here again and highly recommend it to everyone.
