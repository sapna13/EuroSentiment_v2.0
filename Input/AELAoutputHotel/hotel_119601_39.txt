{"text":"Excellent choice for a stay in SF My wife and I stayed at the Coventry while visiting SF on our honeymoon. We picked it based on TripAdvisor.com reviews and we were not disappointed. The rates are excellent (we paid $96 a night) and the free parking is truly a great value. You can spend twice as much for a chain hotel, and still pay $50+ a night in parking fees!The location is great; At 11 p.m. the night before our city-wide tour, I needed to buy some batteries for my camera. No problem! There is a 24 hour WalGreens located just 6 blocks west on Lombard and Divisadero. This was a great spot to pick up some snacks, bagels, juice, etc. for the morning (the Coventry doesn't have a continental breakfast). There are a ton of great restaurants located within blocks from the inn, including a Taco Bell less than 2 blocks away, several diners and ethnic restaurants and more.We had to go to the Ferry Building on the east side of town in the morning, and we walked just 3 blocks south to a nearby Muni bus stop ($1.50 fare each and a 20 min ride took us to Market St., just in front of the Ferry Building).That evening, after taking an Alcatraz tour, we walked to In 'n Out Burger on the Wharf for some grub, and then walked to Ghirardelli Square for some ice cream. The Coventry was just a 10 minute walk from there and a great way to spend an evening stroll hand-in-hand. With a friendly staff, free wi-fi, free parking and a great location, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in San Francisco!
