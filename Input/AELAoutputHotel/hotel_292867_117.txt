{"text":"best value for the $$ We just finished staying at the Caribe, from Aug. 27th to Sept. 3rd.What a buy for the $$. We certainly got our money's worth.We booked thru apple vacations and my local travel agent.We flew usa 3000, both flights were great, ontime, transfers were good, hotel check in, we arrived early about 11:20 and our room was ready, easiest check in we have had.I don't know were the other reviews come from on things like towels, beach chairs and huts, we had not problems . Fresh towels every day, although the washclothes were scarce, we did not have to get up at the crack of dawn to reserve beach or pool chairs, each day after breakfast, around 9 or so there were plenty, even mid day..there was not shortage to be found. We did find the lunch buffetts to be a bit boring..but there was plenty of food and choices, just not to our liking, but we didn't go hungry at all. The best place for lunch, The Crepeorie.The service was very good. we didn't have any trouble getting reservations for dinner, itilian was our favorite. The people were very courteous and helpful, they don't speak much english, but they will try every attempt to figure out what you need. check out was a breeze too. Our 2 kids had a great time too..plenty to keep them busy, from boogie boarding to mini golf to football on the beach...all in all a very good trip. oh i forgot, the beach, absolutly wonderful!, pure white sand...great water....
