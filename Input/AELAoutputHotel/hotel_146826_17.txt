{"text":"What's that smell? The first thing I noticed upon walking into the hotel room was the smell of mildew. It was so overwhelming that I immediately called the front desk. The solution? Sending up a maintenance man with a can of air freshener... After a long flight on the plane, we wanted to take a shower- too bad this was out of the question since the water in the tub wouldn't drain. Also, the bathroom smelled as if it needed to be hosed down with bleach. And the room was dirty. This was all within 30 minutes of walking into the room. I complained to the front desk and the manager upgraded us to a premium room (free). Although the view was better and there was a microwave- this room wasn't any better than the last. Still dirty, dank, mildewy- gross.  I will say, however, that the bell\/front desk guys were very courteous and helpful. They gave great,prompt service (answered questions regarding transportation and sights). The bar never opened and (judging from the poor conditions of the rooms) I wouldn't dare eat in the restaraunt. The parking was $18 a day but if youre lucky, Ala Wai is 2 seconds away and parking is free. The positive reviews for the hotel seem to be for the upper floors only, I stayed on the 15th floor. Perhaps the renovations are starting from the top down? I'm not sure ,but what I do know is that I won't be staying there again.
