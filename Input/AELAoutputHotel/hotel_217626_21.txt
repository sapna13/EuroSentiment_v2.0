{"text":"Bad experience Date: Sept 1, 2008, San Diego We have been staying at The Benjamin for the last 6 yrs, twice a yr, once over Labor day, and again over Thanksgiving or Christmas. We have raved about The Benjamin to everyone, and if asked where to stay when visiting NYC, we always suggested The Benjamin. We love the ambiance, the service, the little touches like milk and cookies in the 'frig on our arrival, and of course the pillow menu!.We always requested (and got) the same room. It was the studio, even though small, for the two of us it was fine, and we had a lovely view, we could see the Waldorf from our windows. The staff was always friendly and courteous.This trip, however, was very disappointing. On this trip, we decided to get a 1 bedroom suite, which we booked in April (5 mo ago). We booked a 1 bed because my husband made arrangements for a meeting with a client, and we felt that having a living room area would be a great place to conduct their business in private.This is what happened (and don't let it happen to you when booking at The Benjamin)!Approx 1 mo. prior to our visit I contacted The Benjamin, spoke to someone in reservations, and requested that we would like a one bedroom with a balcony (he said there were no balconies), and I also requested getting a room like the one shown on Virtual Tourist (because of the view), or one similar to the studio that we stayed in the past, except 1 bedroom. I assumed that's what he did. However, when I called the Sunday prior to our trip, the front desk clerk said there was nothing indicated regarding my request, other than there were two reservations, not one. He said there would be no problem cancelling the 2nd reservation made in error, and he suggested room 912, and that it was everything that I requested the first time. The day before our trip, I contacted The Benjamin again, wanting to make sure our request was on our reservation. The front clerk said it was, but the previous front desk clerk was in error in telling us it was guaranteed, she said rooms are never guaranteed.No problem, I explained to her that we had a horrible experience at a previous hotel years ago. and ever since then always try and get a room request. We've never, ever had a problem at The Benjamin.When we finally arrived, we did get room 912, however when we opened the door, I almost fainted in disgust. The room had a terrible stench (like smoke, and this is a non-smoking hotel). The carpeting was dirty and stained. It definately was not what I expected. So, I called and asked for another room, this time we were given room 1012, which was worse than 912. When I told the clerk that this wasn't the room that they show on Virtual Tour, she told me it was! I told her those two rooms had never been renovated liked the one they show on Virtual Tour, or the photo gallery.This time I asked to speak to the manager, at first he said there weren't any rooms available that night, but after checking found out there was one available, and that was room 1710.This room was better, it was larger, it smelled better, so we took it. However, the carpeting was stained and frayed at the ends (I took pictures), There were no pillows on the bed, other than pillow shams. The only sheet was a bottom sheet, and a comforter, with a thin bedspread. My husband cancelled his business meeting as he was to embarrassed to have a meeting in that room.Last but not least, when we checked out and went to pay the bill, the 2nd reservation was never cancelled, and the charges were higher than what our reservation showed. Eventually that was taken care of. Basically, we weren't treated with any respect that we usually get from the high standards that I thought The Benjamin had.However, we love NYC, the weather was beautiful, we saw and did everything we wanted too!
