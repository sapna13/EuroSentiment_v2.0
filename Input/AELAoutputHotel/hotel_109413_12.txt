{"text":"Very nice place for business travelers We were in Dallas for a trade show which had negotiated rates with the Magnolia for delegates. The hotel is quite nice, upscale-ish lobby with marble touches. We stayed on the 11th floor and had no issues with the room whatsoever. We stayed from Thur to Sun nights and did not enounter any street noise however in the room there was the constant hum of the a\/c which we were unable to adjust. It was noticable at first but over time we became used to it, and it did not interfere with getting a good night's rest. This may be because the king bed was extremely comfortable with oversized fluffy pillows. The bathroom was very nice also, large oval shaped tub (no jets) with shower, modern vanity and tile floor. The hotel offers complimentary drinks  appetizers but unfortunately we were unable to make it during the times offered. We did however visit the lounge on the 2nd floor several times and got to know one of the bartenders (John) who was great fun. There is no restaurant but you can food in the lounge or room service. Starbucks in the lobby if you miss the complimentary continental b'fast. Just out the door there is the Iron Cactus restaurant which is also pretty good.Its about a 10min walk to the convention centre so we would not hesitate to stay here again for the same type of trip. Unfortunately downtown Dallas does not have much to offer for tourists. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":9,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":5}]}
