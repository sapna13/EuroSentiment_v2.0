{"text":"Not quite the MO I booked (what I thought) was a good internet rate direct with the hotel online at $200 a night. When I checked out 3 nights later, the bill for food, spa and the fixed 18% gratuity cost me over DOUBLE of what my room cost! The staff did try their best, but I don't think their service warranted the 18% gratuity I was forced to pay at the restaurant , room service and spa.Whilst this hotel was a fairly decent hotel, the image on their website is decidedly different to the actual hotel. If you saw a private beach on the website, you will be surprised to find something similar to a sandpit with a couple of deck chairs and a few sad looking cabanas. The pool was small and chairs were placed closely together. The Spa was a reasonably sized where I had body, face and hand treatments. I had to shuffle between 3 different rooms, which defeats the purpose of relaxing, having to dress, undress and walk around the spa to get from one room to another.I was surprised the hotel room just had a bulky old TV that didn't even have an entertainment system. No movies or music on demand. The selections on TV were similar to those found in Holiday Inns. Complimentary toiletries were very limited - just had shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion. The bathroom had a big bath, but no bubble bath to put in for a good soak. The tap on the sink didn't extend long enough into the sink, so water went everywhere when you tried to wash your hands. The gym was located in a weird place - by a door next to the M Bar (!?) Or you can go via the Spa by lift. This hotel is nothing to rave about for the price that I ended up having to pay for the extra services. It was not quite the MO experience I was expecting being from Hong Kong. ","annotations":[]}
