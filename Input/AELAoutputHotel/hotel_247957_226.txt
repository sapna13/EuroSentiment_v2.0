{"text":"Beware of this hotel..you may not get what you paid for! I am trying to be very politically correct, however, my vacation at this resort leaves me with very little room to do so. It all started when I arrived at this resort on Feb. 7, 2008 at around 2 p.m. I was told after about a 20 minute wait at the reception desk, that there seemed to be a problem, and that the hotel was overbooked, however, they had a very nice room for me. As I was shown the room, in the edifficio 11 (bldg 11), I was surprised to see this dilapidated room, with only one king size bed (and I happened to be on vacation with my mother, we are ages 36  54, so sleeping together was not an option), a strange bug spray\/mold odor, and bathroom that appeared to be falling apart. Now I suppose this would work for some, however, I was paid for and booked in the Royal Club (a.k.a. VIP section of this hotel, that is much higher priced than the regular room rate), specifically pre-requested a room in the RC with 2 beds and a non-smoking Ocean View Deluxe room. Long story short, I was repeatedly told that my Royal Club room would be available the next night, and had to be moved to 4 different rooms before a somewhat decent sleeping area was arraigned (edifficio 24, a very nice bldg, however, since half of the hotel is being upgraded, stay away from bldgs, 11, 13, and 14..try to request something in the 20's if your not going to the Royal Club) and after many heated discussion with management (Metz was the mgr at the main lobby, who was tolerant but not very helpful initially)...at 11 p.m. I was finally able to settle into the temporary room. The food is horrible, the staff is incredibly rude (except for Albert from the beach bar at the Royal Club, and one of the recp. at the Royal Club reception..I believe her name was Juana). If your going to this resort, have low expectations, bring lots of singles (ATM in the main lobby does not advertise the fees charged which is $5 US per transaction + a 3-4% additional fee based on the amount of money withdrawn), and bring extra toiletries, as they tend to sell common products at ridiculously expensive prices, and if you can buy international calling cards at home, do so, as I paid $20 US dollars for one that I was told had 20 minutes of airtime (don't forget the resorts fee of $2 US for each connection to place a call), and the card only had 12 minutes on it! Also, don't forget the bug spray, especially in the evening and at night. Finally, after all of the stress upon my arrival, and some fighting for some kind of compensation (which was an upgrade to a 3rd Flr. Oceanview Suite in the Royal Club, and a bottle of champagne, and two 30 min. massages, which we had to repeatedly ask for), your best bet is to stay somewhere else. I am still awaiting my reimbursement for one day that we were not in the RC. I won't be back to this hotel, ever! If your staying at this hotel, hopefully you've splurged for the Royal Club, or you may be even more disappointed than I was!The most positive thing I can say is Club Mangu (located right outside of the hotel property) on Friday and Saturday night was the most fun of my entire vacation!!! Stay elsewhere, but def. hit Club Mangu!
