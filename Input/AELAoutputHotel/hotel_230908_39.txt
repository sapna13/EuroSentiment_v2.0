{"text":"Great Location,Tiny rooms - fight for a clean one! Ok,lets start with the positives: The hotel is in an excellent location by rembrandt square  within walking distance of all the major attractions. The room we ended up with was clean  newly renovated. Now the negatives: When we arrived we were told that a canal view room would be 30 euros extra per night.We refused  the receptionist offered an apartment with canal view for the same price... What we entered was not 3 star quality it was infact a dingy squat-like smelly hole with furniture from the 70's  mould from around the same period.Having read other reviews of the hotel mentioning renovated rooms I marched back to the desk  requested one.We were given a room on the 4th floor which was indeed renovated  clean.However there was a major problem - unless you are extremely thin or like pot-holing you will find the room tiny.It is without doubt the smallest room i have ever stayed in  I can't imagine our American friends being too impressed.It was so claustrophobic we spent as much time away from the room as possible.Having said all of this we enjoyed our time in Amsterdam enormously  would recommend the hotel on its location alone.My advice would be that when you book ,request in writing that you will be in a renovated room.Another word of warning - the food in the hotel is ridiculously overpriced  the selection is poor.We asked for a regular green salad - just leaves  tomatoes  were told that as the restaurant is 'Typically French' the chef did not have these ingredients...my boyfriend is French...this did not go down well! If you want a cheap option for brfeakfast go to the 'La Place Mangerie' on Rokin - they have every kind of food imaginable at very reasonable prices.
