{"text":"Worth every penny First I have to start by saying I was very scared after reading some of the reviews on this site. I booked this trip on a whim, and was horrified by some of the things I heard. While everyone's tastes are different as well as experiences....I can only give you mine.The resort is wonderful. It is huge, and at first can be a little overwhelming. It does take a day or two to get the hang of it, such as where the restaurants are... things are quite scattered around the resort ground but they provide transportation and you never have to wait too long.Ok, THE ROOM. Mine was clean; it was nice, not great but good enough. I stayed in a junior suite which is considered a regular room. I was able to get towels when I needed them.The FOOD. This is confusing because not all of the restaurants were open. The resort was only at about 30 percent capacity, so it's understandable. The food was ok, nothing to write home about. I am Italian, so naturally I didn't expect the Italian food to be like what mama makes.... so I stuck to rice and beans and Dominican dishes which is what they do best.The hotel staff was nice, yeah, you have a few that can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be bothered helping you, but that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ anywhere.The majority of them really went out of their way for us. We took a bunch of singles and 5 dollar bills. You don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to, but we tipped. It is a poor country they only make about 200 US dollars a month! And the people are appreciative when you tip them.THE BEACH was beautiful....water was warm, sand was white no complaints!!!!! Wish I was there.Ok here are some tips for you.MAKE YOUR RESERVATIONS FOR DINNER AS SOON AS YOU EAT BREAKFAST!!!! THE RESERVATION CENTER FOR THE RESTARAUNTS IS LOCATED IN THE HIBISCUS LOUNGE, SAME PLACE YOU'LL EAT BREAKFAST.THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO GET YOU TO JOIN SOME KIND OF VACATION CLUB. IT√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©? SOME SORT OF TIME SHARE (they say its not, but it is) AND THEY WILL ASK FOR 90 MINUTES OF YOUR TIME. THEY WILL GIVE YOU A FREE GIFT, BUT I COULDN'T BE BOTHERED SO MY BOYFRIEND AND I JUST SAID NO.....FIRMLY.BRING BUGSPRAY. LOOK, IT IS A TROPICAL ISLAND, AND THERE ARE MOSQUITOS. BUT THERE ARE MOSQUITOS EVERY WHERE, SO WHATS THE BIG DEAL.THE SUN IS STRONG, WEAR SUNBLOCK AND DRINK WATER!ALSO, JUST TO BE SAFE, I TOOK 2 PEPTO BISMOL TABLETS AS SOON AS I WOKE UP EVERY MORNING. I DIDNT GET SICK, NOT AT ALL.AND YES, IT IS HELPFUL IF YOUSPEAK SOME SPANISH, BUT IF NOT, A LOT OF THE HOTEL STAFF SPEAK ENGLISH.We had a great time, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ worry about a thing. Would go back in a heart beat! ","annotations":[]}
