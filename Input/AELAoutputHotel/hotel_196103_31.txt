{"text":"A wonderful experience This hotel was very warm and friendly. The hotel staff went above and beyond the call of duty to help me make transportation arrangements to get to Gent, Belgium. Since I speak no Dutch or Flemish, the female clerk at the front desk spent much time on the phone, then wrote all the information I needed in English, giving me very specific directions so I would not end up on the wrong train, and would not miss the train I had to change to in Antwerp. (Her English was impeccable.)My room was clean, comfortable, and I had no problems with it. I enjoyed all the philosophical quotes and pictures of great philosophers in the hallways, lobby, and my room.The buffet breakfast was fresh and more than adequate. There were many different foods to select from, and the coffee was the very good.My room had a nice view of a church and the hotel courtyard. The internet service was free, a fast connection, and there was no time limit if no one else was waiting to use it.There were enough nice restaurants to walk to in the area - which seemed like a safe and quiet neighborhood.The tram system was easy enough use, and next time I will buy a pass. The walk from the tram stop to the hotel was quick. I did not have nearly enough time in Amsterdam, and would like to go back. I would certainly consider staying in the Hotel de Filosoof again. While it is close to some museums, it was a little too far out from the main part of the bustling city- such as the Dam Square area - for me to want to go back out at night.
