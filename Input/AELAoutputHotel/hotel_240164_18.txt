{"text":"Disgusting This has to be the worst hotel my family and i have stayed at. It was disgusting, even that is being to kind. The hotel staff is rude and unknowlegable. We asked the security if he could direct us in the way of a nice resturant and the only place he could mention was dennys...because by nice we of course meant something we could easy go to in our own town. My brother and I were going to use the gym the next night and asked the same security guy if he could open the door to it for us and he replied you have to go to the front desk and ask them, you have to be a guest to use it i am not sure what he meant by it but it certainly seemed as if he implied we were not welcome, when we went to the receptionist to get the key she said it closes at elven i replied okay and stood there until she went to the back....we waited for five minutes when she came back she looked at us stunned and asked yes i replied i'd like the key to the gym....it was only 10:15 so we would have a good 45mins to work out....but i guess she believed we needed to work out for a lot longer. We put our towels on the floor as the request to get new ones...we didn't get any though the same dirty ones were left there. We were charged for Valet parking the thing is because they were always so backed up they made us both park it and pick it up every time but when we got there. There are black cats everywhere....and im sure its because they find food all over the place. On our way back we found a beautiful beach called Lido beach....its much nicer than Miami Beach, although even Bayside has much more beauty than Miami and South.
