{"text":"Disappointing I booked this hotel on the strength of the reviews I read on Trip Adviser, as I wanted something really special for my wife√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ 50th birthday.I emailed the hotel before our stay to ask them to provide some flowers for my wife, to be in the room when we arrived. (I have now seen on a previous review that someone else did this successfully). I was told that this would be no problem. I also asked them to recommend a restaurant and book a table for the Friday night of our stay.When we arrived there were no flowers in the room so I went down to reception to find out why. The receptionist, who had replied to my email, said that he had forgotten to order the flowers. However he said he would get onto it straight away. Having forgotten the flowers I checked with him that he had booked the table at the restaurant. He assured me that this had been done. The flowers soon turned up and I was not charged for them.The room was great but during the first night my wife and I were kept awake by a rather noisy fan, which was directly over our bed. The next day we reported this and asked if it could be switched off. We were told that it could not be switched off but that it would be seen to. Later that day we were told that the filter had been changed. This did not make it any quieter and we had to live with the noise for the duration of our stay. There was also a stain on the floor of the room. Beware of room 411√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ noisy fan!On the Friday evening we turned up at Het Tuynhuys restaurant on Reguliersdwarsstraat and we were told that they had no record of our booking and that they were full for the evening. They rang our hotel and the receptionist said that he could not remember if he had actually booked the meal. The staff at the restaurant felt sorry for us and worked hard to find us a table and in half an hour we were sat down ready to order. The food is fabulous and the service first rate. We highly recommend it and a special thank you to the manager and Nichole.We would agree with other reviews that this hotel is in an excellent location close to many of the attractions and that the free drinks and snacks are a bonus.We would also agree that the front office desk is friendly but not skilled at handling requests. They did not seem to know very much when asked general enquires about Amsterdam. When we tried to check out some information about buying tickets for some of the attractions they could not help us. We were often kept waiting and then when we were being dealt with; the staff broke away and talked to someone else. On one occasion the receptionist had to ask a senior member of staff three times about a simple enquiry. Not once did the senior member of staff come out and deal with the issue. More training is clearly needed in customer care and the art of concentration.Amsterdam has so much to offer and we would recommend hiring a bike (Mac Bike) to explore and the Sauna Deco at Herengracht 115 Grachtengordel. With all the cycling and walking you will do it is worth spending some time relaxing and Sauna Deco is a great place to do it. They provide good refreshments.Banks Mansion clearly has many good features and facilities, however for us it was let down by the carelessness of the staff.Where was Nina? (Mentioned in previous reviews). Come back all is forgiven!
