{"text":"disappointed.... After visiting the Dominican in January 2006 (Sunscape\/Bayhibe) I was extremely disappointed with this resort. The hotel is located on the beach but because of the size of the resort it is actually a one to two block walk. The winds were strong in December and the sand was continuously piled up on the sidewalks. We had a member of our party confined to a wheelchair which caused some hardship. I don't mind tipping the staff provided they are kind, courteous and helpful but this was hard to come by. Even with a language barrier a smile and an hola should be a must by each employee of the resort! Of course there were exceptions but there never were coffee cups at the place settings for breakfast and never water distributed during the meal unless asked for. The entertainment was elementary and there was never any service for drinks during the shows. The waitress would pick up empty glasses but never ask if anyone wanted anything. The apple rep was not there during posted hours (she said she was being transferred to another site but that a replacement would be available). The restaurant situation was poor as you had to get up early to try to get reservations to other sites (never had any luck ). I will say the wedding that we attended was very nice but overall the stay was very disappointing and I would strongly suggest that if you are going to visit the Dominican Republic you go to the Sunscape in Bayihibe!
