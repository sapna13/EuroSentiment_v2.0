{"text":"Outstanding service and value for money The hotel was reasonably central in Hong Kong Island, being a couple of minutes walk from the metro station and then only a couple of stops to central shopping and sights. There is a park almost opposite, which was good for a stroll in the mornings, away from the bustle.Although it does technically have a harbour view, it is really too far away and at an angle, so not what many people would consider to be a good view from most of the rooms.It was spotlessly clean and a large and well-provided room. Although relatively inexpensive, we were really impressed the hotel overall. The food in the restaurant was excellent - we ate there on the evening we arrived and had a really good meal, and had a delicious breakfast there each day, although this wasn't included in our room rate - some people obviously did have an inclusive rate for breakfast, so it's worth checking in advance as it was relatively expensive but, we felt, still worth paying for. They have a business centre where, as well as providing tourist info and booking tours if you want them, they have a couple of internet points which are provided free of charge to guests.There is also a hotel shuttle bus to and from the airport, which is very efficient and can be booked in advance, saving a lot of hassle and concern about being ripped off by taxis etc.  We were very impressed overall and would certainly go back, and also recommend it to friends.
