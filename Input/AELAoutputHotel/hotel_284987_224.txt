{"text":"No where close to a 5 star. Not worth the price. My wife and I stayed there from 4\/23 - 4\/26 and were pretty disappointed with the service that we received. From the time we got to our room until the time we left, it all went downhill. For being an advertised 4 diamond hotel we were amazed that the service was so sloppy and the rooms were in the condition that they were in. After check in we got to our room and the key didn't work. That was ok, because these things do happen, but when the securities key didn't work we should have known that it was going to be a problem. After waiting almost 30 minutes to get into our room it got worse. We entered our room and the smell of mildew was so over whelming that we could not stay in the room. The wall where the bathroom was located had water stains and the tile did as well. We called the front desk and told them that we will be going to dinner and passing by to have our rooms changed as per David. After dinner we did just that and we were assured that our bags would be brought to our new room. We spent time in the lobby and finally decided to go back to our newly assigned room after about 2 and a half hours to find that our luggage was not yet moved to our room. It was about midnight and we wanted to get ready for bed in hopes that the next day would be better. Not to mention that the new room also had the smell of mildew. We were very surprised that a hotel of that caliber would have rooms under these conditions. After working in the hotel industry myself in the past, it made me feel as though these rooms were maintenance rooms and the only time these rooms are usually used is when the hotel has been over booked. The service at the restaurants were also lacking. The food was great, but the service was very slow at the Avocado Grill. The Bamboo was wonderful, but our reservation was at 9:30 and we were not seated until 10:15. I think Romantico was the only restaurant in the resort that we had a great experience. Room service was horrid. We ordered room service and it took almost 2 hours to be received and the food was cold when received, not to mention the beverages were warm. Like I said, we were very disappointed and when we mentioned the issues we had, all we received in return was a mere I'm sorry and nothing was done to make sure that we were satisfied or taken care of for our inconveniences. In my opinion, this hotel is not a 4 diamond\/5 stars. I wouldn't even give it 2 stars. Not worth the money. Extremely disappointed as it has such wonderful potential. And we were approached with the opportunity of purchasing a vacation club package, but if our experience was different our decision may have been different.
