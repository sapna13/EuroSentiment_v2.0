{"text":"Loved the Conrad Just came back from a trip to Singapore. We loved the food there and we loved Conrad.I called Conrad directly to book because the Hilton website cannot handle an option with 2 adults and 1 child. The check-in process was smooth and we got what we asked for, non-smokiing room, a king-size bed with a rollaway. We are Hilton Honors Gold member and we were upgraded to a business class room with complementary breakfast. The room on 17th floor was spacious with big windows and we could see the harbor and a few other high-rise hotels. It was fun to just looking out the window. We were offered to have breakfast on the executive floor or cafe on the first floor. We picked the cafe on the first floor because we were told that the selection was more there. The breakfast offered Japanese, Chinese and American food. It was quite decent considered it was free.We paid around US$235 per night including tax and service charge. This is a very good price for 5-star quality and service.The concierge, laundry valet, pool\/gym area offered very attentive and speedy service. Business class included $20 credit for laundry and I took advantage of it and had our jeans washed for free. I am a cost conscious traveler. It is defintely a luxury to me.Conrad is across the street from Suntec City which is a huge shopping mall with a lot of nice restaurants and food courts. You could find cuisine ranging from Chinese, Sudanese, Indian and more there. McDonald's, Burger King could also be found near the food court if your kids miss their comfort food. I broke down and let my kid have a hamburger after traveling in Asia for more than 10 days. If you want to play tourist, there is also a tourist center where you can take the Hippon (Hop on and hop off) Tour bus to see the city. It is also the depot of the amphibian duck tour.The country\/city is quite small and taking taxi is the way to go. It is very inexpensive. We went to Long Beach Seafood restaurant on East Coast for dinner the first night. It is on the beach. Their famous black-peppered Sri Lanka crab was definitely a must to have if you go to Singapore. It was spicy but not overpowering. I could still taste the sweetness and freshness of the crab. My son had a buttered crab. It was also very good. We went to Newton circus (sp?) the seond night for chili crab. This was a place full of hawker stands. The Conrad conciege told us about the rating the hawker stands have. Pick the one that is A rated. This is an interesting experience that you should not miss. We took a subway there ourselves after a day visit to Sentosa, an island that offered, cycling, underworld aquarium, luge ride, cablecar ride and fish spa. Yes, we paid to have fish eating dead skin off our feet. It was a very fascinating experience.Conrad is quite far from the subway station. Both Conrad and Suntec City offer shuttle bus to take you to the closest MRTstation. The hotel is not within distance to Orchard Road that was the haven for shopping. I don't like shopping while I am traveling. So I didn't miss the shopping too much.We loved our time in SIngapore and Conrad was an excellent choice. We would definitely stay there again.
