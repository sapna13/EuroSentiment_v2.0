{"text":"Decent Hotel Very nice hotel.Modern and comfortable, sits at the end of Avenida Diagonal on the Barcelona seafront 5 minutes walk away from the beach (not the best beach in the Med but its ok). Also opposite a 3 floor shopping centre that seem's to cater for most shopping need's (a bit upscale - none of the usual cheap Spanish leather goods).Its done out in the usual Hilton style, comfortable beds, a bit minimalist but it all works ok. Nice pool, albeit with plenty of kids running round (one of them was mine) which I know can be annoying if you're on business. Also the pool gets shaded by some surrounding office blocks early in the morning. There's a gym and a business centre and a nice lounge as well.Food and bars are expensive as you would expect in a 5 star hotel in Europe - watch out especially for the bottled water - I think I spent circa 60 euro's on it in four days!Very good staff, I couldn't fault them, all well turned out, friendly and efficient.The hotel tends to cater more for our German friends as does most of Spain so expect the TV channel's to be dominated by German programmes (a bit annoying watching the Olympics with a German commentator) but its just a minor point - but get to those sunbeds early!The only very slight negative is the surrounding area which has some rather uninspiring office blocks and somehow manages to look a bit downbeat when actually its all fairly decent. Maybe they need a new architect in this part of town.Getting around is very easy - Taxis are cheap and there's a rank next to the hotel.Al in all a very good hotel.
