{"text":"Great Honeymoon! My new husband and I had the opportunity to stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for our honeymoon from January 5th through the 12th of this year. I must say, after reading some of the reviews on this resort, I was extremely anxious to arrive to either confirm or deny the comments of other travelers. I am happy to report that our stay at the resort was met with pure optimism and an amazing experience.We arrived at the Hilton late in the evening on a Saturday after a long flight from New Jersey. My parents are Hilton Grand Vacation Club members, and were gracious enough to give us their timeshare for our honeymoon as a wedding present. Therefore, we stayed in the Lagoon Tower. When we got off the shuttle, our bags were taken immediately to our hotel room without hesitation nor pressure to be tipped. We were guided to our tower and immediately checked in without any problems. I had heard on this site that the resort was currently under construction in certain areas, which is true. We were lucky to be placed in a room on the 14th floor facing the lagoon and the ocean instead of that. We had a fantastic view from our room, where we were able to see almost the entire resort as well as the water. The room was very clean, as well as the balcony. My only complaint concerning the room was the bathroom, where I was expecting a separate tub and shower after staying in other 1 bedroom condos through Hilton in the past. However, this is not a necessity.The places to eat in the resort can be very expensive. However, with the location of the Hilton being in the midst of Waikiki, dining options are endless outside of the resort. I would recommend dining at Bali at the Sea in the Hilton, due to the quality of both the service as well as the food. It isn't cheap, but if you go at 6pm Monday through Thursday, ask for the Sunset Dinner Special, where you receive a special menu with dining entrees at a reduced price. As for the resort itself, it has absolute character and appeal. I found it to be absolutely beautiful, whether you were at the beach or on the sidewalk on Kalia Ave. The service was fantastic. We were always greeted whether we were arriving or leaving our tower in the resort. Questions were always addressed on the spot and handled accordingly. I would definitely recommend this resort for couples despite past reviews saying it is more family oriented. Vacations are what you make out of them. Yes, there were families with small children at the resort during our stay, but in no way did it hinder our awesome experience.I must say that I'd been monitoring the progress of the construction around the Lagoon Tower since reading reviews about this in the summer, but for the most part the construction has pretty much passed. The lagoon itself is completed and gorgeous. The Grand Waikikian, which is the new tower in the resort, is diagonal and behind the Lagoon Tower, so it does not create an eye soar. If you book the timeshare for a week in Hawaii, do yourself a favor and request for a room with a lagoon view. Mention that your vacation is a special occasion of some sort (i.e. honeymoon, anniversary, significant birthday celebration...anything), and this will increase your chance of having a room with a view.  If you're looking for an active honeymoon full of activity as well as relaxation, the Hilton Hawaiian Village and Lagoon Tower will provide just that! Enjoy!
