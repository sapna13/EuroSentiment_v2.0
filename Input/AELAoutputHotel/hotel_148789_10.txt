{"text":"okay We found the Lazy Parrot via an internet search. We contacted the receptionist who assured us that we would be pleasantly surprised with our balcony view and room. We decided to book the room for a 5 day stay during the Easter vacation. One of the first things that I noticed about the Lazy Parrot is that once you get there you need to park across the street from the actual Inn. We had to carry our luggage up a flight of stairs through a restaurant and down several flights of stairs to get to the check in. Once we checked in we had to carry our luggage back up several flights of stairs through the restaurant and up another flight of stairs. If you have difficulty going up and down stairs this is not the place for you. Our balcony view was nothing special but our room was very clean and well maintained. During our stay there we met with the owners who where there daily and seemed like very nice people. My family and I spent a lot of time by the pool which was great and had drinks and food from the Rum Shack. The food and drinks at the Rum Shack and Smilin Joe were great however I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not too sure of the math that they were using at the Rum Shack. It seems that several times our bill was padded and we ended up paying more than what we should have. Overall the Lazy Parrot is not a bad place to stay at. Would I go back? Probably not.
