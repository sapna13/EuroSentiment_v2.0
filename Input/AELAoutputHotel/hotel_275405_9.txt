{"text":"Horrible experience A friend and I stayed here in 2005. I have only recently discovered Trip Advisor and it seems somewhat unfair to post a review over two years later. However, the experience was bad enough for me to get over those misgivings. Where do I start? The hotel is inconviently located. Granted, the public transportation was easy and accessible but the hotel was simply too far from the City Center. That being said, the noise here was beyond acceptable. Even the pipes made noise! Taking a shower here was work - the shower head continutally fell and the temperature vacillated from freezing cold to hot. The hotel was also locked at night -- reminiscent of the hostel lock-out periods of my youth. We returned to our hotel after hours one weekend night and had to wait for over an hour, in the pouring rain, finger on buzzer, for the night-duty person to unlock the door in his underwear. We attempted to address our experience with the front desk the next morning and were unsuccessful. We told them of our plans to depart early, explained the numerous reasons why, and they refused to let us out of our paid reservation and charged us for the full number of nights we had originally reserved. They offered NO apologies and were incredibly dismissive. We ended up going to the train station's hotel desk and getting a room at the amazing Sofitel right in the City Center for LESS than we had paid to be locked out in the rain in the outskirts the night previously.
