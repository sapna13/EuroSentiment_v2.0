{"text":"Park Shore Hotel Sucks!!!! Hello. Me and my Mom went to Park Shore Hotel just a week agoand stayed there for a couple of days. I found out about thishotel online and I called in to make a reservation, I told them that wewant a room with TWO beds and the lady on the phone saidno problem. So here is what happened when we got to thehotel: We got off the bus and my FIRST impression of the hotelwas oh wow I did a good job. I saw a nice looking hotel withthese big glass windows showing everything inside, it lookedvery nice. But it looks nice ONLY ON THE OUTSIDE !!!!! That's their way of tricking people to go to their hotel. They made it lookall nice on the outside, but when you actually go in where therooms are and IN the rooms, it's TERRIBLY BAD !! The carpetwas DIRTY first of all. We got into our room and we could barelywalk past each other without bumping...yes, the room was thatsmall !! Oh and to our surprise, there was only ONE BED !I called the front desk right away and asked them why we haveonly one bed when there is TWO of us. Their excuse was : Oh we don't have anymore of those available, sorry I said :Well I reserved a room with 2 over the phone, what happened?And she said Yeah but we can't promise you that. It's only if we have any left. Then what's the point of making a RESERVATION, lady ?!!?!?!??! I didn't say that to her but I got really mad and I asked if there is really nothing she can do. She said I'll send you a roll-over bed. So when we put the roll-over bed in the room, wehad to JUMP over things, there was no space for walking at all.NADA! Another thing I didn't like was the placement of the TV.It was put in this white cupboard that was turned away from the bed, it was sideways so I couldn't watch any TV from the bed.And our balcony view was horrible too. It was facing this taller white hotel and when you look down you can see all kinds of garbage, trash cans everywhere, dirty garages or whatever it was. It looked like it was on fire once upon a time, everything was black. Breakfast is not free and using their so called computers is not free either. There is no fitness center ( I saw that included on some webstes). But no, there is no fitness center or spa.The staff was not helpful at all. They weren't even polite, I did not hear a welcome a thank you a hello !!!!! When we went to the desk up front, the lady only looked at us without saying anything.I guess that's how they say hi. She never said how may I help you? I never heard an enjoy your stay or hope you liked it.None of it ! NADA. Another thing, the housekeepers don't speak English. If you're going to hire someone to help people, he\/sheMUSTTTT know English. I mean come on, how are they going to help me if they can't understand a word I'm saying ?!?! It's ridiculous!! Also, when I went in the bathroom to blowdry my hair, the plug-ins didn't work so I called for someone to come up and see what is wrong. The lady on the phone said she'll TRY and find someone to come up. Finally someone comes up and the it takes the person 30 minutes to figure out what is wrong. He told me that I have to press the 2 buttons on the plug-in one after another to get it working. The bathroom by the way, was a small box too. There was no shampoo, no soap, nothing. I know that usually there has to be SOMETHING there. But not at this hotel apparently. So DO NOT get tricked and stay at this hotel ! Never go there!! Never-ever-ver-er-r !!!!!!!!
