{"text":"Impeccable Service The Shangri-La chain once again proved to me their industry-leading strength in comfort and service. Upon check-in, we upgraded to a deluxe room which entails a larger living area, free in-room wi-fi, breakfast at the top floor restaurant, and more. They were unable to accommodate our party of three with a room with two beds, but we found that most of our hotels in Asia had only king or two twin rooms, although the rolloway bed was the most comfortable one I slept on the entire trip.The room was beautifully decorated and had a high-floor view of Victoria Harbour and the forest of skyscrapers in Kowloon. The bathroom featured a separate television, which only prolonged me in getting ready in the morning while I watched CNN.Beneath the hotel on the street level are a series of restaurants and Pacific Place, a Versailles-sized shopping mall selling anything from high-end purses to unlocked, imported iPhones. We were able to walk from mall to mall and find ourselves on the other side of the city. The hotel is in an excellent location adjacent to Hong Kong Park and is only a short walk to the central business district.What was most impressive of the hotel was perhaps their service. We forgot to pack an extra power adapter, so we made a visit to the gift shop in the lobby. They didn't sell any there, but they promised they would send a loaner to our room. The adapter beat us to our room. The front desk staff were also very willing to give good directions, and the doormen had a bevy of local knowledge. They also would write our cab number on a slip of paper in case we forgot valuables inside the cab.The hotel's elegance, service, and convenient location made it the perfect place to stay in Hong Kong-- but for USD$500\/night, it better be.
