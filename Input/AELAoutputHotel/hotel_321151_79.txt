{"text":"Not Quite There Yet (5 Star) We had a corner premier room (320) for a three night weekend stay in Boston. Got a substantial discount from Orbitz, at least over what was posted on the hotel website. Jury's was a good value for the discounted rate, but I would have expected better for the rack rate. The corner room was nice, but did not have a flat screen TV or ergonomic chair as advertised on Orbitz. Service was always provided with a friendly smile, but there were some kinks here and there. Follow through by the staff was not always there for requests. Despite the reservation having been made for two, the room didn't seem fully prepared for two...for example, there was only one bathrobe, one bar of soap, and insufficient towels (at least for us). Turn down service in the evening provided fresh ice and chocolates. My partner didn't care for the frosted glass on the bathroom door, as light from my late night forays kept her awake. We liked the barista in the lobby for morning coffee and muffins... very good. Unfortunately, they were closed Monday morning, so I had to deal with Dunkin' Donuts' lines. Free local (Boston Globe) and NY papers were available each morning in the lobby...a nice touch.As with most fancy hotels, there was no coffee maker in the room, and no vending machines in the halls. This hotel is in a great location...just blocks from the Arlington and Back Bay T stations, as well as the Theatre District and the Public Gardens.Jury's is trying hard to be a five star hotel, but isn't there yet.P.S. Don't miss a delicious dinner at Giacomo's on Columbus Ave. This site (unlike the one in the North End) does take reservations, but both are cash only. Best halibut I've ever had.
