{"text":"Very good.....although toyko is a challenge for first timers! My husband and I stayed for 2 nights on our way to oz. Here is our summary of the hotel and my 'idiots guide to toyko' for those who go without reading a tour book properly!Hotel room: on the small size, but expected for a captial city, very nicely furnished, free internet, good range of free toiletries, very comfortable bed, nice duvet etcHotel service: excellent, always very helpful brought an iron to room etc, lots of staff around to help, free sweets in reception Hotel asthetics: very nice modern design, immaculate clean and tidy. View from room very good, we were very high. Also we didnt hear the trains through the nightHotel food: didn't try, no time, although bar looked very niceLocation: close to all subway stations, walking distance to main shops, plenty of nice bars and restaurants near by My 10 point guide to toyko if you are a first timer1. Dont tip2. Dont point your finger or shout3. Fold your napkin neatly after your meal4. Make sure you get an ENGLISH SUBWAY map before you leave your hotel5. Know where you are heading to eat\/drink i.e. have a recommendation b4 hand as everything is in japanese (not suprisingly...so you cant tell a restarant from a karaoke from a internet cafe)6. In most areas you can only go in for a drink if you eat also7. Roppongi - we didnt like it, too cheesy and westernised8. Most restaurants and bars are up in the high rises soyou need to look on the lift menu to know where you are going9. Fashion - its quite smart\/casual. Girls kitten heels with girly skirts and macs. Men jeans, pumps, trendy cardigans, pointy shoes.10. Sporadic rain storms, everyone carries umbrellas ","annotations":[{"endOffset":394,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":390},{"endOffset":520,"mention":"sweets","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":514},{"endOffset":560,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":556},{"endOffset":843,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":839},{"endOffset":843,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":839}]}
