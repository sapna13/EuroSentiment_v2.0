{"text":"Very cute hotel I booked my stay at this hotel in a superior room based on the Trip Advisor reviews. Firstly, I was not disappointed with the cleanliness of the room nor the great location - they were both perfect. Additionally, although very close to the centre of Paris, a good nights sleep was ensured every night, the location straddles that void between being near where you want to be, but in a quiet location. The staff were lovely. The communal spaces such as the dining room and the lounge area were stylish and comfortable. The room, however, was small. There was no where to put my case for packing or unpacking except for on the bed. That was Ok for unpacking, but for packing it was an inconvenience. I stayed three nights, I used all of the tiny bottle of complimentary Hermes shower gel on the first night and it was never replenished. There appears to be no provision to get a cup of coffee in your room in the morning instead of going downstairs and paying 15 Euros for a basic continental breakfast. Admittedly I did not ask, but then again there was nothing in my room on the information sheet to indicate that any sort of room service is available. I am not a mean or penny pinching person, but felt that the price of the breakfast was a little steep for what was on offer. On the last morning of my stay I found a great cafe just around the corner from the hotel which offered a better choice for much less. Would I stay again? Probably, because it was clean, quiet and elegant - but I definitely feel that the breakfast is too expensive for what is it, despite the very smart table settings and decor, and it would be nice if toiletries were replenished as used.
