{"text":"The Best Place on The Strip O.K. First of all I'll tell you the good things. The place looks beautiful. My room was great and had a great view. The Pools are clean and stay open all night. The beach is perfect. I had a wonderful time. The Casino pays out at black jack, I couldn't lose. You're in walking distance from Burger King, Wendy's, walgreens and Pizza hut if you need a little taste of home. 20 dollar or less will get you to old San juan and\/or the mall. It has a night life that'll beat any club. After 7pm it's jumping. I found out the hard way don't forget pants. You can't party with shorts on. It's like everyone else who stayed at a resort on the strip came to El San Juan Hotel  Casino to party.  Now the bad things. It's not too much wrong with this hotel but here are a few things I didn't like. They don't give you robes or slippers. The food is way over priced ($30 for a cheese burger and fries)and they don't have enough beach chairs at the poolside. The don't let you party with shorts on. The mini-bar forget about it. Don't even touch it. Now other than that it's the best place to be I found. I stayed at the Ritz-Carton in 04 and I have to admit you can't go wrong there either. But ESJ is a great place to stay. Just eat wendys and go to walgreens for your snacks.
