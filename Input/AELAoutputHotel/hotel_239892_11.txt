{"text":"Convenient and exceptional value for Seattle Airport area This hotel is closer to the South Mall than the airport, but they have a free shuttle which picks you up and drops off, so the extra 5 minute drive is really irrelevant. We do have to wait an extra 10-15 minutes for the pickup, but it is really worth it. We have stayed here 4 times recently and every time has been great. Each room is a suite with a living area, fold out couch, TV and small kitchen and a large bedroom with beautiful bathroom. This makes it a great value if traveling with kids especially with their free breakfast. There is a second TV in the bedroom.Breakfast is buffet style with make-your-own waffles, fruits, cereals, yogurts, muffins, toast, scrambled eggs and meat and fresh juices. There is a fireplace and big-screen TV in the lobby which looks out on the pool and hot-tub (in a pretty little gazebo).In the evening there are soft drinks in the breakfast area and on certain days there is a free happy hour with snacks, but we have not been there for that. The staff is really friendly and professional and the maid service has turned towel-folding into an origami artform. Rooms are immaculately clean and very quiet. Their soaps and shampoos are first class and we always look forward to popping the complimentary pop-corn in the microwave. Trying to find this place on your own is tricky, it cannot be seen from the main roads, so call for directions or use a map.
