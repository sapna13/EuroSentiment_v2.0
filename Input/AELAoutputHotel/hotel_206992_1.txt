{"text":"Small, noisy, cold, unfriendly hotel The room we were first given was tiny with no view. The window opened on to what I can only describe as a large lift shaft which smelt of cooking fat. We were moved to an equally cramped room, but nevertheless one with a marginally better outlook than the first (it looked on to a side street).As it was winter, the air conditioning was switched off, so in order to have fresh air in the room, we had no option but to open the window and put up with the noise from the street (sirens, shouting, fireworks, garbage collection, etc). Much of this went on all night.The staff were indifferent, and one in particular was somewhat miserable and quite rude whenever dealing with us - particularly when we asked if we could change rooms.One afternoon I realised the heating wasn't working, so I phoned down to tell them only to get the response are you cold?. I might have thought of a witty reply, but I was too cold and tired. Apparently the heating only goes on at certain times of the day!The free WIFI was unreliable to say the least - the connection often cutting out for no apparent reason. And on our last morning, we had no access at all, even though we should have done until noon. I thought it was more trouble than it was worth to enquire as to why this was - given the responses I'd previously had to my queries.The room wasn't cleaned properly - different kinds of hair (not ours) appearing every day on the bathroom floor.Needless to stay, I will never stay there again.
