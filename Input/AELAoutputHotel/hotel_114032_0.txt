{"text":"Would you choose a hotel because of friendly front-desk staff? While looking for a place to stay in Hawaii for 2008 Chrismast vacation, my wife and I noticed one recurrent favorable feature pointed out by reviewers about Aqua Continental (Surf): staff kindliness. I didn't know what they meant until I got there.Upon entering the room on the 9th floor assigned by the Orbitz package deal, my wife recoiled upon being greeted by a c-bug or two. I hurried to the front desk to protest our plight of having to share the room with uninvited guests. Douglas, the attendant, profusely apologized for the distress and assured me a suitable replacement would be available later in the day when the full-occupancy state eased with checkouts. As a way of comforting me, Doug disarmingly feigned his surprise that he, being an expatriate himself from New York, was seeing someone from the same city, noted for, among other things, saturated infestation of this species, who would find this particular bug to be such a stranger.I countered that that was why we had traveled 11 hours across the ocean, to get away from them all for our anniversary, which led him and his associate, Suki, to a furious search for an immediate replacement. To my delight, they informed me of having netted a special upgrade on the 22nd floor.With a new key envelope in hand, I hurried into the elevator. But no 22 button to punch, stopping only at 21. I pressed the only remaining one marked PH and there it was on the top floor a two-room suite with a full-function kitchen and panoramic views. No trace of any little creatures ever trespassing the space.My top highlight of the trip all the way from New York was a side-flight to the Big Island for a view of the lava-oozing volcano, but it turned out an utter flop as it was thoroughly rained out from departure to return. All that I could do was, other than listening to the narrative history and geography lessons from the bus driver, to gaze at the rising flume from miles away, with a camera whose lens was mercilessly pelted with rain drops streaming like tears. To add to my misery from the volcano venture, I returned to Aqua darkened by an historic blackout that had spared Honolulu for eons. The only means to get to my top-floor suite was trudging up step by step lit up by emergency generators. For a moment, it occurred to me the upgrade to penthouse was a curse, of having to scale the extra steps from the original 9th floor. But this downer turned into a source of self-pride when I made it up to the top in one pause-less jaunt at my age.My wife, who had had the wisdom of eschewing the volcano in favor of a neighborhood excursion and returned to the room before the island-wide darkness descended, welcomed me in.My wisdom would be to stop here before my tale gets long enough to vie with a NY Times travelogue. But, yes, Aqua Continental remains with us as the highlight for our journey to the mid-Pacific paradise (even though the helpful front desk could not make our stay perfect with an arrangement to say hello to Barack, whose pre-inauguration vacation coincided with ours just a short distance away).In sum, who among the weary travelers will challenge my weighted observation that a genuine touch of goodwill emanating from the hotel staff, above and beyond their perfunctory concern for their charges, can up the sojourner's satisfaction index by an inestimable factor?
