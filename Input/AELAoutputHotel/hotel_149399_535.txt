{"text":"Two families that enjoyed the stay There were 9 of us in all from Dec 23rd - 30th - five 40 year olds, two 8 year olds, one 10 year old and one 13 year old. We've been to many all inclusives (Cancun, Puerto Rico, Aruba) and this resort was better than most. Some opionions\/advice - 1) stay in the Royal Service area 2) Tip the towel boy the day before to get a cabana for the following day 3) Use the Royal Service to get restaurant resevations a day in advance 4) the food was better than most all inclusives (we only ate at the ala carte restaurants and enjoyed the Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and Mexican) 5) beach was ok but water was murky and a little cold 6) Gabi Club was good for breakfast and lunch 7) a few dollars do go a long way 8) casino was a little lame because they have no craps 9) there is not much to do at the resort but if you just want to chill and relax, it's the place to be 10) it was not that crowded for a holiday week 11) two people in our group did get sick for a day or 2 and they said that they would still go back - you can get sick on any island, anywhere 12) the rest of us would definitely go back again 13) you get what you pay for - we paid DOUBLE the price in Dec 2005 to go to Aruba and this was a better value for the money!
