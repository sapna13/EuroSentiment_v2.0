{"text":"Fooled by pics on website!!! We read all the reviews and we felt ok about going. WRONG. First if you are European, for some reason, you seemed to like this resort. If you are American and used to somewhat edible food, stay clear of everything except the breakfast. Even the bottled water has issues, no chlorine, floride or other ingredients our bodies are usedto for hydration. We were al sick and constipated the majority of the 8 days. First of all, everyone smokes. So if you are a smoker you will love it. We noticed that everyone that smoked was mostly from European countries where it is still widely acceptable, unlike in the United States.Also, those lovely Europeans have never heard of wearing the tops to their bathing suits. Why do you think they are sold together as a 2 piece?? TO WEAR BOTH PARTS!!!My children couldn't stop laughing at these women with boobs like pickles walking around. The Dom. Rep. people seem to only know English and comprehend when they want to. Our power went out 2 times. Expect your power to go out at least once due to the hotel not having a generator capable of supporting its facility. The Food.. or if that is what you want to call it, is just wrong. I think it is because our family isn;t used to corn on pizza or beef that has fatty tussue in every bite. We still aren't sure what Hake is?? Have a lot of ones if you expect to get good bar service. I will say Santiago in the lobby bar was great. Oh, if you are a whiye wine drinker brink your own.Their wine (only one kind) tasted like it was bad,, and they said that is how it is supposd to taste, So I lost weight not eating the food but gained weight frinking the only thing palable,,Coco Loco., rum fatttening foofoo drink. The beach is gorgeous..prettiest one I have seen in a while. No one takes your order on the beach for drinks. You gave to get up and stand in line every time you want a drink, I am used to all-incl resorts where there is someone on the beach bringing you drinks. the grounds are clean but the pool needs to be shocked,, not once did I smell chlorine which scared me. We diddo the horse back riding and the dune buggy. They were fun, but be prepared to go bymany resorts to get other vacationers so you spend more time getting others than you actually do enjoying the horses and dune buggys. Also,, the pool bar closes at 6 pm,, total buzz kill. The various restaurants are ok, the pizza is the best food to try there,, but not the best pizza. We will not be traveling back to the Dom. Rep. We got to visit with family which was the most important but the trip would have been great if we were in a different resort al together. Ohm the kids fun club was a scary joke. DON:T leave your kids there,, they didn't do anything with the kids that were there,, we didn;t leave our kids there once..The night programs( kinda like cruise ship shows) was ok,, would have rather been able to sip nice chard in a quiet romantic area, there were none. Ok, on a good note we ventured out to the Casino about 5 miles away and I won $800 in slot machine,, so all in all,, no more DOm Rep for us evermm abd we wish we would have listened to all you trip advisor peeps before going,, Oh well live and learn,,toodles!!Cassie ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2413,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":2408},{"endOffset":2468,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":2463},{"endOffset":2676,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2672},{"endOffset":2916,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2912},{"endOffset":3177,"mention":"peeps","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Peeps"],"startOffset":3172}]}
