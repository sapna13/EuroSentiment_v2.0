{"text":"Comfortable place in the heart of Toronto I would stay here again. You feel like you have your own apartment in the city.Location: This is a great location for sightseeing in Toronto -- very centrally located. It was a bit further to the Convention Center than I liked (a 15 minute walk at a very brisk pace). Pros: The rooms were huge -- with a separate large bedroom and living area (each with its own TV). The bed was firm and comfortable. The kitchenette with complimentary tea, hot cocoa, coffee, cookies, microwave popcorn and real cups\/utensils was a nice touch. There are two robes for your use as well. In business center, you can print things for free (off of a USB, but you pay for the internet). The staff were courteous, friendly, and helpful. Free continental breakfast was nice. The food available was just average -- but they did have good variety (various juices, coffee, yogurt, cereal, dried fruit, bagels, bread, pasteries). It was definitely enough to start your day. And even if you showed up 15 minutes before the breakfast ended, they still had a full selection (it was constantly replenished).I really liked the complimentary bottle of water they offered every night along with a card describing the weather conditions for the next day. Cons (all minor): The towels were not fluffy -- they were a bit on the rough side. Unlike other hotels, they don't provide complimentary shaving cream, razors, or toothbrushes through the front desk -- but that is available for purchase as part of the minibar selection. The internet service costs $9.95 a day (whereas I'm used to hotels like this offering that free). The elevators were very slow and I sometimes waited close to 10 minutes. I was on the 5th floor and did hear some street noise (nothing out of the ordinary though). There wasn't much of a view from the window. I found the thermostat difficult to adjust. All in all, though -- I'd recommend this place for anyone who wants a good location in downtown Toronto and wants some of the comforts of home.
