{"text":"Fantastic City Centre Hotel Banks Mansion is not your usual European City Centre hotel. It is much more in keeping with the 'Inns' found in New York City. It is all the better for this.Our stay over new year was excellent - from the friendly, efficient check-in; stylish, modern, clean bedrooms; bathrooms you actually want to use (though many rooms simply have walk-in showers rather than a bath so worth checking if that is important to you); 'The Living' where drinks and snacks are available 24\/7 - all complimentary - and internet access is free; to the more than sufficient breakfasts served in the kitchen. If you are looking for pomp and ceremony (you know the sort of thing - your poached eggs brought to you covered in a silver dome at breakfast), then Banks isn't for you. If, however, you are content to request freshly cooked pancakes, french toast and feast of high quality fresh bread, jam, cheese and meat at breakfast and prefer a more relaxed hotel stay, this place is perfect.Re comments below regarding the policy of not taking drinks to your room. This is nonsense. Yes, the drinks are for sharing so it is bad form to take a bottle of champagne up to your room, but we (and other guests) were never stopped from taking glasses of wine  champagne, bottles of beer, cups of coffee etc. to our room. As we stayed over new year, a half bottle of champagne was left on our bed - a nice guesture. There is also a well stocked mini bar in each room along with decanters of gin, congac and whisky.For a City Centre base in Amsterdam, Banks Mansion is faultless. I wish every city had an equivalent hotel to save us from the overpriced misery of bland, outdated, business hotels that charge √à√\u2020√ü?0+ for a substandard breakfast.If I had to critique it would be twofold: 1) our loo roll supplies weren't topped up (thoug remedied by a phonecall) and 2) local taxes payable on checkout were unexpected. That said, as everything else was included in the room rate, the bill on checkout was considerably smaller than is usually the case!
