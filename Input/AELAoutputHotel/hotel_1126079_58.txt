{"text":"Good value, clean - too techno for its own good I stayed at the CitizenM during a trade fair. At such times it is very difficult to find a room at any kind of decent price in Amsterdam, so being able to book the CitizenM for a reasonable rate was a bonus. There was no apprehension about the cleanliness, as the hotel is brand new. Check in was on a computer at the entrance. There was a member of staff there to help with potential problems. The room was pretty small and played on its techno, wiz-bang modern theme. There is a pod for the shower and one for the toilet in the middle of the room (other peoples' photos show these). This means that there is not much privacy whilst 'visiting' either pod. Room facilities like lights, TV, blinds are controlled by a central touchpad. I guess this is fine if it works, but ours didn't, so for a time it was not possible to change channels on the TV or to switch the lights off. Mounted on the wall, the touch pad glowed brightly even when all lights were off, which - in a small room - could disturb you whilst trying to get to sleep. The staff there were very friendly and helpful. Again the hotel let itself down technically by the fact that my room key stopped functioning at the till, so everything had to be paid cash. There was no breakfast included, so everything had to be bought - that was pretty pricey. If you had time, it may be better to nip into the airport for some breakfast. All in all I thought the hotel was trying to play on its technno image too much. There's no point being ultra modern if things don't work and you have to go back to the old way of doing things anyway. It just seemed more wiz-bang than practical.I would stay there again in the same circumstances, but would probably try to find something in the centre thats a bit more classical....
