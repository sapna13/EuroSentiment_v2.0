{"text":"Staff training? This was my fourth stay at this hotel in the last 4 years. I checked in on Thursday (11\/13) and checked out on Monday (11\/17).There is no question this hotel is a great value, as noted by the other guests.I do have suggestions for Management to improve their front desk. I will send Management my sugestions.The front desk is the frontline- they are the first and last to see you, as well as throughout the day. Train them to say Welcome to the University Inn..........how can I can help you today? , rather then last name please or hi and stare at you. It is a simple statement, but a very welcoming opening statement. Train them to look up and say hello and smile whenever guests are passing by the front desk. Rarely did they do this, unless I initiated the hello. A guest will feel much more appreciated by this simple courtesy. I know at times, it can be very busy at the front desk, so a simple wave can even suffice. This is the kind of simple things that can bring back customers.......not the free breakfasts. Competition is tough because of the economy, so making the guest welcomed and happy should be the number one priority,Another issue is to be sure your information is corrrect whenever it is in black and white. The black informational book in the hotel room indicates you can ask front desk to request a time for housekeeping to clean your room. I requested 9am cleaning daily and the front desk clerk typed the memo to housekeeping. They always came in the afternoon( 1:30pm and 2:30pm). I know it was a busy weekend for the hotel because of the football games, but why did I even bother making the request?The book also gives you the hours and menu for the Portage Bay Cafe. I wanted to order a simple hamburger on Saturday and they said they only serve brunch all day. Update your book. Also note the front desk neglected to say there was tax on the airport sedan service. The service is not $40. It is $43.50.Would I stay again.......probably. The positives definitely outweigh the negatives. All of these issues can be resolved to make the University Inn a better hotel.
