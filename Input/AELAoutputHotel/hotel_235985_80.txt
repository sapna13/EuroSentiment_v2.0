{"text":"Quaint, cute and comfortable We stayed at the Porta Faenza for 4 nights at the end of March 2007. We chose the hotel based on feedback from Tripadvisor. One of the reasons we chose this hotel was that we were advised not to get a hotel on a busy road in Florence, and, when we got to Florence, we realized that this was good advice! The Porta Faenza is on a side street off a busy street close to the main station. We took a train into Florence from Venice, and easily managed the 10 minute walk from the station with our luggage.The hotel is very, very quaint. We found all the people working at the front desk to be knowledgable, friendly and very helpful. They recommended restaurants, made reservations, and were always cheerful and welcoming. A great service offered by the hotel was a computer with free internet access in the lobby area.Our room was small with little space to unpack our clothes, but it was comfortable. It had two large windows which overlooked a quiet parking area - not very pretty, but nice to have some fresh air! The bathroom was small, but had everything we needed (including a towel warmer which was great for drying laundry!).Breakfasts were fine. They offered the usual Italian choice of cold meats, cheese, croissants, pastries, cereal, etc. The choice was not as extensive as the hotels we stayed in in Milan or Venice, but it was adequate.The location was fine, although it was a little far from the 'action' (the Duomo, the Ponte Vecchio, etc.) We enjoyed walking so it was not a problem for us, but if one does not enjoy exploring, you may want to stay a little closer to the river. As mentioned earlier, the location was perfect for proximity to the station or the Mercato Centrale (Central Market). Florence is a fairly small city, so nothing is really too far!If we were to return to Florence, we would stay at his hotel again. While nothing fancy, it was clean, comfortable and very quaint!
