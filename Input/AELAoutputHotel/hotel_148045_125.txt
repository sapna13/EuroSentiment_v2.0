{"text":"BIG resort We just returned from 10-days at this property. This property is HUGE. While it is a nice place for what it is, I personally did not care for it and wouldn't go back. There was just 2 of us adults looking for a quiet romantic get-away. We had no idea based on our review of their website that they catered so much to families. The good: The food is excellent, albiet expensive. My compliments to the management in that regard. I don't think we had a bad meal the entire trip. The wine list was also excellent. The bad: Don't get me wrong, I like kids...but they did not have an adults only place anywhere on the resort where you could get some quiet time...not even the martini bar (you couldn't even have a quiet conversation there!). We also saw them serving teenagers in the Ballyhoo bar in the Marina...who got pretty obnoxious after awhile. Aren't the drinking ages the same in Puerto Rico?? As a parent I'd be quite upset that they were serving my underage kids. We found we had to wait in line for just about everything, from the funnicular that takes you from the top of the hotel to the marina to the ferry that takes you to the only accessible beach on the private island off shore. In my opinion, the nicest place to swim in the water on the island appears to be reserved for private boaters coming in for the day. There are no beach chairs in that direction, so they are definately directing the masses to the shallow, windy and more rocky side of the beach. And when I say masses, I mean masses! There was one day that not one beach chair was available on the beach. One of the employees told us later they had counted 1500+ people taking the ferry to the beach that day. Expensive...I don't know how so many folks with families can afford to stay here. Bring a small ice chest. If you have a car, you can stop at one of the local grocery stores and buy snacks  things. You can walk down to the little marina town just outside of the hotel  buy beer for less than $1 per can (Beers (10 oz cans) are over $5 each at the resort). You can get ice at the machines near most rooms. There are small refridgerators in each room, so you do have somewhere to store snacks. SUGGESTIONS: Rent a car and travel around the island. We rented a car in advance from Enterprise about 4 months before our trip...we got a great rate ($150 for the week for an economy car). They were renting for $59 a day if you rented at the hotel. The hotel says there is a $15 per day parking fee. The folks at enterprise have spaces reserved for enterprise...they told us we could park there for free if there were spaces available. We were able to get a space every night, so never had to pay any fees. Bring a small ice chest. The bioluminescent bay is a must. We did the motor boat with Capt Suarez, but the kayaks looked more fun. If you don't think you can control a kayak, the motor boat would be the way to go. The rain forest was beautiful. Pack a picnic lunch (you can get stuff at any local supermarket). After we hiked to the top we had a beautiful picnic at one of the picnic areas within the park. Go to San Juan for at least one day. It is a beautiful city full of history. We had a great meal at the Parrott Club.
