{"text":"Pretty Good I was a little worried heading to Grand Oasis after reading the previous reviews but I can say I was pleasantly surprised. Transport to the hotel was fast and comfortable in a new air-conditioned bus. Check-in was also fast.Our room was quite nice and we had no problem with either the air-conditioning, shower, or electricity.Contrary to other reviews, I thought the food was excellent with a great variety at the buffet. I do, however, agree that getting a drink, especially a re-fill is near impossible and you will not be offered a coffee after your meal by anyone. You may want to try to a la carte restaurants- I visited the Italian restaurant on the first night and thought it wonderful- food and service. Our second night we went to the Acqua restaurant which, I must say, was really bad- the atmosphere was unpleasant with a bad smell, and our server seemed to hate his job. After that experience we stuck to the buffet but I did hear good things about the other restaurants from other tourists. Oh- and make sure to make your a la carte reservations one your first day if possible.It's true what the say about chairs- both at the pool and the beach. I noticed that people would leave a towel or shoe or book or any random item on a chair in the evening to reserve it for the following day and then wouldn't show up till late afternoon.There was also a lot of seaweed both in the water and washed up on the shore but not really much you can do about that- it could be a seasonal thing.Overall, I quite liked the place and think you will enjoy your stay.
