{"text":"Very nice hotel.... but.... I took my family and parents to Renaissance Paris Vendome for a week. We had three rooms. The hotel is very nice, the staff were friendly and accommodating but I came away feeling nice, but.. when I compare it with stays at other five-star hotels. On the nice side were the gym and swimming pool, both of which appeared very new, were not at all crowded (in fact most of the time we were the only ones in the pool which was lovely), with decent locker-rooms and showers. Flat-panels in all the rooms, and DVD players (but no evidence of a menu of DVDs to borrow although I didn't look that hard because we were out all the time so we didn't need in-room entertainment). Beds were very comfortable, with a very nice topper on the matress which is not that common but gives a luxury feel.On the but side: 1. We asked for interconnecting rooms so my kids (aged 6  8) could have their own room but get to us easily. We were initially given rooms separated by two other rooms - when we complained, we were moved to adjoining but not interconnecting rooms after one night. Not the end of the world, but even so annoying.2. The bath robes were regularly removed from the room and not replaced, which was a bit annoying given we didn't have interconnecting rooms so if the kids wanted us in the middle of the night it is kind of handy to have a robe to put on when you step into the corridor. We asked repeatedly and eventually got robes but again, annoying to have to ask.3. The one and only PC with internet connection in the lobby was out of action for our entire stay4. One of the two lifts was out of action for most of our stay, meaning some competition with the bell-boys for elevator space5. We asked for a taxi to collect us from Gare du Nord so we didn't have to sweat in line after a 3 hour train ride. This is a ten euro trip, but the hotel wanted me to pay 120 euro for their driver to collect us. I consider that an insult when the total budget for the week was already close to ten thousand euro.6. Similarly, babysitting at 30 euro an hour plus 30 euros for taxi home is a rip-off: even the Biltmore in Miami which is a very expensive hotel, offers better value babysitting than that.7. Breakfast was very expensive and they didn't seem to offer any reduction for children: both Le Meridien and Four Seasons typically offer children much cheaper breakfast than 29 euro.So, we had a nice week but it could have been just that little bit better -- and when you book five star, you expect the best, not second best.
