{"text":"Way Overpriced! We stayed at this hotel from Thursday to Monday (President's Day) in February 2008, for a conference held on site. Unfortunately, our stay coincided with a national cheerleading competition, so there were loud girls running up and down the halls and clogging the lobby throughout our stay. Although this was not the hotel's fault, the hotel is so large (1800 rooms, 3 different towers) that if its filled to capacity, you will not enjoy a quiet stay whatsoever.Unfortunately, we were placed in a non-smoking, king-size room on the 16th floor of the North Tower. I say unfortunately, because this is the tower which hasn't been remodeled yet. However, after traveling all day from Buffalo, driving from the airport, waiting in line to check in with all the other guests, waiting for an elevator to the 16th floor, to discover we were in the old tower... we were just too exhausted to complain and move. We paid the convention rate of $160 a night for a small, Motel 6-grade room. The bed was adorned with your typical mid-80s flowery duvet, and the mattress itself was incredibly uncomfortable. Ugly carpets and drapes, old tv with a remote that hardly worked, you get the idea. However, there was a nice desk and a sink outside of the bathroom itself, which is always nice. We also received a complimentary USA Today each weekday.We were under the impression that we would have complimentary wireless internet in our room throughout the stay. However, on our second day, we realized that there was no wireless in the room, and only the option of an ethernet-type connection for $9.95 per day. Upon inquiry to the front desk, apparently only the new, renovated tower, the South Tower, has wireless, but they said we could sit in the lobby and access wireless if we needed to. Well, with all these cheerleaders running around, we were not about to do that, and just ended up paying the day rate. However, if I would have known this when I checked in, I would have definitely insisted on being placed in the South Tower. And when I finally visited a friend's room in the South Tower... the difference in comfort and style was ENORMOUS!The hotel features a casual restaurant that offers a buffet and menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and we ate their our first evening. It was decent food. There is also a lounge (where a friendly bartender lent us a corkscrew for a bottle of wine in our room) as well as a sports bar. The hotel also has an upscale restaurant, Chaparral, on the 38th floor of the Center Tower, but we didn't eat there at all since they were only serving a special Valentines Day special (ie $$$$$$$$$ for a small selection of food) throughout the weekend.Parking onsite is $12 a day with in and out privileges, and valet is also available. There wasn't much to see in the immediate area of downtown, at least without walking distance. So luckily we had rented a car to get around.As far as the conference itself, everything seemed... too confusing. Upon asking the front desk when the meeting started on Friday, they had no information and seemed to think our group didn't even exist! We met on the 37th floor of the center tower, which meant catching our elevator on the 16th floor, going to the lobby, and then walking to another elevator to get to the 37th floor. Very annoying. And then, our final banquet was actually across the street, and we had to walk through cheerleader practice to get there! I can't really blame the hotel, since it was probably the conference planners' fault, but nonetheless.... this hotel is very large and you will just be one of a crowd.Would I stay here again? No way. There are several hotels in the immediate area that I would try over returning to the Adam's Mark.
