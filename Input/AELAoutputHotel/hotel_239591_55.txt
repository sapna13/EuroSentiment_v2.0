{"text":"Nice hotel and location We stayed at this hotel from June 26th-29th. We arrived early and our room was ready for us to check in right away. The hotel room was a nice size, pleasant decor, nice wood floors and we also had a small balcony over looking the street that the hotel was on. There were two beds in our room, one double and a twin even although we did not need the second bed. The room and bathroom were always very clean and the rest of the hotel seemed to be as well. The staff seemed ok and were helpful when asked questions. The few times that we took a taxi they knew where the hotel was, so I guess we got lucky as I see others have had problems with that. The hotel was a very short walk to Las Ramblas, in walking distance to some of the major sites and easy access to the Placa de Catalunya where you can board the bus turistic. The beach (Barceloneta) on the other hand is a bit of a hike and we had to take a cab or the metro to Port Olympic because it was too far. All in all we were able to navigate nicely from the hotel.We are not able to comment on breakfast at the hotel b\/c we chose to eat out for breakfast. There is a nice little place just down from the hotel, at the end of the street (if you take a left out of the hotel) that has a standing bar and we really liked the food and coffee, the market is near by or there are plenty of other places to sit down or grab something to eat or some great coffee. The street and area of the hotel is a bit shady but we did not have any problems with anyone on the streets. I would be careful in the large dept. store there, there are a lot of thiefs roaming around. We were actually followed by a really bad one for quite a while. He was so obvious (it was pathetic actually)....so he did not end up being a problem for us as we were on to him from the start. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel or stay there again.
