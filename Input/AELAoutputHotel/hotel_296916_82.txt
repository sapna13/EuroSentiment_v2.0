{"text":"Another good choice from TripAdvisor Once again I have not gone wrong in picking a hotel that's in the top 4 or 5 on this site. Hotel Jazz was fine - certainly not the best or fanciest, but the location was excellent (very close to metro stop and walking distance to p. catalunya\/ramblas); clean rooms; room was certainly larger than some europe hotels I've been in; and very helpful and friendly night staff (note I stress night). The roof deck w\/ pool is very nice (just wish it was open later).The main complaint I have about this place is the stinginess with the toiletries. We had to practically beg for additional toilet paper and soap; the maid never left enough. The toilet paper was just slightly softer than sand paper and the soap was tiny and melted in 5 minutes. We resorted to using the bath gel as handsoap bc we never had enough to last. They also don't provide any moisturizer or hair conditioner, and only about 5 tissues per day in a tiny sealed package. Once we saw what the deal was with the toiletries, it made sense that this was only ranked a 3-star hotel. Luckily the maid left the cart unattended in the hall a few times so we stocked up. The breakfast is a rip off at 15 euros per person though the selection was fairly good - however, they kept running out of things the 2 times we went bc they use the buffet to assemble the room service orders!
