{"text":"Great hotel, good location, budget appropriate! My best friend  I met in Barcelona and booked this hotel for the whole stay (89 E. per night). We easily booked it right off the website. When you get off the plane, there's a bus right outside the airport (its a nice bus  it's only 4 Euros) to take you to Catalunya Square  from there its just a short walk to the hotel. Our room was on the 3rd floor, not big, but fine for us. The bathroom was clean, tub, shower, mini-wall hair dryer, etc. And, of course, the big bonus, a bottle of Cava awaited us in the mini-fridge! We drank it on the porch later that night. The only little gripe I had was the bars are open there until 5AM and those kids paarrrttyyy. We like to have a good time, too, but we are in our early '30's and it was just a bit too much. Honestly, we wish we would've gone to Seville or some smaller city in Spain where we could've really enjoyed the food  culture. Barcelona was a very international city, with different languages flying everywhere and it's a very 20-something party town (and $$$). But we still had a good time and this hotel rocked our needs and our budget. The next door cafe was perfect for our (free!) morning breakfast. One last note, don't eat on Las Ramblas!! They'll overcharge you so find the little places (in Born) to have Spanish fare. You all are lucky you have me to tell you what I wish someone told me! :) ","annotations":[]}
