{"text":"Just what we needed... Well, long story, I booked 2 weeks at the Bahia for me and my boyfriend. Situations changed, and I took one of my (girl) friends instead. We went from 4 Oct for 2 weeks. Booked with First Choice. Flight there we were sitting behind eachother directly next to toilets, not happy as i booked it a year in advance! Advice you to pay an extra √ä√£¬¢10 to sit togther, my friend is petrified of flying, made it worse!The hotel was wonderful, elegant, gave drinks on arrival, and a welcome dance (all very staged, but thoughtful all the same) amazing reception, you and luggage carted off to your accomodation. We were round the corner, block 12, next to first pool and garden grill restaurant. Take a spanish phrase book, as this will help, luckily I speak Spanish so we were fine. The weather was glorious, apart from 2 days and 2 evenings of torential thunderstorms, the works. ever night there are amazing lightening forks in the sky in October, even when it's pleasant.Buffet was great, went there most times for breakfast, lunch, dinner, as so much to choose from. Booked up at Garden Grill, this was ok, not good for my veggie friend though. We loved Japanese, they cook it in front of you. Did'nt think much of the Italian either, we just loved the buffets! There a few around, the one on the beach\/far pool is good for a snack in afternoon, paella there was yum. Beautiful beach, 10 minute brisk walk from our room, but regular trams to take you there. Yeah there's seaweed...but it's the sea funny enough, just float and don't tread in it, they did make an effort to clear it every morning. The shipwreck is a good photo opportunity! Pools were great, most days found loungers with brollies for shade. You need atleast factor 30 cream for the first week, even our eyelids and scalps burnt.We went on the Sanoa Island trip (amazing) the beach is gorgeous, like a postcard, so clear, our coach broke down in Higuey, a really poor part which was quite funny, got another one within 25 minutes. Horseriding at el pat ranch was the best, galloping along the beach, cannot beat it. Outback safari is a must to see how people live. If you take some packs of pens pencils, sweets, wait until you get higher into the mountains to reach the real poor children, or give them to the tour guide who will give them.The one night we were sick, was because we drank 7 tequila sunrises each one night and 6 mama juana (local drink) So it was totally self inflicted. tried to drink 2 litres of water a day. The rooms were spotless, had one teeny cockroach the last night, we did not tip the maid until the day we left, when we left her a nice little package, and the fridge was always stocked. The air con was freezing, we hardly ever had it on! coming from England, we like to feel the warm!Advise you take US dollars, Dominican pesos are so confusing, i still have no idea! Everything is priced in dollare anyway. the entertainment was bad apart from the Michael jackson tribute night, which was really good, and wait until the end for heal the world and it is hysterical.This is a very relaxing hotel, geared towards couples for sure. there's a wedding chapel, and we saw many weddings take place. We got hassled every where we went being two blonde 22 year old girls, the men do go on and on, which my friend did'nt like, but I have been to egypt\/Turkey, and it's much worse there. Don't come here if you want wild nights out, there's a disco, open midnight til 2 (hardly worth it) It's a place to be lazy, with a few action packed trips to stimulate you really. People want to do whatever they can to make you happy, which is the same in all of the all inclusive resorts I have visited around the world. I don't have a bad thing to say about the place. the only bad thing was the rep did'nt have a clue most of the time, and messed up a few of our trips.If you want to be pampered, relax, then I definately reccommend this resort, it is pretty big though, so if you don't like excercise don't go!
