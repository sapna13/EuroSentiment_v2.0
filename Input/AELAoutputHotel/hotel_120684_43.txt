{"text":"Great for a KB (kick-back) Hawaiian Trip! My family and I stayed here for ten days in early August 2008. The Outrigger has a lot of things going for it. First of all, I found all of the staff very friendly, from the check-in to the restaurants, shops, UPS store (forgot my wallet after I'd made copies and they were happy to wait for me to go get it, guess they didn't have a choice, but they were still very nice about it), the deli, and the pool towel guys. Oh, and the valets, very nice guys asking if you need directions, etc. The location is also awesome. If you are thinking about saving money here or off the beach, you can't beat this location. Splurge on the umbrella set-up. There are different choices and you get a discount as guest. There are also canoe rides and outrigger boats running all day. Don't know the prices but everyone seemed to be having a great time. The pool was fun and warm (just the way I like it!). It is quite deep so if you have very young children make sure they have floats. It starts at 3 feet, jumps to 4, then 8. There is also a nice-sized hot tub. I did not order drinks at the pool but there seemed to be plenty of servers so it didn't look like people were waiting long. I also found the food at the restaurants to be very good. The banana\/macadamia nut pancakes are great! Also, try the famous hula pie. I did not eat at Chuck's steakhouse, but my mother did and said it was very good. Prices are not cheap, but compared to many Hawaiian resorts, they will not require a second mortgage! I found them rather reasonable. The only complaint I'd have is the drinks were a little weak. Our room was a partial ocean view. It was clean and the closet space was great, one was more like a walk-in and the other was the typical sliding door. It had a sort of tub-shower, which was a small square tub or you could shower. Great for the kids. There was lots of counter space as well. The balcony was angled and small, though. Difficult to move around. As far as noise, you do hear flushing toilets, etc. but I've heard that in even nicer places so don't know how preventable it is. Overall, the hotel is fun and laid-back. I personally prefer more upscale when I travel, but sometimes a place like this can be just right, esp. if you don't want to be nickel and dimed by a 'high-end' resort. Oh, two other things that deserve mention, the hotel allows free long distance to anywhere in the US. I've never seen that before in a hotel. Also, when you order room service, the bill states 'tip already included'. Now how many hotels can say have the integrity to do that? Aloha, and happy travels.
