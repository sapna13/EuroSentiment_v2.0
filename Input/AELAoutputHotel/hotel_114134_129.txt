{"text":"Experience the Judy Garland Suite Arriving in Boston for a quick business meeting, I checked in to the Lenox rather late, after 9 p.m. The staff were mostly older gentlemen that time of night, which was odd... but the person at the front desk was young, pleasant, and accommodating.That time of the evening, they were completely booked. But because I had a reservation, the front desk person proceeded to upgrade my room to what the staff call the Judy Garland Suite. Apparently the Hollywood legend lived there for a month or so at one point in her turbulent life.The room didn't disappoint. Its walls were lined with stately wood, and a small but comfortable living room came attached (couch, ottoman, high-backed chairs, the works). The bathroom was richly appointed as well: large vanity, gold-plated fixtures, big shower. It was a blast from a more fashionable past, and positively oozed with history.The entire building is beautifully restored. My suite was cordoned off (with other suites of higher value, I'm assuming) by a separate set of doors in our own little wing. It only underscored the already palpable sense of VIP privacy and exclusivity.A quick call to the concierge got me an equally quick reservation at a nice restaurant that was open late, just a five-minute walk away.The hotel bar was also recommended for late-night snacking and drinking. I didn't opt to hang out there, although it looked modern and inviting.Overall, a quick, nice stay in the historic heart of Boston that was unique, convenient, and memorable.
