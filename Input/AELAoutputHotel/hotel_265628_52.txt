{"text":"Worth Every Penny ResortThe resort is beautiful to say the least, very big and easy to get around. Theres 20 + two-story villas, all around the resort. Some are closer to the lobby, but the one i was at was closer to the beach, which was perfect. The rooms were very well kept, and cleaned every day. The room i was staying in had a nice living room with a couch and a chair, a standard size bathroom, and a nice bedroom that accommodated two people very nicely.FoodThe food, in my opinion, was very good. I guess this category depends on how picky the person is. I'm not too picky, and i always found at least three or four dishes at the buffet that i liked. Remember to take a good look all around the buffet before you slap something on your plate. There was about 6 a la carte restaurants, and the ones that i went to were very nice. Recommend: Jade (Japanese) and La Cincetta (Italian)Animation Team\/ EntertainmentThese guys made the trip a blast. They are all very energetic, talented, friendly very funny, and they work so hard from the morning to late at night. Shout outs to Spaghetti, Eddie Murphy and Chico Rico. Every night these guys put on a show at night, got the crowd participating and rocked the show. Dancing, acting, singing and joking around.There was also a casino which was fun. We played a bit of slot machines and had fun. Drinks are included in the casino to those who are playing games. Definitely nice that there was a casino, it was nicely air conditioned and it was a good meeting spot for us at night.ActivitiesThe day activities were probably the things that made me enjoy my trip the most. I had the option of doing my activities with the hotel (expensive$$), or walking around the beach and seeing if anyone else offered those activities. I ended up getting lucky when i found a guy named RAMON who offered many activities for a much better price than the hotel. His prices were so much better that i planned the rest of my activities and excursions with him. So i definitely recommend that anybody who wants to save a little money on their excursions to go see PAUL AND RAMON. They are on the left side of the beach usually just hanging out there right by the little shops.Overall a great trip, would recommend it to everybody.
