{"text":"Superb Amazing hotel in a great location.This hotel should be 4 or 5 stars for the service and the quality of the room, and proves how flawed the whole star system can be as I have stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels which have been much worse than this one.Firstly the location is second to none. You are staying right on union square in prime central location. You are staying right next to all the most expensive hotels, and the most expensive shops and restaurants.To get there from the airport I would advise taking one of the shuttle buses which will cost only $14 plus tip, much cheaper than a taxi.The service throughout the hotel was excellent. The room was a good size, and it was located in a quiet area as I requested, although I thought the whole hotel was quiet.The hotel has wi-fi throughout, and if you do not have a computer you can check your emails on the computer in the lobby for free! The room had a nice size bathroom, which a good shower\/bath. There is a fan in the room, which I preferred compared to the air-conditioning systems found in most hotels which always give me a sore throat.There is also a television and a clock which can play your mp3 player through its speakers.As for San Francisco it is very nice. Would definitely advise booking Alcatraz as soon as you get there as it is always booked up during peak season for at least a day, so if you are only staying a couple of days book it before you go there, and if you are staying a week or so, then do it as soon as you get there.The tour bus, located in Fishman's Wharf is a good way of seeing the city (and is close to the place for buying Alcatraz tickets) so I would advise seeing Fisherman's Wharf, buying your Alcatraz tickets and doing some of the tours on the first day so that you have a good orientation on the city.Enjoy, ","annotations":[{"endOffset":920,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":916}]}
