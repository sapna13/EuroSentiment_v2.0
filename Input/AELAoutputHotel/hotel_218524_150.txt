{"text":"Almost Excellent! Oh, I so want to give the Excellence a 5-star review - but it fell just short in all areas. Let me start by addressing my main concerns, some of which have no bearing on the resort itself. First, the ride to the hotel. Yes, it is long - 1 hour and 10 minutes. Our driver on arrival should be nicknamed The Artful Dodger because he manuevered around the potholes and numerous scooters with artistry. Since we didn't opt for any excersions, we knew from reading previous reviews to treat this journery as our excersion. Sure, it is bumpy - but no bumpier than a New England back road. I had no problem at all with nausea and neither did anyone else on our tour bus. Try to finagle a front seat on the bus and you will be fine. On our return trip, just to test this theory, we sat in the back seat and it was much bumpier, but we were still fine. We actually ended up enjoying the ride! Secondly, the mosquitoes. I tend to be a blood donor for the local mosquito population at home in the summertime, so I was expecting the worst. I got a grand total of 3 bites! And half the time I forgot to put on the Deep Woods Off. Go figure. Thirdly, the weather. The Weather Channel outlook for the week had 80% chance of storms or showers each day, it looked pretty grim. In actuality, it rained for a total of about 2 hours during our 6 day stay. Ignore the weather forcasts, its a tropical climate and from time to time there's a storm or a shower. Lastly, I was worried from quite a few reviewers about getting ill from the food. My husband and I were both completely healthy the entire time, and didn't hear of anyone else who got sick either. Now on to the hotel. Our room was lovely, we had an Excellence Club Junior Suite Ocean View Swimout Room. The maid service was spotty, some days the room wasn't done until 4:00. We had broken glass in our slider door that took two days to replace. And the jacuzzi - the knobs on ours were broken (fell off in my hand when I turned on the water), and when the people upstairs used theirs it began to rain in our room. Now, on to the food. In most cases, really good - just not great. Beware of items not being what they are described on the menu. For example, in Spice, my Shrimp Tendon was described as Shrimp and vegetable tempura - but the only vegetables on the plate were the parsely garnish. This happened quite a few times and actually got to be a joke with us. We ate at all restaurants except the french one. We didn't like the Grill at all. We both ordered steaks and they are not char-grilled like we are accustomed to. It is a flat fry grill and they pour gravy on top of the steaks (to create flavor?). All other restaurants, breakfast, lunch and dinners were really good. Now on to the property. This place is a paradise! Take time to walk around and explore, especially the Eco Park (please feed the 3 baby ducks for me!). The bridges in this park are in need of repair, and watch out for the attack geese - my husband got bitten in the ankles! If you take the bike tour, it isn't much of a tour. The bikes need to be replaced, my husband's chain kept falling off. The guide takes you off the property, around the back of the resort to a horse ranch- where there's a gift shop (how convenient) you are escorted to. Same thing with the horseback ride (which is great), but at they end they try to sell you a fuzzy picture of yourself and a cigar for $35. No thanks. The Excellence Club is well worth it our our view. Robert is great! One last thing that disturbed me that I wasn't expecting. The alcohol flows very freely here. In the late afternoon people got quite loud (and in some cases obnoxious) in several pool areas. Funny at first, but after 6 days it gets old. I can't for the life of me figure out why you would spend this much money on a vacation and spend your time drinking yourself into oblivion. So, to sum this up - don't hesitate to go to Excellence, it is a wonderful vacation spot. We vacationed at another all-inclusive in Mexico that really was 5-star, and the Excellence falls just short of that.
