{"text":"relaxing and spotless resort We just returned from a week stay booked thru Apple vacations. Direct flight from Connecticut into Punta cana airport and approx 30' fast\/aggressive bus trip to our resort. We didn't check in on the bus but that sounds like a good option. We traveled with 2 kids (3 and 7 y\/o) and 5 adults.We have been to punta cana 3 other times in the past 7 years. 1st trip was to melia Caribe\/2 times at the old sunscape grand, now called Globalia. Melia caribe was large like bahia, sunscape was very small and more personal but the bahia was superior in its upkeep\/FOOD choices\/plenty of staff\/very efficent moving people around\/more places to walk around but still be on the property.My only complaint was that making la carte reservations wasn't very easy....it was easy if you wanted to eat at 930pm but no reservations were available at the italian the whole week and I made them the 1st morning there. But it didn't matter b\/c the buffett was excellent.We upgraded to the golden area b\/c of the proximity to the beach\/pool and that is were we spent 75% of our time, took the tram or short stoll to the main building for dinner and nite entertainment. Things are different in punta cana, it isn't las vegas\/or broadway so don't compare the entertainment\/casino's\/resturants to it. It is a relaxing and beautiful place to spend a week with people who serve you better than anywhere else and you can't beat the price. This resort is definately the best I have stayed in punta cana and would return to it or try one of its resorts in other locations. I would recommend going to dinners\/meals on the earlier side of when they begin serving b\/c the lines are better and the food is the freshest. we had Japanese 2 nites and both times it was great. No the show isn't as entertaining as in the states but the food is fresh and there are so many people taking care of you-the service is great. TIPPING is highly recommended, bring tons of singles and you won't complain of the service you recieve. We tipped each meal, they work hard to be sure you are taken care of, but relax and remember you are on vacation and the nicer you are to them the better you are treated by them.....RELAX and enjoy it is a beautiful place....The weather was perfect also.Some bug bites from mosquitos at nite, no creepy bugs on 1st floor, rooms big and nicely done. Don't leave sliders open\/no screens on doors. Have Fun. ","annotations":[]}
