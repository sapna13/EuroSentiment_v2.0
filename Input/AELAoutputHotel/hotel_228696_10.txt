{"text":"great service, lovely rooms I stayed here for a short 2 night business trip, and this hotel made it a pleasure. The quality of the decoration was good and the rooms were well designed with a lovely spacious bathroom, a powerful hot shower and a good sized bath - which I needed to soak my feet in after a hard day pounding the pavements of Paris! My standard room was a little on the small side - but in Paris I think that is usual. Nice flat screen TV's left more room on the dressing table. There are several different types of room, some old fashioned some modern. Mine was a lovely new modern room, didn't see what the traditional one's are like.Not sure that all rooms do, but my standard room had a balcony with a great view of the Eiffel Tower. The only thing I could pick fault with is that for a four star it had no spa, pool or gym so maybe that could put you off - but I was way to tired at the end of each day to think about that! I wouldn't normally stay in the Rive Gauche \/ Montparnasse area, I had though it was a bit too far from the main attractions. This is not so! Its very easy to get to the Louvre \/ Place de la Concorde etc without changing Metro lines, and you sure get a lot nicer hotel for your money in this area. Breakfast buffet was good; fruit, cheese, ham bread, croissants, pain au chocolat, etc as well scrambled eggs sausage and bacon. All in all my stay here was a pleasure - the staff deserve an extra mention as they were all pleasant and helpful anytime I requested any information or help.
