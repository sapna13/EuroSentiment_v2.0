{"text":"not my first time there, and not my last I love the Pulitzer and everytime I can get a good deal for it, I stay here when I travel to Amsterdam. It is a nice get-away from the tourists who come to Amsterdam only to indulge in the green, as they cannot afford it.Everytime, we get different rooms with different arrangements. This past time we were traveling with older relatives, and they were more than willing to accomodate their inability to deal with stairs, and gave them a room right near the elevators and recognizing that we were return guests, gave them a wonderful canal-view room... certainly made their trip a little more romantic. We kids did not get such a lovely room, but we still enjoyed it.The property provides a lovely place to meet with guests - we have family in the Netherlands. It is well located just a few steps from a tramline, a short walk to central areas, and some of our favorite restaurants. All the times that we have been there, we have yet to try the in-house restaurant. We do, however, love the cookies that you get in your room upon check-in. It is a race to the room to try to steal the other person's cookie each time, although the tolerant atmosphere of Amsterdam usually makes the winning party relent and share.As I mentioned before, it is nice to not smell the aroma of weed in the hotel, although some guests will go and enjoy the nightlife of Amsterdam and sleepily wander back to their rooms, but there have never been any problems with unruly, bothersome guests.This past time, we drove to Amsterdam, and parked our car with the hotel garage. We did not realize though, even though it is printed on the ticket, that it could take an hour to get the car! Eeek! Put a little delay in our return home, but just wanted to put it out there for those who really love sticking to a schedule.
