{"text":"Convenient Location, Large Room Shinjuku is convenient for shopping, nightlife, restaurants and access to all subway and rail lines, and the Keio Plaza is located on the other west side of Shinjuku approx. 4 blocks from the subway\/rail station. Not a problem because it's connected to the station with an underground passage that has a moving walkway and there are a lot of reasonable restaurants and diverse nightlife one block from the hotel. The hotel itself is huge, with over 1400 rooms, so don't expect personal service. The lobby is always crowded with tours and business groups but the rooms are larger sized with large windows and views of Tokyo from higher floors. The hotel has three types of rooms: newly-renovated in modern style in the main tower, deluxe in main tower, and superior\/standard in main and south towers. The deluxe rooms in the main tower are a little larger than the superior\/standard rooms but with dated furnishings. I preferred the superior rooms in the south tower that had better and more recent furnishings. Bathrooms are modern with Toto washlets. Windows in rooms don't open. Our reasonable rates included breakfast that is served in the tea lounge. Better than adequate western food buffet with cold and hot items, though it's not the regular breakfast buffet in hotel's buffet restaurant. One complaint about the hotel's decor is that it could be in any western city; there is nothing Japanese about it. Still, a good value in a very convenient location in Tokyo.
