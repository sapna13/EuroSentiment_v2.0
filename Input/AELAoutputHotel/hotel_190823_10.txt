{"text":"Added to a great stay in Barcelona Having finished a walking holiday around the Costa Brava coast, we decided to spend a few days in Barcelona as a complete contrast and the hotel offered was the Hotel Colon. It is in the most superb position, right opposite the Gothic Cathedral, which sadly is still covered in scaffolding, and within really easy walking distance of Las Ramblas, the Placa de Catalunya and the Palais de la Musica, to name but a few. The hotel offers old-world style and courtesy. We arrived early for checking - in, but were given a room immediately and without fuss. This was an inside room, (i.e. it didn't have a view of the square and cathedral), but it was well-furnished, quite stylish, comfortable, spotlessly clean and very quiet. Throughout our stay, the reception staff and doormen were unfailingly polite and helpful, particularly those on the desk in the evening. Breakfast was excellent, with an extensive array of food to choose from and professional, unobtrusive service. We didn't dine here as there are too many exciting tapas bars and restaurants on offer in town, but we did have a drink in the bar which, although a little stuffy in atmosphere, had very pleasant bar staff to compensate, and we also made use of the outside tables, which are great for people watching and just sitting with a drink listening to the music drifting across from the cathedral steps, where talented buskers were performing. We loved Barcelona and will most definitely return. When we do so, we shall very happily stay at the Colon.
