{"text":"Affordable but far from city center i paid $60 USD per night for a 3-night stay (with double beds) in Dec 2008. the hotels.com price included breakfast.the price was fair given the location and acceptability of cleanliness. if the price was higher, then i wouldn't stay here.the hotel is surrounded by nothing. it's a far walk to la rambla, especially in the cold. however, it's literally right next to the parell-el metro station, so you can take the subway anywhere you want since there is really nothing to do in the area.the reception speaks english. it's hit or miss with the personnel in terms of helpfulness. be careful with the city bus tour package they sell to you. there's 2 bus services in barcelona, and the hotel sold us the one that's not that popular. i suggest going to the Colon area (10 minute walk towards La Rambla) and buy it from the company named Bus Turisto. they are better because they have a variety of routes and frequent stops whereas the one the hotel sells you is the one that takes one large circle around the city.also be careful with what kind of rates the receptionist tells you. he told me the telephone usage rate in the hotel room was very cheap. well, when i checked out, the cost was 3 euro a minute! public pay phones only cost 1 euro for 100 seconds! also, the receptionist told me that a taxi to the airport would cost 25 euro. he called one for me and i later got billed 45 euro when i got dropped off at the airport. i knew something was fishy when the taxi driver gave some money to the receptionist when the taxi driver picked me up from the hotel.........
