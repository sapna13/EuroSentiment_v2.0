{"text":"A convenient location in 'real' Venice Venice is expensive, teeming with tourists and touts of one kind or another. So the real benefits of this hotel are:-a peaceful, colourful, location on the Canal di Cannaregio (one of the old ways into the city) where you see real Venetian life around you - mothers taking children to school by boat, delivery barges plying the water, old ladies with cats leaning out of balconied windows. The local restaurants have local customers, and the small grocery shops are also for residents so don't have 'tourist tat'. an easy travel distance from the station and airport - not to be underestimated in a city of small canals\/streets and many bridges, where a water-taxi is ludicrously expensive. It is a short walk from the Guglie water-bus stop, where one of the special airport water-boat also stops (12 Euros per person each way, but the easy and comfort are worth it). a friendly, family run hotel where you feel at home with the thoughtful\/friendly little touches. It has beautiful traditional Venetian decoration, clean marble bathrooms, and modern conveniences - safe, air conditioning, TV (not flat screen), fridge. When warm, breakfast is taken on the canal side - a nice feature. the sites of Venice can all be walked too quite easily if you are able-bodied; but the best thing to do is to buy a water-bus travel pass and jump on and off at will - useful if you need to cross to other islands or want to explore the outer islands of Venice. Two other stops besides Guglie are very close by, and another two only a short walk away. The hotel is practically next to the historic and evocative Jewish Ghetto - one of the few havens for Jews in Europe since the 14th century - at a price. The things you may not like:-Only a low level shower attachment on the wall over the bath - so take some aromatic bath oils and have a wonderful long soak after a hot day site seeing instead. TV is small and some people may not like the fact it is not flat screen. But you can spend the whole evening sitting in one of the small restaurants only a stones throw away - watching the Venetians and tourists parade out in the evening cool as the sun goes down. (Obviously different when the weather is chilly.) Breakfast is 'continental' and may not be enough if you are used to big breakfasts. But if you do want another croissant or more coffee (very good) just ask. That is the advantage of the hotel being family fun. We were extremely happy with this hotel and would definitely return.
