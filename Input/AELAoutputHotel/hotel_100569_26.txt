{"text":"Very charming. Old world style This is a very endearing hotel with old world charm. The staff is friendly and accommodating and personable. After one day, we were greeted by name upon returning to the hotel. The service deserves top ratings. We booked a suite and the living space was very spacious. We had two queen beds and both were comfortable - they have a pillow menu and several types to choose from and although we couldn't distinguish which was which we all found something comfortable. We had no view but that was okay. If you like modern and contemporary this is not the hotel for you but if you enjoy old world luxury and style you will love this property. The room has a great audio system and was equipped with a fax and copy machine. There was also a little bar area with a french press coffee maker and fresh ground coffee - nice touch!The air conditioning worked well but had a little rattle. They have a wonderful afternoon tea served in a clubby sitting room atmosphere with a fireplace, cushy seating and dark wood. We also had an enjoyable breakfast outside on the patio (Hunt Club), which was delicious. The location (on First Hill) was definitely residential in nature and the walking access to downtown was fine although very steep - I am not sure I would make this walk alone. If you plan to spend a lot of time down by the Public Market I would stay somewhere else. The work out area was unexpectedly good with windows to the street and decent aerobic and weight equipment. Two members of our group adored this hotel and wished we could have stayed longer. We also wished we had been able to have a drink in the Hunt club. Next time!
