{"text":"how not to make a gin and tonic The exterior of the hotel is shabby and the hotels shuttle bus that picked us up from the airport is equally tatty. The reception staff were cool - not particularly welcoming and the porter quite off hand. When we arrived in our room there were workers in the room next door banging away. After some while of this we asked if they could stop as we were desperate for a sleep as we were on our way to the UK from Australia and facing a 13 and a half hour flight next day. Despite three requests they did not stop banging. Admittedly they did eventually offer us an alternative room but by then we had unpacked and really did not want to move. There was no chance of rest. We decided to go out for dinner at 7pm they were still banging when we got back at nine. Despite having an executive room the facilities were poor - one tiny bottle of shampoo, horrible coffee and creamer instead of milk for tea making. The TV did not have the channels the manual claimed it to haveThe pool on the eighth floor looked inviting and it was but the spa didn't work. We made the mistake of going to the bar for a drink - Gin and tonic with flat tonic, no lemon and one ice cube which took ages to arrive. The breakfast was awful. Despite asking for the apple juice jug to be replenished it never was, the orange juice was from concentrate, there was white bread only for toast, some of the plates and dishes were still dirty. No way would I recommend this hotel ","annotations":[{"endOffset":895,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":889},{"endOffset":895,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":889},{"endOffset":931,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":928},{"endOffset":1377,"mention":"white bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1366},{"endOffset":1377,"mention":"white bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1366},{"endOffset":1392,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1387}]}
