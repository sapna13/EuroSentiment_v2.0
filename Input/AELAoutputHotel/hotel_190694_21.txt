{"text":"A historic hotel that's unfortunately known for Michael Jackson Stayed here for business for 4 nights in January of 2008. Definitely a five star hotel for European standards. Room was nice although again the typical European queen bed means two twins pushed together. The actual size of the room was much larger than other European hotels I have stayed in. Bathroom was interesting because the actual toilet had two doors leading to it in a small room with a mirror facing you if you sit on the toilet. Rest of bathroom (shower, bath and 2 sinks) was connected to one door and was large. Had three English speaking channels (CNN, BBC and CNBC Europe) although did not spend much time in room. The hotel is in a great location if you plan on exploring the city. Unter den Linden S-Bahn stop and the Brandenburg Gate are literally right in front of hotel. If you get a room on the Northwest corner of the hotel you may actually get an amazing view of the Brandenburg Gate from your hotel room. The Jewish holocaust memorial is right outside the rear of the hotel. Also, the Reichstag, parts of the wall, Checkpoint Charlie and the Potsdamer Platz area are all within 10-15 minute walk of hotel. Didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat in the hotel, I think breakfast was $36 euros. There is a Starbucks and Hagen Daz right across the street from the front of the hotel and a Dunkin Donuts right outside the rear of the hotel. There are also several restaurants within a 10 minute walk from the rear of the whole to the Potsdamer Platz area.  Nice pool and spa facilities however I found the gym to be lacking for a five star hotel. The gym was tiny with 2 treadmills, a bike, elliptical, rowing machine and a few free weight dumbbells. However, if the weather is nice you can make an easy run through Tiegarten Park which is right next door to the hotel. Overall, a great place to stay for business although I think it would be a little out of my price range if I had to stay for personal travel. Unfortunately, the hotel is mostly known for Michael Jackson hanging his baby out the window.
