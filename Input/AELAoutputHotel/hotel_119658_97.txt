{"text":"It's all you really need... First, what Castle Inn is not...Castle Inn is not the Ritz. Do not expect to be pampered or receive room service. However, if you want a decent hotel at a very reasonable price, then Castle Inn is the place. It's closer to a Red Roof Inn\/Motel 6 but is WELL WORTH the price. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat and suggest it to anyone wanting to stay in SF.Pros: Great location in the interesting and safe neighborhood of Russian Hill, about 2 blocks from different 3 bus lines (get used to taking the bus...they're safe and convenient), about 1-2 blocks from restaurants and boutiques, not a lot of hills in this area, free parking (HUGE benefit), microwave and fridge in the room, clean, excellent service via internet liason (Varsa), helpful front office (Marshall), and the City tour we booked through Varsa and Tower Tours was well worth the price.Cons: Parking (although free) is a little tight...but so is the rest of San Francisco, our king bed was pretty uncomfortable...my shoulder hurt and my wife's back hurt after a couple of nights, we had some noisy neighbors above us one night around midnight and it took the front office a little while to respond to it. All in all, no major problems with Castle Inn. One negative thing to keep in mind about San Francisco: it is very expensive. Expect to pay $40-$50 for a tasty, but otherwise average meal. (I don't care what Zagat or other restaurant guides say...expect to pay more)Gas was $3.70\/gallon. It won't be a cheap trip...but it is totally worth it.We had a great experience at Castle Inn. I shopped around quite a bit before booking my room and I honestly feel that this is the best value in the City. Other discount hotels charge anywhere from $10-30 a day for parking, so factor that in before choosing. Also other discount hotels that I looked at booking a room are in semi-rough neighborhoods. Castle Inn is in a very residential area (which I really enjoyed) but is just a 5 or 10 minute bus ride to almost anywhere in the city. Also, I really can't say enough nice things about Varsa (internet liason). She was very helpful and answered even the most mundane questions I had about the city. She's a real San Francisco ambassador. I give Castle Inn a 4 out of 5 and a hearty recommendation.
