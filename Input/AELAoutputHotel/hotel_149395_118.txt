{"text":"It was a Great Xmas Present fr my Husband! We booked the royal service with the butler. Was it worth the extra money, absolutely. We were checked in right away and the champagne, was flowing. My husband booked a garden view room and we lucked out into a ocean front room with a wonderful view of the beach. The grounds were beautiful and well kept. Three pools on the grounds, one was just for royal service, so it was semi private, same on the beach, there was a area with tiki huts and beds. All very nice. The water was a beautiful blue, and we never got tired of looking at it. Now, with the restaurants. There was 12 to pick from. There is something for everyone. Venti, (mediterranean) was awesome, we went there twice. The french, was good, but the portions were too small and we hit the buffet, on our way back to our room. The Steak house, the food was O.K. but the service Sucked big time, compared with the other restaurants. The lunch buffet was good, right on the beach. Great wines, and their house champagne was very nice too. On the whole, all the restaurants were fine, some better than others.. Make your dinner reservations for each night, as soon as possible.  Word of warning, they are a tad pushy with looking at their timeshares. They say it's a hr. of your time, but it was more like 2. We did get a $100. credit, out of the deal and a free room in the future, to use on their slow times, . My hubby used the credit for a massage. The time shares were very expensive in my eyes, I have two kids to put thru college, so we won't be buying one anytime in the near future. My husband gave this to me for Xmas and it was a great wk. to just relax, eat, drink and lay on the beach. Who could ask for anything more. Not me, But, I am asking for this same exact present for 2010, already have a cruise planned for 09.
