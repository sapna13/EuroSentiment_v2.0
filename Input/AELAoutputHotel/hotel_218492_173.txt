{"text":"The Honest Truth About Grand Oasis .. My family and I stayed at the Grand Oasis just recently, February 24th - March 2nd 2008 . We enjoyed our stay here but there is still some things this hotel can improve on. Here is the honest truth about the main components at the Grand Oasis.Beach: It was probably the nicest beach I have ever seen. The water was clear and turquiose and was just amazing. Loved the beach and so did my family.Pool: The pool was alright. It had a swimup bar, but it was always packed there.. however a few times it cleared up. The pool was pretty big. I might add that they have two lazy rivers, one on each side of the resort. They also have an adults pool with a jacuzzi.. these were all nice and refreshing. Service: The service was actually very good. We usually got our food and served right away so again there was no problems here.Food: Wow pretty much describes it. The food was very good. They had a main buffet resteraunt called Windows that offered an assortment of food. I always found something to eat. We also ate at the three a la carte resteraunts.- American Grill - Was pretty good. It is mainly mexican food. The service was excellent.- Italien Resteraunt - Was my familys favourite. The resteraunt was really elegant and nice, and the food was amazing! Great service as well.- Seafood Resteraunt - Was slightly disappointed. They didnt have much on their menu, but the food was still very good. the service wasnt the greatest either.BREAKFAST OPTIONS: you could either go to Windows buffet or down by the beach they have another buffet.LUNCH OPTIONS: Windows Buffet, buffet down by beach, the grill on the beach.SUPPER OPTIONS: Windows Buffet, Italian Resteraunt (reservations required), Seafood Resteraunt (reservations required), American Grill (reservations required).Rooms: When my family goes on vacation, we don't really care about the look of the room. Our rooms were alright. Nothing too fabulous. Me and my brothers shared a room and my parents shared a room right next door, Our rooms were in the 1st building, numbers 1206 and 1208. My parents had more problems with their room than we did with our though. It wasn't a big deal with the rooms so if you dont really care either, dont worry.Check-In and Check-out - the check-in took a long time since we arrived with a bus load of people. But once we got to the front it went quick. We also had to wait a bit for the bell boys to take our luggage over. The check-out was quick and easy, we got there early to do so.TIPS: - do not keep your cards for your room with cellphones, cameras, anything that might act like a magnet because it will cause the card not to work. I think i went up to the front desk three times before I figured this out.- do NOT buy packages with tutti frutti tours or any person who claims to work with another company that is on the beach. They rip you off and take your money. You will know the difference between the people who actually work at the hotel and those that dont. - the vendors near the lobby can be very annoying, so if they ask you to go over just make up an excuse to go. (i often said I have to go eat! or something like that). - if you are looking for vendors (me and my family were) dont even bother heading down the left side of of the beach. To finally get to the vendors is about a 2 hour and 30 minute walk one way. Go on the right side, their is some vendors about 5 minutes away. Also their is vendors who came to the resort on the Tuesday and Thursday when we stayed.- the a la carte resteraunts require a reservation, to make one go to the lobby and there is a guy on a computer to the left. just talk to him there.Overall, I would recommend this resort for people who want a nice beach, and great food as well as a good pool. I hope this helped you somewhat.
