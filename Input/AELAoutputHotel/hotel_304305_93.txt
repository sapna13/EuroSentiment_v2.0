{"text":"Great location\/good value My son and I stayed here for nine nights total. We were quite happy with the service upon check-in, front desk and bellpersons spoke excellent English and were very gracious. The common areas in the hotel are elegant and clean.The first three nights were in the main tower, where the room was dated, but quite large. The bathroom had been redone and we had a nice view of the city. Provided in the bathroom were a razor, toothbrushes, hair scrunchy and elastic band, cotton swabs, shower cap, shiseido bar soap, foaming face and hand soap, liquid bath soap, shampoo and conditioner, making me wish I had left most of my personal care stuff back home and left more room in my suitcase. Surprisingly, there was no lotion provided. The bell desk happily stored our larger pieces of luggage while we left for three days to Kyoto. Upon our return, we stayed in the south tower. The room was smaller but the furniture more current than in the first room - bathroom once again had been updated and was immaculate. There were instant hot water dispensers and green tea and teacups available in the rooms. Both rooms also had a sitting area where we could have meals and look out at the view. Several times during our stay, we bought food in the nearby department store basement food halls or the nearby Shinjuku station restaurants and bakeries and ate in our room after long days schlepping around Tokyo. I would recommend joining the hotel's Executive International Club for the free breakfasts as the restaurants are quite pricey. The Glass Court breakfast buffet ran around $25 pp for a choice of Japanese or Western style foods. There was quite a variety there. The Korean restaurant was excellent, and my son enjoyed cooking his tender short ribs at the table. As noted before, the convenience store in the lower lobby is very reasonably priced and offers a variety of bentos, noodles, rice balls, baked goods, liquor, etc. The hotel location is very convenient to Shinjuku station as well as to several great department stores. It rained a lot of the time that we were there so we took the covered walkway to the station most of the time. We took the Yamanote line and transferred from it for most of our expeditions.We took the Airport Limousine Bus to and from the Keio Plaza from Narita Airport and can vouch for its convenience. I agree with previous posts regarding the lack of weight equipment in the workout room. I also agree that the free LAN is a nice feature.The only negative experience at the hotel was with our one attempt to get information from the guest relations desk. The woman we spoke with was quite snippy with us, so from then on I just got on the internet in our room for any further Japan information. I observed other guest relations employees being quite pleasant and helpful with other guests so it was just the luck of the draw for us.We booked our room through JTB and got a reasonable rate. This room was a lot lower-priced than I expected in Japan. We have paid much more for comparable rooms in the U.S. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":389,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":385},{"endOffset":1086,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1083},{"endOffset":1490,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1486}]}
