{"text":"Wow! Its big. Just got back from this wonderful resort, Nov. 1-4. I was surprised to see it listed as a 4star, was sure it was a 5 star and mentioned to everyone that it was beyond that. Food: Was great everywhere. Make reservations at the restaurants as soon as you get there. We had a party of 12 and we never had a problem. The breakfast buffet can not be missed it is awesome and the best I ever had. The beach lunch buffet I would pass on and take the tram to the, what I call, restaurant row and eat there instead. Coffee was excellent everyday! Lobby bar was packed every night, drinks are good, free black jack, the attire was dressy at night. Bottled water everywhere. Ask for the 151 rum, you might get an out of body experince like I did at the beach.Pool\/Beach: Ususal carribean blue water, kind of cold, not too much seaweed. Lots of chairs on the beach, pool got alittle crowded, swim up bar was always crowded. Spa: Very nice. Alittle secret for ya, there are two indoor jucuzzi's opened to the public, you have to walk through the spa to get to it and it is not advertised anywhere, we found it by accident. I also booked a spa special with 2 free massages, when I went to redeem it they did not have any idea what I was talking about, I had to remedy it with guest services the next morning. I was not happy about that.Staff: They are everywhere and super friendly. They will speak english if you start it first but come on, you are in a spanish speaking country everyone in the world knows how to say Hola and Grasias, if not start there.Notes: Don't bother leaving the resort, the outside is scarry without a local. We went into town and there were armed guards at the shopping center with rifles. Yikes, thank god we were with family that were DR locals. The outside streets are very scary, no lines and not maintained. The business center has good computers and the onine rate is cheap. Casino is small, no REAL poker tables. Get a phone card because calling is expensive. Complaints: Just one, the resort is soooo large that you have to ride a tram to the beach and pool, we were next to the restaurants and one of the lobby's. But when I was in a real hurry I just flagged one of the passing golf carts, they always stopped and said yes to wherever I was going.Any free gift means listening to the 90 minute timeshare speech, don't fall for it.I highly recommend it! Have a great time!
