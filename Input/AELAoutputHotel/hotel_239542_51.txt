{"text":"Hotel Cram - Wonderful! When I lived in Barcelona I walked passed this hotel and thought the bar area looked really cool... but living there it would have been silly to pay for a hotel and I never really went back.After moving back to the UK and wanting to plan a visit back to Barclona I decided to check-out Hotel Cram and it was wonderful.The design was great, staff were extreely helpful and friendly - allowing us to check-in early have a free coffee and looking after our bags after we'd checked-out. The rooms are great, they are very cool with a great layout, great lighting systems and the most wonderful bathroom.. the shower is great!Also good (may sound silly) is that the curtains are very dark and don't allow the sun in, so when you want that lay-in you aren't getting woken up by the sun! This is great when you've had a big night out!I liked that they had books on Barcelona in the rooms and you could buy everything, like the phone, dressing gown, slippers (think they should have been free as surely they'll only throw them away!?), ashtray etc etc. they were all expensive though!They don't make enough of the fact they have won design awards for the hotel, or that they have an outside on the 7th floor where you can eat and drink, or sunbathe on loungers and have a swim in the pool. The only negative is the price of drinks... √ä√£¬¢3 for a coke and √ä√£¬¢7 for a coke+spirit seemed a little steep.I would definately recommend staying at the Hotel Cram and I will go back there for sure!
