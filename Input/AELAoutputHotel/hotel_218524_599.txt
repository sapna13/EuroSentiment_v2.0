{"text":"Anybody that thinks this is a 5 star place must give Motel 6's 4 stars This review wasn't just my opinion but at least 2 other couples we spoke to while we were there. The BAD:To start our own travel agent said you'll never go back to Sandals after staying here. Well she will also be getting an ear full today. After arriving at 4pm (check in is at 3) we had to wait 1 hour and 15 min for our room....while everyone else got there's. The rooms are nice size. Day 2 - No power and water for 2 hours.Day3- No water for 6 hours.....gross, no one could wash hands,flush tiolets etc. In fact people were using the hotel lobby bathrooms because the help were flushing the tiolets with the water out of the fish pond. Day4 No power and water in the morning.I understand things happen..... during the day3 incedent I said something to the front desk.....I got sorry at least 200 times but I let it go. The front desk person caught me a little while later and said sir we have water again....on that bit of good news I ran to the room to enjoy a shower....but...still no water. Went back down to the desk and was told sorry at least another 200 times. I could get into many more details of this vacation but im really only hitting the highlights.....this place isn't worth the price.The food was fair at best......if you got it, the one night we waited 1 and 1\/2 hours for dinner, only to wait another 1 and 1\/2 hours to be served my wife the wrong food and I only got half of my order.The GOOD: Very well maintained and beautiful groundsThe WORST: The place was only about half full when we arrived on a Thursday. Apperently every other hotel is over booked.......they end up sending there guests to the Excellence.Here how this went down....Italked to 2 couples and both went threw the same thing. There hotel stay was $200 a night, while the excellence is like $300 a night. Since there hotel was overbooked, there hotel refunded $200 a night. Since there vacation was for 6 nights they got $1200 in cash. At the same time there hotel puts them up (pays) for them to stay at the Excellence.....Basically they paid for airfare and got to stay at a better hotel than they booked. These people made up the other half of the hotel...which inturn fills the Excellence to capacity. Now They get a free vacation, while I paid full fare plus I have to wait in longer lines at all the meals, never get a decent spot at the pool or beach. This was just the icing on the cake. To Sum It Up: Stay at a lower class hotel that is closer to the airport (less travel time wasted) because it isn't that much lower class than the Excellence and if your lucky they will be overbooked and you will get your vacation paid for while still staying at the Excellence. Either way don't book a trip there, your just throwing your money down the tiolet (i'm sure it will be working then)PS. I cant wait to go back to Sandals (any location) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":453,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":449},{"endOffset":2459,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":2455}]}
