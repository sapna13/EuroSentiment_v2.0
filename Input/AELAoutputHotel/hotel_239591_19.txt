{"text":"Good value We booked a room for two adults and our 12 year old daughter. We were in room 421 which was very spacious and looked over the street. It looked like a bigger and nicer room than many of the others I saw open. After a month of staying in 3 star hotels in Europe, we found this one the most luxurious and best value. Definitly more like a 4 star.There was a tv, tea  coffee facilities, lovely big bathroom with some toiletries provided. The beds were comfortable. Everything looked very new and clean, with very pleasant decor. The reception staff spoke English and were very helpful. The full buffet breakfast was very nice, as was the dining room. There were also laptops and internet to use free of charge. The hotel was very central - just off the middle of the famous La Ramblas street that everyone visits, and close to lots of shops and restaurants. I had been a bit concerned before we went that some people thought the area was seedy, but it did not seem any different to other back streets in central Barcelona. We were happy with it as it was great to be so central. It was also very easy and cheap to get there from the airport - we caught the airport bus from just outside the airport (4 euros each) to the last stop in town, then walked for 10 minutes down La Ramblas to the hotel street. I would also recommend the Bus turistic open top double decker, hop on hop off, bus for seeing the whole city easily and at your own pace. It is also very easy to catch a train for half an hour to the seaside resort of Sitges. We had a lovely stay at Hotel Principal and loved the beautiful city of Barcelona.
