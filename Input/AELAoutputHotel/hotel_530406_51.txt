{"text":"Thinking of a Honeymoon or Special Trip, Think Again! This trip was without a doubt an absolute disaster and we will never ever darken the doors of this establishment again.We were booked to stay from the 24th April Until the 9th May but actually had to ask our rep to fly us home a week early.the food is disgusting unless you like all your food deep fried and swimming in grease. The only place to eat that didnt make us sick was the Beach Grill, but this is only open during the day and was closed in the evenings.Hotel guest services should be renamed, Hotel Guest Ignored unless youre American and flashing your $$$If you want to see a Good Evening Show dont bother its 1 hour long max and the warm up act is tiresome after the 3rd time of seeing the same routine.there is no communication between the staff, we were moved to four different rooms on our day of arrival. we were supposed to be on our honeymoon the holiday of a lifetime and a chance for us both to really kick back and relax. the hotel management made our stay so stressfull we had no choice but to leave a week early. something i've never had to do on a holiday before.The general staff are friendly and about 50% bilingual or better but a smattering of Spanish will get you a lot more.Room cleanliness varied over the stay, some of the maids did a lovely job and others barely made the bed let alone cleaned anywhere.If you dont like coffee take tea bags, the local ones aren't very nice and Mike's coffee shop insist on making tea with hot milk!Best place to spend your evening is in the Casino if youre any good then take full advantage and clean up on the blackjack tables.
