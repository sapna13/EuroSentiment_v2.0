{"text":"My two cents I feel obligated to write a review since TripAdvisor was helpful in determining my vacation plans. The resort is beautiful and the grounds immaculate. The beach was gorgeous and among the cleanest I have seen. The resort in general was so clean and well-kept- it was impressive. Do try to get a room on the top floor of the villas as they are all tile and sound tends to reverberate throughout...we started out on the first floor and moved to the third floor which was much quieter. There is a lot of walking- if you do not like to walk, go elsewhere. The food was good- We had a few meals that were just OK- but nothing inedible. The buffet was great- a LOT of variety; the Japanese and Le Gourmet ala cartes were both quite good- Dominican and Mexican just OK. I would recommend avoiding beef in general- it was tough everywhere we tried it. The staff was for the most part great- if you find a few people who are extra helpful- remember their names and go back to them for help throughout your trip and tip them accordingly. A few US$ go a LONG way and a little effort at speaking Spanish is also helpful. Remember that you are in the Caribbean and things move a little more slowly- get used to it and try to enjoy a more relaxing pace! Aldo and Caesarin at the front desk were very helpful to us. The shows were not a big draw- if you are looking for top-notch nightly entertainment- look elsewhere. The other guests were mostly Canadian and South American- many kids (although we went during Spring Break) and not many singles- if you are looking for a great singles scene or a quiet romantic getaway- look elsewhere. In general, I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the resort was after reading a couple of negative reviews and fearing the worst! ","annotations":[]}
