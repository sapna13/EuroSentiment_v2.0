{"text":"A home from home! Simpsons Hotel is a home from home! We booked a 2 night stay at Simpsons Hotel after reading about it here on Trip Advisor. No wonder it is voted best place to stay in Sydney! It is a gorgeous little boutique hotel. It really feels like you are staying with a rich friend! We stayed in a dormer room which was very spacious and beautifully decorated. The bed was extremely comfortable and there were all the amenities you would need including an iron  ironing board! Breakfast was included in our stay and it was delicious! Such a variety ranging from muffins and crumpets, to stewed fruit, yoghurt and muesli. The manager, Vanessa was extremely helpful, suggesting places nearby to eat and the best ways of walking to the harbour etc. Nothing was too much trouble.There is a lovely communal lounge at the hotel where we sat both nights after dinner by the warm fire enjoying the complimentary sherry and port! There is also free internet in the lounge and lots of reading material including lonely planet guides to Sydney.On our first morning we walked through the botanical gardens to the Harbour √à√\u2020\u2022?this is a lovely walk and only took about 25 minutes. Potts Point is a great location as there are loads of restaurants and lovely boutiques in the area. Be careful of the Sydney taxi drivers however. We paid $22 for a trip to Darling Harbour and were only charged $11 for the same trip on the way back later that night! It also only cost around $10 to get a cab to the Harbour so don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ let the fact you are not in the hustle and bustle put you off staying at this wonderful hotel. It is exceptionally good value for money. We looked at many other hotels in the CBD to stay but the prices are astronomical. You get great value for money at Simpsons Hotel and a friendly personable service. Vanessa really makes you feel at home during your stay √à√\u2020\u2022?a service you would not receive at a big hotel.We will definitely be staying at Simpsons Hotel again the next time we are in Sydney and have recommended it to family and friends. Thank you Vanessa for a wonderful stay!
