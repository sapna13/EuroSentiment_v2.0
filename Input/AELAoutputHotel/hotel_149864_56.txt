{"text":"Exceeded all our expectations Before we went to Club Med Punta Cana, I read about 200 reviews. I didn't know what to think. Now, after spending 10 days there, I can tell you it was absolutely worth the money and the travel time. We had a wonderful time and would go back in a minute. The kids program was unbelievable. Our eight year old son was gone everyday from 9 am until we made him come back to the room with us at 9 at night. The GO's were fun and very responsible about the kids. I really can't say enough about them. This allowed us, the parents, to lounge by the pool or grab a chair on the beach without any cares or worries. After being there, I think if you want to have a wonderful time you have to have the right expectations. If you want a five star resort that caters to you in English, this isn't the place for you. The rooms are very clean, but plain. We didn't care, we used the room to sleep in and change our clothes. The food was very good, but it isn't a fancy restaurant. We had fun sitting with other people and met several that we are still in contact with. If you want to sit alone, they will accomodate you. We always found someone that spoke English. I did the water aerobics and they were in french but the instructor demonstrated each exercise so it didn't matter what language it was in. I had a blast each day. There is so much to do and so many choices there, I can't believe someone could not have a great time. The grounds were kept in impeccable condition, the staff friendly and accomodating, delicious food, wonderful weather, beautiful beach, fun activities and a top notch kids program. We loved Club Med in Punta Cana. Go and enjoy it. But, take lots of suntan lotion - we went through about a can a day.
