{"text":"This place is suspect Myself , wife, daughter and friend just returned from a week at this hotel. I should start by saying that we got less than what we expected. I should give kudos to Apple Vacation personnel, who were very helpful. However, I am not sure where to begin. We got to the room to find it very small for two adults and two pre-teens. The mattresses were like slabs of stone, the shower did not work and the toilet ran constantly. The buffet was set up primarily to appease European tastes. So if you are a person who has a limited culinary tolerance, bring snack food with you. The only air conditioning in the place is in your room, so if you have low tolerance for heat and humidity while outside your room beware. Also note that there is no food available at the pool, and the drinks at this resort are exclusively self serve. There are no roaming waitstaff for drink orders. Speaking of drinks, if you are used to top shelfliquor you will be sorely disappointed. They have very little liquor that is recognizable to most Americans. A working knowledge of Spanish would be a plus since very few people speak English. The shows put on by the Animacion crew are repetative and amatuerish. The specialty restaraunts are also not worth making reservations for. Overall, this hotel is a 2.5 star. Took a tour that was nice, the DR is pretty but we would never go to this propety again. The chief problem is that we usually stay at Secrets properties and this hotel is not even in the same ballpark. ","annotations":[]}
