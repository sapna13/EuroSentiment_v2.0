{"text":"Absolutely brilliant choice Hotel Perseo Of the 6 hotels I had stayed in various cities during my 14-day trip in Italy, this has to be the best.The hotel is located right in the centre of activities, conveniently located near to the Duomo, central railway station and bus routes. Most of the tourist sites\/museums are within walking distance.The rooms look new and recently refurbished, with tasteful furnishings and a homely feel. I especially liked the bathroom which is of sufficient size. The facility of free broadband internet connection for room guests with laptops is the cream of the cake. If you do not have a laptop, there is an internet station near the reception where you can use for free.The staff have been extremely friendly and helpful in providing info on tours in Florence, train timetable, where to dine etc. The husbandwife owner are equally warm and friendly. They must have treated their staff well for them to be so motivated and into the job. This is the most guest friendly hotel I had experienced in Italy. The breakfast has a variety of croissants and buns, cold cut meats, cereals etc. Breakfast is served in a cosy coffee room. Don't forget this is continental breakfast and so don't expect any hot food.If there is any downside comment I want to make, it is the hot water system in the shower which occasionally fluctuated in pressure i.e. a slight variation in temperature. But this is quite common in some hotels I had been to and is a minor problem.Will I ever return? Most definitely! I would strongly recommend this hotel to other travellers. It is good value for money!
