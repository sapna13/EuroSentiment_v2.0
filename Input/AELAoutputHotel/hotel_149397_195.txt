{"text":"Prepare yourself for a nightmare We went to Bavaro Princess for a Wedding with about 25 people. the trip started off good the hotel is visually beautiful and beach is amazing. That's were it ends....the customer service is the worst I ever received - I can go on and on about that. For intance waiting for room service for over an hour on more than one occasion. Wating for a day for an addtional blanket. Everytime you called to follow up on requests for room service - you were received with an argument on the phone asking am i sure that i spoke to that person etc.We had about 5 or more from our group that became ill from the food one even had to be taken to the hospital during our stay. The night of the wedding no special accomidations were made for the bride or the groom. the reception was held outside in a sectioned off area that the staff continued to let other guest walk right through reception party (we actually had a drunk hotel guest come up during the reception and ask if he could have a piece of cake).these are minimal examples of things gone wrong - it was a short story horror. what ever customer service mishap could happen - happened. after the first two illnesses i was so afraid to eat i stuck with bread and rice. I still got sick came home and was in bed for two full days. IF YOU STILL HAVE TIME MAKE ANOTHER RESERVATION IF YOU ALREADY MADE IT HERE. If you havent made one yet - DO NOT MAKE IT WITH TIS HOTEL!!!!
