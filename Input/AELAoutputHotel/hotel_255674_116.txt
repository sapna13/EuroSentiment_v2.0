{"text":"Location and view This is a top rate Marriott property with views over Sydney Harbour and the Opera House--a million dollar view if there was ever one! Great location as it takes only a couple of minutes to walk to Circular Quay (hub for city buses and the train station, as well as range of shops and restaurants) and only slightly longer to the Rocks and to the Botanical Gardens. Terrific concierge desk that gave us great recommendations for neighborhoods to visit, where to shop, and also set up surfing lessons at Bondi for my teenagers--and in each case made it clear what bus to take and approximate cost. (Bus drivers in Sydney were helpful and friendly and made it easy to get around the city.)The rooms were American Marriott standard--comfy beds with nice linens and lots of other amenities. We had two rooms with an adjoining door so it felt very spacious. Some reviewers have complained about the price of food in the hotel--we had room service once which I thought was very reasonable (better than average menu selection, too, and very prompt and friendly delivery) and the breakfast buffet another day which was pricey but a very nice range of food available and good table service. There's also a vast range of eating options literally on the hotel doorstep (beware, though: this is the business district and many of the places are closed Saturday and especially Sunday)--from cheap take away food to haute cuisine. Nice pool and well-equipped gym in the hotel, but the attractions of Sydney don't leave much time to take advantage of them! Highly recommend a harbour-view room.
