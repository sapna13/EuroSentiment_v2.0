{"text":"Definitive Review I guess the title is a little presumptuous but after reading the reviews on TA before we went I think I can help a little more with our review.We went with two other couples to Paris, this is our second trip and the first trip for the other two couples. I travel abroad extensively as part of my job and am accustomed to staying in 4 - 5 star hotels. So when we were looking into this trip I had to consider the other two couples and their spending limits ... so to the web we went. We looked at at least twenty different hotels, going back and forth on cost vs. features, reading every review we could, consulting a travel agent, etc. until we finally settled on the Tour Eiffel.Once the booking was complete I was never really sold as I know what European hotels are like and you typically get what you pay for. The 4-5 star hotels are very expensive but you get the amenities of large bathrooms, comfortable beds, in house resteraunt, room services, etc.Well knowing all this I was expecting the least from the Tour Eiffel, even though the reviews have been good on TA.Anyway, now to the review; we booked the Executive Suite and it is small but with a balcony, view of the Eiffel Tower (top half) we really enjoyed the room. The bed is large and very comfortable, the linens are fresh and crisp and the pillows are full and fluffy.The bath rooms are small. The showers have the half glass partition and it is difficult (no impossible) to take a shower without getting the bathroom all wet. The hot water ran out on me a couple of times during peak shower time (I guess 7-8 am)In other words the rooms are what you would expect for the price and size of this hotel.BUT; the location can not be beat. It is just off the beaten path and you should take a hotel business card with you to tell the cab drivers the address of the hotel. But the Trocedero Circle is about a 5 minute walk with a Metro station and Taxis stand. Right across the street from the circle is the promenade to the Eiffel Tower, about another 5-10 minute walk. We spent a lot of time in this area, laying on the lawn with our brown bags of wine, sandwiches and enjoyed the scenery and weather. The biggest part of this review is to comment on the service of the hotel; the Staff is genuinely friendly, helpful, courteous and professional. They went above and beyond to accommodate us and serve all of our needs. I must especially compliment the front desk staff for this. I bought my wife a dozen roses at a nearby flower shop (Place de Mexico) and as I was walking through the lobby they asked if I need a vase. It was brought to my room promptly with water and sugar for the roses.We asked for wine glasses on one occasions as all three couples met in our room and from then all we had fresh glasses every day.One Saturday night me and the other two men stayed in the lobby until 5 am listening to a College game, they never blinked an eye and kept the bar open for us all night.Anyway, I don't know what else to say to convince someone that this is a great hotel to stay at. If you want creature comforts and 5 star ambiance it is not for you. But if you want to be in the local crowd , close to the Eiffel Tower and receive excellent service then I highly recommend the Tour Effiel.FWIW; we are now at the Intercontinental Le Grand for the last five days of an 11 day trip, the service is not near what it was at this hotel.Other hints; De Vino on Plaza de Mexico is a very good restaurant. Nicolas (wine shop) is off the Place, third street on the left about 100 yds down in a little mall like area. Pataserier is across the hallway for good pastries and sandwiches. The Eiffel Tower restaurant Jules Verne is worth every penny. Normandy is a must see for Americans.
