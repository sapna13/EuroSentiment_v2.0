{"text":"Great place to be your home base in Honolulu. This was my first trip to Oahu and was traveling on a budget with my 19 year old son. I read many reviews on Tripadvisor and finally decided to try this hotel. I can stay at any hotel as long as they are clean and properly maintained. My expectations were not terribly high when I booked a room here, but it exceeded my expectations. Our room was 218 on Ala Moana Blvd side of the hotel and I had no noise complaints at all. We requested two beds and got them. The lenai overlooked the parking garage and all the action on the street. The beds were comfortable and the air conditioning worked well and quietly. There is no chance of seeing the ocean from your room, but the ocean is only a short walk away. We were close to the elevator and pool which is located on our floor. Actually never used the pool as we walked over to the Hilton every day and sat on the beach. The room has a nice sized minifridge, microwave and some eating utensils. I never waited long for the elevator. Luck was on my side! The only complaint was that the carpet could have used a good cleaning. I had a couple of minor problems with the safe and door lock, which were attended to immediately and actually was the fault of the operator, not the equipment. We had a rental car that was helpful in getting to a grocery store and less expensive restaurants. But there were plenty of restaurants in the area as well as several ABC stores. The buses will take you all around the island, but we had five total in our party and the minivan worked well for us. The parking stalls are tight, but there was adequate room for the vehicle. My son rented a moped for a day and parked it overnight in the secure parking area below our lenai. The ramp had quite a steep incline to get into the parking garage and coming out, but any experienced driver can handle it. Access to the parking drive was easy to find. The laundry room is on the P3 parking level and quite nice to have. So, definitely recommend this property.
