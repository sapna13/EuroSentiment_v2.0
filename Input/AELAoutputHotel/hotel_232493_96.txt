{"text":"Delightful gem We travelled to Amsterdam to see our son perform with the Halle Youth Orchestra at a lunchtime concert in the Westerkerk. The Nadia is a charming hotel, occupying the end part of a very historic building. The location is absolutely fantastic, with the Westerkerk opposite, Anne Frank's house around the corner and the stop for the Canalbus just over the road. We had read about the friendly staff before we arrived and were not disappointed. Nothing is too much trouble for this family. They are welcoming, provide valuable tourist information and go the extra mile to make you feel comfortable. It is true that the rooms are snug - my husband felt that he was in the cabin on a ship! Everything is there to hand though - tv, fridge, fan and a safety deposit box, which is invaluable in a city hotel. Everything is perfectly kept, with fresh towels daily. The owners seem to know exactly what makes a difference to customers and the service reflects that. Breakfasts were good, with fresh juice and the usual continental fayre. The dining room is in period style, with lots of plants and fresh flowers. It too is tiny for the number of rooms, but seems to be able to accommodate the people it serves and we never had to wait on the three days of our stay. What is not to like about the Nadia? The only problem could be the stairs for the less mobile. They are certainly a challenge, but help to burn off the calories and are good exercise! Staff anticipate difficulties and carry bags etc., so the only thing you have to worry about is yourself. This is Amsterdam and the Nadia reflects the typical style of the buildings! We had a lovely stay, would definitely stay here again and will recommend the Nadia to our friends. ","annotations":[]}
