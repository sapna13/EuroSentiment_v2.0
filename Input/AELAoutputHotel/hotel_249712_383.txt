{"text":"Family Weekend in NYC Our family of six stayed here for a long weekend in November. It was in just the right location with it's easy access to Times Square. Teenagers (15 and 16) felt like they were in the most exciting place on earth. The 10 and 11 year old agreed. Therefore, that made it work for the parents.Our 6- persons situation requires two rooms which we booked with Starwood points and upgraded to the club level. We booked two rooms each with 2 doubles on the Club floor. One of the rooms had a couch and a couple of chairs plus large windows. The rooms did not connect but we felt safe with the setup.Before we got there I thought this was one of the hotels right in Times Square. It is not, but it is 1 block off which was just fine with us. We were there to see shows on Broadway and to visit with family on the upper west side. Theatre's are nearby and for restaurants we enjoyed Tony's DeNapoli on W. 43rd between 6th\/7th. Also, Angus McIndoe on W. 44th between 8th\/Broadway. Both very good quality and family-friendly.It's an enormous hotel but it worked really well for our family. We weren't there to spend a lot of time in the hotel room but we were seeking a high quality hotel in a central location. We walked or took taxis everywhere. The service was fine but we had pretty low expectations because we knew it was a huge hotel. We would definitely return with our family and stay again on the Club floor to take advantage of the muffins, coffee\/tea\/juice, fruit in the morning and snacks and desserts at other times.
