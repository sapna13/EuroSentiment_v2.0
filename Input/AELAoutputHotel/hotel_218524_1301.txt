{"text":"Excellence Punta Cana is EXCELLENT The resort more than lives up to its name !After doing much homework on the internet, my wife and I chose Exllence Punta Cana to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary (2nd Honeymoon). We were at this resort from Jan 20th to Jan 27th, 2007. We had the vacation of a lifetime, and we plan to return next year. One of the reasons we chose this resort was that it was an adults only resort. The Excellence Punta Cana far exceeded our every expectation in an all inclusive resort. We were treated like royalty from the minute we arrived. The entire staff at the resort were extremely friendly and the language barrier was non-existant. We do not speak spanish at all (other than the standard Hola !)The cleanliness of the resort , our room, the pools, and the beach were second to none. The staff were friendly and accommodating to our every whim and desire. The food at all the the 7 a la carte restaurants was outstanding. The weather was 85 to 90 degrees everyday, we never saw a drop rain. Bring lots of sunscreen !One of the best features at this resort is the fact that they have a no reservation policy for all amenities and restaurants (fist come, fist served) which is one less stressful event per day to deal with. The shows at night were excellent.We felt extremely safe at all times at this resort. The bus ride was about an hour from the airport with only one stop to another hotel. The bus was brand new, very comfortable and also had air conditioning.Like the resort name, everything was EXCELLENT !!Mark  Judy Ottawa, Ontario Canada. ","annotations":[]}
