{"text":"Dream come true Not sure if we were at the same resort as some of these other poeple on here because we didn't find any of these problems. We were getting a little worried about going after reading some reviews, but we were not disappointed. It is the first time we have brought our daughter who is two and a half on holidays and we were a little worried about entertaining her for a week but there was no problems at all.The ride from the airport is not as bad as I've read or expected. Sure the roads aren't great and they drive a little crazy, but your in a third world country and I felt safer then riding in a cab in Mexico. Upon check in we were greeted with cool clothes, cocktails(punch for my daughter and pregnant self) and warm chocolate chip cookies. Our check in was fast and our bags were at our room right behind us. The rooms were a bit small but except to shower, change and sleep who spends time in the rooms anyways. The beach was closed down due to rip tides, but that's hardly the hotels fault. The water right in front was not the nicest to swim in but if you took a quick walk to the left by the floating trampoline the beach and water are beautiful. There is also hardly anyone over there so it's like a beach to yourself.The chairs at the pool is a little crazy, but we never had a problem on any day to get a chair when we went over after a morning at the beach. As people would leave they would give us there chairs or the workers would find empty ones and bring them over without being asked to. As for tipping and waiting in line. We did tip but never felt the need to and always had the same service as when we didn't tip. Also as far as waiting for drinks that never happened. If I could get served that fast at home I would be very happy. As far as I could see all of the liquors were top self and not stingy either. If my husband says a drink is stong then it is. Also they carried Bud Light which made all the men happy.We have been to quite a few all inclusives and this is the first time I can say I don't think I had a bad meal. I appriciated them having a kids section at the buffet for breakfast and dinner. There pizzas were alos great. We ate at the Mexican, Japanese and the Seaside grill and all were very good. The seaside grill had very good steak. BBQ on the beach was good and having fresh fruit by the pool was great with little kids who would need snacks. Also NO ONE GOT SICK!! As I previously read we were a little worried as two of our group had previously been to Dominican and got very sick, but not here.A would recommend hiring the hotel photographer to take some family pics, we did and they turned out so amazing. As far as I'm concerned this hotel was great and I can't wait to go back. I would also like to say that we very much enjoyed their Easter activities. The Easter bunny flew in via helicopter and landed on the beach. She then took all the kids up the resort for and easter egg hunt. My daughter loved it.
