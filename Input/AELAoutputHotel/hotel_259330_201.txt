{"text":"Worst vacation of my life Let me start off by saying I am easy to please and dont ever bother to write a review about somewhere i have been. Although, i feel that it is my PERSONAL duty to warn EVERYONE about this terrible resort.This resort is EASILY the worst place I have ever stayed in.The beach is nice, that is the ONLY semi decent thing about this place. I mean, its nice if you want to wake up at 6 am for a broken chair.1. ROOM: SMELLY and the sheets were NEVER changed once. 2. FOOD: Literally, the worst food i have ever put in my mouth. First of all, you need to book all your meals soon as you get there. The girl that books your meals is the rudest person in the resort, possibly in the universe. She gives you what time and place she feels like. We asked her a question, she would answer and started singing in our faces. She says everynight is lobster night which its not, and if it were i wouldnt advise eating the lobster from there anyway. The Buffet is SICKENING, dirty moldy food. Needless to say, we ate bread and water for breakfast. For Lunch, there is one place, another buffet, the only thing that is decent is the pizza which there is a line to get to, and run out constantly. The meat....dont even go there.3. Beach: The beach is beautiful, the water is crystal clear. The beach is great, if you want wake up at 6 am for a broken, old, nasty chair. Without a chair, dont even bother! There is no service on the beach either.4. Entertainment\/ Nighlife: There is none. There is one place to go at night outside of the resort. MENGU, bring a machetti if you want to go.In conclusion, be forewarned, this place is the PITS. Do not waste your money, I rather have been at work than on vacation at this resort.
