{"text":"Hospitalized for three days I should know that you get what you pay for. I went to Natura Parc for what should have been a 7 day vacation from May 25 - June 1st. The total cost including airfare, accommodation, food, taxes etc. was only $890pp from Montreal. We got what we paid for, I suppose.We ended up going to the hospital to get medication for ear infections (both of us!) on the day we were supposed to leave and were hospitalized for three days and told not to fly until that weekend. The hospitalization may have colored our view of the entire stay. It seems that the hospital hospitalizes everyone who shows up for three days. It's hard not to think it's a scam - $360\/night for the hospital room, $250 for each consultation with the doctor while you're there plus all the medications - $2300 for two nights and three days.On a positive note, the ground are beautiful - pink flamingos, geese, a peacock, lots of palm trees and a beautiful white sandy beach. Everything else was horrible.The rooms are small and old. Nothing works and everything is dirty. The mini bar in the room had one bottle of water, two beers and a half empty bottle of coke. Trying to convince someone to replentish it was impossible. When we arrived, I called the front desk to ask for a bottle opener (one of the few times they answered the phone). They asked me if I wanted the spa - I said no I wanted a bottle opener. After finally communicating successfully, they told me that there was no bottle opener since most of their guest brought their own! No offer to send room service with one. I later found two in the room - one on the bathroom wall (how elegant!) and one attached to the inside of the minibar.The main problem is the attitude. All of the staff seem to be unhappy, overworked and unwilling to help. We were convinced it was because the the manager at the front desk who seems to go out of his way to be difficult. My family tried to reach me several times when there was simply no answer at the front desk. The guest relations desk was a joke. The poor woman had no interest whatsoever in assisting in any way. We tipped everyone in site but it made absolutely no difference. Don't even THINK about going to the spa. I had a massage and the massage therapist actually answered the phone in the middle of the massage and continued massaging me with one hand. The manicures and pedicures are unhygenic - not to mention ugly. If you book a hair appointment, you get a wash in cold water and no blow dry!Kudos to the few staff who brightened our stay - Anthony in the pool bar (but he'd only been there a few months and didn't know how miserable to be yet) and Alberto who is the scuba instructor and was amazing. There were a few other attentive staff but with overtones of sexual harassment - definitely not a comfortable place for a woman to be without a man.I've traveled to many places and think I make a fair effort to take into account the differences in each country and had relatively low expectations due to the price but I honestly couldn't recommend this place to anyone.
