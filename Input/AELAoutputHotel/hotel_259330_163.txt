{"text":"We had a fabulous time!!!! There were 13 of us in our group. Ages ranged from 18-72. I'm here to tell you that there is not one of us that would not go back! My brother and sister-in-law got married on the beach on Wednesday February 20th. (What a beautiful ceremony--but I'm here to give a review about the resort!).Check In: Here's a huuuge tip: Wear your bathing suit underneath whatever you have on for the flight; grab your sunscreen  a hat and head on over to the pool bar for 4 or 5 hours! We landed at the airport at around 11:30 and did not get into our rooms until 6:30. Whatever! Expect it to happen and make the best of it! They watch your luggage like hawks. No worries. The truth about the Club section: We absolutely loved it! We had brand new rooms with flat-screen tv's! Ask for the remote upon check-in. We were in building 7 on the second floor and had from our balcony, a fabulous view of the swim-up pool bar. This is where we hung out the most. There is a large shaded section for seniors and non-sun-worshippers. Then there is a fabulous 4 foot deep pool and yes! the swim-up bar is great! Bring your own thermal cup...keeps drinks cold  you don't spill in the pool! The bartenders were hilarious...mamajuana  diablo will knock you on your [--], so be verrry careful! The beer Presidente is very cold and very coors-lightish. Yum. Bahama Mama was my drink of choice, though. Right beside the pool bar was the buffet. Great selection of meat, potatoes, salads, pastas, pizza, burgers, fries, basically something for everyone. I tend to eat with my eyes, but I can honestly say there was nothing gross when it came to the food!The staff were incredibly friendly and for you ladies: the guys are fricken hot!We took the tram (which was fun!) to the ocean in the morning almost every day. We would walk the beach, play in the waves, enjoy the sun. Great barbecue on the beach! Then in the afternoon we'd head back  hang out at the pool bar. After dinner, we'd head back over to the main hotel, to the piano bar or the sports bar. Then the disco opened at 11 (until 2). After that, we'd hang out at the sports bar (which is open 24 hours!). They have some computers; you get 1\/2 hour of tme for $5.We took the tour where you get to swim with the sharks  stingrays...one of the scariest most fun things I've ever done in my life! Cost was $80 and worth every penny! p.s. after swimming with sharks they pump you full of booze and make you dance on the boat! Fun Fun Fun!We would definitely return to this resort!
