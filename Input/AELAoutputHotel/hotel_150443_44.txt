{"text":"Excellent Were there from 7\/31 to 8\/9 , 2008 with two boyz, 58. Loved it. Have been to San Juan several times and stay at the Marriott Resort but didn't miss it this time.There are two buildings, one facing a lagoon, has one pool, gym, the other is ocean front, a pool with a slide, a salt water pool and the beach. Very calm beach which is public as are most in Puerto Rico.Italian restaurant overlooking ocean great for breakfast, try there 2 by 2 brkfst and you'll never need lunch.Staff is extremely nice, especially Bernice who is a hostess at the Italian place. Great steak at the Strip restauraunt. The pool side bar is great, again very nice staff, good food menu. Pretty clean place, we were in a ocean front room, very big room, unique bathroom with a shower within a glass square with toilet and sink to one side and drawers and closet on other. Wi fi is iffy, stay at higher levels to use.Starbucks is next door and you can charge everything to your room. There is a Puerto Rican\/Mexican restaurant a few feet away on Ashford next door to another amazing place Waikiki. Make sure you go to the back of Waikiki out the door to be literally experience a drink or dinner overlooking the waves. Best place to be!!! Their beer is 2.50 which is cheapest next to going to the corner store which is close to Max and Charlie's pizza. They have the best pizza ever as everything is fresh. Sit at their bar to enjoy a sip while your food is being prepared.There are so many hotels and outdoor bars along Ashford, perfect in the evening.All in all a very good experience, guest manager is Jean Pierre who is very helpful.Enjoy!
