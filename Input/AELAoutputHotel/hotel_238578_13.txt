{"text":"Lovely Location and a nice clean hotel ! This does what it says on the tin (but perhaps you get a bit more too!)Its an above average two star hotel, its in a lovely location - a very nice area of the city. Easy reached by tram number 5 from central station and then you get off just at the Reiks Museum.You are close to a long road full of designer shops...so if this is your bag you will be in shoppers heaven. Also walkable distance to restaurants etc. Very close to Hard Rock Cafe.Hotel itself. Smooth check-in. reception staff friendly and helpful .......manned 24 hours. Reception area seems a bit cluttered with a UK telephone box in it and some airline seats amongst other things! Lots of reading info\/free maps\/and leaflets.Very steep steps up to the front of the hotel. There is a lift once inside the hotel - to the rooms, but this does not go down to the breakfast room.Breakfast. Self-Serve.Good selection of cereals, toasts, breads, ham and cheese.Eggs too if you get down early enough. (didnt see this being re-filled.)There is a small bar too which also served coffee s etc.Rooms small. Bathrooms excellent. Everything you need for a city break - as you dont spent very much time in the room anyway. Plenty of hanging space, and shelves, and even a desk with 2 chairs. Shower excellent. Room clean.We pre-booked an evening dinner canal cruise which I would highly recommend. beautiful food and wine included all evening.If you would like to book this, and\/or the hotel, contact me via email as I am happy to help you out....Be aware there are lots of different cruises - all leave from opposite central station.Overall would recommend this hotel to others, as long as you realise you are heading for a 2 star I feel you will not be at all disappointed, like me you will be very pleasantly surprised !Lucy - Travel Counsellors UK ","annotations":[{"endOffset":26,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":22},{"endOffset":187,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":183},{"endOffset":944,"mention":"breads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":938},{"endOffset":1082,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1076}]}
