{"text":"Mixed feelings about Legian Beach Hotel I recently spent 5 nights at Legian Beach Hotel and have mixed feelings about the experience. The bungalow room was pleasant and comfortable, nothing special. The lobby and reception areas have recently been renovated in a tasteful modern Asian style, which looks sleek and smart, but other parts of the complex remain in traditional Balinese style, so it looks a bit of a mish-mash. The two swimming pools and their surroundings are large and very attractively landscaped, with spa pools, a swim-up bar, plenty of sun lounges etc. The Ocean View bar and restaurant areas have great views over Legian Beach and are very popular at sunset.The day spa is a bit shabby and they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ change the linens between customers (yick!), but the women are pleasant and the treatments were fine. The so-called gym is woeful √à√\u2020\u2022?generally poor quality equipment in poor condition.The reception and housekeeping staff were very polite and prompt. I reported a problem with the plumbing in my room, and it was fixed quickly and effectively. There seemed to be literally dozens of staff in the restaurant and bar areas, all busy looking busy, but the speed of service was atrociously slow. Every time it took a very long time to get food and drink orders delivered to the table. Then there is no follow up service √à√\u2020\u2022?once you are supplied with your drink and\/or food, nobody comes back to ask if you would like anything else, or even to give you the bill to be paid or signed. The breakfast buffet was excellent because you can walk up and serve yourself! It was also tasty and good value.I felt certain that the so-called cocktails at the bar had little or no alcohol, so my tip if you stay at Legian Beach Hotel is to order straight spirits on the rocks and then request your mixer in a bottle on the side. That way you can actually see and taste the alcohol! I think the level of service in the restaurants and bars was a major disappointment. It obviously pays to be a pushy tourist here.
