{"text":"Superb Shangri-La What can I say that hasn't already been said about this wonderful hotel? This is truly how a 5 star hotel should be! The service is impeccable from the moment you arrive, with friendly ,smiling faces everywhere and nothing you require is too much trouble for them. I stayed in the Garden Wing and my room and balcony were HUGE, luxurious and spotlessly clean.The breakfast buffet at The Line was the best I have ever seen, with the Eggs Benedict and orange juice to die for. Just why their orange juice is so much better than everyone else's I don't know - but it just is!! The food, service and view at the Blu restaurant is a bit pricey but again simply wonderful. The elegant afternoon tea at The Rose Verandah was superb, with a huge choice of sandwiches, crab cakes, sushi, curry, quiches, pastries and yummy desserts. It was so much better than Raffles High Tea where I had the impression they couldn't wait for us to leave so they could put other people at our table. In contrast High Tea at The Shang is like from a bygone age of luxury and relaxation.The location of the hotel is very convenient - away from the noise of Orchard Rd but only a 10 minute walk or a 6 dollar taxi ride. The hotel also provides a free shuttle bus to the shopping malls.There is a magnificent swimming pool and gardens to relax in, with attentive pool boys bringing you cool towels and iced water for free. In all I would say that my stay at The Shangri-La was the best hotel experience that I have ever had (and I have stayed in some very good and famous hotels throughout the world) and I cannot recommend it highly enough. I will most definately be back!
