{"text":"Fab time at the Ritz! My girlfriends and I decided in April we truly needed a fab girls only weekend away to rest, relax, unwind, drink plenty of tasty cocktails and decompress from the hustle and bustle of our busy lives. And unwind we did! This was my second time staying at the Ritz Carlton in San Juan and the second time was EVEN better than the first. Our agenda for the long weekend was beach, pool, cocktails, dinner and repeat it all over again the next day.We were able to check in a few hours prior to the check in time and upgraded to the Pool View Room on the 9th floor of the hotel, which was an awesome view. The rooms were in top Ritz-Carlton fashion and we had no problems with the room the entire weekend. The hotel staff were always accomodating and we had turn down service every evening, bottled water, chocolates, and relaxing music playing in our room upon our return each evening.We spent a considerable amount of time at the pool and beach (10am-7pm) each day :) So, we really got to know the pool and beach operations staff. They all were absolutely great! We had lunch by the pool each day and again, the service was in top Ritz-Carlton fashion.On the third day, I had an ipod disaster and acidentally dropped my ipod in the pool. I was devestated because it would not reprogram or turn back on! But, Pablo Santiago (Beach and Pool Operations) saved the day and GAVE me his ipod! It was such a wonderful and thoughtful gesture.Also, on Sunday morning, we had brunch at Madres in the Hotel and it was fabulous! Fresh fruit, made to order omlettes, Puerto Rican cuisines, and mimosos, just to name a few of the items on the menu. Note: Madres has a daily full breakfast brunch buffet for $26.00\/per person and on Sunday it ends promptly at 11:00am. The Full Service Brunch is $70.00\/per person which begins at 12:30pm. We had the full breakfast for $26.00 and got there at 10:30am, so get there early!We did not spend a lot of time in Old San Juan on this trip, but of course its highly recommended for those that will be traveling to San Juan for the first time. Also, we did go to the El San Juan Hotel in the evenings for drinks and music, since the scene was a lot more lively.All in all, the Ritz Carlton San Juan did not fail our expectations and I will ONLY stay at the Ritz when I visit San Juan! Next time, I'll definitely check out the spa.
