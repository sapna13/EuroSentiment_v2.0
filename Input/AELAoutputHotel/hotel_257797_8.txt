{"text":"It's OK I booked this hotel in a hurry, without any time for research about Sydney. I was in a party of about ten, all going to Sydney for a series of meetings from different countries, but travel organisation had not been centralised, so everyone was staying in a different place and I had not had time to talk to anyone else. Overall, I was satisfied about the hotel, but nevertheless I won't be going back. The location is quite good, central, yeards from Darling Harbour. This would be perfect if there weren't other hotels actually on Darling Harbour. Breakfast is very good. I must say I remember it being particularly good, actually looking forward to breakfast. I had one meal in and it was room service. It was OK. The room was a reasonable size, neither too small nor particularly large. The common areas were OK, albeit a bit soul-less. The price was low (relatively so, at least), so for the first day I felt good because I was being wise and saving company money. This lasted until I visited the hotels were my fellow travellers were: the Shangri-La, Four Seasons and the Park Hyatt. That is were I am going to go next time. My advice is: if on business, it's not bad but you can find better. Particularly, there is no point staying at Darling Harbour for business: you want to be near Circular Quay and the Rocks. If on holiday, might be OK, but perhaps I would choose a similar hotel on Darling Harbour, or if your budget allows it, one of the three I mentioned above, which seem to be where everybody stays anyway.
