{"text":"Fantabulous!!!!! This hotel was just spectacular!! First time in NY did not know what to expect from the quality of their hotels but this one is just something else. Arriving at the hotel we had the door of our taxi open our bags taken in for us all we had to do was walk to the check in desk to be greeted by extremely friendly staff. We were no sooner in our room when our bags arrived and were placed exactly where we wanted them in the room The room...... beautiful!!! We booked a studio suite. Massive size in comparison to other suites we have stayed in. Two very big queen sized beds beautifully dressed, a small kitchenette with everything you would have needed in a hotel room kitchen and a very attractive bathroom with a much needed power shower!!! Plenty of TV channels to chose from. We were not in the room longer than 10 minutes when the reception desk phoned to ensure everything was OK and to see if they could provide us with anything else!!! A really nice touch. The purpose of our trip was sightseeing and shopping and the concierge was most helpful in pointing us in the right direction and giving us very detailed maps. We didn't not plan to spend much time in the hotel as our days were limited but it was an absolute pleasure to return from a hard days shopping to a room with beds redressed, pj's folding a fresh towels and shampoos ready to use. The beds....... so so comfy i was tempted to ask could i take one home!!! Any queries we had about NY were answered by either very friendly and helpful reception staff or the concierge. A member of house keeping phoned to make sure everything was up to standard and provided us with extra towels and shampoos on request. A newspaper delivered to your door.... a nice touch. The hotel is located a block from the subway and very close to all the sights of new york. We would recommend you walk to mid town from the hotel to really appreciate its closeness to everything along with being away from the hustle and bustle of mid town Manhattan.On check out the hotel kept our bags in safe keeping for the day as our flight was later that day and when we required a taxi the concierge was most obliging and flagged down a mini bus taxi (we did a lot of shopping) packed up the car for us and wished us a safe trip home. Overall we had an extremely pleasurable stay and would return to this hotel without question and would highly recommend it to anyone.
