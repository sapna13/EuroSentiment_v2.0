{"text":"Charm and Class My wife and I stayed at this hotel on a recent √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëelayed honeymoon√à√\u2020\u2022? It located on a very prime stretch of Waikiki beach with beautiful views of Diamond Head, surfers and outriggers, and is within easy walking distance to many good restaurants and shopping. The beach in front of the hotel is broad, without seawalls or jetties to get in the way, and there are few rocks or coral in the water to step on.The hotel is lovely to look at- it has a classic charm, with high archways, beautiful rugs and artwork, and gorgeous gardens with a variety of tropical plants. The hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ stucco-like surface and squarish shape makes it seem like a big sand castle that rose up from the beach! The pink color is not overwhelming, and complements the blue sky and blue water. Although this hotel is √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âlassic√à√\u2020\u2022? the pastel pink color gives it a festive, fun vacation spirit. The lobby was quiet and grand, with little alcoves with wicker chairs and chaise lounges to relax in. Along the main lobby hallway are a few high-end shops, and it ends in an archway that opens onto a green lawn and then the beach and water beyond.Check-in was smooth and friendly- but we got there early and the room was not available until 2pm (check in time is 3pm). We were upgraded to an ocean-view room in the tower. Elevators were fast, the room was clean, no smell, it had a hi-def large TV, quiet and efficient air-conditioner, two phones and desk, large balcony with two chairs (√à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¨anai√à√\u2020\u2022?, modern bathroom, no mini-bar but the room had a good refrigerator, well-stocked coffee maker, free safe in the closet, internet for a fee, ironing board and iron in the closet, and free local newspaper each morning. The doors were card keyed. There were smoke detectors in each room. The swimming pool was smallish, somewhat old, but clean. The pool is located next to the beach, and very well heated. Cabanas were available, and plenty of chairs.We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat in the hotel restaurant for dinner, but had drinks at the outdoor Mai Tai bar, which had nightly Hawaiian music\/light jazz entertainment and hula.Misc Tips:1) We searched very hard at the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ website, and got a free breakfast package included. The breakfast buffet was excellent and extensive, but too expensive if not included in the room (so definitely get it as part of a room package). The Surf Room restaurant opens onto the beach and a great place to start the day.2) We originally reserved a room in the architecturally interesting original portion of the hotel, but accepted the tower for an ocean view upgrade. This worked out very well for us, as the tower elevators lead right out to the pool and beach. Since we spent our vacation days in our bathing suits and swimming, it was very convenient not to have to walk through the lobby with wet bathing suits! Also, the lanai with a view was a great escape from the midday sun, and a very relaxing place to have lunch.3) The hotel offers its guests a generous stretch of private beach, but get there early if you want a chaise lounge chair with an umbrella. (there were always plenty of lounge chairs, but the umbrellas went fast!)From reading other reviews, we had worried that this hotel had become a somewhat dated and worn-out √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Ørand Old Lady√à√\u2020\u2022?of the beach. Instead, we found the hotel beautiful, fresh, and charming. We would most definitely stay here again.
