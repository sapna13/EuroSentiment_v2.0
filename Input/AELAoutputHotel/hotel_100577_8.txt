{"text":"worse hotel for the money I ever stayed in We stayed in this hotel from Aug 13 thru Aug 21st. If another hotel had been available we would have left, but there was not one within the area. The motel was $115 a night and on the weekends it was $145. My son was getting ready to go to the University and we wanted to be close by. This is a hard hotel to get to from the University. They say its only 2 blocks but that is deceptive. You have to go thru a mall parking lot and then get onto the road that leads up via a HUGE hill to get to the edge of the campus. He's not walking distance and driving is difficult fo rthen you have to find parking at the University and that is not cheap! $11 a day to park there. That was the first bad thing. When we checked in all they were worried about was how busy they were and how many housekeepers they are short. You know what? I dont care what kind of day you are having, you had better greet me like I'm a guest and not an inconvenience. I was put out by that, but made the best of it. Then to the room. The rooms were AWFUL! To spend that much money I except a bit more. Where do I start? First thing was the clock that didnt work. We went and asked the front desk where Ben was working. They did not have one but he would get the maintenance man in the morning to get one. That never happened. The tv's sound went in and out. No consistency. The interenet rarely worked and we could not go online. Had to go over to the barnes and noble and pay to use our laptops. The sheets were old and the blankets were ragged. Of course the mattresses were old too. The walls were dirty ( a bit of paint goes along ways) The curtains were old and drabby and dirty. The coffee maker didnt work either and the coffee they gave out was so bad anyways. No coffee in the filters. The bathroom was gross. There was rust on the toilet paper holder, the door was all chipped up (again, a little paint goes a long ways), the sink and faucet old, tears on the wallpaper, the caulking was dirty around the tub. We didnt even attempt the hot tub or the swimming pool, because they looked dirty and un kept as well. I think the owner\/manager should be ashamed on how bad their hotel looks. We looked into a couple of other rooms there and they were just as bad. To think people pay alot of money for such a bad room. And we were one of those. This room would'va been worth $50 bucks a night, not 145. That is ridiculous. The people at the front desk were okay, just too concerned with how busy they were and not if we were taken care of as a guest. This hotel has alot to learn about customer service. I was not pleased at all and I doubt if they will do anything anyways about it, but at least people will be forewarned not to use this hotel.
