{"text":"Christmas in Paris We spent a magical Christmas Eve and Christmas day in this lovely hotel.The excellent service began before our arrival,with Yohan confirming our booking and also helping out with information about getting there, local attractions and eating out.The hotel was easy to get to as it is very near to the impressive Arc De Triomphe. Yohan suggested taking the AirFrance bus from CDG airport instead of the Metro as it avoids having to change stations whilst carting luggage around. We took his advice both ways!The front of the hotel is probably the best looking out of all the buildings on this side street and the reception area of the hotel is very pleasant.The double room we booked was suprisingly large, very quiet and clean. The bathroom was a bit on the small side but again, it was very clean with modern decor. The toilet was separate and again rather small but adequate.The only staff we encountered were Yohan and the gentleman on reception in the evening (we never got his name!). Both spoke excellent english and were very helpful. On the first evening we were directed to a great brasserie a couple of streets away on Ave. De La Grande Armee (the SCS La Grande Armee). Although it may seem a bit pricey to some at 100 euros for two people, the meals were great. As a side note, if you plan to go to this brasserie, brush up on your french food as we had a bit of difficulty with the menu!On the subject of food, the hotel does do meals as there is a menu in the room, although we never did get to try it. We found breakfasts to be adequate for self service Continental style fayre.There was a nice touch on Christmas Day when we arrived back at the hotel to find a Christmas card and chocolates from the staff. Also, Yohan was very helpful in keeping our luggage for a few hours after we checked out as we had some time to kill whilst waiting for our flight. Overall, our experience of this hotel has been one of a pleasant surprise. We didn't quite know what to expect with various tales of small rooms being the norm in Paris. We actually downgraded from a four star hotel to this three star hotel after finding all the positive reviews from TripAdvisor. One of the key benefits is the location, being very close to the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs de Elysees (for big name shops such as Louis Vuitton, Cartier, and DG) and a metro station only 5 minutes away. We will definitely come here again!Dan  Magda ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1626,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1622},{"endOffset":1723,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1713}]}
