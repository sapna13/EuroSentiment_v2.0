{"text":"great location with good breakfast, fine dining  Excellent hotel for our first ever trip to DC - 6 days to see the sights, visit the galleries  dine well.Mild initial disappointments:- it did not trouble us that we were not instantly offered assistance to take our bags up to our room  took them up ourselves but we found that our room was missing bath robes ( the reception staff did not understand BritEnglish, e.g. 'dressing gown'), and that the hotel does not supply the usual in-room booklet setting out the range of services available  how to use them (e.g. telling us the breakfast times, about laundry services,  of the availability of free internet access from an alcove next to reception), and that it took three trips to reception to get both our room swipe cards to work (tip: take both cards to reception to be reset if one does not work as some quirk in the programming can disable the other card if you reset one).But all deficencies were quickly remedied and needed information instantly supplied as and when requested, and our stay proved most enjoyable.Staff:- throughout our stay the reception staff, the concierge service,  the staff in general, were approachable, friendly and very helpful indeed.Room:- our room, bed  bathroom were spacious  comfortable - very good shower, bath too short to lie in but very comfortable if you like sitting in the tub.Breakfast:- particularly excellent with excellent service, even when busy later in the morning, in the comfortable spacious stylish setting of the hotel's Cafe 15 restaurant. (It might be advisable to make a table reservation if planning to breakfast late.) We readily abandoned ideas of trying breakfasts elsewhere.Location: absolutely perfect for sightseeing. The hotel's entrance is on 15th Street - just a short stroll, past on your left the impressive view down Pennsylvania Avenue of the Capitol in the distance, to the White House on your right and on to the green of the National Mall to the Washington Monument, etc., and in easy walking distance of anywhere downtown.The hotel is not actually on Lafayette Square but a block away (so your room view will be of the building across the street, not the square or the White House). Evening dining:- superlative. We spent 3 evenings out at restaurants nearby highly rated in Zagat but found the hotel's own Cafe 15 restaurant the best for quiet dining - superlative food prepared with care, well suited to a european palate, friendly attentive service, a good wine selection, all at attractive prices in stylish surroundings - a complete puzzle why it is not busy every night. (Maybe the lightness of the food  the quietness of the surroundings is not what washingtonians look for on an evening out.)Bar:- Le Bar was not of quite the same standard but was a great place to rest your feet with a cognac in hand in a well-padded low armchair in subdued lighting after a long day seeing the sights.All in all this was a perfect and enjoyable place for our stay. We will not be considering staying anywhere else on any future trip to DC.
