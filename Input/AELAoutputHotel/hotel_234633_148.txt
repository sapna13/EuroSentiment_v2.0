{"text":"Our Best Stay Yet in Paris My wife and I just returned from a five-night stay and had a wonderful time. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ hard to believe the writer of √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬©eality Check√à√\u2020\u2022?stayed at the Hotel Residence Foch during the same time period; we had a completely different experience. The room was very quiet, owing to its location in a very nice residential section of Paris and to the lack of traffic on rue Garbeau. On the nights we stayed out late, we easily slept as long as we wanted (sometimes until noon). Our water temperature was always consistent, and we heard no more than muted conversations from guests or staff (perhaps) in the hallway. We skipped the hotel breakfasts, drank the free coffee in the room and simply bought Pain au chocolat at the Pastry Shop a couple of blocks away.If you want to stay at a boutique hotel where you experience true hospitality in a unique residential setting, then this is the place to stay. However, if you desire a hotel with a closer proximity to the action of Paris, this may not be for you.Our experiences with Nelly and Isabelle at the front desk were always friendly and helpful. They would ask if everything was okay and if there was anything they could do for us. The night of our anniversary we wanted to eat at a memorable restaurant, and at their suggestion we ate at Le Pergolese around the corner from the hotel. It was truly an amazing experience, but do be prepared to pay extra if you go. (During our dessert the waiter brought us two glasses of champagne, compliments of Isabelle from the hotel.) We will certainly stay at this hotel again!
