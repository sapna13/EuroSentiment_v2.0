{"text":"Nice location but the rest was pretty bad... We spent our first anniversary in the Park Hotel in Amsterdam. The location is very good, right in the museum district with easy access to the centre by tram or river boat. But this is were it ends for us.The hotel is obviously under refurbishment with some rooms being ultra modern and others looking like they have not been touched for 20 years! The hotel pictures on this website are very misleading, so you have been warned! They are all from the refurbished part of the hotel and are all from rooms that are bigger then the 'average' superior room. We arrived Thursday evening, was given one of the old rooms (which was ok but very worn), however we were given a smoking room (had requested non smoking) and with people smoking joints next ddor out the window it was not ideal. We asked to change but were told they were full (which was ok), and they told us to ask again thenext morning. The next day we were eventually given a new room (one of the refurbished ones) and they moved our suitcases over to the next room which was nice. The new room was nicely decorated but so small you could not swing a cat! There is no bathroom, only a white see through curtain seperates the bed from the sink. There are stained glassdoors to a seperate shower and toilet, but unless you like being in full view whilst going to the toilet this is not great.The water from the shower leaks out on all sides when using it so make sure you go to the toilet before you have a shower (unless you want wet feet!). On the second day our room was not cleaned until 16:30, even though we had left the room at 11:00 and putting the'please make up my room' sign up. When we returned they were still cleaning all rooms in the hallway on two floors so we had to sit outside and wait. The next morning (on our checkout day) the maid entered our room at 08:30 to clean!! We were still asleep and were shocked when someone came in that early. We could hear them going down the hallway immediately after knocking on all the doors. So if you like your sleep, make sure you use the 'do not disturb sign'!Theyobviously need to communicate better and get their cleaning staff sorted out!! All in all, we were dissapointed after the stay, it was not worth the money and we were not impressed by their service either. We loved Amsterdam, but will definately not be returning to this hotel if we ever go back!
