{"text":"Great stay at the Renaissance We stayed at the Renaissance from 19th-23rd July. Check in was incredibly quick, taking literally 1 minute to complete, which was a blessing as we were meeting friends for dinner less than an hour later and were pretty stressed out after a long drive through rush hour traffic from the airport! The hotel sends an email in the week before your stay asking if you have any specific requests, and we had requested extra towels and a refridgerator in our room. The pleasant receptionist noted this and said that they would be delivered to our room promptly. They arrived less about 10 minutes later. The room was reasonably sized and very clean, the bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. Our view from the 14th floor was of the pool area and into the Hollywood and Highland Center was pleasant enough. The bathroom was good, if nothing special, but the water pressure was good and the bathroom amenities were nice and replenished daily. Unlike some hotels the hair dryer was also moveable, and I was able to take this into the bedroom to use the mirror there whilst my husband was using the bathroom. Housekeeping was good, but there is a notice in the bedroom that says they clean rooms between 9am and 5pm, which meant that often when we returned in the early afternoon the room had not yet been cleaned. Nevertheless, they were efficient and unobtrusive. One of my few complaints with the room was that it was not particularly well sound proofed (although I am quite particular about noise levels). I never heard a thing from outside, or from the rooms either side of us, but people in the corridors could be heard as clearly as if they were in the room itself! Not that it happened regularly or was lengthy, but I was awoken twice by such noise. The air conditioning was good although, again, too loud for me, so I did turn it off during the night. We didn't use many hotel facilities, and didn't eat there. We did eat at Wolfgang Puck's Vert in the shopping complex attached which had a lovely ambience, great service and good food. One thing we did use was valet parking. It may be $29 per day, but for the convenience, speed of service and pleasant staff it was perfect for us. We also used the minibar for bottles of water, when we ran out, and they cost around $2 per bottle, which in terms of hotel minibars, isn't that bad. The hotel always seemed busy during our stay, with many conventions or events going on. There were all sorts of different people from business men, regular tourists to women in amazing evening gowns in the lobby and as such the elevators were slow and sometimes crowded. Overall, the Renaissance Hollywood is a reasonably priced hotel with good amenities in a great location for tourists. As a tourist who was meeting friends that were staying at different hotels around Hollwood, I can honestly say it was perfectly placed and of a better standard than many of the other hotels around the area. Literally a minute's walk through the HH complex and you are on Hollywood Boulevard and right by the Chinese theatre. A very pleasant stay indeed, and we'll probably be back next year!
