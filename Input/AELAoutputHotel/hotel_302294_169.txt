{"text":"Outstanding Service I stayed at the Pan Pacific on a 24hr stopover on my way to Australia, I was traveling alone and was apprehensive about staying in a strange city on my own. The staff at Pan Pacific made me feel very welcome and helped me to feel at ease immediately.I had a room on the Pan Pacific floor (33rd I think) the room and views were outstanding. I ate in the hotel that evening and again the staff helped to alleviate the feeling of being alone with small touches such as giving me a magazine to read as I waited for my meal. Just a small touch which makes all the difference.Breakfast was included and could be taken anywhere in the hotel, I chose to have it in the Pacific Floor Lounge and again the service and food was excellent. My flight was not leaving until early evening and I was encouraged to wait in the hotel for as long as I wished and to avail myself of all the facilities of the pacific floor, including afternoon tea.When I took a taxi to the airport I was overcharged by the taxi driver but even this negative has been changed into a positive by the wonderful staff of Pan Pacific. I had the chance to give feedback to the hotel and mentioned this to them and over the past 3 weeks since I left, they have, traced the taxi firm through CCTV, registered a complaint on my behalf, and secured a refund of the charges from the taxi company which they have since refunded to myself. I could not have asked for better service and would definately reccomend this hotel to anyone.
