{"text":"Grreat Hotel in a Lovely City Although we are world travelers we have never been to Tokyo. I found a great package deal on Skyauction.com. It included round trip air from LAX to Narita on Northwest airlines and 7 nights at the Royal Park Hotel that ended up costing us $1644 each. It was advertised as a 4 star hotel but I think it should be 5 stars. Everyone at the hotel was very attentive and friendly, especially the girls at the bell captains desk who helped us make reservations for a trip to Kyoto on the bullet train and get tickets to a Chuck Mangeoini Jazz Concert at the Cotton Club. We had a standard room (not on the executive floor) and it was very nice. 16th floor room with large window that overlooked a large section of the city. Wonderful toiletries in the bathroom. We thought the restaurant prices were high (breakfast was $23, dinner about $100 each) so we ate at neighborhood places, which was much cheaper. The location is wonderful, as the Friendly Airport Limousine Bus terminal is just next door. We took the bus directly from Narita to the station for about $28 each. The porter from the hotel came with a cart to get our luggage. (Use the Royal Park direct line from the bus lobby). The subway is directly under the hotel and we went all over Tokyo on the subway. The hotel sells 1 day passes cheaper than at the station. (about $6). For some cheap eats, McDonalds is in the bus terminal on the 2nd floor. The terminal is immaculate and so are the subways. Very easy to get around and explore Tokyo cheaply. For a great evening, take in a concert at the Cotton Club (near Tokyo station) or go walking in the Ginza area. Take the subway to Ginza. We also booked a 1 day tour on the bullet train to Kyoto (from Tokyo City tours) that included lunch for about $225 each. Great price as we found out that the train tickets (if you buy them yourselves) are more than $275 each. The tour price inluded a lovely lunch at the hotel adjoining the Kyoto train station. (another great place with a 5 star hotel and a beautiful shopping mall). Overall, I thought the hotel was first rate and highly recommend it.Pat and Tom ElliottOrange, California ","annotations":[{"endOffset":243,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":233},{"endOffset":243,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":233},{"endOffset":243,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":233},{"endOffset":243,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":233},{"endOffset":243,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":233},{"endOffset":243,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":233},{"endOffset":243,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":233},{"endOffset":243,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":233},{"endOffset":243,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":233},{"endOffset":593,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":589},{"endOffset":1594,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1590}]}
