{"text":"Ignore the bad reviews, this place is great! Four of us, all 20 year old males, stayed at the Caribe Club Princess for a week from March 10-17th. I read the reviews on this site before we left, and was worried that they would be true, however was more then surprised to find out that the CCP was a great place, and none of the bad reviews held any merit. We ate at the buffet at least once a day, and quickly made friends with one of the waiters. We tried the Italian, Dominican, Brazilian, and Chinese ala-carte's, however really only enjoyed the Italian and Brazilian. There is snack bar near the beach that is open from noon to 6am that has hot dogs, hamburgs, nachos, salads, etc. We usually had a snack there in the afternoon and then a snack around 2am after the night was over.We mostly sat on the beach during the day, and then moved to the swim up bar in the afternoons. The bartender there was awesome, we quickly became friends with him, and he gave us excellent service. They key point here is to be nice to the staff, and they will do the same to you. We encountered a lot of young people our age on Spring Break ordering multiple drinks and yelling rapido, rapido. This is not the way to do it; just wait your turn, be polite, and you will be fine.At night, the lobby gets going around 10pm til' midnight once the nightly show is done. There is music and dancing, and then people head to the Arieto disco or to the beach bar. We tried the Disco a few times, but it is excessively loud to the point you can hear it from a long way. There are also tons of local prostitutes inside, propositioning the males. We were in there for less then 10 minutes before it started. We only went to the disco with friends, and otherwise avoided it and chose the beach bar instead. The beach bar serves drinks all night, and the bartenders were nice to us, we gave them a tip a few times and they would serve us immediately before any one else, which was nice.We did one excursion. We went on the Caribbean festival excursion which is a snorkel tour and booze cruise, and includes swimming with nurse sharks and sting rays. It was an alright trip, but a little pricey at $80 usd but I would do it again.Finally, the rooms were more then adequate. We had 2 rooms on the 3rd floor which gave us vaulted ceilings. The rooms were updated and kept clean every day, and the fridge was stocked with water, coke and sprite. Bathrooms were clean and new, and no complaints there.I read the reviews before I left, and was worried that my friends and I would not like this place. If you are young and want to have fun, or would like to be able to drink until the early morning hours, then this is the place for you. It is a 4 star resort, and a lot of people I met said that they could not tell the difference between the CCP and a 5 star, so like I said, take the bad reviews with a grain of salt.
