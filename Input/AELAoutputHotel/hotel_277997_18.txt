{"text":"OK but can be noisy on weekends Between the price I paid for the room and the Hilton name I was expecting an outstanding property. It was nice but not anything special.The good:- Large room, with separate sitting area- Good housekeeping- Proximity to hiking trails.The bad:- Room was a bit shabby (scuffed furniture), had no view, and overlooked the parking lot- Not much close by. You really need a car, although there's a Safeway and some shops about a mile north.- 5 pools, none of which are big enough to do laps in- Exercise room (for which a resort fee is charged) is underwhelming, with a limited selection of equipment- Party destination, not a luxury resort, on weekends. I stayed there Thu-Fri-Sat. Thursday night was fine. Friday night the people next door dumped a whole bag of beer bottles off their balcony. Saturday night, the same room was occupied by a different group who were up doing shots and talking and laughing on the balcony. I called the front desk at 1:15 and 2:15 and it took 45 minutes each time before things quietened down. On checkout, front desk staff were relatively unsympathetic (and the ass't front desk manager was borderline rude), saying, we have no control over who stays in our hotel rooms. True, but you do have control over how you respond to complaints, especially if your guests are paying over $125 night for your rooms.Overall, it's OK. I guess I was expecting this beautiful luxury resort and it's kind of just an ordinary hotel with a few more swimming pools. ","annotations":[]}
