{"text":"Okay stay If I could give the hotel 3.5 stars, I would, but I'll err on the side of caution. I paid about $125\/night after taxes for room 132, all the way in the back of the hotel on the first floor.Pros: Very professional and helpful staff (had maps printed for each desination that I inquired about) with a 24 hour desk, nice property, nice, clean pools, large enough grounds to not feel crowded even when the hotel is full. The hotel restaurant (Blue Iguana?) got some flack in previous reviews -- while I would not call it authentic, the prices were decent and the food always filling, not to mention the convenience of having a place to get some quick food right in the hotel. Good-sized room, well-kept property. Convenient to Seven Seas beach and highway 3 to get to El Yunque\/any points south.Cons: I'm generally not a picky hotel customer, but for the price, there were several small problems that I might have ignored had the hotel been cheaper. Doors to the outside were left open at all hours of the day, and cleaning staff left the room doors open while cleaning -- this resulted in an army of mosquitos in the room each night, and fresh bites each morning. Bathroom had a slight smell, maybe mold. The door\/lock was smaller than the frame, which led to a banging sound all night long as the door rattled with the breeze -- to accompany the knocking sound in the a\/c. Two days into the trip our cards randomly did not work for the room, although the desk was quick to replace them. In an effort to tidy up the room, the housekeeping staff occasionally stuck things in random drawers\/out of sight, which meant some hunting around to find things.All in all, as a bargain traveler, I might look for a cheaper hotel next time instead of paying for the nice facilities, which we rarely used (there's too much else to do!). If you're looking for a more relaxed vacation where you plan to spend a bulk of your time at the hotel, or for an extended business stay, this is probably a suitable place.
