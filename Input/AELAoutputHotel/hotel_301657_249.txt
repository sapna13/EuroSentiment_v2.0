{"text":"I've stayed here twice in three weeks - highly recommended! My husband and I stayed at Park Hotel Tokyo - which I'd chosen based on tripadvisor.com reviews - the first week in October while on holiday, and we couldn't have been more pleased. As I pen this using the complimentary Internet hook-up in my room, I am just wrapping up my second stay this month (this time on business). Excellent value for money. Shimbashi station is about a 10-minute walk (15 minutes when stopping at Starbucks ;), while the Oedo subway line - which I've used several times to get to such places as Roppongi - is accessible through the one hotel elevator that descends to B1 (basement 1). (The hotel has four elevators; the one on the right side, farthest from the reception desk, is the one to take to B1.) You exit into an underground hallway with restaurants; go straight out and through a revolving door, and you'll see a Family Mart convenience store on your right. Keep going, and you'll exit into an underground pedestrian walkway. Look for signs that will direct you to the Oedo line. One trick to get back to the hotel using the same underground access is to follow exits 7 and 8 from the Oedo line exit....you come out of the subway area, take a sharp right and go up an escalator. The Park Hotel Tokyo entrance is up ahead on your right (turn left and through the sliding glass doors for Starbuck's, Mailboxes Etc., convenience store with water, etc.)When my husband and I arrived for our first stay in early October, we were intent on walking to the hotel from Shimbashi station using the hotel's on-line map that I'd printed. We failed miserably - and we laughed when I remembered the one reviewer who said he is a savvy traveler (as are we) and his best advice was to take a taxi. We solved the problem later! When reading maps conveniently posted all around Japan, be sure to look for the symbol that denotes which direction is north. Turns out that maps on display here are oriented in the direction you are facing! And the map we'd consulted in Shimbashi station had North pointing down.Incidentally, my colleague reports that the Business Center on the main floor by the reception has two computers connected to the Internet with free access and printing.We bought breakfast items in a convenience store instead of having the hotel breakfast. When we asked for bowls\/spoons for our cereal, they were promptly delivered to our rooms.Also, if you like to exercise, this hotel doesn't have a fitness center. The front desk has a 1-mile-circuit jogging map, though. It's a simple, rectangular route. I would have preferred a fitness center, but the difference in room rates for another, untested hotel would likely not have been worth one.Also, when we asked the front desk personnel to help us plan how to arrive at our various meetings this week, they were more than helpful, showing us on a subway map which lines to use, etc. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":97,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":87},{"endOffset":1287,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":1277},{"endOffset":1287,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":1277},{"endOffset":1287,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":1277},{"endOffset":1287,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":1277}]}
