{"text":"Not bad like some reviews make it sound! I stayed at this hotel for the four nights immediately before Thanksgiving; a friend who lives in Miami thought we would like the area. Our stay was pleasant and we have no bad things to say about this hotel. The reviewer below me who posted last seems to have unrealistic expectations (most travelers know that the items in a minibar aren't free!!) and because I felt the resort's staff were helpful and did their jobs well, I find it hard to imagine that the sheets would have been an issue if he would have just called the housekeeping office and asked them to change his sheets... Also, I felt the property was well kept and very clean, so I have trouble with the notion that there were fleas...The pool and beach are great here! The pool was heated to a nice temperature, there were soft lounge chairs all around, and the outdoor restaurant was nice; we had good food and thought the service was friendly. The beach was immaculate and picture-perfect. Our room was rather spacious and as I mentioned before, very clean. One entire wall was a picture window which made the room bright and open with a nice view (we stayed on the 8th floor).The location was great for us. Although we went down to South Beach three of the nights for dinner, etc, we were always happy to get away from the crowds and noise. We had dinner at the hotel one night since we were leaving very early in the A.M. The restaurant's menu for dinner was good and we liked what we ordered. It was more enjoyable for us to spend our days in this quieter section... and SoBe is only a few minutes drive away. We felt like the hotel was a good value for money and can see ourselves going back again.
