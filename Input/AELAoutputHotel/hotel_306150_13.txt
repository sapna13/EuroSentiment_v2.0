{"text":"Average Hotel Trying Desperately to be Chic and Trendy Whether or not you'll like the Gallery depends on what motivates you to love a hotel. I appreciated the free internet and inclusion of breakfast in my room rate. But the rest of the hotel left me rather uninspired.The Room In their attempt to be hyper-architecturally cool they're missing basics. The closet doors are on ceiling tracks so that they 'float'. Nice looking. But they don't slide far enough to actually allow access to the drawers inside! The Bathroom: The heavy glass swinging bathroom door, which again looks very cool, is hinged only to open inwards rather than swinging in both directions. This means that when you want to get out of the bathroom, you have to back against the basin to do it. And to flush the toilet you need all the strength of either your back\/feet or shoulders\/arm as the wall-mounted button is too low for hand pushing and too high for foot pushing unless you kick. And you need to hold it in for quite a few seconds to get the desired effect. What a palaver. Nice toiletries...The Bed: AWFUL. I stayed in a standard room and the queen sized bed was harder than the worst rock-hard Asian beds I've experienced in my many travels. Thank god there were lots of pillows to try and soften the blow, but I did not get a comfortable night's sleep, which made my day at the office and flight out the next night quite tough. The Logistics: As other reviewers have mentioned, the two-lift system is a huge pain. Dragging luggage in and out of two lifts to check in-out is a huge nuisance, and there are not enough lifts to service the number of rooms at key times, so you wait forever at each juncture.The Food: The room service menu is very limited, so plan on going out for lunch and dinner. Breakfast is fine, and was included in room rate. The Staff: Staff are not particularly polite - too hip to provide any real service, I guess - but you should have little cause to call on them as the hotel is pretty self-explanatory.The Spa: I can highly recommend the Ayuthaya Thai Spa at the hotel - decent value and fantastic Thai massage\/spa treatments. i had a 2.25 hour package that included a back\/shoulder\/neck massage, thai foot massage and facial for SGD188. Of those, I'd recommend you stick to the Thai Massage and don't bother with the rest - the massage was superb. The rest was a bit pro-forma and lacking in care.All in all, I'll definitely come back to the Spa next time I'm in Singapore, but I probably won't bother actually staying at the Gallery Hotel.
