{"text":"I loved this hotel! Okay, it's the Holiday Inn Express, so you know what you're getting. It's not the ritz, but its really comfortable, and the location is great. It's in a perfectly safe area. Not slap bang in the middle of the city but walking distance from everything. (And really really close to the space needle). It also has the advantage of being right beside the Holidy Inn, which has a bar in it - there wasn't much in the way of bars nearby so that was handy. I think the Holiday Inn might also have a restaurant too but I can't remember. We paid for a basic room but got upgraded to a suite, so we had our own little kitchen with a fridge, kettle, microwave etc - which was very handy. There is no restaurant or room service in the hotel, but they have a menu for surrounding takeaways who will deliver to your room, so that was great. We got lovely pizzas from a near-by takeaway.I HAVE to coment on the breakfast bar!!! I don't usually eat breakfast at all, but I was at that breakfast bar every morning without fail. They have loads of stuff and you just go up and help yourself (so if you have a big appetite you do very well out of it cos you can take as much as you want!). You can toast your own bagels, make your own waffels, there's fruit, cereal, yoghurts, muffins, juice, eggs.....pretty much anything you could possible want. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
