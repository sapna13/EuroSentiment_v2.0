{"text":"Excellent Hotel and Staff- it is that good!!! We booked 4 nights at this hotel after a lot of searching. I was impressed by the fact that the manager took the time to read all reviews and respond. It shows someone w.ho really does care about the service the hotel is giving. I booked this break as a birthday treat for my wife.  We arrived very late at night after a cancelled flight with only 1 bag ( thanks BA!) , tired and stressed. We were greeted by the Manager who took details of our missing baggage report and said the hotel would look after the enquiries. When we got to our room on the 3rd floor we had our first pleasant surprise, it was immaculate, stylish and large Well stocked minibar-prices reasonable for a hotel. In room safe deposit. We had a room with shower only ,but it was big enough for a whole group to use. The bed was very comfortable, I don't think I slept in better. As a previous reviewer has stated, there were some really good toiletries- essential in our case as our luggage was still in England somewhere.  Then our next surprise, room service arrives with a complimentary bottle of Cava and cake to celebrate my wife's birthday. The look on my wife's face said it all. This turned around a nightmare day and set the tone for the rest of our stay. The staff were all very helpful and pleasant, particularly the lobby bar staff. As i said in the title this is an excellent hotel, with a great location, Excellent manager- one again a big thank you , and superb staff We have been to Barcelona before and will go again as we love the city. I know which hotel I'll be booking from now on.
