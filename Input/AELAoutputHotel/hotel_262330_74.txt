{"text":"average corporate hotel, lost of construction, good room service I stayed at this hotel for two days. It was convenient to the business meetings I was attending. The check-in took a while -- the clerk (only one, despite a long line of people waiting to check in) was nice.The hallway was covered in plastic (the hotel is undergoing construction) and looked very industrial\/non-plush. Not impressive at all. I got a king room on the 43rd floor (4306) with a view of the WTC site, the river, and the city beyond. The room was small, but the furnishings were modern. I liked the bed linens and great pillows (I think I used all 6!), and a flat screen TV was a nice touch also. I also liked that there was a coffee maker with two cups. I always like to have a hot beverage and don't necessarily want to order room service every time I need a cup of tea.There was an alarm clock (not too hi-tech), and the obligatory mini-bar with a selection of very expensive drinks. One of the drawers was taken up by snacks (I tried the pretzels -- 1oz bag for $4.50! - but that's to be expected, and they were fresh).The bathroom, also small, had a weird toilet with very low water level and low flow of water in general. The shower head and the fixtures were not too modern.The toiletries by Crabtree  Evelyn were pleasant smelling. The cleaning person refilled all of them (unfortunately, no cotton balls or Qtips) the next dayI wish there was a bathrobe and slippers! The safe was useful, though.The gym was adequate -- much nicer than I've seen in some other hotels, with several cardio machines, weights, water, towels and magazines. I also wanted to try the heated pool that looked relaxing, but it was rather crowded with families\/children and I decided to pass. The business center was inadequate, in my view -- you could not even acces the internet for free. What kind of business hotel is this?I thought that room service (I had 2 dinners and 1 breakfast) was good -- the food came when it should have and was fresh and tasty, but the menu choices were fairly limited, especially if you don't eat meat\/want something healthy.I would recommend the shrimp wrap (I had it twice!) and the heathy breakfast (eggwhite frittata was beautifl -- large, hot, full of veggies, and just delicious; juice, hot drink, and fruit cup).Finally, it was odd not to have the option of checking out via the TV, like most other hotels (even of much lower 'grade') have. I got a paper bill under the door overnight (the old fashioned way) and had to call the front desk to check out.Overall, this was okay, but I won't be disappointed if I never stay here again.
