{"text":"Friendly but basic The hotel is basic. Staff is friendly - well as friendly as Barcelona can get- not exactly a city known for customer service and hospitality. The location is right off Las Ramblas which in my opinion is not a necessary thing for a wonderful stay in Barcelona. What is good about it is the short walk to Placa catalunya and the shops and the Metro station that is only about 200 metres away.The Ramblas is just a loud street with no good shops, just tourist haunts and restaurants, fast food stops and full of wandering tourists and con men trying to make a quick dollar. Be aware that is unsafe at night- I wouldn't recommend it for a single woman and any nice receptionist will tell you the same, as they have often told me in Barcelona. Our rooms were extremely tiny and extremely basic, but not ugly. Bathroom was tiny- could only be used with door closed. The rooms on the top floor are rumoured to be nicer but we didn't see them. Cleanliness was okay- though we all did have some ants in our rooms. But one of our group found bedbugs in her bed and told the reception about it who promptly apologized and moved all her things into a new room while we were out. When she wanted to retrieve something left in her old room she found that they had already moved a new guest into it- the same day! That poor fella.Breakfast is basic with toast, very dry rolls and pastries, scrambled eggs, sausages, yoghurt. Service at breakfast was very friendly.Internet access in the lobby was free.We moved to another hotel for the second part of our stay to meet friends, the Apsis Milleni- this was not as close to Las Ramblas as the Sant Agusti, but at the same price had a real 4 star quality to it and was completely modern and comfortable- read our review.All in all the Sant Agusti was a basic and clean place to stay with all the necessary amenities and a friendly staff trying to please, - located right in the middle of the tourist action without being affected by too much noise.Unless you need to be right on the Ramblas or are staying in a superior top floor room you can do better.
