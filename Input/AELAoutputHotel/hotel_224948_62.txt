{"text":"We Love The Omni The Omni San Francisco staff made me smile every day of our stay in June. Our check in was great. My husband mentioned that we were celebrating our 30th wedding aniversary (15 years a piece) to Justin Seeto, the Guest Services Manager. Although he was not able to upgrade our room that night, the following afternoon we were moved to a lovely upgrade with a good bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us. That is when I really started smiling! Lex ,at the concierge desk was delightful. He took time with us to find out our interests before making some great recommendations for dining and entertainment. If you haven't done it the Alcatraz cruise is a must. We loved Golden Gate park with the De Young museum and the Tea Gardens. A short walk from there is Haight Asbury, interesting. Good restaurant, Cha Cha Cha, Caribean tapas. We loved Mamacita, gormet Mexican and the Boulevard is a must do. We were lucky enough to catch the Frida Kalo exhibit at SFMOMA which we also loved.I digress, in short everyone we encountered at the Omni was friendly, personable and seemed to be enjoying making guests happy. The dorrmen were sweethearts, with a cold water in hand on an uncharacteristically warm summer day, the housekeepers were terrific and I had a great chat with a maintenance guy on the elevator. They all made a difference and made our stay at the Omni an absolute delight. Can't wait to return.
