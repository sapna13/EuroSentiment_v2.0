{"text":"I just love this place so much we came back for a second visit Kudos to Alfredo and his staff! I decided to stay here post cruise after staying here the past September. The hotel is well kept and I liked the idea of staying on the beach and having a nice pool nearby where I could relax after a long week of cruising. On my last stay I also enjoyed hanging out at the beach with my binoculars and watch the planes from the nearby airport take off. Upon my arrival on Sunday was given a warm welcome by the front desk staff and the manager on duty whos name I can not recall came out to welcome me personally. We arrived a bit early after our cruise and before check in time but we allowed to check into our beautifull rooms.Later on in the afternoon upon returning to my room to prepare for my kayak excursion up in Farjado I noticed the staff had delivered a very tasty fruit platter. The food in the hotel is very good. After a very long walk on the beach the following morning I was extremely hungry and tried the breakfast buffet which offered any type of breakfast food you could imagine. I would recommend if you really enjoy a good breakfast.The hotel service that I experienced was top notch. Kudos to the front desk staff, the waiters and waitress in the buffet who work hard to make your meal enjoyable, Axel at the pool bar and the pool towel boys who will set up your chair with a towel on the beach. The bellhops were extremely friendly and allowed me to store my bags after checkout at noon on Monday and was allowed to use the beach and hotel facilities until leaving at 4:00 P.M. for my flight back to CT.Overall, I just love this resort and would recommend it to travelers wishing to stay close to the airport. Bob from CT.
