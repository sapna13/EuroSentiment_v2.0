{"text":"Loved it! Just back from 2 weeks at the Dominicana, our third time in the Dominican (first time here) and the best holiday yet, if not ever!great everything, although evening carabet poor, but a great laugh after a few cuba libras! younger kids loved their part, certificates etc and prizesthe two teenagers we were with discovered the nightclub on their last 2 nights and loved it-some issues about the lads having shots at the bar (both underaged) but we all have to learn sometime!without a doubt, the most friendly palce we've ever stayed in, nothing too much trouble for the staff, with or without el tipioswe found it useful to be able to cash travellers cheques in the casino-they only give you tokens for them , but either have a couple of games or just a quick drink from the free bar then they'll change them back again-no commission, fuss or anythingthere was a nice little reef off the beach, off to the right of the sports centre, look for a black patch in the sea, which was full of fish which gathered in huge shoals for bread crumbs out of a bottle or boiled eggs (from the beach restuarant) horse riding trip was great, but be prepared for a mad gallop down the beach a couple of times-take a drink of water tooloads of entertainment if you want it, although the bingo took ages because of the translationhad looked at the bavaro next door, but a much more expensive option for little more as far as we could see and a huge campus, whereas the Dominicana was nicely compact-ideal for the heatenjoy, we'll go againJohn and Co ","annotations":[{"endOffset":223,"mention":"cuba","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cuban_sandwich"],"startOffset":219},{"endOffset":877,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":873},{"endOffset":1041,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1036},{"endOffset":1041,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1036},{"endOffset":1041,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1036}]}
