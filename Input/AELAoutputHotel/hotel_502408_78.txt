{"text":"great venue We had been trawling through lots of reviews on tripadvisor for our trip to New York , undecided between a number of hotels , namely Waldorf Astoria, Affinia Manhattan and Affinia 50 , originally i wanted to go to the Waldorf....for no other reason than its global name , and it would be a giggle to have stayed where King Jofi Jaffa from Zamunda had stayed in Comming to America..but the reviews read indiferently..so we opted for the Affinia 50 ...Ok some pros and Cons.....Pro......position is fantastic , walkable to Rockafella, Grand Central,Central Park, Empire State,Chrysler, Times Square ...you know all the main attractions , Hotel is clean, staff very attentive, quality is great, we had a queen on the fifth floor....no no not Elton...a room..size was reasonable for a central New York hotel , only down side really was the smog hog machine below our room ...but hey ho its no worse than the air con running i suppose..they have a club room on the second floor (free wine\/cheese 6-7pm) ad free coffee all day...great idea and a nice place to take five after walking the streets.The guys on the front door are very helpfull and have good knowledge of the ciy ...just ask them! We stayed 4 nights and had a great time there...the Cons...not many really , its not especially cheap...but then no where in town is,the corridor decor is showing slight signs of age ..or is it my taste?? i dont know and thats about it for the cons really ...would i recomend it ..yes definately , and would i go back , yes i would , without a thought.As for the rest of the trip, New York was what i expected and so much more , its fast , its alive, but everyone is laid back and cool with it all, We arrived on the Sat afternoon , in from Newark Liberty , we arranged a super shuttle transfer on line, cost 40 dollars each return...well worth it , dead easy pick up\/drop off and collect from the hotel on the way back .est advise i can give would be to get down to Time Square asap and buy a ticket for the open top bus , they do three loops , uptown,downtown and a night loop...50 dollars gets you all three on a hop on hop off basis for 48hrs ..do the loops see where ya want to go, guides are excellent.for you guys who dont live in a city (like us) and dont use the tube\/underground....dont be affraid of the subway..its cheap ,quick and safe, you can get from Rockafeller to Battery\/wallstreet in 18 mins...Also ,dont buy into the empire state tour or the statue of liberty tour....get some discount vouchers for the observation deck on top of the Rockerfeller its fabulous! and go on the Statten Island Ferry...its free and goes right past the statue of liberty...World Tade Centre site will make you think and will almost make you cry...unless your one of those looney extremist!Central Park is just increadible , right in the middle of all the madness....tranquility!Shops bore me (the wife like em though) but they are all here and for all the nutter saddos out there the Apple Store is unnderground and looks like geeksville usa...that said ..i had to go in!tell you what surprised me the most ...the people...so polite , not as you would imagine, and very proud of their city , on a few occasions we looked a bit lost , map out, finger pointing..and regular people approached us asking if they could help or point us in the right direction...just increadible...or is it just our British ignorance? Traffic...traffic like you have never seen..its madness all day everyday...word of caution...the street crossings...when the hand is green...dont assume the traffic will stop for you!If you want any more info drop me an e-mail, no probsHope you have a good time if ya go ","annotations":[{"endOffset":160,"mention":"Waldorf Astoria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel"],"startOffset":145},{"endOffset":345,"mention":"Jaffa","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Jaffa_Cakes","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Jaffas"],"startOffset":340},{"endOffset":959,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":955},{"endOffset":1056,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1052},{"endOffset":1056,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1052}]}
