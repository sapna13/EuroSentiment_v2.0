{"text":"Royal Service, Royal Waste My husband and I just returned from the Melia Caribe. We stayed from June 27 to July 4. We opted for the Royal Service because it sounded fantastic, what a waste of money. First, the grounds were beautiful and the food was good. I researched the property for six months before our vacation so I knew what to expect. This resort is very family oriented. During our stay there were many obnoxious children in the Royal Service pool area. There were also many large groups of families. I wouldn't recommend the resort for couples. The Royal Service did not have any pluses at all. Our room was mediocre. It was very outdated. We had three bugs in our room. Anytime we went to the VIP area to ask questions the help was so busy talking to each other they didn't seem like they wanted to be bothered. We called the evening before our flight back to Ohio to arrange to have our luggage picked up but they told us to call in the morning. We called in the morning and they weren't open yet. Golf transportation can only be arranged every hour. My husband had to walk back from the golf course with his clubs because Royal Service doesn't pick you up. We didn't see any plus in Royal Service. We usually stay at Iberostar Lindo or the Grand and this place couldn't compare. It was a waiste of money. I would recommend this place only to families because they did have a nice children's area. This is not a quiet or romantic resort. If you are going on your first all inclusive you will most likely enjoy the resort but if you have been to an Iberostar property in the Mayan Riviera don't bother with this property.
