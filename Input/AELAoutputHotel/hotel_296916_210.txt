{"text":"Jazzy-Hotel in Mardi Gras-like town LOCATION: We took the bus from the airport to the nearby Placa de Catalunya for about 3 euros each. There are plenty of busses going to the Placa and they are easy to find, but don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother with their automated curb-side ticket machines. None of them worked when we were there, creating long lines of frustrated customers. You can simply buy your ticket from the bus driver upon entry. We took a taxi on our way back to the hotel instead of taking the bus (around 30 euros with all the fees) because we simply didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to deal with dragging our suitcases through the mass of humanity at the Placa. Barcelona in August is crazy busy, like going to Mardi Gras in New Orleans. The hotel itself is clean, sleek and new, and just far enough from the Placa to provide a sense of refuge. The place used to be a bus station, making it an interesting and fun lay-out. The staff was helpful and gave us free maps. The University metro stop is right outside the hotel, and yes, you do hear the underground rumbling in your room which sounds like an elevator. I wore earplugs to counteract it and slept well. Frankly, the party girls in the hallways at all hours were a greater problem. ROOMS: We booked months ahead of time and got a lovely courtyard double room for only 105 euros, a great value for high season in Barcelona. Our beds were comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. Like others, we had issues with getting water all over the floor from the partially enclosed shower. My daughter had to blow-dry her hair in the bedroom because she was worried she√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° electrocute herself standing in the puddles of water. There is a drain in the floor outside the shower but it doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ help much. We could have used more soaps, towels and tissue paper, but we got a nice supply of razors, toothbrushes, etc. BREAKFAST: We ate the 15 euro breakfast most days as it was too good, fast and convenient to pass up. You can also watch German MTV while you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e eating with all the international travelers and their families in the breakfast room. POOL: A happy place. You can order up food and lay in the sun while looking at the view (and the occasional topless sunbather). INTERNET: There are two Internet computers next to the bar, but the rooms themselves offer excellent free wireless. ROOM SERVICE: If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e feeling overdone by all the Spanish ham and heavy meats, order up the vegetarian pizza. Delicious. OVERALL: This place is cool without trying too hard, a fun hotel with no snobbish airs, and an excellent value if you book ahead. Just be prepared for a party if it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ August.
