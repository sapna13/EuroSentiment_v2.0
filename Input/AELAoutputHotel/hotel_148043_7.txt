{"text":"On business, and I am in love with El Convento A mix between 4-star and local, your room is one of 50+ in an extraordinary, converted convent. The care taken to maintain its beauty and charm is second to none (I saw them varnishing the banisters and polishing the stunning antique furniture). Hospitable, unpretentious, generous, El Convento deserves a Best Of nod amongst leading American hotels to which we've grown accustomed, from the finest Schragar and Hilton properties, to the extraordinarily Ritz Carltons and Four Seasons. All the amenities are the same with the exception of a concierge, including privacy, comfort and elegance. The bed is delicious, and there are no smells to speak of which are notable in old cities and on islands. And the 24-hour, rooftop hot tub, plunge pool and fresh coffee are the icing on the cake. It's a safe, perfect location for romance (especially a much needed escape) and business meetings (a board room, outdoor\/indoor library and business center) and has excellent restaurants. You'll never feel like you're on a hotel property...there's a courtyard that shades diners from the beating sun below, while rooms rise 3 floors above it on three sides of the building. You'll feel like you went back in time, though spoiled by the modern offerings. The place was nearly fully booked, and I rarely saw guests except at the nightly wine and cheese reception, most of whom were on vacation, there for a wedding, or on honeymoon. Convinced? I'm a snobby NYer who travels for work regularly, so please don't even consider the Sheraton in the same area but opposite 17-story-high cruise ships and other tourism clutter. You'll get what you bargained for -- literally -- if you do.
