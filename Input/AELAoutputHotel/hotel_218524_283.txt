{"text":"I want to go back now! Got back from the resort two weeks ago, and I am dying to go back. We had a fantastic time, and my only regret is that we didnt stay longer.Beach is beautiful. Walk down to the log for calm waters. It is like a pool! You get the best of both worlds: waves to jump or calmness to relax in.The entertainers were awesome. They were friendly, upbeat and fun! Thank you Alexandra, Franklin, Juan Carlos, Joel, Joanna, Rolando and Wilkens. You made our trip exciting.Restaurants- We ate at Toscana (which we disliked immensely). Barcelona was okay. Agave and Chez Isabelle were wonderful. Rooms- Were pretty and spacious. Clean. The only downside was that one of the two rooms we occupied definitely had a smell, permeating the entrance area of the room. The other room was fine.Pool- warm, relaxing. Our only complaint is that some people hog floaties. They will keep them next to their beds even when they are not using them. They are not meant to be removed form the pool, but some people ignore that rule, and refuse to share. Despite this we were able to find them by swimming the length of the long pool when we needed.Tips-We never felt like anyone expected a tip. Bloody Marys at the Martini bar were good, however my dirty martini at the club Alegria was terrible. Shows- two were great, a singer (cant remember his name) and the circus act. We found the other two shows to be corny- the stars show and the magic show. We didnt sit through either one. The belly dancing warm up act was terrible. I have taken 3 belly dancing classes and am pretty sure I could have performed at the same par.The only thing that did bother me was that it seemed impossible to get food to eat by the pool or beach. The only option was pizza or the beach bbq. There are no snacks available at all! Ice cream there is not what we were used to. The flavors taste nothing like they are supposed to. Strawberry tasted like some sort of bubble gum. Vanilla doesn't exist!Bugs- We only got bitten our last night- the night we were outside for a few hours, and suspect that our bug spray had worn off. The other nights we were bite free which we achieved by spraying bug spray before we went out for dinner every night.I had so much fun and relaxation that I am trying to get my group to go again next year!
