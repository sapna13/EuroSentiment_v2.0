{"text":"Great Place I think this is a great hotel. I disagree with a lot of the other reviews about noise and the lifts. We never had a problem with noise. We could not hear anything from the rooms next door and we were there for 5 nights. The lifts - we never waited more than a minute for the lifts to arrive and they were never full when they did arrive. We had a very spacious room on the 8th floor that did not look dated or old. It had a very comfortable king size bed (we made a special request for this) a two seater lounge, a work desk and a huge bathroom. There was one issue with the bathroom and that being when in the shower it was rather dark because there is no light near the shower and the shower curtin is very thick there for not letting any light in. Not a major problem at all. The hotel is in the best spot right on the beach, you walk out the back door and your on the sand. We walked up and down the beach each evening and some of the more expensive hotels have nowhere in front of the hotel whereyou can lay on the beach, some don't even have a beach, it's all rocks. I noticed a few people on here complain about the pool. Why would you use the pool when you have such a beautiful beach right in front of you? It's a safe beach too, small waves and no dangerous currents. We loved sitting on the balcony each evening with a beer or a glass of wine watching the turtles swimming and the surfers surfing. The view and sunsets are to dye for. We upgraded from a partial ocean view room to an ocean view room, they offered this to us on check in and we were glad we got a better room, we had to pay for it though. We ate at dukes one night and I am sorry to say that it was awful. I found most of the food in Waikiki to be tasteless and awful. I am sorry if I have offended anyone but I now realise how lucky we are in Australia to have great tasting fresh food. We also made use of the little sandwich shop under the hotel. It's cheap and they make your sandwich fresh on the spot. There was no mini bar in our room but I think that was a good thing becausewe all know how inflated mini bar prices are in hotels. There is an ABC store right across from the hotel so you can get everything you need form there. In summary this is a top hotel, it's in a great spot, it has great views,the rooms are very comfortable and the staff are friendly.
