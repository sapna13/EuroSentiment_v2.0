{"text":"A great holiday I have to say reading everyone else's reviews before I went was not a good idea, as they were all so negative before I went away. I went there very worried. I came back thinking it was fine, the resort is fine! All worried for no reason.Firstly I have decided to review this resort and counter some of the bad reviews the place has had recently. So please read the last few reviews to understand.1. The food.Was fine! There was variety, and different themes each night, and I would recommend you try the themed food as that is the freshest and nicest! I managed to have a different meal each day, lunch and dinner, and not once did I get a tummy complaint (and I suffer from IBS!). Note: If you get an undercooked bit of meat - ask them to cook it better - its not hard to do - 'Bien Hecho' means well done. Although I have to say I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see any 'pink' meat.I think what also helped is we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ restrict ourselves to the resort either, although on AI deal, we went to a fab fish restaurant called Jellyfish (amazing!!), and also the Hard Rock. We made the holiday work for us not the other way around.The ala carte restaurants. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think you should bother. The Mexican isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ that good but they are nice in there. The Creperie during the day was lovely.2. BeachWas amazing. And I would recommend if you want a chilled holiday - namely couples √à√\u2020\u2022?with no kids or little kids √à√\u2020\u2022?go in mid September. We always got a lounger on the beach (no matter what time i.e no need to get up at 6.30am!) √à√\u2020\u2022?in fact it was deserted most the time and very quiet and yet the weather was fab (even better was the rain tended to fall in the middle of the night and only happened a couple of times therefore not even noticeable).3. Pools.Didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ actually go in them because the beach was so fab, but the pools were always being used so can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have been that bad or dirty!4. Rooms.Fine fine fine!! Mini bar √à√\u2020\u2022?free! Rooms huge. All in all fab. Cleaners did a fab job. No roaches, pests, great Air Con. Fine fine fine!5. Sellers.Yes there are some a couple of nights a week outside the restaurant and on beach they would walk by. But to be honest they really didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ pester us that much, if at all. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not a problem.6.Reception.Checkin and checkout was easy and not slow. The girls on reception not smiley but the guys were and to be honest √à√\u2020\u2022?do I really care of one girl on reception doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ smile at me? Not really.7. Saftey.Well I was never worried, and it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a problem.Maybe because I had read everyone else√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ reviews I was extra safe. I always carried my safe key with me and never left anything out on the bed or anywhere in the room. I never gave them an opportunity to steal. All in all, this was a good holiday. It is not the best holiday resort ever, but I knew that from the start √à√\u2020\u2022?I paid very little for this holiday, and therefore I got exactly what I was expecting. A nice resort, with nice friendly staff, nice food, nice drink and nice all round. If you want a better holiday then pay thousands for it and you will get it. You get what you pay for and I got a lovely holiday.
