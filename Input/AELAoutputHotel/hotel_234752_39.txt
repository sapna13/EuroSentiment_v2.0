{"text":"Still Great! Just stayed at the Nine-Zero and am happy to report that it is still a great destination when visiting Boston. I haven't been there since the first year they opened and was delighted to see that most things are still up to par. The most alluring feature of this hotel is the location - I can't imagine a more convenient hotel in all of Boston. It's sleek\/hip design is also very cool. But, like all trendy hotels, it seems to tire from hipness. While still sharp, nothing really has changed since I've been there 4 or so years ago.The room is very comfortable and stylish but was showing slight signs of wear (minor wall scuffs, slightly aging furniture). Also, on my first visit the robes and towels were Frette and that was no longer the case. The Mario Russo products were great but seemed to be smaller in size. And the cheap plastic made it difficult to actually get the shampoo or conditioner out. And, as mentioned in another review...it is a little tacky that there are so many things for sale in the room. The bed was super comfortable and very roomy. A luggage rack would have been nice.One great addition from my last stay was the evening cocktail hour. Nice wines were served in the lobby from 5-6. A nice touch. Staff was friendly and helpful. Needed some extra soap and it was sent up promptly. As instructed, when I needed my car I called about a half hour before hand. I came downstairs and it was ready and waiting. Although the $38 fee is quite steep!The Nine-Zero is no bargain but look around the web. I got a great rate through one of their promotions and it was actually a little cheaper than comparable hotels such as the Hilton.
