{"text":"Excellent We visited Bali Tropic Resort and Spa for 2 weeks in September for our honeymoon and we have to say this is the best holiday either of us have had.Bali Tropic Hotel was much more than we expected. The staff are so friendly and the bar staff remembered our first names for the duration of our stay. The manager of the hotel even came and saw us off on our last day and thanked us for staying at their hotel.We stayed in a deluxe bungalow which was newly refurbished. We were a bit dismayed when we arrived and noticed we had twin beds, but as soon as we mentioned it the room was re- arranged and we ended up with the biggest double bed I have ever seen!! The rooms were clean and well air conditioned and where well stocked with toiletries and mineral water.We stayed all inclusive and the choice of food is vast, although you do really need to like rice and noodles as they are avaliable for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you fancy a change there is a 24hours a la carte restuarant that serves pizza, burgers, toasted cheese sandwiches and a lovely spag bol !!The grounds of the hotel are amazing. I have never seen so much greenery and beautiful flowers. There are always staff around washing down the paths, picking up leaves and generally keeping the place spotless.The beach is nice, although the sand is yellow in colour and quite shelly. The sea is clear, but quite seaweedy.To be honest, we spent most of our time around the lovely pool. It is not massive but is big enough for the amount of guests that can stay at the hotel. Most of the time the pool was relatively empty and we never had to wait to be served at the pool bar.There is entertainment in the evenings which consists of a 4 piece band of local men that play your requests and a duo who play 2 nights a week. Our overall verdict of the Bali Tropic Resort and Spa is 10\/10. The manager is working hard to make improvements all the time and I must say, it is working.We are hoping to go back and visit all at Bali Tropic in the next couple of years we loved it so much.To give you an idea of how good it is, we met an English couple when we were there and it was their 18 visit to Bali Tropic - that says it all really !!!
