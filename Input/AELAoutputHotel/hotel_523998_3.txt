{"text":"Slowest Check In Ever Witnessed The location of this hotel really can not be beat for the money. It is a half block from the Chong Wen Men subway station, there is plenty of good shopping and restaurants nearby and although it would be a long walk, it is near the Temple of Heaven and the Forbidden City. The rooms are of decent size and the most of the rooms offer great views of the city. Make sure you get a higher floor because the streets are are very noisy and busy. The rooms are clean and come very well equipped, including toothbrushes and toothpaste. If there is one bad thing about the rooms is that the beds are very hard, but that seems typical for China. All this being said, you can experience this good hotel only once you have checked in, which could be a little trying on the patience. First they have to look something up on the computer, then several pieces of paper have to be written out, then back to the computer, more paper is filled out, another computer is logged onto, your passports are then examined, more paperwork, then finally the last computer seems to issue you room information. All of this efficiency is easily done with no less then 5 front desk clerks working on my one reservation. Luckily no one else was attempting to check in at the time, or else this may have overloaded the system. All-in-all this was a great hotel to stay at. The breakfast buffets were ok at $15, but lacked fresh fruit and oatmeal. Oh and one more thing, stay away from the doughnuts!
