{"text":"You get what you pay for... The downs: There are only showers...the furnishing is dated...parking is tight and very limited...no pay per view...no hot tub.The ups: Rooms were clean...kitchenette can come in handy...centrally located...staff was excellent.I had read the reviews on this property and expected the worse...But I figure you get what youpay for and if want budget thats what I would be getting. And yes, while I would consider this a budget property, I feel you get more then your monies worth. To knock down some of the negatives:1) There was no MOLD in the bathrooms...I spoke with the staff and they said that there was a time when the shower tiles had been GLAZED and the GLAZE would start to peel. Some poeple thought is resembled mold.2) Bugs...HELLO...the property is actually in the shape of an L and is not enclosed, so yes there are instances when a gecko, mosuito and even a flying (YES FLYING) roach will make is to a Hallway and\/or room.3) the Views...Yes the bulk of the rooms face another building or parking structure. But if you are spending that much time in your room to care...then you should have stayed HOME...or BOOKED an OCEAN FRONT ROOM at the HILTON.4) There was no restaraunt when i was there in JUNE...but I heard they have one NOW.5) The Small pool...the pool is a good size for the amount of rooms the property has...believe me, I seen larger properties with smaller pools. 6) parking...yes parking is tight...limited and expensive. But as most return vistors know...there is really no need for a car...most tours on Oahu provide transportation so the car is sitting in the garage most of the time anyway.Finally...When I went back to look over the reviews, i had realized that the bulk of these were written well over 1 year ago...I don't even think it was called the Hokele Suites back then. the staff told me something like MARK Waikiki.
