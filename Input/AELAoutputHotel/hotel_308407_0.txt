{"text":"Beautiful Garden Bungalows We arrived in Bali on the 8th November and stayed at the Santika for 14 days in room 188 - Garden Bungalow. The room is nice and big - perfect for a longer stay with its own couch, lay back chair, desk, 2 settees and a coffee table still with plenty of room to move and store all your Bali bargains... Like most people have said, the gardens are just gorgeous and its fantastic that you can walk straight onto the beach - thanks to the beach works.The food is quite expensive, for what it is - although room service was lovely every time. The egg bar at breakfast was the saving point for me as there isn't really a big variety to keep a person happy as its a bit repetitive. The Sunset Beachfront Restaurant has a fantastic view, but is a bit over priced. Its a great place to sit back, have a Bintang and watch the setting sun.The sun lounges that face the beach are in the perfect position to get some bargains, a massage or manicure from some of the locals. Rosey, who does manicures and Carmen who does massages were both just lovely ladies! We utilised them both many times during our stay. We also found a fabulous driver called Aan Yudianto who has a little beach store in between the Santika and Bali Dynasty Hotel. If you use these fabulous people tell them Mrs Simone and Mr Brian sent you! Overall, my husband and I loved the Santika. The staff were always willing to help and nothing was too much to ask. Although we didnt see the inside of any of the other rooms, so we can only vouch for room 188!!
