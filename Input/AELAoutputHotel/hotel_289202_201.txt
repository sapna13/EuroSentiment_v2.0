{"text":"Excellent base from which to explore Venice Based on the glowing user reviews at tripadvisor.com I decided early on that I wanted to stay here with my famiy when we visited Venice. I booked in early February after a long conversation during which I made clear that I wanted two joined rooms for our family of three. This turned out not to be possible (the hotel was planning to introduce apartments in a separate building, but they weren't in service at that point, I was told) so I settled for a three-person room overlooking the canal.The one big advantage of the Antiche Figure is that you can get there by foot in about three minutes from the station, saving you the need to fight your way onto a vaporetto with bags. The first impression of the room was not good, since we were bowled over by the smell of cigarette smoke when we opened the door. I went down to reception and was told they had no record of a specific request for a non-smoking room (although they knew we were travelling with a young child).Overall, we enjoyed our stay. The breakfasts were very good.The room was air conditioned, comfortable and not too noisy despite facing on to the canal, although you won't be able to sleep in much beyond 7.30 am when the boat traffic really starts up. There are plenty of vaporetto stops outside the station which makes exploring the city very easy. There also is a high-speed internet terminal in reception for clients, which I found useful.The one thing that did bug me was that every time I was in reception and guests came in, I seemed to hear them being told their apartments were ready or that they were being upgraded to a suite at no extra charge. The hotel had known in early February that I really wanted an apartment or suite-type arrangement andyet they made no effort to inform me when these types of accommodations became available. I'd willingly have paid the extra. ","annotations":[]}
