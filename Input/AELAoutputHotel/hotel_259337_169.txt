{"text":"I had a great time but could have used these tips....... We had an awesome time. So relaxing. Beautiful beach. Gorgeous grounds. Nice room. Friendly staff. Here's what I wish I knew before I went:-Tourist Visas. When you arrive at the airport terminal, head straight for a counter that says Tourist Visa and buy a $10 card for each guest. It's a government tax card you will need to get into the country. Buy this BEFORE you line up for customs. It's required. -Hotel Shop. Everything in the store at the hotel is way overpriced so if you need anything basic, you are really in trouble. Sunscreen was $26!! Do yourself a favor and pack more than enough sunscreen (the sun is very very strong). -First Aid. Bring medications, band-aids, neosporin, immodium, pepto, etc. You are coming to a third world country and the hotel has no first-aid kit or free medications - not even aspirin. Be prepared for possible stomach ailments due to (I believe) adjusting to new cuisines. My boyfriend had a little bug for about a day and a half. I was fine. Don't panic but it's a possibility.-Excursions. Don't overpay. I met people who were offered a snorkeling trip for $78 each. My boyfriend and I went to the Dolin Dive center (right near the beach next to the gym\/spa) and paid $25 for a nice 1.5 hour excursion to the same place these guys were going. -Beach chairs. There are not enough of them. It's annoying but play the game. Get to the beach at 6am, put your towels down and go back to bed. When you come back they will be there. Or you could put them out the night before. Everyone does it. It's not worth it to fight with some stranger on vacation.-The Europeans. I think they just aren't that friendly because they don't know how to address you. There are several languages spoken here so I found saying Hola! no matter where someone was from elicited a smile. -Spanish. I'd like to address the Americans who come to a Spanish speaking country and are surprised that the staff doesn't speak English. Please represent the States with a little more class and adjust to your surroundings. Most staff know just enough to get by and it's not rocket science for one to say Yo quiero agua, por favor. Get a Spanish for travelers book and make the effort. It's appreciated.-Tips. Bring $100 worth of singles and keep some in your pockets. The staff is very appreciative and it helps if you need something special. Besides these people have nothing and they bust their butts to keep tables clean and drinks flowing.-Other than that, take a lot of pictures to make your friends jealous and have a blast. If you have any questions, you can email me via this website. Buenos Dias!
