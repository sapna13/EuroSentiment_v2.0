{"text":"Surprisingly Great hotel in the best location! (When I got the room, it was ranked the 3rd, but now I see it's at the top deservingly so!!)I just came back from a week trip from Madrid, and all my boyfriend and I talked about all throughout the journey back home was how great the hotel was!Tripadvisors did not disappoint us as usual. I had a bit of reservation with the brand Best Western as it doesn't carry anything near to what I would expect from a nice hotel brand in US. However, I trusted Tripadvisor and there again, another bull's eye! The review was accurate and correct.We booked the room via Expedia and got Superior Room which basically has a double bed than two single beds. My boyfriend requested that we get a room with a King-sized bed with balcony, and the got the response right back saying they cannot guarantee the balcony, but we will definitely get a double bed. When we checked in, they congratulated our anniversary (which he mentioned in the email), and got the room 808, the corner room on the highest floor that has the view of Gran Via (9th floor doesn't have any rooms. Only the lounge and roof-deck). It was a pleasant surprise how big the room was! Also, the bed was definitely not a double-sized bed in American standard. It was a king.The decor was very elegant and the bathroom was huge!! I travel all the time on business and get checked into 5-star hotels all around the world, but this was one of the biggest bathroom i've ever had. Especially for European standard, this was enormous.There was a separate vanity in the room with a separate hairdryer (there was one in the bathroom as well). And the bathroom had an old-style bidet as well as the seatcover (like in public bathroom). To a germiphobic like me, this was a great addition. All the amenities were there and promptly replenished every day. The housekeeping had two services daily and it was impeccable! Also, I liked the fact that they knew that we were in the room though there was no do not distub sign available. Maybe they knew so because the keycard was placed in the entrance card holder. Very nicely sized safe, and two luggage holders, generous closets as well as sleepers and robes were all the signs of the 5-star hotel room. I wouldn't call this hotel 4 star, but the room itself was nothing less than 5-star! The view was great, and since we were located on the higher floor, we didn't have those metal shutters, but still the noise was blocked off with just the windows.The laminated wooden floor was very nice and clean, and something you rarely see in a hotelroom. The staff was helpful and also spoke English. We did have breakfast at the hotel, which was 9 euros per person. It was nothing great or spectacular, but easy enough and also cheap. Compared to what you need to pay outside of the hotel, 9 euros was a steal! They do have the tea time and happy hour on the 9th floor lounge, but I was not too impressed with the service: Probably with the serving staff himself who seemed to have an attitude problem, but we let it go and didn't bother to check back to the lounge. After all, you're in the middle of the city with full of bars and outdoor cafe where you can have a nice sip of wine. So, why would you confine yourself in the hotel lounge?One thing we did notice is that, the demographic of this hotel is quite skewed to the older generation. Maybe because I saw most of the guests in the breakfast which younger people tend to skip. But this is no indication of anything of the hotel quality. I also noticed a couple of business travelers as well.All in all, this was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed. The nice room, housekeeping, the location and the convenience was all there! Enjoy your drinks and meals outside of the hotel then this will truly serve you the best!!!------- ","annotations":[{"endOffset":459,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":455},{"endOffset":2859,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":2856},{"endOffset":3199,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3195},{"endOffset":3647,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3643}]}
