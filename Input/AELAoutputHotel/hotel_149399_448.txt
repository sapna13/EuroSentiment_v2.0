{"text":"Middle of the Road Upon arrival to Melia Cabri Tropical, we were pleased- very very clean, open resort. The language barrier is tough- not many on staff speak even broken English. The check-in process was terrible and the staff were not helpful at all- very lax.Our initial Villa (#20) was nice, but too far from the beach, so the following day we moved closer to the beach area (#33)- due to the size of the resort, it was a good 10 minute walk from Villa #20 to the pools\/beach so we were happy to move BUT, our new Villa didn't have AC and while they assured us they were working on it, that never happened! As well, there were a few ants (maybe to be expected in such a tropical place) but overall, not the worst but not 5 star (maybe 3).The food (lunch\/breakfast at the buffett) was good- they had it all, pizza-hamburgers-hot dogs-chicken-fries- and the list goes on. If you can't find something you like, you're too picky to be leaving your own kitchen. As well, the ala cart restaurants were good (make reservations the day of dinner, not the night before)- the American Grill was fantastic (the chix wings were awesome) but the French restaurant was bad- the lobster was terrible!!! but can't win them all, got try them out and find what you like. (the mexican was good too).The pool area was great- bartenders friendly; the drinks were good- beers beer! the mixed drinks were a bit sweet but it depends on the bartender. Great weather- friendley people- and the Spa was nice too (for adults, go to the pool next to the spa, it's quiet, not crowded and relaxing!)- Overall, a good trip! BUT don't fall prey to the time share nazis that try and get you to tour their Royal Service Hotel (2 hrs) and buy into it for......$32,0000!!!!! Thats right, for a mere $325.00\/mth for 10yrs you can become a Royal Service member! Have Fun- bring lots of sun block and don't drink the water!!!!
