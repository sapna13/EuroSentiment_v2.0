{"text":"The smallest bath I have ever seen My wife and I have just returned from a three night romantic break to Barcelona, where we stayed in the Grupotel Gravina. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this hotel, but it did fall short in a number of important areas.Firstly, our room had the smallest bath I have ever seen. I'm not particularly tall, but even a child would have struggled to fit into the bath. So far as I could tell, this √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°eature√à√\u2020\u2022?was common across a number of rooms. There was a shower, but I prefer baths and booked the hotel on the understanding that my room would have a bath.Secondly, the hotel told my wife and I that it was impossible to give us more than 1 key (between the two of us) for the room. This is possibly the most ridiculous claim I have ever heard from a hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?but they were adamant that they could not give us a second key.Thirdly, the hotel is arranged across two adjoining buildings: floors 1 and 2 in the first building and floors 3 and upwards in the other building. The adjoining building faces out on to a very busy main road and not the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√∫uiet side street√à√\u2020\u2022?that the first building is on. The road is busy not just with traffic but through much of the night, also busy with revellers, due to its proximity to Las Ramblas. Expect noise.On the plus side, the staff were friendly and helpful. (They also appeared to be genuinely apologetic about the shortcomings mentioned above.) Furthermore, the bed was comfortable and the breakfasts were excellent. Another nice touch was the free internet access provided by the hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?WiFi was available throughout, or a couple of PCs in the lobby were dedicated to internet access.Overall, it's not a bad hotel, but for the price I paid I expected better.
