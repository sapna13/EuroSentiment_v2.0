{"text":"Loved the Hampton Inn Blue Lagoon!!! Caught the complimentary shuttle to the hotel from the Miami Airport. About a ten minute ride. On entering was checked in quickly and assigned a room as requested. The desk staff is muy simpatico and always had a genuine smile. Like nearly everywhere in Miami, all of the staff was bilingual and the first language was spanish. I haven't seen a well oiled desk staff like this in a long time but it was very welcome and a great way to start off our cruise vacation. Got the luggage cart and headed up to check in to our room overlooking the airport and lagoon to the north. Our room was clean and well made up with a small table and two chairs at the window. That made for a nice spot to read while watching the international traffic at the airport and jetskis in the lagoon. The view from the top floor was great to watch and was still far enough from the airport that there was very little, if any, noise. Beds were comfortable and pillows were great.We went down to check out the pool and grabbed a complimentary banana along with some coffee. This lobby area is clean and well decorated. The drink and (healthy!) snack supplies were generous and always available. The pool and hot tub were clean and swimming was refreshing.Internet was accessed wirelessly with a hotel assigned code (changed every 24 hours). It was speedy and there wasn't a place in the hotel I couldn't get connectivity.One of the nice things staying here pre-cruise is that you can do your shopping here by just going across the street. There is a supermarket and liquor store along with a small strip mall to the west, while to the south there is a Wendy's, McDonalds, Walgreens and CVS. For dinner, we were able to use the hotel shuttle (with a decent tip) to get over to the 94th Aero Squadron for dinner. It is only about a 1\/4 mile north of the hotel, but walking was out of the question due to the lack of sidewalks all the way there. We simply called the desk for a pickup and the driver stopped on his way back from the airport to get us back to the hotel. Great service (and a decent tip) went a long way toward making this a comfortable start.The morning breakfast was appetizing but not overly done down in the second floor lobby. To get to the port, we asked the front desk for cab recommendations. They offered to call a cab for us and since we had a lot of luggage and the family, they made sure it wasn't a sedan, but a GMC Suburban instead. Checkout was a breeze and again the desk staff was enthusiastically friendly. A quick 20 minute cab ride dropped us and our luggage right at the cruise terminal.In my book, this is a hard package to beat. Great rates, clean rooms, great staff, extra ameneties, incredible service and pre-cruise last minute shopping right across the street. Easy to recommend!!
