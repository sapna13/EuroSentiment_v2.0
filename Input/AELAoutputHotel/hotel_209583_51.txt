{"text":"Amazing time will go back next year!!!!!!! I just returned home from a week stay at the Barcelo Palace and loved every second of it and wanted to extend my stay!!! I was hesitant in booking this hotel after all the mixed reviews but i am glad that I did. People have to keep in mind that they are going on vacation in a very poor country so not everything is going to be the best of the best. I could find nitpicky things that I did not like about the hotel but nothing out of the ordinary that you could not find anywhere else.One thing that I will do different next time is take a direct flight there because it is so so so so worth it. So here goes my review:Hotel: The grounds were kept very clean and manicured. I always saw workers mopping the floors and trimming the palm trees. The premises were never dirty with any trash, leaves and if there was a mess the workers were right on top of things. There is a lot of security guards standing around each block of rooms which made me feel secure since it got very dark at night. My boyfriend and I took the Barcelo Express (shuttle trolley) to the other hotels on the property and the Palace had the best of everything (food\/pool\/atmosphere).Rooms: By no means are they five stars but I would say a three(?). The room is decorated in peach colors and brown wicker. King bed, balcony w\/ place to sit, small table and chairs in room, TV and desk. The bed for me was uncomfortable but my boyfriend had no problem with it. I like my matress soft and he likes it more firm but not a big issue for me. The TV only had two english channels, CNN and a movie channel that played the same two movies over and over again. You could pay for more english channels but the only time we were in the room was to sleep and take naps. The bathroom was small but not a vacation killer.Food: Again your in a different country the food is going to be different from what you are used to. If something didn't look good to me or tasted funny I didn't eat it. Use your head and everything will be fine. I always found things that I could eat mostly grilled chicken, boiled vegetables and rice. The OJ was the best fresh, squeezed!!!!!Beach\/Weather: The beach was beautiful, very much topless, but beautiful. I'm more of a pool person and spend most of my time there. The weather was 80-82 everyday and at night 74-76 with a cool breeze People: Not a lot of people speak english so it is best to learn some common phrases. I never had a problem with the staff at the hotel everyone was nice but there was one bartender that was annoyed that I was asking what each fruity drink was. Guess what......no tip for her......not a big deal. I do have to say at the casino the bartenders Maximo and Dolca make the best drinks and are extremely nice people I enjoyed talking with them.I really enjoyed my stay at the Palace and I hope this helps anyone else that is nervous about booking this place for their vacation.
