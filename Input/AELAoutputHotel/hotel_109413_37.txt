{"text":"The Magnolia wilted Particulars:* Second time to stay at hotel* Booked suite - separate living area and kitchen* Stay during TX-OU weekend (big college football game during the first weekend of October) - Friday thru Sunday* Received 14-day advanced booking promotional rate of about $260USD per night from hotel websiteComplaints:* Carpet stained, worn* Cleaniness lacking, especially in bathroom - floors appeared dirty, prior guest hair in bathtub drain and on floor* Thin pillows* Phone in living area didn't work correctly - intermittant dial tone* Room service order incorrect - ordered salad with dressing on side...received no dressing; ordered wrap with no onions...received onionsCompliments:* Location, location, location! Very close to DART light-rail line which can take you to many locations.* Complimentary milk and cookie service - soft, chewy cookies, yum!* Complimentary continental breakfast - bagels, coffee, tea, juices, muffins...not bad!* Kitchen, although not used by me, appeared to be well equipped for preparing meals--pots, pans, dinnerware, full-size fridge, microwave, stovetop* Considering it was in the middle of downtown Dallas, my room was quietConclusion:Unless The Magnolia has a really great rate deal, I will not stay here again. The fact that some things were not clean leads me to the conclusion that their quality control may be a little too lax for my standards. Granted, most homes aren't the picture of cleanliness, but when you stay at a hotel, you expect a little more attention to detail. Next time I am in the Dallas area, I will look for another hotel to stay at. With the extension of the DART rail-line, it is possible to stay at hotels outside the Downtown area and still be able to get around without an automobile.
