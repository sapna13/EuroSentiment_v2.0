{"text":"Nice hotel in the ghetto Last week, I went to Boston by myself to see 2 Sox games and I found out about that hotel. Best Western has got a good standard. Clean room, decent breakfast. This hotel, however, is difficult ro rate.First of all, should we downgrade it because of its impersonnal, almost impolite greetings by its counter hostesses? No smile, no words of greetings, just a you got your credit card?. Really, if I were the manager, I would question myself about the way I trained my staff on that matter.Second and foremost, the hotel itself is located in a very bad and dirty, noisy part of town. The nicepart part about it is the shuttle that allows us to get out of that hood...Parking is free,,,yeah, whata conveniance....you have to park your car in the lot of a gas station. No security and a lot of people roving at night. Homeless, strange figures walking around and about. I even set my alarm at night so I would go see if my car was still there...The Mc Donald across the street could certainly be considered one of the dirtiest in the whole country, let alone poor service and bad customer service habits.About the hotel itself, the free, help yourself breakfast was lush and generous. Nothing to say, really. It got me started well. Air conditionning needs some reconditionning, if you know what I mean. Inconsistent, too cold, too warm, difficult to regulate. My neighbours were once told to open their windows if they wanted to getfresh air...wow....even with the windows closed, you can hear the city life...ambulances, traffic, honking,,..Next time I go back to Boston, I will try another hotel in another area. An area which is going to be cleaner, more upscale and certainly more appealing.Thanks to the shuttle drivers for allowing me to escape, on several occasions.It you can avoid this hotel, do it.
