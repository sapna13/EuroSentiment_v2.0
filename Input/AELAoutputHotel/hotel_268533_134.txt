{"text":"Brilliant hotel! Best location for the Wharf! We were lucky enough to get a really good rate at the Argonaut - only $209 a night for 4 nights incl NYE, which is very good value for the location  time of year that it was. On the Wharf and beside the Cable car base, The Argonaut Hotel is right in the heart of what San Francisco is all about. Views of the Golden Gate bridge if you're lucky enough to have a room with a view, and the walk from the hotel along the wharf to Pier 39 is charming - lots of cute shops  San Francisco character.Rooms are clean  spacious, with a big TV, DVD player, ice bucket replenished daily if you want it  a cute chocolate surprise every evening at turn-down time. The beds are the most comfortable we've ever slept in at any hotel!! The hotel staff are friendly, providing complimentary wine tasting evenings everyday at 6pm - and they aren't shy with the wine  refills!!!The only drawback for the hotel is the restaurant - do not have dinner there!!! Whilst breakfast is definitely worth having, our dinner experience was 1 that goes into our book of dining catastrophes! They don't have a bar of any decent standard but there are a couple of Irish bars within a 2 min walk of the hotel, so that didn't cause us a problem.We love San Francisco and are already planning a return trip, and if we can get such a good rate from the Argonaut Hotel again, we will definitely be returning!
