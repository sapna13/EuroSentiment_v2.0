{"text":"Never wanted to leave From start to finish this hotel provided the very best service and accomodation we have experienced in a long time, if ever. We booked a hotel limo to pick us up from the airport and that made the whole arrival completely stress free. The hotel staff are present in arrivals, making themselves known with announcement boards and whisking you straight to car. We were actually greeted on the steps of the hotel by a guest services manager (a lovely girl called Elkie) and taken to the room to complete check in. The harbour view room was beautifully laid out with a super bathroom, which included a seperate shower room and bathtub where you could watch a TV, set into the wall above the bath. The bed and bathroom were spotless, but the thing which singled this hotel out was the fabulous service provided by the staff. Most remember your name after a day and they seem to anticipate your needs almost before you realise you need something.Cafe TOO is great. We are usually not too keen on buffets (food left for ages and kids touching everything etc.) but this was a buffet out of this world, with every taste catered for, wonderfully set out, clean and hygenic. For a special treat the Petras Resteraunt is recommended. It is quite expensive, rather the wine is, but has a wonderful atmosphere and of course supurb service and lovely food. Lobster Bar is good for food and cocktails and the Lobby does afternoon tea with scones and tiny sandwiches should you feel in a colonial mood!The pool area again is very well serviced with attentive staff who provide towels, bottled water in little cool bags and, should you wish, drinks and lunches. It was my husbands birthday when we were there and the hotel sent up a lovely cake and card. Completely unexpected and quite a nice touch.However, the best touch was when we left. We again booked a hotel car to take us to the airport. When we got there hotel staff were waiting outside departures. They took all the luggage out of the car and accompanied us to check-in where they waited while we checked in and loaded all the luggage onto the conveyers. They made us feel like movie stars.Cannot recommend this hotel enough. Have stayed in Hong Kong previously at various places, all being of a high standard, but this beats the lot. We were there for 12 days mostly on business, but this hotel made the whole experience feel like a long holiday.
