{"text":"A jewel in the Amsterdam crown You will find this lovely hotel a peaceful retreat only 2 minutes walk from the busy Rembrandtplein. As previous reviews state the rooms  hosts are welcoming  the breakfast (served at 8am as requested) superb with warm croissants, cheese,fruit, yoghurt, choices of breads with jam  butter (we requested no meats which was noted) and a choice of tea or coffee. We had coffee  again to repeat previous reviews it was the best we had ever tasted - all served on a clean matching china set.It does feel like you are a welcome guest in a very nice canalside private house. We stayed in attic room 9 (150 euros per night) right at the top of some very winding steep stairs- choose a lower room if you have a heavy case! The room was better than expected as had a T.V  a newly installed fridge cleverly disguised as a marquetry bedside cabinet - sweet touch. Everything was clean  in order as shown in the pictures on their website.Mosquitoes were mentioned in another review so did take repellant although we only saw one in the room.The hotel provided a very useful map with the hotel  a few sites ringed - we walked to most areas in our three 3 night stay.We caught a taxi from the train station (11 euros) but took the tram (no 4 from Utrechtsestraat) to return @ 3.20 euros for both for the return journey. Highly recommend  would stay again on returning to Amsterdam - may be to room 5 as passed the room on the way down stairs  looked in as the door was open - as well as the opulent furniture,mirrors  rugs they had a large flat screen t.v  small courtyard garden- great stuff! Hope you enjoy your stay as we did.
