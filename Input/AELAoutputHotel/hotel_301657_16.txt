{"text":"Great, quiet, safe, clean, convenient stay in the city! We really enjoyed the stay at the hotel. The prices were reasonable for Tokyo, the location was quiet and convenient. It is located in the business district which is very quiet in the evenings and weekends which we really appreciated, especially after a day's walk in busy Shinjuku or Ginza. Great place to rest! The room was really comfortable and nice, no complaints at all. For the taxi ride, be sure to state Shiodome, Park Hoteru, Media Tower, next to Conrad if they have no ideas. There are many restaurants within a short underground walk to the Caretta Shiodome. Check the Caretta Shiodome's website for a list of restaurants! Starbucks in the Conrad's basement which is next door. Train and subway stations are within a short walk underground. There is even a supermarket right above the train station on ground level where you can buy quick meals as well. Can walk to Ginza or take the subway. The subway line right outside the hotel on the second level takes you on a scenic ride to Odaiba where there's a great indoor hot springs, Oedo Onsen Monogatari. Also, a nice walk to the Tsukiji market for great sushi breakfast when you are jet lagged. Left the hotel by airport shuttle booked through the hotel which was easy. A bonus was there were different all-girls bands playing every night we were there!Will definitely stay there again without question if we ever go back to Tokyo!
