{"text":"Hotel Ok-But problems?? Hello: Husband and I spent 9 days here at the RIU Resort. We checked into the Riu Naiboa and checked right out about an hour later and checked into the hotel IN FRONT of the Naiboa - the Riu Taino. The problem with this hotel is not the property, the price, the staff - the whole compound of RIU is fantastic but this hotel is the only one not located on the beach. It is far far far away - tucked way in the back of a jungle like property. If you are elderly, handicap, or do not like to walk or in good physical shape - this is not the hotel for you - yes the price is right - but you get what you pay for and you will not be happy here at all! This is a hard place for anyone with a handicap. My husband is walking on a cane as a result from a leg injury and this was just not going to work. The beach is a good 1\/2 hour walk and it is hot outside. Very hard long walk. I was not impressed with the hotel. It is like a high rise you would find in Miami. Tiny pool with a lot of people crammed in. No swim up bar and no real space like the rest of the hotels on this compound. I know the reviews are good on this but if you are thinking of this place and you are bringing your grandparents or anyone elderly or with any type of handicap please do not book this hotel. It is not equiped for this. For a few more dollars book the Hotel Riu Taino which is in front of this hotel and right smack on the beach. The rooms are all like cottages\/bungalows and much easier to get around. I hope this helps. Please email me if I can be of any assistance to anyone. Thank you and best of luck to all!
