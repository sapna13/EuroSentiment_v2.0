{"text":"Excellent hotel in main square We stayed for three nights in mid April in a room (213) overlooking the square. The rooms are fairly typical city centre hotel rooms. The ones overlooking the square have doors and a small balcony. Other rooms seemed to be smaller and overlook enclosed light wells. The only problem was that the air conditioning was not working when we arrived and the weather was quite warm. We were ok because we could ventilate our room with the French doors, but people staying in the rooms at the back said their rooms were much too warm and ventilation was inadequate. The aircon was fixed for our third night.The staff were very friendly and helpful. We particularly liked the breakfast with a large selection of cold meats, cheeses, breads, fruits and a small hot buffet. There was even Cava available if you wanted it. We also liked the buffet provided in the afternoons \/ evenings.The computers provided for internet access were very slow, but free.We would thoroughly recommend this hotel and would be happy to stay here again if we come back to Barcelona.One general point - Barcelona does not seem to be anything like as safe as it used to be - we had our camera stolen at a sidewalk cafe and when we went to the police station to get a report for our insurers we were shocked at how many other tourists were there reporting similar thefts. Take very great care of all your personal belongings and valuables in this city!
