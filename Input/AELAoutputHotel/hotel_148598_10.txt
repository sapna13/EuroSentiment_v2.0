{"text":"Quite a nice place The Wyndham Rio Mar is situated in a nice location about 40 min from the San Juan airport. It is in a gated community and has a resort like atmosphere. It is great for a family getaway. There are many inexpensive deals on the internet for this hotel and it is well worth the price on these sites.The rooms were spacious and clean. We did not have any problems with our room and the bathroom was nice. It is in the Westin\/Marriott\/Hyatt type category. There are flat screen tv's in every room. Sign up for Wyndham by Request\/Rewardsand you will surely get an upgrade to an ocean view room like we did. The grounds are very lush and well maintained. It is important to rent a car for this hotel so that you do not feel trapped on the property. The round trip airport transfer is $60\/person so the cost is made up quickly. We rented a Camry from Hertz at $188\/week. The food at the hotel is only fair and at typical resort prices. Go to Lolitas for great Mexican food and La Parilla(kiosk #2) for fresh fish and beef. Guavas in Luquillo had good food as did Don Pepes very near the hotel.The rental car will serve you well to go on your own to the rainforest. Do not take a $75\/person tour. You can drive there in 10 minutes and hike the trails which are well marked. You can go to the visitors center where there is a film, gift shop etc.Overall, we had a very nice time at this property and at a reasonable rate.
