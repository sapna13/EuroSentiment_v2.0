{"text":"Like the earlier man said -- you get what you pay for. I have no idea how this hotel got rated so highly but, to tell the truth, the entire experience has caused me to doubt the ratings process of tripadvisor.com. For the money, I suppose it is fine, but it is nowhere near the top 100 in Amsterdam, let alone 20. The floors are so slanted (at least in the Van Gogh room) that my roommate and I had to leave after 2 nights of a planned 8-night stay because of her vertigo. There are no TV's or radios and, I know, I know... you don't come to Amsterdam to watch TV, but every so often it is nice to hang out at the hotel. At the Brower, all access to any common area is cut off at 6 p.m. You must go to your room, where there is not even a comfy chair or writing table... just a couple of hard backed chairs and two not-quite-twin sized bed which particularly slide apart (as noted in earlier reviews), especially when the the floor is at a slant. The management is courteous but not particularly friendly--we experienced (and we are fairly kind people in our sixties) very perfunctory, almost New York-rude service.... not the family atmosphere we had been led to expect. There is no wi-fi Internet service, even if you wanted to pay. Bottom line... if you are looking for a basic youth hostel, the Brower is great. If you want a hotel with any amenties... keep on looking. We ended up at a 4-star just down the street for only 10 euros more a night on a great special. Also, and none of the earlier reviews I read mentioned this... the Brower is right next to the red-light district and right next door, there are a couple lovely women displaying their wares -- something families not interested in this part of Amsterdam culture might not all enjoy. Just telling the truth here--the Brower is okay if you want bare bones hostel, but there is no way this is a top hotel or value in Amsterdam. ","annotations":[]}
