{"text":"Nice twin towers We basically picked this one based on reviews written by other travellers on this site.So thank you everyone.The reviews were in general spot on. The hotel is very good, very clean and deserves its 4 stars.The people at the reception were friendly and professional. Rooms are big and clean. Everyone is helpful. The shuttle to and from the airport arrives and leaves on time (except once in 5 days).The only flip side is the fact that it is quite a distance from the city, which means, you only have limited places where you can eat. We tried all the hotels and restaurents at the airport. There is a chinese opposite the hotel but it is expensive.The hotel shuttle into the city is NOT FREE. It is 5 Euros one way per person. You wont need it, all you need to do is to go to the airport and take a train from platform 3. It'll take you to the city centre in 15 mins.If you are booking with expedia please note that you wil have to shell out 5% more thanks to something called city tax! There was a bit of a problem regarding this but the hotel manager could not help. You will need to take it up with Expedia.The food in the bar downstairs is very good, do try it.Also, try the gym and spa facilities. There was nobody there and we loved it!Overall, we think this hotel offers a clean, enjoyable  an inexpensive stay.
