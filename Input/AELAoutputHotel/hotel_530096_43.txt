{"text":"OK, but not great The hotel has a lovely lobby and magnificent lights hanging from the ceiling, which gives an overall good first impression. The rooms are above average with a HUGE bed, nice TV and bathroom. The only downside is there is only one English channel - but still, not a big thing unless you are planning to stay in the room all day! The selection of room service is not great, and neither is the lunch-time option in the restaraunt, but the food you do get is excellent. The separate restaraunt Takenmori has amazing food, although quite expensive; about √à√\u2020√ü?0 for a meal for two! It is well worth it though. The bar in the lobby also shuts at 11 so we didn't even get a chance to try it!One major drawback is the size of the pool - absolutely tiny and not heated. The views from the roof are quite spectacular, especially at night, however, they do shut the terrace round about 10.30 - 11, so you don't get to see much of them. The staff at the hotel, although being far from rude and unhelpful, are quite unfriendly and speak very little english.Another big drawback is the location of the hotel, however it only costs round about √à√\u2020√ü?0-30 to \/ from the airport which is quite reasonable and about √à√\u2020√ü?0 into Las Ramblas. However, if you were staying in a city-centre hotel of the same quality i expect the prices would be a lot higher. Although the area is a little run-down, you feel quite safe walking around there - even at night. About a 10 minute walk away is a really good shopping centre with a massive supermarket and anything else you could possibly need. All in all, its ok, nothing special but definetely good value for money. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":191,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":187}]}
