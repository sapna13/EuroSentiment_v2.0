{"text":"americans may want to skip this hotel My husband and I and our 2 close friends just returned from our trip here. Let me start with the good news...the beach is beautiful. The weather was fantastic. The water was clear and the fish were everywhere....really beautiful. OK, here's the rest....the food is really bad. I am not sure if it is bc as Americans we expected better quality, but it is just not at this resort. Honestly, breakfast was average but lunch and dinner were horrible. The choices were limited as far as restuarants, but even the Italian place which was their nicest, had terrible food. Just not what you would get at any decent place in the states.Also, as americans we were in the minority. This was not initially a problem for us, but as the days progressed we realized that americans were not being treated the way other guests were. This was by the Dominican people and by the other guests. This was sad for us, as we have travelled all over the world and have never been treated like this anywhere. The staff was not friendly. Don't expect anyone to say good morning, etc to you. It was a very different trip than Mexico, which was our last vacation. There, the people could not have been kinder and really were hospitable.Anyway, would not go back. Air conditioning did not work in our room all of the time and the rooms in Bldg. 7, which were supposed to be the newest ones, smelled. It was a moldy, mildewy type of odor.I would not recommend this place to anyone, but as someone from the U.S., I would tell others from here, beware. ","annotations":[]}
