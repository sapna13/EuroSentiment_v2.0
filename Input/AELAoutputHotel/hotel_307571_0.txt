{"text":"Nice setting but small room and subpar cleanliness for the price My husband and I came to Bali for our honeymoon on 12\/13\/2008. Four Seasons is our last stop in Bali but it was a very big disappointment. The room is fairly small compared to other places we stayed and there are tons of bugs not just on the ground outside the room but sometimes on the bed. I had extremely bad allergy the next morning and couldn't enjoy my stay at all. There is no sitting area or sofa indoors, so I had no choice but sitting outside with all the mosquitoes around....My allergy got so severe that I had to move out the next day - what a waste of time and money for our honeymoon :(For our trip this time, we first stayed in Kajane, Ubud, a nice cozy villa in downtown Ubud with very friendly staff and great location and services. Then we moved to Samaya Villa, Seminyak for another 2 nights, great services and amazing ocean views!!! Finally the Four Seasons at Jimbaran Bay...with very high expectations. However it turned out to be a nightmare. One more thing - the food at the Indonesia restaurant was below average...even the traditional breakfast at Samaya is more tasty and authentic. I've traveled in Asia a lot and even a simple fried rice dish in Taiwan or Japan can compete the dinner at Four Seasons...If you like authentic and traditional settings, you would probably like Four Seasons; though if you are allergic to bugs and prefer a cleaner and more comfy place to stay, this is not the place for you.
