{"text":"Great hotel: Get the scoop on the remodel underway I've written previously about the New Otani (see review link in my profile), so I'll focus this update on what is new. As several reviews have noted, there is a remodel underway for the Main building at the New Otani. I had a newly remodeled room and wanted to report on it.The Main building has been undergoing remodeling for approximately 1 year. They are renovating each of the three wings in succession. The first remodeled wing just opened in October. So currently the Main building is 1\/3 remodeled, 1\/3 old, and 1\/3 closed.I booked a superior remodeled room in the Main, but at check-in, it was not available. They upgraded me at no cost to an Executive style Deluxe room! How wonderful! The executive deluxe rooms are both larger than superior rooms, and have nicer fixtures. This was a very nice touch of service.Apart from that, however, I'd like to comment on the features that are common to all of the newly remodeled rooms. First, the rooms have been essentially gutted and rebuilt. This starts with the beautiful new windows (triple pane, floor to ceiling), through the bathrooms (beautiful and efficient) to redesign of the infrastructure (digital TV, well-planned PC\/internet workspace). The color scheme has changed from the pastel look of the old rooms to a striking black and chrome style.How about the construction -- does it pose problems? Absolutely none that I observed. There was no construction noise during the day, no mess, no dust, nothing. The closed wing appears to be completely sealed both inside and out. Inside the building, it's been walled off so successfully you wouldn't even know it was there. On the outside it is completely encased and there is no sign of the construction. So don't let it bother or scare you away!The only downside of the remodel, I think, is that the prices have gone up for the new rooms, as compared to the old. The new pricing puts the New Otani into the same price range as Grand Hyatt and other top notch Tokyo hotels. However, with the beautiful new, large rooms, along with its many other positive qualities (location, services, etc), it deserves to be in that class. Note that most of the offers at travel sites are either for the Tower rooms (fine but moderate in age and with less personality than the Main) or for the old Main rooms. If your travel site doesn't show them, you might want to check directly with the hotel's website for offers on the newly remodeled rooms.The New Otani is a very large property, definitely not at all a boutique hotel. But it is a wonderful, convenient, friendly, and now up-to-date (at least in the new Main) hotel. Highly recommended if you want a central Tokyo location with full services.
