{"text":"Buyer Beware My two friends and I staryed at this hotel, but from the first day, we should have seen the sign on the wall. It should have read, no customer service, no flexibility, the rules are the rules and we do no bend to make your stay worth while. First, cleaning the room. Do not expect to have your room cleaned anywhere near the same time each day. 9 am or 6:30 pm. When your room is cleaned, do not expect clean towels until later in the day. Cleaning your room and getting fresh towels in the same visit will not happen. Cleaning staff does not speak any English. Good luck telling them what you want. Good luck in getting extra tells delivered when you call the front desk.Second, using Travelers Checks. They do not cash them for American dollars. They will give you pesos, so you loose money in the exchange. If you bring cash, there is a safe in the room, but it costs per day.Third, the local phone calls are charged at $1.00 per minute. So if you want to call your travel agent, you will pay for the call.We originally requested a folding bed for our visit, but when we got to the room, no such bed was supplied. bottom line: they provide no such amenity. Beds are two doubles or one king, pillows are hard and not flexible. One of us slept on the floor each night. We even asked for a beach chair or mattress, but no luck. Also, each room only gets two keys. So if there are four of you, only 2 keys will be provided.Food was ok for the most part. Not spectacular, but ok. Beach and pook are good. Drinks are also ok. Tours are expensive. they range from $80.00 to $300.00. Golf prices are all over the map with the cheapest being $200.00 with club rental. Tip no included. If I did go back, this is one hotel, I would stay as far away as possible. One more thing, Spirit Airlines is a terrible airline and you will feel like a load of cattle instead of people on a plane ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1666,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1662}]}
