{"text":"Fantastic location and CLEAN My boyfriend and I just stayed at The Vibe hotel after getting a great deal on an executive room via needitnow.com.au and we totally loved our stay here.Firstly when we arrived check-in was a breeze, it took about 2 mins to check us in (at 10am our room was ready) we were on the top floor and had a MASSIVE room, the bathroom was huge and had a really nice spa (big enough for two) two sinks and heaps of room. There was also a really nice couch, and the bed was very comfy. The first thing I noticed was how clean the room was, everything was immaculate. We had a really good view of Elizabeth street and Centrepoint Tower.Room service was fairly quick (about 30mins) and not overly expensive (you must try the mozzarella pizza balls!) we didn't get breakfast as we though the menu was pricey (but on par with other breakfast room service prices at nearby hotels)I've stayed in lots of places in Sydney but this hotel is my fav, the people were really nice and the room was clean. We were on the street side so there was quite a bit of noise at night but we couldn't hear anthing from the other rooms. The gym and pool (which looked only half full of water) were right across the hall from our room and we didn't hear any noise from there and there were plenty of people using them.Museum station and Hyde park are only a few hundred metres from the hotel and you can easily walk to Haymarket and Darling Harbour from the hotel (we did) I would totally recommend this hotel.
