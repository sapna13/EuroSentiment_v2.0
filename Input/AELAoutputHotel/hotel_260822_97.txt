{"text":"Hotel Perseo - Great value and location. I stayed here for 3 nights in October 2007 with my sister and brother-in-law. Booked a single room, but the room was a double for single use - I paid 97 Euro per night, which I thought was very reasonable. I think the only difference between my single room and my sister's room was that they had a better view. Rooms were clean, bed was comfortable, bathroom was good sized. My room was on the 4th floor looking over the street but the window did a good job of blocking out the noise. The location is wonderful - just a few steps from the Duomo, and about a 5 minute walk from the train station. It was a quick walk, but in hind sight we probably should have taken a cab - am betting it would have been cheap, and we had overpacked for our 3 week vacation so lugging the suitcases on crowded sidewalks probably wasn't worth what we saved by not getting a taxi. Plus, we had just come from Venice and dodging the traffic was a bit of a shock to our system at that point! But had I gone carry-on size, I wouldn't hesitate to walk it. Breakfast was good - buffet with fresh fruit, really good pastries, yogurt, the usual meats, cheeses, rolls. Freshly made capuccinos. Took advantage of their happy drink one evening too. A very nice touch. We took one of the staffs recommendations for lunch at a pizza place on one day - very good. My sister and brother-in-law took their recommendation for dinner one night and were very happy with that too. Probably the only drawback (if you can call it that) is that the entrance and the hallway aren't nearly as attractive as the hotel itself - since it occupies the 3rd and 4th floor in an apartment building. The owner told us they are going to be able to repaint the hallway between the 2 floors soon, so then once you get up to the property on the 3rd floor, and have to exit to go to a 4th floor room, you won't feel like you are going back into a dingy apartment building. But really, this isn't that big of a deal. Would stay here again!
