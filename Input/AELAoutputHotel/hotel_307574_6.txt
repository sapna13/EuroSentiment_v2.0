{"text":"Do yourself a favor... I spent most of my trip to Bali in Ubud at the Maya Ubud. It also happened to be my birthday. Not only was everything spectacular but I was greeted with lovely people singing and wishing me a happy birthday all day long. I don't know if it was just because it was a big birthday but they also had a cake and bouquet as well. I could not think of a better place to be. The people are so kind, pleasant and extremely accomodating in all ways. The place is beautiful and convenient to town. I went based on a recommendation from a friend's daughter but was thrilled to have it be better than anticipated. IMy only negative is that the drivers they supply who, I don't think, are hotel employees tend to be very aggressive about taking you to the shops even if you say you don't want to go. Overall, that is a problem at all times. Taking no for an answer is not in the make up of most of the hawkers. It gets very tiresome and one's politeness starts to waver. Tip. I enjoyed walking all over and found if you walk in the direction opposite to the traffic, it makes it more difficult for the motor bikes to come back for you. And don't make eye contact! You're doomed if you do. I ended up practically living in the spa anyway so it was all good (although I felt kind of guilty) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":326,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":322},{"endOffset":326,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":322},{"endOffset":326,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":322}]}
