{"text":"Still got a lot going for it.. Stayed 6 nights over Christmas 2006. Arrived and was upgraded to a Club Room courtesy of Priority Privilege. The room was large, but initially I thought it didnt have any windows, the room was long and narrow like a shoe box. Then realised there was a small window almost disguised at the side at the end of the room, there wasnt a lot of natural light so had to have the lights on all day. The room had some big comfy arm chairs and a table. The bathroom had seen better days and the tiles in the shower had stained grouting or holes where other fittings had been removed and the holes had not been sealed up. Other than that the room was comfortable and large enough for the two of us. There were lovely toileteries and plentiful supplies. We paid extra to use the club lounge so we could have internet access. The lounge itself was nice enough with plenty of tea\/coffee\/juice\/wine\/nibbles always on hand, however some guests have now got wise to the idea that if they pay the 30 Euro charge, they can invade the Club Lounge with all their kids, who hog the computer terminals and have the TV sets on loud when you are trying to have some quiet time or work.. This hotel though has LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION.. 5 minutes walk from the Centraal Station, 5 mins from Damrak, we never had to use a tram the whole time we were there. There is a self service laundry across s the road, so things could not be better.. Would I stay at the Crowne Plaza again.. Hell yeah !! The plus points far outweigh the negatives and the location just tops it off.. we booked via the Crowne Plaza website and the prices seemed to go up and down by the day, so keep an eye on the prices. we were lucky to get a bargain at 94 Euro, but the prices sky rocketed a few days later..
