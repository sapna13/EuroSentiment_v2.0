{"text":"Truly outstanding Having chosen the hotel, for an Easter break with my wife, based entirely on the excellent reviews of tripadvisor members, I had very high expectations. Still, I was totally impressed by Elysees Regencia. Using the very convenient hotel website, I booked a standard room at 195 euros\/night, a reasonable price for a 4-star hotel in Paris. In return, I got an experience that I really doubt if it would be equally good, if I had opted instead for one of the top 5-star Paris hotels, at double this price!Location is ideal, in a nice quiet area very close to Champ Elysees and less than 5' walk from two different metro stations. Communal areas are not huge but totally adequate for the size of the hotel and very tastefully decorated. Free internet access is offered next to the reception and a cozy bar is available for evening drinks.Having asked for a high floor room, I was offered one at the 6th (top) which was huge by any (and not only Paris) standards. If this was a standard room, I wonder how big a superior would be! Decoration was very modern and tasteful, bathroom was equally impressive in size and quality. The room was spotlessly clean and meiden service was offered twice per day. Service was exceptional, with stuff speaking perfect english and always ready to provide assistance when needed. Buffet breakfast (charged extra at 18√à√\u2020√ü?person) was served in an atmospheric cellar and certainly deserved the asked price. At the last night, a hand written thank-you note from the hotel manager, along with a nice L'Occitane gift, was a last confirmation of our conclusion on Elysees Regencia: it is a hotel where attention to detail, respect for the guest, understated perfectionism, really spoil you as client. The fact that the only 'default' that I could find was the lack of slippers in the room, really says it all. This hotel is a true advertisement for Paris hospitality and it certainly deserves the No1 position that it now enjoys in tripadvisor rankings. Bravo!
