{"text":"Excellence Punta Cana was Amazing! My husband and I stayed at Excellence Punta Cana from February 15-20 and our stay was amazing! The resort is absolutely beautiful with large groves of Palm trees and artistic landscaping. Our room was perfect- with a large canopy king bed, comfy pillows and mattress. I loved the marble floors and decorations in the resort. We had a second floor garden view and this was nice (very quiet). There was no noise from the rooms beside us. The servers and bartenders were very friendly. Benjamin at the Cafe Kafe bar was awesome. Our room steward kept the mini fridge full of Presidente beer and water as we asked. The food was great at every restaurant. We enjoyed the Lobster House and Barcelona and had dinner at each twice. The Chinese restaurant Spice was also good. If you like seafood- there's a variety (mahi mahi, grouper and shrimp on most menus- even at lunch). The frozen drinks were excellent (premium liquor). We had no problems with long waits at the bars- even though the resort was at full capacity. The spa is wonderful- we had massages and good pedicures. I recommend the horseback riding that the resort includes (20-30 minutes). It was fun galloping down the beach! The pool is beautiful and we could always find a chair somewhere. The beach is great for walking on. The sea was a little rough, but 2 days you could swim in it. The shows at night were above average (we saw belly dancing, a magician, a great singer and a cool circus act). There were also many activities and you could join in if you wanted- aerobics on the beach, volleyball, etc. Also Yoga and stretching at the spa.I hope this review is helpful. I'd highly recommend Excellence Punta Cana. It's a great place for couples!
