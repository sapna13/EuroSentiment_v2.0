{"text":"Another Great Trip to the Palace First off this was our third time to the Palace all were in October. We were there in October 2002 and 2003. This trip was October 14 -21.Check in: We got there at 2:15 pm, had to wait till 3 pm to get our room. We had requested a specific room number that we had on our prior visits. We got the room requested.Room: The room was fine nothing fancy. It had just been repainted. The phone didn't work, we left a note and it was fixed. The beds are a little hard, but we slept very well after a long day on the beach. Mini fridge always full of beer and water. Air conditioned worked well for us.Beach: Just GREAT, white sand, palm trees and more palm treess, plenty of chairs, very little waves.Weather: Had some rain, more this week than in the past. Rained almost all day Monday, made the most of it (went shopping and etc.). The other times it rained, it would rain 10 to 15 minutes and it would pass. Plenty of sun otherwise, we got got good tans.Food: Plenty of food to be had in every part of the resort from the buffets to the specialty restaurants. Nothing super fancy or great, plenty of selections. Our favorite place is the La Pina Grill at the far end of the resort by the straw market. You can eat with your swim suits on and feet in the sand. Wilson, one of the cooks and all of the employees at the grill are very nice.Resort: It is just huge, the tram will take you all over the place. Casino was fun, won a little money. Tried out 4 out of 5 pools, 1 was closed (Caribe - remodeling).Comments: We snorkeled off the beach, saw a few fish, eels, lobsters and a ton of star fish. Straw market is fun to deal with the shop owners (it is at the far end of the resort). Went on glass bottom boat\/snorkel cruise, deep sea fishing and para-sailing by the straw market, we felt like they gave us a better deal than you can get on the resort. The beach is great for long walks. You can e-mail from the lobby $3 for 15 minutes on the internet. Take your lotions, chap stick and etc, you can get them in the gift shop but, it is costly.Closing Comments: We love this place, we would return again and again. Some people complain alot. We have traveled throughout the Carribean. We always go in with open minds. We expect a few bumps here and there. We don't know much spanish, but we try speak a little spanish the employees and they seem to try to communicate back with you.
