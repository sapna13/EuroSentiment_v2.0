{"text":"You Cannot Do Better For The Price\/Location In S.F. We were a little concerned and scared booking this hotel because the price was so reasonable, and the location was so great. We had a Queen room (Standard room), and the rate was $109\/nt. The hotel directly was willing to match any online price we found, so we just booked it directly. You will pay $33\/day to Valet for the day, but you are allowed to take your car in and out as many times as you wish. That is really the only parking option, as street parking is limited by both time and availability. The hotel is in a GREAT location. Right in the heart of Union Square. The cable car is about 2 blocks (Right outside the GAP), as is tons of shopping, i.e. GAP, OAKLEY, MACY'S, PUMA, etc. The area is very nice and safe. There are plenty of restaurants, etc. in the vacinity.Now for the rooms. The hotel looks like it is brand new. It is seriously as if it opened a week before we were there. The ONLY drawback to the rooms is the size. They are slightly smaller than the average room, but not a big deal at all. Flat screen TV on the wall, very clean and nice overall. Don't expect a nice breakfast. Just muffins, toast, OJ, etc., but totally sufficient. I am not kidding you, this place is great, and you won't find another hotel in this area for the price. People mentioned on the reviews it was noisy. We didn't find that at all. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone, and I am very picky when it comes to hotel rooms.....Feel free to e-mail me with any questions you may have. jonrhanson@hotmail.com ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1115,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1111},{"endOffset":1144,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1140},{"endOffset":1168,"mention":"muffins","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Muffin"],"startOffset":1161},{"endOffset":1175,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1170}]}
