{"text":"Expensive, but top notch quality. Finally, a hotel worth its star rating. The interior of this hotel was every bit as nice as the exterior. It exuded understated elegance. The location was excellent right in the center of everything on Las Ramblas. The staff was very friendly and helpful too. The reception, bar, and sitting areas were very classy with leather seating, club chairs, and 1930's style of decorating. The business center was outstanding with 4 computers with free internet access, leather furniture, and a conference table. Again, very classy. The rooftop bar and pool area was great. The spa and pool area in the basement was top notch. I had the silk feet massage and it was wonderful, but too short. The breakfast buffet was pretty good. You could special order eggs, which was nice. It wasn't worth 20 euros, but typical pricing for western Europe.We booked a superior room. It was very clean and quite lovely with quality features: king size bed with a selection of pillow types, plasma TV, wood floors, light dimming switches, room safe, robes, slippers, etc. The bathroom was in marble with a nice rainfall showerhead. Although not huge, the bathroom was above average compared to other 4 and 5 stars we have stayed at. There were several complaints on tripadvisor about room noise, but our room faced the side street and was very quiet.We payed an average of 315 euros per night which is very expensive by American standards. We have stayed at less expensive 4 and 5 star hotels in other major European cities only to feel disappointed in the end. We were very pleased with our selection this time.
