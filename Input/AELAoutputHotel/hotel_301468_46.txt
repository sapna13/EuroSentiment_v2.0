{"text":"Impeccable Service We got an Executive Club room and requested a high floor. This was accommodated as we were on the 18th floor. When we got dropped off at the hotel, it was buzzing with people...at least 7 people were jostling into position to open car doors, check us in, welcome \/ greet us, open front hotel door, call the elevator, etc. I think over the 2.5 days there we were welcomed at least 100 times! The people are really warm and friendly and we can say was some of the best overall service that we have received. After a while it may seem a bit over the top but still nice! With the Executive Club room, you get access to the Executive Lounge on the 19th floor. Views are to the 'back' and not out the 'front' towards the marina or city skyline. That said, the food, snacks, drinks and comfort settings \/ furniture are very good. You can also use free wireless internet access up there...in case you don't know, the whole city of Singapore is wireless and anyone can register and access free internet, even tourists. I would also recommend paying the extra $20 or so to get a harbour \/ city skyline Executive Club Room looking over the 'front' rather than the 'back'. We made the mistake of not doing this.Pros- service, politeness of staff- quality of fittings and furnishings- cleanliness- foodCons- S$105 for a 1-way Merc E-Class ride to airport not worth the value (big S-Class Merc is S$155)- shopping mall attached to hotel is very average- Morton's Steak House not open for lunchOn a side note, we did the Night Safari at the Singapore Zoo and would recommend this for a good time.To wrap up, we'll be back!
