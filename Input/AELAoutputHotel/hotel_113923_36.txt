{"text":"A really nice alternative. We had a week in San Francisco for a convention and decided to take our two kids. That meant looking for a suite, so that we could put the kids to bed in one room and still stay up and watch TV and visit with friends in the other. The Kabuki had a variety of reasonably-priced suites that fit the bill, for just a bit more than a regular double room at the big-name convention hotel. (Note: the Kabuki's 'East-West' suite, with one Western bedroom and one Japanese tatami room, does not adequately isolate one room's sound from the other.) The 'Junior Suite' was great for our purposes. The kids had the big bed in their room while we had a foldaway futon in ours.The hotel is newly remodeled (it was the Miyako when I lived out there), and very comfortable. The staff seemed to be changing constantly, so it was hard to find a regular, 'go-to' person; however, everyone was professional and pleasant enough.Japantown is a nice part of the city, with plenty of (mostly Asian) dining options very close to the hotel. We found we could walk pretty much everywhere we wanted to go (we made the obligatory tourist trek up over Hyde Street to Fisherman's Wharf and even walked to the Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park). When we needed cabs, they were easy to find.The only drawbacks I can think of were the lack of any sort of bathrobes in the room -- a bit odd for a Japanese-style hotel -- and the rather slow wireless Internet. Also, refrigerators in the suites would be nice (NOT just for the idiotic mini-bar -- does anyone actually buy that overpriced crap?) However, all in all, we would gladly go back, and we were very glad we opted for the Kabuki over the mega-chain conference hotel.
