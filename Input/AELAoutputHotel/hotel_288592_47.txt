{"text":"Very Nice, but could do better. First, let me start by saying that this hotel is indeed a very nice hotel. The image Hilton give of the Conrad chain is that it is a 5* hotel and by the look, this is definitely a top end hotel. I arrived with family on Christmas day and stayed over the New Year. On check in while there was 2 staff members behind the desks only one on them was dealing with guests. The other member of staff saw us waiting, did not even say sorry for the wait we ended up waiting to check in for 15 mins! I booked 2 smoking rooms, they gave us 2 non smoking rooms- there was no longer any deluxe smoking rooms left, even though I booked months ago!Once checked in, we made our way to our room. It was a lovely room. Clean with a great view of the bay and Molton Brown amenities. Noticed the mini bar in the other room did not lock and made sure I let the hotel know about this before they started charging us for items, we had not taken! Around the windows, it seemed like to window were not fixed or plastered correctly or that they were still in the process of renovating the window area. They was also construction work during our stay, this was not a problem as they was not much noise, this might have been down to the fact that it was the holiday season, but the hotel should have made sure that they informed all guests of this matter.Also after leaving our room for a while, with the AC turned onto heat, I returned to find that my room was as cold as an ice box. It seemed like the AC had broken and the display reading was not as warm as displayed. Maintenance came to the room and within 1 min, stated that the problem was fixed. Needless to say the AC remained broken for the whole stay, after mentioning this to front desk for the second time and getting no response. I decided to turn the AC completely off and try to enjoy the rest of my stay, as it was winter, so the need for AC was not that great. (something, I would not have done, if I was staying during the warmer months)The location is good if you don't mind using the PT (public transport) as you are across the street from a metromover stop and can get to downtown, cocowalk and south beach very easily. We used the bus and train and metro mover to get around, as the hotel charges too much for parking. As for food, we ate at the restaurant in the morning, as we had HHonors breakfast vouchers. The breakfast is ok, but I have had better. Hard to find a decent coffee shop in the area and you have to be prepared to travel for some food, unless you want to eat at the hotel.There is a Walgreens and a Publics supermarket within walking distance, which made getting water easier, as water which is provided in room is $7 for a small bottle. We arranged to have new years dinner at the hotel and I expected it to be over priced and not worth it, but it was surprisingly decent. A 4 course champagne meal was around $100 per person. The turndown attendants were lovely and very friendly unlike to concierge who gave off a really bad attitude, when asked where the nearest sports bar was (sorry for asking!)All in all, I would go back to the Conrad, but not for the price paid. I have stayed in much nicer Hilton hotels and considering this is meant to be the top of their chain, it could have been much better.
