{"text":"5 Stars I just arrived home from 5 days at the fairmont olympic hotel in seattle and i would have been content to move in their permanently! i was fortunate to be booked in on a convention rate ($250 per night--and they didn't have the basic room for 5 nights so for $25 more i had a suite!).....that is $25 well spent!! i had a huge king sized bed and a separate living room with sofa, 2 overstuffed pillows to rest my head after a day of shopping, a desk, chair and 2 tvs.....there is a separate dressing area and the bathroom was nice with 2 robes to use.....the hotel is first class all the way....the staff cannot do enough for you!! i had requested a coffee maker, which for some reason the fairmont does not provide.....when i checked in, there was no coffee maker in the room, so i phoned the front desk.....the head of catering told me that he would get one for me, even if he had to buy it himself.....sure enough, within 1\/2 hour they brought me a coffee maker on a silver platter with all the acoutrements!! i was very impressed.....the doormen greet you when you leave the premises and when you return--a nice touch!! coffee and tea is served in the lobby in the early morning.....the carpet is starting to look a bit dated in the halls, but that would be my only complaint--and a small price to pay for a marvellous hotel.......i can't wait to stay on the gold floor on the fairmont in boston--where i am going in 1 week!!by the way, seattle is a great city for shopping! it is small--all of the shops are within a 2 block radius--macy's, nordstroms, brooks brothers, coach, yves st laurent, etc. etc.! heaven for this visitor from canada!
