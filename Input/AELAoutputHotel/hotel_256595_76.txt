{"text":"Great Value for a very good hotel I am staying at the Swissotel Sydney as I write this. I am overlooking the city from my view on the 24th floor. The rooms are very clean and well furnished with usable and comfortable furnishings. The location is top notch and right in the heart of everything. A wide range of shopping is right out the door of the hotel and beautiful Darling harbor with all of it's restaurants is a short 3 minute walk straight down market street.The service is top notch, check in was flawless. Upon checking in I was told that my room was not ready. After explaining that I had just traveled 23 hours the agent at the front desk worked diligently to find me a temporary room until mine was ready. She called 15 minutes later to tell me that my permanent room was ready and a bellman was at my door within 4 minutes to help me with my luggage and deliver the new room keys. Housekeeping is excellent as well, the room is spotless and turn down service was prompt and efficient. I am staying on the executive floor which is great value, the lounge is very nice and well equipped and the free breakfast is very comprehensive. In particular the constant availbility of beverages is very welcome. For a mere $20AUD more it is certainly worth it.I checked out the pool and health club facilities and they are both top notch as well.To sum up the hotel is very up to date and clean and offers great value for anyone traveling to Sydney. I travel more the 400,000 miles a year and spend many nights in hotels and this hotel certainly offers as good if not better value then anywhere I have stayed.
