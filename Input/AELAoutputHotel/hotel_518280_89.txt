{"text":"Cozy Paradise in Bustling NYC I've stayed in New York City several times, and this hotel is by far my favorite. The rooms are a little small, even for New York, but they were cozy all the same. We stayed in a Room C, with two bunk beds. The beds were extremely comfortable and equipped with Egyptian cotton. Each bed had its own personal TV that hooked up to a DVD\/CD player mounted underneath the platform beds. However, when we got to our rooms we found that our room did not have a DVD\/CD player. We called once down to the desk and the told us that it was indeed under the platform bed, which it wasn't. The second time we asked in person and they told us that our room never did have a DVD player, like promised.We stayed on the fourth floor and yet our room was very, very quiet and peaceful. The bathroom was a little less private than most because it had no door. It did have a sliding door between the shower and the toilet, enclosing the toilet in. It also, of course, had a shower curtain for the shower. The pool, sauna, and steam room were quite enjoyable. The pool was very warm- 92 degrees at one point- and very small. During the morning and afternoon there were few people there besides us. However, we went once at midnight to swim and found out that a private party was using it and that we couldn't swim until 1:30am. We were supposed to have recieved notice of this in our rooms, but we hadn't. The hotel was very cooperative with us when we informed them of this and we recieved $50 off of our room rate. Also, the continental breakfast was impressive. The service was also impressive as they gave us directions and held our bags for free the day we checked out. All in all, we had a very positive experience. If you are going to New York City, don't miss out on this rare gem. Stay at the Hotel QT! ","annotations":[]}
