{"text":"Non smoking room on a smoking corridor! Let me just say that it isnt all bad. The room was very comfortable and quite new. They gave the most pillows that I had seen on our entire trip (very comfy ones too!)- about 6 on each bed!The breakfast was excellent. Pastries, bagels, cereal etc and it all was very fresh and nice.The problem for us was the cigarette smoke. We booked a non smoking room as we dont smoke and we have a toddler. We were shocked to find that the corridors of the hotel were smoker friendly! So the smokers were filling the halls with smoke which I could smell in our room even with a wet towel across the bottom of the door! I was appalled. We had to walk through it with my son and I am just amazed that the hotel has this policy. When my husband spoke to the front desk regarding this they were not suprised and had heard similar complaints from other guests. However they just stated that it was hotel policy. However NOWHERE on their website does it mention this. You would expect them to have at least one non smoking floor.Many places we stayed were entirely non smoking.The other downside for us was that the area seemed (like a lot of inner LA) a bit on the rough side.Its convenient for hollywood but took over 1 hour in traffic to reach Venice Beach\/Santa Monica pier. Its also not convenient for the airport. Next time I would stay nearer the airport which is also nearer to the beach areas.The hotel seemed quite secure though, there were cctv cameras on each corner of the corridor and the underground car park has a gate that can only be opened with a room key after it closes at 6pm. This is also cctv monitored. On the downside there is no room safe and to our surprise no safe at reception!I was woken at about 3am by someone playing about with their car stereo in the outside parking and the sound of traffic is constant all night long.Im glad we only stayed the one night but if you are a smoker and are in LA for seeing Hollywood then im sure you could do a lot worse. Non smokers, people with young kids and those that want the beaches\/airport, you could do better.
