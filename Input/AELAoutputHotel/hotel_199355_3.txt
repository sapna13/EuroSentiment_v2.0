{"text":"Wonderful Experience We were a littlle concerned as we read several reviews that mentioned a red light area close by, but we didn't see anything like that. Althought the railway station is only a stone's throw away we were totally undisturbed by the closeness of the station. In fact the station is right across from the hotel and the hotel is well signposted from within the station. If you take the train from the airport you could be in your room within an hour as the hotel fast-track registration for prebooked guests. We booked through Expedia because it was fast and hassle-free.The hotel was wonderful and the rooms, clean, warm and spacious. The bathroom had these huge fluffy towels and had the kind of soap selection found normally in hotels with a highrer grading. The shower was as hot as you want it to be. The bed was comfortable and the double door to the corridor ensured that any corridor noises were almost unheard. The reception staff were very friendly and receptive to requests. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The barman night waiter is a wonderful and friendly guy, full of good humour and tips about the weather and about things to see and do. The free bar in the room is free and stocked twice daily. You can get free coffee and snacks all day in the lobby. The hot breakfast was included and there was a vast choice of cereals, meats, yoghurt, jams, marmalades, cakes, eggs, fruits and fruit juices. You could have piping hot coffee and there is a huge selection of teas including herbal teas. The elevators were fast and the place was clean throughout. The lobby is a friendly, sunlit and comfortable place to sit and for those of us who had to drag ourselves homeward eventually, there is a safe left-luggage room. The place had an olde-worlde feel to it. It was full of charm yet modern. We had a wonderful time there and we are recommending it to our friends.
