{"text":"Better than I thought it would be..... We booked a stay here before reading the reviews on tripadvisor. I must say, after reading many of the reviews on here, I wanted to cancel and find another place to stay. However, we decided that since maybe there were some good reviews, the resort wouldn't be all bad. And, it wasn't. I'll give you a few of my thoughts...The facilities - they were nice. They definitely weren't as nice as either of the two Riu Palaces, but they still weren't bad by any means. None of the rooms are on the water, so if you're expecting that, you'll be let down. The rooms were ok - my biggest complaint here was the beds. There were two double beds pushed together. Both were hard as a ROCK. The pools were in just fine shape. I wouldn't say spotless, but not near as bad as many had said on here. There are palm trees all over head, so leaves and such are going to fall in the pool - it's just going to happen. The food - Again, this was ok. There are a lot of choices, but there are a lot of things I didn't want to eat too! It's more geared toward a European culinary pallet, so if you're a picky American (like we were), you will be limited. There was always stuff we wanted to eat, but we found ourselves eating the same things over and over (like pizza and fries for lunch).The staff - they were just wonderful. I really don't know what the other reviews were talking about. Almost everyone there spoke English, and the few that didn't quickly found someone who did. We had no language issues at all. A couple little tips if you do go:They give you a towel card when you check in for a beach towel. When you go to the pool area, you give them the card and they give you a towel back. You only get one towel per day and can't trade it in for a fresh one. We learned this the hard way as we turned them in around lunch, got our cards back, and later that afternoon tried to get new towels. They at first told us no, but eventually did give us new ones and told us not to do it again. It's a little bit of a pain.In the guest rooms, there is a main switch in the room that turns *everything* off - including the AC and the alarm clock. I would recommend taking a 9 volt battery with you for the clock just so you don't have to reset it every day.The main restaurant is fairly large, and we found it gets very warm for lunch and dinner. The second day we noticed there were a few tables outside, so we started eating our meals outside which made for a much nicer experience.Tipping isn't required, but I found just a couple of singles every now and then got us great service...but I don't think anyone had bad service.Overall, it was a good stay. My advices though, if you can afford a little more money, stay at the Riu Palace Punta Cana or the Riu Palace Macau.
