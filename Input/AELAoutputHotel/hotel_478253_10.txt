{"text":"Excellent Location near Union Square My husband and I recently returned from a three-night stay at the Hotel Des Arts. The location is great! It's only three blocks away from the Montgomery BART station and just a few blocks from the MUNI lines and buses. There are many cafes, restaurants, bars and GREAT shopping in all price ranges nearby -- and it's two blocks from the gate to Chinatown! It's also a short walk from the SFMOMA. A+ for the location! The hotel is very cool - numerous paintings line the hallways on each floor - many for sale -- as well as in the lobby. We enjoyed walking around and checking out the art. The staff was very helpful and accommodating with maps, bus lines and restaurant recommendations. They were always available when we had to be buzzed in from the street as well. Our room, which cost about $360 for three nights, had a private bathroom. We loved the style and the mural on the wall [the DeRosa room]. It was simple and clean but small. Since we didn't plan to spend a lot of time there, it was fine. On the down side, it faced the backs of buildings and we got the exhaust from a nearby restaurant which woke us up on a couple of occasions. The hotel also didn't have any type of temperature controls for the air and there was no ceiling fan so we had to sleep with the windows open. It was not ideal since the windows didn't have screens and bugs and flies came into the room.I would recommend this hotel for young travelers and couples. It's not a place that I would suggest if you are older or have difficulty with stairs as they are very narrow and steep - and the elevator is very small. But, for the price - in that part of the city -- you really can't beat it or complain too much.
