{"text":"Liked our Hotel We spent four nights here in Oct 2006 and were given a beautiful, large corner room at the front of the building. Hans de Rapper, the owner, guided us to our room, brought us a complimentary glass of champagne, then told us about the free in-room laptop for internet access, free long distance phone service, free laundry service, and complimentary breakfast. What more could we ask for? The hotel is located on an elegant residential street a block away from the van Gogh Museum and a few steps farther to the Rijksmuseum. The breakfast downstairs includes bacon and eggs and is a more than adequate way to start the day. The only additional luxury that would be nice is air conditioning. Even though it was chilly outside during our stay, our room got warm enough to use the ceiling fan several times. The neighborhood is upscale, and there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a supermarket, Albert Heijn, a few minutes walk away, where we picked up wine, cheese, and fruit. Leidseplein, with its plethora of restaurants and clubs, is 10-15 minutes walk away, and there are several good restaurants all around the hotel, including on the walk to Leidseplein and on the walk to and past the Concertgebuow. The tram stops about 2 blocks from the hotel for points farther away, such as the Red Light district and the Anne Frank house. We found our stay in Amsterdam to be much too short, and we intend to stay at Hotel Fita on our next visit. ","annotations":[]}
