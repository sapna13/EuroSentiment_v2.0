{"text":"High-Tech Amenities I stayed at the Courtyard San Francisco Downtown for a few days in August 2007. The rooms are clean and large for city standards (300+ sq. feet). The bathrooms are unusually large. The toilet is at least 3-4 feet from the shower, which is a nice change from those closet bathrooms. The sink area (only one sink) is outside of the bathroom, but has space to put your toiletries. The room has air conditioning and the view is decent (I had a city view). There is a sofa bed in the room too (full size bed).The best part of this hotel is the high-tech gadgets. My room had a flat panel LCD HDTV. Internet service is free, but make sure you bring your own Ethernet cable because they didn't provide one in the room. The desk is huge. It has a pull-out desk which pulls out from under the main desk. You can place your laptop and a stack of papers on the pull-out desk and still have room on the main desk behind it to store even more papers, etc. The office chair is very comfortable too. The back of the desk has a power, A\/V and network\/phone panel. You can plug a phone cable, ethernet cable, audio and video (RCA jacks, audio mini-plug, S-video, HDMI and VGA) plugs, 4 power plugs, and a USB port into that panel. The clock radio is modern and you can plug in your IPOD into it.Since the hotel is on 2nd and Folsom, it is not in the middle of the tourist area. If you want to be in downtown\/Union Square area, try the Marriott on 4th and Mission St., the Four Seasons, the Palace Hotel, etc. However, you will be paying at least 2x more. Union Square is walking distance away (about 8 long blocks) and the Metreon\/Moscone Center is about 4 blocks away. There are some great restaurants near the hotel. Try Bong Su (Vietnamese Fusion) and Cha Am (Thai) on 3rd and Folsom, Mehfil (Indian) across the street, Osha (Thai) on 2nd between Folsom and Howard), Azie (Asian fusion) and Lulu (Mediterranean) on Folsom between 4th and 5th.
