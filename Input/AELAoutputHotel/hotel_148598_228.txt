{"text":"Please with Rio Mar Overall I was very pleased with the Wyndham Rio Mar. I was part of a larger group. It was my husband's family reunion. There were 23 of us in total including children, two of which were under 2 years old. We all rented three of the 3-bedroom golf villas. I read many of the reviews on this site and because I got to see three different villas I do understand why there are different opinions. Of the three villas our group rented, one was fabulous (luckily, this was the one I was in), one was very nice, and one was not nice. I understand that each is owned privately so each is decorated and cared for differently. However, these were not cheap and the one villa was unacceptable for the price we paid. That one was Villa Naranja. It really needs to be nicer. It was practically bare and there were light bulbs without any fixtures. Just bare light bulbs. Not worth the price. However, Villa Chaly and Villa Rio were fantastic. Villa Rio was the best. If you go try to request it. I rented the villas through The Clusters.com. They were great. Totally helpful. Especially Xavier. He's awesome. Ok, now for the resort. It was very nice though we didn't spend a whole lot of time inside the main building. There was a bunch of construction going on past the main building. I guess just past where the ocean villas were. It was unattractive but the only reason we drove by it was because we drove past the main building by accident. You can't see it from the pool or beach as far as I know. Maybe from the Ocean VIllas though. We ate in the casual restaurant one night and were pleased. But I have to say I don't think Puerto Rican food is all that great to begin with so I wasn't expecting much. The golf villas are quite a ways away from the resort pool and beach. But each villa had use of a golf cart which made it fine. Especially for the kids. They loved the carts. We even found a free place to park a car (near the playground at the pool). The beach was nice though we spent most of our time at the pool. It was pretty windy most of the time we were there so they wouldn't allow umbrellas on the beach and we needed them for the babies. The food and drinks at the pool are ridiculously expensive. Bring a small cooler and bring your own. So that's it. Would I go back? Only if we did another family reunion there - my husband's family is Puerto Rican. Though this has nothing to do with the resort. I just think there are much nicer places than Puerto Rico. Aside from the resorts and more affluent areas near the resorts it seems to be all strip malls and high rise condos. With the exception of Old San Juan which should not be missed.
