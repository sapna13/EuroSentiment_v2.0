{"text":"Very Good Value for Families Hilton Tapatio is a very good property for families looking for a fun vacation in the sun. We (my wife, myself and two daughters 5  9) just returned from a four day stay 4\/10 - 4\/13 and had an excellent experience.This resort is a solid 3 - 3 1\/2 stars and a good overall value but do not book expecting a 4 or 5 star property. For the $150\/night we paid, I was very happy.All rooms are two room suites with a good layout, comfortable beds and furnishings. The furnishings and room were that of a quality 3 - 3 1\/2 star hotel. Very nice and functional, not the bells, whistles and special touches of a 4 or 5 star resort.The Falls Water Village has 2 large pools, waterslide, 2 hot tubs, bathrooms and pool side service. While the pool area did get crowded, we were always able to find 4 lounge chairs together and the crowds didn't bother us. Basically families with younger children splashing and laughing in the water. The resort has a total of 8 pools (some very small) and the pools outside of the Falls Water Village seemed more quiet, sedate and an adult setting. They do have some pools reserved for Adults Only.The pool towels were a bit thin, but we got two a piece and that worked just fine. We found the pool area well maintained and the pool bathrooms some of the cleanest I have ever found. The pool side service was very good and responsive. Just raise the flag on your chair and they were by to assist within a minute or two.Overall, Hilton Tapatio is a very nice property for a reasonable price. If you want 4-5 stars, luxury at every turn and a quite pool area, this is not the property for you.If you are looking for a quality spot with very good pool offerings and a reasonable price (vs. $250 + for a higher rated hotel), then you can't go wrong at Tapatio Cliffs.
