{"text":"It's almost humorous We just got back from staying a week at the resort and if my kids would't have had a good time I would have been furious (ages 3 and 1).Good thing the 3 year old loves to swim because there was NOTHING eles for him to do. Here is a list of things that went wrong:From the time we arrived to the time we got into our room with our luggage it was almost 2 hours and after our long flight and being so tired, I didn't have the energy to switch rooms when they gave me a room with a king bed instead of two queens like we requested. Service was horrible, don't bother asking for anything because you were going to be a bother to the staff or thats what you felt like, even when ordering drinks you had to walk up to the bar youself, so carry cash it comes in handy if you want good sevice.We ate 3 meals without a high chair (can you imagine doing that with a 1 year old)? They claim to have ran out.Shower in our room was broken, we called to have someone fix it but when no one showed up we gave up.You couldn't get into eat at any of the restraunts if you didn't have reservations a week in advance ( no joke) unless you wanted to have dinner at 9:00 and with kids unrealistic.Bring your own crib because they ran out, so you were on your own even if you did request one in advance.Beach was rocky and unswimable.Oh... and the food, disgusting especially the buffett.ALL in ALL...... I think I lost weight from not eating and drinking or it could of been the half a mile walk to the room from the pool. They claim to have golf carts but don't count on it. ","annotations":[]}
