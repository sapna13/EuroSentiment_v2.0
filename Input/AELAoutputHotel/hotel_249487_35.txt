{"text":"Water Club... ok Stood at the Water Club with a group of friends. Its not at all a bad place. It's very shiek, very modern, contemporary and very trendy. However, it is not practical. The blue lighting in the rooms are cool to look at, but is again not practical. You can't use blue light when trying to look for something in your room during the night time. Of course there is the bathroom light, but when sharing the room with two other people, that's not always accessible. The showers are annoying, for whatever reason they only have 1\/2 a door so all the water splashes out and drenches the throw towel that is used for the floor. The AC also did not work very well and in PR's July humidity, AC is a must. The staff is fairly pleasan, the valet men and the door men who hang about outside are absolutely terrrific! The most coolest and down the earth people I've ever met. The rooftop bar was pretty cool but they did charge $2 for a cup of ice... just ice! I am very particular about beds and my bed was very comfy. I stayed on the top floor and I didn't have any complaints about the noise coming fromt he rooftop... not sure what those other folks are talking about.Would I stay here again... not unless they fix the blue lighting. Relying on that blue light to look for something after the sun goes down gets annoying fast.
