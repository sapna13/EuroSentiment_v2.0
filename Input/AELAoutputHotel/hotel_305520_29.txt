{"text":"dont stay at the orchard hotel I work for an international shipping company. I have been staying at the Orchard Hotel Singapore for around three months now. This has given me enough time to evaluate the hotel and may I say that it is the worst hotel that I have ever had the displeasure of staying at.Please allow me to give an example, on 31st dec 07 at around 530pm I received a phone call in my room from the guest relations officer, informing that I had to relocate rooms because they claimed they were doing rectification on that floor, keep in mind this is new years eve. Disappointed I moved to another room on another floor. I went down to reception and spoke to the guest relations officer who ensured me that the rooms were undergoing rectification and that nobody would be staying in the room that I once occupied. So it was to my surprise when I called the room from my newly appointed smaller room and to my surprise there was somebody staying in there. The guest relations officer blatantly lied to me.The gymnasium is poor in relation to some of the equipment. The treadmills require servicing only one of them gets upto the speed that you select. the decor in the rooms looks tired, fixtures in the rooms need repair. Fire exits are blocked on occasion by room service trolleys or boxes and the doors that should provide you with a somke free escape are rotten at the bottom. The thermostats in the rooms that I have stayed in dont work. When I checked in they reserved 1000 dollars on my credit card without my knowledge. Overall A poor hotel with tired staff.
