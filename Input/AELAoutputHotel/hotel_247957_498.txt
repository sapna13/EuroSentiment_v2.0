{"text":"One of our better AI trips We stayed at this resort for 8 days and had a relaxing time. We thought the food was about average for most of the all inclusive resorts in the Dominican Republic (DR). But the air conditioned restaurants was a plus. Making reservations for the restaurants, we found out you can book all three at the same time and make sure you arrive on time, otherwise they will reject you. We have visited Puerto Plata, Boca Chica and though this one was one of the better trips. The beach is swimable, the sand fine and the water was as blue as the sky. The pool area was large enough for the resort. If the beach was filled we would enjoy the day at the pool and always find a quiet spot. The grounds are kept clean and pretty. The room we stayed in was a junior suite in building 13 on the first floor, facing the ocean, which was away from the foul odor on the opposite side of the resort. To our surprise the room was recently renovated, new bed, linens, curtains but the bathroom is due for some updating, eventhough the hardward to the shower and sink was changed. I recommend tipping as they will appreciate it, especially the maid because she made sure our drinks and towels were well stocked. We found that when the hotel desk did not have change for US $'s, the bell boy did. Also, on our way back the taxi fare from the hotel was raised to $30 USD one way (we didn't have a choice because it is a set rate). But upon your arrival, if you are traveling without a group\/agency, I recommend negotiating a taxi fare rate beforehand and you might save a couple of $'s, we paid $20 USD to the Occidental and tipped the guy $5 USD, he was quiet happy and I saved $5.All in all this was one of our better all inclusive trips to the DR.
