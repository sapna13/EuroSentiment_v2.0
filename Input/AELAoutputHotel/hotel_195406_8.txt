{"text":"This is not a 4 star hotel...maybe 2 star at best I am very surprised about all the reviews I've read. We arrived on our honeymoon last week to find two separate twin beds even though we had booked a double. When we asked to change rooms or fix the bed they said no that they were booked and that the chamber maid had gone home. (who was cleaning the room next to ours) When I pointed that out they then said that she was too busy to help us and we would have to wait until the following day. We pointed out that our booking instructions had said HONEYMOON and they still didn't care. We were then finally moved to a room that had black carpeting (from dirt) that was meant to be beige, a TV with no plug and about 1 inch of dirt on everything. After much complaining we were finally moved to a room that was clean with the twin beds pushed together. I'm still not sure why they just didn't move us there in the first place. We weren't asking for an upgrade. Just wanted what we booked and were treated as if we were asking for too much. This hotel was 1\/4 full at best and everything was shut including the restaurant and laundry service.The only thing I liked about this place was the lobby, the coffee in the morning and the location. The breakfast was pathetic.Note that this is from a couple who have traveled for over 10 years together. We've only asked to change rooms one other time due to the fact a construction site outside our window was knocking the pictures onto the bed at 6 am while we were sleeping. Such a shame because the website looked so nice.
