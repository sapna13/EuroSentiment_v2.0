{"text":"great stay at Royal Plaza again.. I'm just back from my second stay at the Royal Plaza.Both times were for business, so I'm not sure how the holiday traveller will find the hotel...I found whole experience pleasent and the staff very friendly and helpful. The rooms were a good size and the complimentary internet and mini bar a nice touch for Singapore.The bathrooms are nice with sufficiant toiletries for long haul destination, should your luggage get delayed there's enough here to keep you going.The location is also a great plus point if you are looking for a hotel in the middle of the hustle and bustle and, of course shopping, of Orchard.There's plenty of eating options around, and one of my favourite vegatarian restaurants is just a short walk away!..Singapore is such a safe place I've never felt uncomfortable as a lone female traveller walking around alone after dark. However if you happen to be near the Hyatt or Mariott across the road you'll notice the presence of prostitutes hanging around outside the hotels, which may make you feel uncomfortable...coming from Amsterdam, I'm not bothered....but I've witnessed none of this at the Royal Plaza.The gym facilites are pretty small here, one tredmill, bike, step machine, weight maching and free weights. Which is fine and I've only ever been the 2nd or 3rd person in the there, but I do miss the sauna\/steam facilities that are usually found in 4\/5 star hotels in Singapore, especiall after the long flight.Overall I would (and have) recommend this hotel, the price is good, but I have noticed it rise since my last visit. I fthis continues I think I'll go back to the Hyatt as the facilities are much more varied...which is what you pay for.
