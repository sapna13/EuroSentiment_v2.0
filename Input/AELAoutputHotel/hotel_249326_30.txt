{"text":"Overpriced, dirty, and unhelpful staff...need I say more? we stayed here last weekend as part of a group of girls (women) on a hen weekend to amsterdam. from start to finish this was a disappointing experience and anyone who has stayed anywhere remotely nice will find this a shock to the system. a holiday inn or a tulip would have been better... and cleaner!the hotel, despite much e mail correspondence had cancelled our booking, despite us having written confirmation. so we were forced to grovel for our room- how I wish we hadn't ... the hotel is a really interesting building (an ex sanatorium\/orphanage I think) with some great marketing, but the rooms were just like they probably were 50 years ago - I've heard of keeping the experience authentic, but really it was laughable to suggest the hotel was 3 star. not one of could see how it was even one. the shower was filthy, with mould and dirt on the floor, the rooms were beyond basic, very cold and there was no room service. the blankets were dirty and you had to pay for any extras at all - hairdryer, tv channels etc. the bar was smoky (of course not their fault - we just so used to non smoking uk now) and expensive. there was no room service food or drink for once we arrived and there was no where to get even a glass of water from (the vending machine - yes - a vending machine in a so called 3 star hotel - was empty of water - not great after many beers). It is a good 20 minute walk into central amsterdam and whilst I understand that drugs are much the norm, there were people dealing openly outside the hotel.when we asked reception (already not impressed with them with their less than welcoming attitude) to book us cabs to our restaurant (jamie oliver fifteen - VERY good - much recommended but book in advance) on Saturday night, after 30 mins in reception , we enquired again and they had 'forgotten'. the main toilets in the bar\/reception were dirty and had no loo roll and they clearly think that by draping a few sheets everywhere and turning the lights down, people won't notice how grotty it is. It is a shame, as their 'brand' is funky, and the club adjoining the hotel is meant to be one of the best in amsterdam - we did not go as it was hard core dance on sat night, and queues were long.we were only using the room to kip in after boozy days out, so it didn't matter so much, but i would not recommend this place to anyone - go to a budget chain- at least you''ll get clean sheets and its probably cheaper. Alternatively go to Banks Mansions in the centre of Amsterdam - it is fabulous and well worth the extra money - a boutique hotel with great service and free drinks and nibbles and breakfast (no breakfast included at the Arena).Incidentally - we loved amsterdam , it is fantastic.
