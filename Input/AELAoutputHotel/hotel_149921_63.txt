{"text":"Service was terrible, room was ok, food was expensive We stayed here for a romantic getaway. When we arrived we could tell the service was going to be an issue. The valet\/check-in stations were not well organized. We went to valet the car and told a guy we wanted to park. He told us to leave the car and then he forgot about it. We went to check in (which took 30 mins!...no one is in a rush here) and they still had not moved it. We walked over to the car and told them we wanted it parked and then they took care of it. Once we got checked in we asked to have our bags delivered to the room. After waiting 45 minutes, we called and they said they would send them up. After 15 more minutes we went downstairs to find them still sitting where we left them. We ended up taking them up ourselves.We ate by the pool and ended up spending $100 on 2 drinks each and sandwiches! We ate at most of the restaurants and found the food and service to be average with the exception of Lemongrass. While this was our most expensive meal (we ate just apps and drinks and it was still $150!) it was by far the best meal of the trip. I found the pools to be a bit chilly, crowded and noisy with lots of kids. We actually rented a car and drove to Ponce for the day. We stumbled across a place called Copamarina and will stay there next time. The pools were perfect, spread out and they had more activities on the beach (parasaling, snorkeling etc. right outside the room door!)
