{"text":"The Best, The Best, The Best, The Best This Hotel was a pleasant surprise after returning from our cruise for 12 days to the Mediterranean, we spent 5 nights from May 1st until yesterday May 6. My husband and I did some research over the internet and found this hotel...What a surprise, it was not over priced for it's PERFECT LOCATION, a clean, neat, very modern hotel, with perfect facilities, the rooms are big, huge bathroom, plasma tv, in the center of everything but with perfect insulation to avoid the noise, considering it's location. The staff on the front desk, the BEST EVER!!!, Very Knowledgable, always willing to help and recommend places, they took care of most the dining reservations for us (party of 4) , because we do not want to go to tourist places...we want to have the real deal of local food, we did not care for the price,,,we wanted the best...and they took care of everything.... My husband and I travel a lot....and we recommend this hotel and will stay in it when we come back to Madrid..they makeus feel at home..and that's what's all about. The Hotel has beenmarked as one of the highlights of our 25 days vacation.I walked the streets by myself to go shopping... and never felt insecure. This hotel is located in the exact middle of the Gran Via...can't get any better than that......The Royal Palace to the left.........El Prado Museum on the right......Plaza Mayor, Plaza Santa Ana behind......what else you can asked for????....If someone'sdare to criticize this hotel, should stay home and never go out on vacation!!!!...This is THE PLACE TO STAY!!!!!
