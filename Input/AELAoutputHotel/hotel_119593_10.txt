{"text":"good value, great location The buena vista has mixed but consistent reviews. Firstly it is NOT the Marriott and no they do not do english breakfast. However this is a tidy convenient motel which you should use as a B and B. There is nothing else in the hotel except reasonably clean rooms. Breakfast is included but consists of croissant, other pastries. orange juice,tea and coffee. That's it, so dont ask for more. If you are hungry turn right out of hotel go up hill 300 yards and cross over to the cafe (that's what my son did) In reception there is a pc where u can access the web freeThe location is everything=I was on crutches at time but could still walk to Ghiradelli square, and the busy Polk street. I also got up the hill to see crooked street (very near by if you survive the hill) Please note that you cannot walk to Union Square from the hotel nor China Town even if you are Seb Coe. Once you get to Ghiradelli of course the Wharf is quite close. There was a fair bit of tourist crap here but we loved itDo's=Definitely Al Catraz, repeat definitely. On crutches so we also did a bus tour and this stopped at the Gate and Twin Peaks, hippyville and many others. Twin Peaks was obscured by fog which is a feature of this city, sunshine one minute then fog, maybe some rain,then sunshine again. Do a bus tour if you are short on time. Go to the Wharf and try the seafood, see the seals etc, its all pretty walkable. The chocolate at Ghiradelli is amazingDonts - very few, except the new yorkers told us the shopping in SF was average (well they would of course) but our girls (all 17) loved SF, its a wonderful city full of contrast and fun. One tip- if you want to ride the cable car dont do it at peak times - we queued for about 1 hour to get on at Ghiradelli and we didnt see much on way to Powell street, but its worth it especially if you can hang off side, otherwise you see zip. Second tip- if you are going out in evening in March\/April take a light jumper or you WILL regret it. Third tip- try Polk street for reasonably priced food which will not break your wallet. Finally try the Buena Vista and remember what you are paying for - in our case $400 for 6 people with breakfast for 2 nights Enjoy ","annotations":[{"endOffset":337,"mention":"croissant","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Croissant"],"startOffset":328},{"endOffset":353,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":345},{"endOffset":382,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":376},{"endOffset":1442,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1433}]}
