{"text":"An outstanding hotel with great amenities and comfort! I stayed at The Langham Place in Hong Kong with my family for 12 nights (20\/8-1\/9\/07). We had one Residence Suite and two standard rooms.Our stay was just wonderful. The rooms were beautifully fitted with everything one needs. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a fairly new hotel with high tech features and flat wall TV√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ (the room phone had a screen which allows you to access news, weather, information..etc). The beds and pillows were superbly comfortable. The breakfast buffet was grand with an amazing variety of foods. In the suite, we had access to the Club Lounge, which is open 24 hrs and offered a relaxing atmosphere where you can enjoy free internet, coffee and drinks anytime (plus snacks in the afternoon and evenings). The Club Lounge is only open to suites and club room guests. However, free internet is also provided at the bar level (above the lobby) to all guests. The hotel also has magnificent spa facilities (called the Chuan Spa) √à√\u2020\u2022?something not to be missed. The treatments were costly but indeed splendid and worth it. The hotel also has a top floor covered pool with breathtaking city views, saunas and exercise gym. The location was ideal. The hotel is directly connected to a shopping mall with lots of places to eat and to the Mong Kong MTR underground station.It's one of those hotels which you would really be hard pressed to find something wrong with it.The staff we met throughout our stay were very friendly and helpful, except for one little blemish that occurred at our check out from the suite. At 2PM, I was sitting at the Club Lounge desk waiting to check out while a male employee was finishing up some paperwork. As soon as he finished, I expected him to attend to me because I had been the only person sitting right in front of him, across his desk, for some time. But instead, he noticed a Chinese looking man, holding a US passport, entering the Club Lounge. He immediately got up and went around the desk to greet him, asking him if he was checking in or out. He then proceeded to help him, while totally ignoring me. Favoritism, racism, something else√à√\u2020\u2022?I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know! But whatever it was√à√\u2020\u2022? it was a blatantly rude behavior. Anyway, another female employee, who happened to be in the Lounge speaking to another guest came later to the desk and helped me check out. Despite this last minute disappointing flop, I still highly rate this hotel and give it the full five stars which it rightfully deserves.
