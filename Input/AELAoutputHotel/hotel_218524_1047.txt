{"text":"Great resort made greater by some special employees We went to Excellence for our honeymoon and were really impressed by all aspects of our stay. But we're writing this to praise a couple of very important players in our excellent stay. The restaraunt manager's name is Victor and he went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and more importantly, happy during our stay. He was polite, friendly, extremely accomodating and warm to both myself and my wife - most importantly he was being sincere and not doing it for a tip, in fact he wouldn't accept one when we offered.The other person we were really impressed by was Fransisco. He is a young man who is extremely gifted in languages. We went for a Spanish lesson and really just ended up enjoying our time with Fransisco, the instructor. I believe he originally comes from close to the Haiti border so he speaks Creole which he proudly spoke when he learned we were from Canada in hopes we could speak french which has similarities to Creole. He went on to display his talent in speaking Spanish, French, Italian and even some German. Fransisco is a very bright young man and i'm confidant he'll have a very bright future, which he truly deserves. We ran into him numerous times after our lesson and each time he would beam a smile our way and say hello to us by names even though he must have met at least 100 people a day. I wish i could have thanked him for everything before we left. I would have said Gracias Fransisco, mon ami. Sincerley, John and Lisa. (Toronto, Canada) ","annotations":[]}
