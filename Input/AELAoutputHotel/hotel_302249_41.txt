{"text":"What an amazing place - Magic! We have just arrived back from 5 stunning days at the Ritz Carlton in Bali. We had initially booked an ocean view suite, however when we arrived were told taht they had over booked these particular rooms so they had to upgrade us to a cliff top villa! We checked in reasonably quickly and were then escorted by hotel buggy to the villa.We entered through beautiful balinese doors to the sound of water trickling down the water feature, placed strategically near the entrance. The air temp inside the villa was very refreshing considering the sweltering heat we had experienced outside. Immediatley our eyes were drawn to the private plunge pool directly outside of the double glass doors, off the lounge area. There was also a balinese style cabana and sun lounges for you to enjoy the view. Our view was not of the ocean, however the garden sourrounding the pool area was very nice. Off the lounge area was the bedroom which had a huge king size bed, and a large plasma screen (not that there was any watching tv). From the bed, you could see outside onto the patio area and pool. It was a nice spot to lie when it got too hot outside.The most impressive part of the villa was the gigantic bathroom. It had double vanities, a changing area, a huge shower and toilet area and then the pinicle of the whole room was the huge spa bath sitting in a bay window so that you had full view of the pool while taking a bath. The bath was filled with cool water and had floating frangipani's and rose petals for beautiful presentation.My gorgeous boyfriend would pour a cool bath and a galss of wine for me each night before we went out to relax me so that I could enjoy sunset from the comfort of the bathroom!! It was heaven!The grounds of the Ritz Carton are breath-taking! It is set high on a cliff with green, soft grass areas and crystal cleaqr pools spread all over. The most impressive pool was the one which was set in the cliff side, with views spanning out over the indian ocean. From the pool you could look down to the private beach or out for miles into the ocean. It was a magical place to sit and have a cocktail by the pool in the late afternoon.We ate at the Italian restaurant on the first night we were there. The food was reasonable and the menu was quite extensive. I wouldn't rave about the food and the restaurant was quite empty, without much atmosphere so it wasn't the best night, however it was great that we could just walk from our villa to the restaurant in 5 minutes flat and not have to worry about leaving the grounds. There were some local guys serenading the few guests that were dining with U2 and Elvis Prestly. It was very sweet!My only suggestion, given that I spoke with other guests at the resort, would be to stay in a villa if at all possible. I don't think the experience would have been quite the same if we were staying in a standard room. I heard that some of the rooms are quite out dated and old and not that exciting to spend much time in.The only other problem was the fact that the hotel was quite removed from all of the action at Seminyak. It takes between 30-60 mins to travel to seminyak from the hotel, depending on the traffic. This can get quite frustrating when you are stuck in traffic which happened to us one day.My suggestion for the area of Jimbaran would be to have dinner on the beach where all the local seafood is served. You choose what you want from large water tanks and they cook it fresh on the spot. You sit directly on the sand, surrounded by many many candlelit tables. Its a very romantic and serene expereince.The other must haves in terms of dining for Seminyak would be The Living Room, Ku de ta and a cocktail at The Legian Hotel. All in all, I would say that our experience was extremely pleasant. I would go back there tomorrow given a chance. Bali is an amazing holiday destination with all the luxuries you could desire. We found that the Ritz Carlton provided everything that we had hoped for and then some. Must do it!!
