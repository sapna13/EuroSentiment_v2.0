{"text":"Had a nice time, but wouldn't go again This was our first vacation in 15 years, and though it definitely wasn't an above average resort, we did enjoy our stay. The rooms were outdated but clean. The air conditioning and water worked, and the bed was very confortable. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, and the site is clean and well kept. (The staff can always be seen attending to its upkeep, we were impressedand humbled by the diligent and hardworking staff) The beach was lovely and the weather was phenomenal. The buffet was average\/good, yet had much variety. Unfortunately, the √ã√ë√∏ la carte restaurants left alot to be desired. Especially the italian. The Spanish grill was a pleasant surprise as most of the people that had went there before us, complained of overcooked meat and poor service. We were there on Valentine's Evening, and the service was quick (probably because it was 9pm) and the food were the best that we had tasted, - the filet mignon was cooked perfectly. The Mexican was fine, and the service we received there was wonderful...Great staff... One major problem with this hotel was the salesmen trying to sell vacation packages... Very annoying and they are relentless... On a better note, we went on an excursion to eat lobster(really huge langoustine), speed boat picks up on beach, 7 min ride to drop you off at this quaint resto - for 50US$... it was out of this world, great service, plenty to eat (my husband had langoustine  shrimp plate - it was huge......and well presented) drinks, salade, dessert, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE... Though we probably wouldn't return to this particular resort, it was good value for the money....
