{"text":"Great Hotel, but Beware the French ;-) My wife and I visited this hotel during a recent weekend. The previous reviews are accurate = good service  great location (to Metro, Air France Shuttle, Champ Elysees). We arrived early and had to leave our bags, while we explored the area. When we came back they had already placed our bags into our room (nice touch). The elavator is SUPER tiny, so get ready to make several trips. We would recommend a Suite, as the rooms are very tiny. With the Junior Suite we were able to fit our bags, no problem. Room was somewhat clean - some dirt near door, which was odd - but the bathroom was very clean. Our phone was a Pulse phone, versus a Tone, so had to use my cell phone for checking voice-mails, etc....Front desk receptionists were very helpful and polite. No need to rent a car, the Metro will get you everywhere, BUT beware of people trying to squeeze behind you when you pass through the Metro gates (turnstiles). My wife and I got a serious scare when a guy tried to force his way through, almost glued to my wife, with her ticket. He then cursed my wife and spit on the ground in front of us, when we confronted him! As if we were doing something wrong! Furthermore, beware the taxi drivers - they try to charge you 1 Euro per Suitcase - even though this isn't written anywhere. You really don't need a taxi with the Metro being so convenient. We REFUSED to use a taxi after this woman taxi driver tried to rip us off, stating that this is Paris and this is the way it is! I guess the taxi meters don't mean anything then. So, bottom-line, great hotel and location, but beware the locals as they try to take advantage of you. Keep your guard up please!
