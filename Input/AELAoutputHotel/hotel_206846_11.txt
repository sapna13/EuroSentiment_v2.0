{"text":"very nice hotel and within walking distance to the city centre We stayed at this hotel im May and booked one of the executive suits. on first arriving in the room we were perhaps a little disapointed as the picture of the rooms were entirely different from that on the internet. obviously we are aware that picutre often dont depict the exact rooms, but it was very different. however. on closer inspection of the room we realised that it was very nice. the bed was amazing, huge and very comfy, and the room had all necessary ammenities. the jacuzzi bath was big for a bath, but unfortunately when we got there it didnt work. the manageress came to fix it which we thought was a bit odd, but it seemed to work. that night when using the bath one of the pipes must have come loose again and the jacuzzi stopped working, it was late so we didnt complain, but the following morning we wanted to make sure it would be working for that evening. the staff were fairly helpfull and the jaccuzi was fixed that night. all in all the room was very nice, but a few minor hiccups. most people who have reviewed the hotel said it was quite far out, but we found that to be a blessing. it was still within walkable distance (about 20 - 30 mins) and it was nice to see this part of amsterdam. if we had been staying in the city we would not have got to have seen all the gorgeous building surrounding the hotel. trams were also very convienient if you didnt want to walkoverall i think this is a very nice hotel. if you have already looked at the pictures on the internet of the executive suites then you may be disapointed but the staff are helpfull, and location is ideal to be able to get away from the hustle and bustle.
