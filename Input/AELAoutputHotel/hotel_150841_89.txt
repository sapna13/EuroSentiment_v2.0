{"text":"Punta Cana is Paradise This hotel was a wonderful all-inclusive. The staff was happy, helpful and cheerful. The language barrier was minimal. The grounds were beautiful. The rooms were nice with a sunken sitting room\/bedroom. The air conditioner in the room worked real hard to try to keep up with the outside temperature and humidity. The bathroom had a separate tub and shower stall. My only complaint was that the bathroom didn't have a fan and therefore the bathroom was always hot and humid. Bring your own hairdryer. The one provided was not great for drying my hair. The food was pretty good. In addition to the buffet, we also went to the Mediterranean, the Steakhouse, and the French restaurant. The Steakhouse was good, but the other two were excellent choices. The buffet provided a good assortment of food, even kids could find something to eat. The breakfast buffet was delicious. Lunch was wonderful, too. They had a couple themes set up during the week, a cookout where they grilled ribeyes and the dominican day where then made paeau (spelling? rice and seafood in a spicy sauce) in giant skillets. In my opinion, this resort did not skimp on alcohol. The staff was always pushing drinks. If you declined, they would keep trying to suggest other things. The beach was absolutely beautiful. Clean water and the individual cabanas were nice and kept us from burning in the sun. The pool was nice. There was a nice swim up bar. Lots of activities, from beach volleyball, bingo, water aerobics, dancing lessons, water polo, etc. We went on an extra 2 hour scuba diving excursion. Very nice. I would definitely recommend this resort and will return again in the near future.
