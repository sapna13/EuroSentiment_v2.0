{"text":"Significant deterioration... I stayed in this hotel many times back in the days when it was the Four Seasons Olympic. My spouse and I recently had the misfortune to stay there again under its new (Fairmont) sponsorship.We arrived around 10 pm only to find that the room we had booked through American Express (and gauranteed for late arrival!) had been given away to a guest who had arrived earlier. The desk clerk DOWNGRADED us at the same price we had paid for the superior room that he had given away earlier!We complained to American Express who apparently caused a stink with the asst. manager who grudgingly offered to move us to our original room the next day with a $30 credit for the night we arrived.We declined the asst, manager's offer because we didn't want to stay around to monitor our luggage during the move and we were staying for only 36 hours anyway. We took the credit instead for 2 nights. At our age and after all we've been through, we weren't keen to stay in a below-par room, credit or no credit, but there was nothing we could do without destroying our leisure time the next day!Apart from the bad check-in experience, contacting room service was difficult with many minutes spent on hold. Some more experienced staff would be in order... and fewer shyster practices!I've been traveling on business for over 40 years and so I know that hotels routinely give away their best rooms (even the GAURANTEED ONES!!!) if it appears that the guest may be a no-show. Knowing that we would be a late arrival, I deliberately chose the Fairmont based on my earlier experiences from when this hotel was under the Four Seasons banner.I'll never stay at the Fairmont again!! If we had want to subject ourselves to the shoddiest practices of the lodging industry we would have stayed at a cut price motel. At least they smile when they're ripping you off!
