{"text":"one of our best resorts Excellence Punta Cana is on a beautiful secluded ,uncrowded and well maintained beachfront property. Perfect for a romantic adults only vacation.We have stayed at over 10 different all inclusive 4 or 5star in the Caribean. This is our favorite so far. Where else to go after such a luxury resort for the price. Since the standards of service were so high at the Excellence Punta Cana, we will book Excellence in the Mayan in February.Beach:We enjoyed the waiters that served drinks and pizza on the beach and pool area. They were very prompt at keeping the area free of empty glasses and litter. No cigarette butts in the sand, there is a ashtray-flower pot at each cabana. Lots of towels and lounge chairs around the pool and beach. Note the undertow in the ocean can be strong.Pool: Clean, long and many floating mats and loungers availableRestaurants: Dinner..all a la carte. Except buffet at one restaurant on Domincain Republic theme night. No reservations required for a la carte restaurants. Just show up between the open hours. If there is a waiting time, they supply you with a beeper when a table is available for you. You can relax, follow no appointments like back home....leave your watches in your luggage and enjoy your vacation. The food was freshly prepared, very tasty and with a nice presentation at all the six restaurants we attended. Breakfast and lunch were buffet style, clean serving dishes and not over cooked food.Animation: Energetic polite,friendly. But mostly they did respect your wish if you would prefer to relax and only watch. Inez, Mariel Andre and mostly Rey made us feel welcome and happy to be on vacation with them at this resort. Evenings:Before the show, they did play those silly games on stage . But they were never insulting or degrading games for the guest such as we have seen at other resorts. The evening main shows were of good quality since the shows were not put on only by animation team but rather invited entertainers. Disco: The animations team even stayed at the disco for 1 1\/2 hours...They would dance with the guests. They were probably very tired, but they didn't let that stop them. My favorite part is that I I would get to dance latino salsa, meringue to local songs with a dominican flair.. Can't do that back home in our clubsExcellence deserves to be number 1 resort of Punta Cana. They will do what you need to make this your best vacation. You can trust them with your vacation.
