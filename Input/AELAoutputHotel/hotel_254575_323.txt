{"text":"Enjoyed Our Stay My wife, 6-year old son and I stayed here on the last 2 nites of a 2 week vacation in England. After arriving at Victoria Station and making the trek (four blocks) to the hotel, we were welcomed by Benard. We stayed in the room downstairs with 3 single beds. The dining room is located on the same level, but any noise during the a.m. breakfast hour was barely audible due to a glass door separating the two rooms. Although the room had its own bathroom, there was also a toilet outside of the room which we found handy and convenient. The room was small, but clean and comfortable. The beds were firm and comfortable. We appreciated the in-room safe. The bathroom was tight, but usable. The shower worked well with good pressure and plenty of hot water. Fortunately, we did not have to use the fan (and forgo any A\/C) because the heat wave had passed so the temperature in the room was comfortable. There were 2 chairs in the room, but we often sat on the bed. The only criticism that I have about our room is that the channels on the television were very limited and the tv reception was spotty. But then again, we didn't spend a lot of time in the room. Loved the neighborhood and all that it offered - many restaurants, markets, coffee shops, etc. We had a very tasty dinner at the indian restaurant recommended by the hotel. We would have ate at Sole Mio, but it was closed on Sunday so we ate at a nearby italian restaurant. Benard and Peter were great and made a supreme effort to make our stay enjoyable. At breakfast, they both competed to serve my son the best hot cocoa in the morning. I'm glad my son didn't take sides. We would definitely stay here again. The value, service and convenience simply can't be beat. We look forward to returning again.
