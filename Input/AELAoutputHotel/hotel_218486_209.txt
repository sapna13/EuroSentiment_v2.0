{"text":"Priceless Experience!!! Just Great!!! Took my two sons Matthew and Nicholas and two grandaughters Cassie and Missy to Ocean Bavaro for seven nights...booked using an online service auction...got an ocean view clean room with huge jacuzzi tub and clean cold air conditioning...due to this being my fourth trip..i knew what room to ask for in advance:)What made our trip special were three things! One was the ocean..every day it was hot and the beach was clean and fun to be on with the girls, my sons and the people we met there! The 2nd thing that made Ocean Bavaro was our bartender at the beach pool...his name is Santiago or just Santy...tremendous..wonderful person who instantly made us feel welcome and who was our good friend there at the resort..if they-- Ocean Bavaro only knew to hire a few more Santaigos....who could not be happy!!! The third thing that made Punta Cana special was the Jungle Safari trip we took the girls on to see the countryside. We visited the sugar plantation and met the people working there from Haiti...as close to slavery as i would ever want to be....BUT I had brought from the USA..many things to give these people as we drove at a fast clip past their homes made of tar paper and card board....I had asked the guide...Michael to please allow me to give my gifts..I had an entire LARGE suitcase...to the kids there..so in a safe area he pulled over and we just sat for like one minute and waited and ..all of a sudden here are so many kids..I opened the suitcase and gave them Baseballs, baseball gloves I had bought at yard sales or begged from the baseball coach at home...baseball cards, crayons pencils, tablets and notebooks....yes candy..(forgive me)...soap, shampoo and toothpaste...my students had given me(I teach 9th and 10th grade us hist at Warwick High School)...so many happy kids....we left them all happy and i STILL had some more things in my suitcase and we went a short distance and saw a man on a mo ped..fishing with fish hanging from his cycle and hes carrying like four people with him!!! My guide smiled and said..watch ...and we stopped at the next farm..it was the fishermens house...and..he had TWELVE kids...out went the suitcase and we gave everything away....even the people on the safari trip were helping to give gifts to the kids..all of them got a baseball and a baseball glove..someday maybe we will see them in Philadelphia????So yes there are issues with the language..gee sorry you are not at Wildwood Crest, New Jersey...tqake a look at the water???---you are in a FOREIGN country..hello?????....there are one million motor boats that buzz the beach nearby..thats their life!!! They need those boast for transport!!!! The food? Wow,..it was great and like five or six different restaurants to choose from every day? What did you want more than that? Oh one more thing that made Ocean Bavaro special:) The Spa there is to KILL FOR!!!! A Massage for one hour or work out there...even out door massages....wonderful!!!!!!What made all this priceless you ask Maurice? The sixth day on the beach little five year old Missy Blose comes up to grandpa..(thats me Maurice) on the beach and says..Grandpa...we are going to stay here! Everyone else can come here and visit us..ok? Finally please say hello to Santiago at the bar by the pool and tell him he is a great friend and missed by Maurice, Matta nd Nick!!!
