{"text":"worst experience ever This was the worst experience we have had in any hotel. The room is really ridiculously small. There is barely room for the queen bed and night-stands. No room for the luggage. Fortunately, ours were small and we managed to show them under the bed. Although with modern design, the room looked worn off. Haven't been given a lift off for some time.That however turned to be the least of the problems. The maid service was mediocre. All they did was to make the bed. didn't touch even the towels in the washroom, not to mention cleaning up. The works experience however came during the last night we stayed there. Suddenly the cold water stopped and only a boiling hot water was running. Even the flush was using hot water. We couldn't shower and the toilet felt as if it is going to explode. A call to the reception got me just one unconvincing I am sorry, I will send somebody up sometime in the morning. Well, we had no choice but to use more eau the toilet and keep packing. Then, at 5am we got our wake-up call and information that our taxi for the airport is already waiting downstairs with running meter. When we called the elevator, nothing happened. Turns out, the elevator was broken and nobody cared to inform us or to come up to the eight floor to help with the luggage. We had to drag it all the way down by ourselves and when we got in the taxi, the meter was showing already 10 Euro while the standard fare to the Airport is about 25 Euro.My complains at the reception were answered with the same bored and uninterested I am sorry and I was told that this is the service I should be expecting in a normal hotel.I would never return to this place.
