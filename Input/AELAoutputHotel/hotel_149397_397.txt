{"text":"great weather, not so great resort Me and my husband and 4 year old son just returned yesterday (Jan.23\/07) from a one week stay at the Bavaro princess.First of all let me say that the property at this resort is beautiful.A very very large resort for those who enjoy that, most of the time you have to take a tram which came quite frequently. We were booked into a junior suite which was very outdated, small, noisy and very far from the beach and main pool, we upgraded to a suite 3 days into our trip for ten dollars per person a night, which was well worth it. Talked to alot of people who were extremely dissapointed with the junior suites, my honest advice is to upgrade if possible. Now I will comment on the food, again I too read the comments on this site before leaving and I thought alot of it was an exageration but unfortunately I now have to agree that this resort is not all that's it's cracked up to be.As far as the food, please be careful not to be too adventerous as my husband became very ill 3 days into our trip from somethiing he ate. I talked to quite a few other people with the same problem, in fact one party of 17 all had food poisining! Thankfully my son who is an extremely picky eater was fine.Be careful as to where you get your buns,breads etc.. fom because we witnessed a black bird pecking peices out of the breads , I actually informed a few people who were approaching this area to get bread not to eat it.The service fom the wait staff was quite slow as well,definately brush up on your spanish before leaving.To sum up our trip we were dissapointed and unfortunately have to say we would not return, but like every other comment on this site you pretty much have to go and judge for yourself. we did come back nicely tanned.
