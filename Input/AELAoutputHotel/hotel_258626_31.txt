{"text":"Big Let Down I was disappointed by the Prava Suites from the minute we pulled into the drive. When we got to the room, our key card would not work on the door. The light turned green but the door would not open. Rooms were large and clean but very outdated. The TV in the bedroom did not work and my husband had to fix it himself when the front desk did not answer the call. The hotel was overrun with children. We expected a more adult-focused hotel with the minimum check-in age advertised everywhere as 21-years old. At 10:30 PM on Sunday evening we attempted to visit the pool but there were literally 20-kids under the age of 12 screaming and running around wildly, as they were up and down the halls most of the weekend. The fitness facility was basically a playground overrun with kids as well. When we visited the bar and front desk asking to borrow a bottle opener they could not find one to let us use, even at the bar. The business center was not working and there is no printing availability from the guest room. Parking in a open, unsecured, uncovered, unguarded lot is $8 per night. There is no reason to pay for this parking. I usually stay at the Wyndham right across the tollway when in the Dallas metroplex and I wish I would have during this trip. Very, very disappointed. The only good thing was the location, but there are plenty other hotels in the area, in this price range to choose from. ","annotations":[]}
