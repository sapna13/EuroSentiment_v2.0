{"text":"Love this Hotel of Luxury and 5 Star Service I just got in today from a 5 days stay at this hotel I travel the world to over 45 countries and no hotel was a good as this the service, the atmosphere, the people, the location, and most of all the VIEW was just spectacular, I could not get enough of the view I got up at nights at would take a peak at the view it was just breathtaking. The staffs was so helpful even if their english is not great they do whatever they can to help you service is very prompt as well I told my cousin about this hotel and we are already planning a trip to Tokyo as she would like to experience this hotel. Also they upgraded me to a suite as I arrive late from Toronto the room was unbelievable, I fall in love with the massage chair and also the toilet seat with multiple functions, the maids doesnt bother u they come later in the afternoon to clean up. The breakfast in the hotel is very good but anything else is pricey but a few minutes up the road there are many restaurants which includes McDonalds, Tony Romas Rib and Steaks and also lots of Japanese cuisine close by you wont starve. I really love Tokyo the place is amazingly clean, people are super polite, Transportation is first class to none, no cabs though they are pricey. I develop a special love for Tokyo, it is a vast city with beautiful neon coloured buildings and with great architecture. Akasaka Prince Hotel is just a wonderful hotel and dont hesitate to stay here you wont regret it. I am a world traveller and I have it all this is the BEST. I give this hotel a 6 Star.
