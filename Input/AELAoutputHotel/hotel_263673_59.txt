{"text":"Problems w\/ Degli Orafi Great location, right around the corner from the Uffizi. But for a 4-star hotel, you get 2-star service. The front desk couldn't locate our reservation when we arrived and made us wait around for over an hour. A better hotel would have just checked us in w\/ our credit card and dealt w\/ the hotel voucher on their own time. We asked the front desk to reserve us a table at Trattoria Sostanza the following evening, which they said they would do and that if there was any problem they'd let us know ASAP. Sure enough, when we got to the restaurant, the restaurant manager didn't have our reservation. When we called the hotel to help resolve the issue, the woman who answered the phone was the one who didn't make the reservation and quickly put us on hold. Someone else picked up the phone and said the woman who booked the reservation was not working that evening. (Fortunately, the rest. mgr. took pity on us and gave us a table.) When I asked for a 2nd key, the front desk was experiencing technical difficulty, which I guess never got resolved, since they never provided me a key. We had problems w\/ our rooms circuit breaker, b\/c the TV and electricity would go out every 10 mins., which was corrected by housekeeping. We stayed there for 3 nights.The upside is that we did get a better room (mainly b\/c they ran out of rooms while they made us wait). The hotel housekeeping was quite good. ","annotations":[]}
