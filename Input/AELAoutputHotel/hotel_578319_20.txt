{"text":"Modern Hotel In A Traditional Country I selected All Seasons, taking into consideration its price, location and high ratings on Trip Advisor.Overall, I think it was quite a nice hotel, with a very modern setting. Vibrant colours were used throughout the hotel, including the uniforms of the staff!The room is clean and spacious. However, the room we stayed in, had a slight problem with the bathtub, where water tend to overflow to the floor. The bed is comfy, though the sheet feels a little weird. But it didn't impact us having a good night's sleep.The masseurs at the hotel spa were great! My friends and I went for a late night shower and massage at the hotel and we all truly enjoyed it. If you do stay at All Seasons, do check out the spa!Staff at the hotel are generally friendly and helpful. An example would be when we had asked for a late check-out due to our late flight, even though the front desk staff rejected our request, she had offered for us to store our luggages at the concierge. What was delighting was that she had offered for us to shower at the spa, should it be necessary. It was a very pleasant surprise and nice gesture.In my view, the worse part of the hotel is the breakfast. The spread is small and the food taste below average. We were supposed to have 4 breakfasts at the hotel, but we skipped 2 after giving it 2 chances.Overall, I think All Seasons is a hotel where one should consider when visiting Bali.
