{"text":"Great location and awesome service We stayed at the Raddisson Plaza for two nights and we are very happy with our choice to stay there. Our son is vegetarian and we got two calls from the chefs asking us if they could offer anything different for him. Very pleasant atmosphere and withing walking distance to all the fantastic shopping Sydney offers. We easily walked down to the Quay for our dinner cruise. I even had high heels on. Very friendly staff. Of course, the food was pricey but all five star hotels are the same that way. It was good food, so it was worth it to splurge. My tip to you is don't buy their internet service. We recieved free wireless in our room! The rooms are very clean and the bathroom was all marble. Very nice design. The few complaints we have are the key card to get the elevator up tp your room was a pain to us and other guests. We saw the conierge helping others with their cards. You had to put the card in and press the floor than pull out the card!! Even that didn't work sometimes. Another annoyance was when we would shower the bathroom would flood near the shower door. This is due to a poor design in the glass door. No big deal really but I thought it was wierd for such a beautifully appointed hotel having such a flaw. The beds were hard compared to the Marriott's and Hilton hotels we have stayed at. Other than that it was an enjoyable few days.
