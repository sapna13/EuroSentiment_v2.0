{"text":"Great location, nice hotel but check your bill. We stayed here in April 08 for seven nights. Arrived in the morning around 10am and our room was not ready. The agent said that our room had been assigned but the current guests had not checked out yet. It was going to be about 4 hours. We are Starwood gold members and asked if anything else was available, but no luck. When we returned several hours later, we spoke to a different check in rep and she said our original room was still not ready, but when we asked her to check for something else, she came through for us. We ended up on the 4th floor in a newly renovated room that was very modern with a hugh bathroom to die for. Giant shower with top and side shower heads. We loved the shower but be prepared for flooding on the floor. Poor design flaw on the lip of the shower door. Put some extra towels on the floor. Even a flat screen TV with remote in the bathroom. There was also a large flat screen TV in the bedroom area. Very nice. One thing that bothered us a little. For a room that was recently renovated, it had a lot of dirty finger prints on the walls and ceilings. It looked like they were from the workers that were remodeling the rooms. Very sloppy. The breakfast buffet was nice but they need to rotate the selections. We stayed for a week and the food was the same every day. The breakfast was included in our rate. Do not pay for it otherwise. You are better off at a local cafe. There is also a hugh grocery store right next to the hotel. They have wonderful baked bread with meats and cheeses and just about anything else you would need. Get your bottled water there too. The location of this hotel could not be better. You are right off La Rambla and close to the metro. This hotel is very expensive especially when converting US dollars to Euros. While a very nice hotel it is, I think the location and name is what what we are all paying for. We pre paid our stay in full before arrival and upon check out we were charged an extra 30EUR a day for a double room. We already paid for a double room in full. Why were we being charged for it again? We showed the check out agent our receipt showing that we already had paid in full and after he made a copy of it, he quickly removed the charges. Overall, we would stay a the hotel again, mostly for the location. Don't pay for the internet. The hotel has three computers in the business center on the lower level. It is not advertised, but you can use the internet and printers for as long as you like for free, yes, free and it's open 24 hrs.
