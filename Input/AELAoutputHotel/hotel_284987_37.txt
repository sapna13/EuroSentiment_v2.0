{"text":"Pleasure in Paradise My family and I vacationed at the Gran Melia PR September 13-19th and what an awesome time we had. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been a lot of places, but this resort by far is one of my favorites. I would highly recommend placing this resort on your top 5 places to vacation list. Please allow me to take a moment of your time to share my experience at the Gran Melia with you. To begin, when you enter the resort, you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e going to think you stepped into a place like bath and body works. They have these scented oils all over the place and they smell great. The scenery is beautiful, the people are very helpful and friendly, the rooms are spacious, and the pools are huge. If possible, I recommend upgrading to the Royal Service. The Royal Service includes a private butler ready to tend to the most detailed request (Thumbs up to Mario), free happy hour everyday from 6:00-9:00pm (Thumbs up to Pedro) to include alcoholic beverages, evening hors d'oeuvres and cocktails, free all day coffee and tea in the lounge, free continental breakfast (you can upgrade to the hot buffet for $7 if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° like), and if you'd like to relax feel free to lounge at the exclusive adults only Royal Service pool and beach area. Believe me you will feel like royalty during your stay. I wish I did not have to return home.While on the resort, you can take advantage of the casino, the spa, the gym, the restaurants, the pools, and the beach. If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° like to get off the resort Dragon Fly Adventures can assist you with making reservations for New  Old San Juan City, The Rainforest, Carabali Horseback Riding, Mountain Bike Challenge, Four Track Extravaganza, Catamaran - Snorkeling, Bioluminescent Eco-tour, Deep Sea Fishing, Bacardi Tour, Belz Factory Outlet Tour, and Bubble Maker for Kids. Since we were at the Gran Melia for a week, we did a little bit of relaxing and activities. This is absolutely a wonderful resort to visit.I would like to give a very special thanks to Felipe, Yahdira, Mario, Pedro, and Temary for making our vacation worth every penny.Many Thanks,The Lewis FamilyWashington, DC ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1009,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1003},{"endOffset":1017,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1014}]}
