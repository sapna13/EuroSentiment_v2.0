{"text":"Loved the Conrad Nusa Dua! I highly recommend the Conrad Hotel Nusa Dua. I am a married female executive who travels to Asia frequently for business and I decided to do a short detour to Bali after I concluded my business in Singapore. This was my second trip to Bali and I decided to stay at the Conrad after reading the reviews. For first time visitors to Bali, I don't recommend Nusa Dua (my pick is Ubud to experience the lushness of the true Bali) , which feels like a big resort community however, if you are looking to stay at a top of the line resort, this is your place. Other reviews are correct, the hotel is just gorgeous (amazing black marble and teak lobby) and the service is outstanding. The grounds are immaculate with water fountains, lush trees and flowers galore. I agree with others that it is worth it to upgrade to be a Club member to enjoy free internet (in the lobby and in the Club -- oddly I didn't have internet access in my room but I took it as a sign from God that I was meant to detox from my computer for a few days) as well as the breakfast, tea time and cocktails. The rooms are well-appointed with beautiful glassed in shower and a (separate) sunken tub. Nice towels and toiletries, which like most women I am picky about. The Jiwa Spa is wonderful. I had a both a full body and a foot massage. Not the best massage I ever received but very nice and as a Club Member you get a15% discount. The best part of Jiwa Spa? The black ininity pool with a view of the ocean! It's quiet and a welcome retreat from the many noisy children at the resort pools.All the restaurants were excellent though pricey -- $12.00 for Nasi Goreng ( a typical Indonesian dish you can get for less than $2.00 in local restaurants)? Forget it. Still if you want a treat then by all means dig in. Balinese are known for their hospitality and the Conrad is no different. The staff were beyond wonderful and I felt very well taken care of. A quick side story-- when I arrived, I did not realize that it was the eve of Balinese new year -- a time when the whole island shuts down and Balinese do not work, use electricity or even speak --the night before the Day of Silence (the day that brings the world back into balance)-- our hotel staff arranged for the guests to attend the Ogeh Ogeh festival which is an island wide festival where gigantic paper mache demons are paraded through the street by young boys chanting, followed by a procession of gamelan musicians. There were literally thousands of Balinese in the streets and our wonderful hotel staff guided us through the festival explaining its significance. It was an honor and a treat to experience one of the most important days to the Balinese. All in all I had a wonderful experience at Conrad Nusa Dua and highly recommend .
