{"text":"they should have let us know that they hate Americans from the minute I entered the hotel, I had a sinking feeling. The check in was confusing and tedious although there were almost 40 of us in my group and one would think that they would be happy to have such a large party! The rooms were scattered all over the complex. they were filthy smelled and had mold growing on the walls and towels. one room had a razor blade floating in her toilet and there were bugs everywhere. Several of the rooms were not made up in the morning and often no clean towels were left. The social staff were downright rude, except for belly man. They ignored us except for a few lewd comments to some of the girls.It was very clear that they hated Americans. No one ever offered to help There is really only 1 place to eat and it's buffet, because the other one is a seating by reservation and is partially buffet. the food is the worst i have ever tasted and prior to our departure we were under the assumption that we could eat at the other riu restaurants, what they didn't tell us was that it would cost 40.00 extra a person. the 70's style foul smelling disco is also an extra charge. On the day we arrived one member of our party slipped on a wet floor,( and no she had not even had a drink yet) and her arm went through a glass table requiring over 30 stiches. the hotel put her in a cab with one way fare paid and she had to pay $600. at the hospital to be treated A positive is that the tour bus drivers were very nice and the beach is beautiful, but so are the beaches in Cancun, St Thomas, St Maarten, and they like us!
