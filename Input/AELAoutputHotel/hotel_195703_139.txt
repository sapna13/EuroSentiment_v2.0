{"text":"Like being at home While I was looking for a hotel to stay as a part of our honey moon in Florence I founded very good reviews in tripadvisor.com about hotel Casci, but what surprised me the most was the price everybody said they payed.At first I tough it was a part of a promotion or something like that because is hard to find a hotel that gives the kind of service it does for the price the charge.I found out in their webpage and confirm it was cheap.Then when we got to Florence in our honey moon we confirm it was very good to.The hotel has a very good location, you can walk to all the atractions in the city: You are 2 minutes away of the duomo.The hotel is served by the family of Paollo and Pierre Paolo and their mother. They are very kind people who make the impossible for make you happy.They made for us the reservations for going to the Ufizzi Galerry and for Academy Gallery, by the way, this last place is just one and a have block from the hotel.Breakfast was very good, with bread, jam, salame, jelly, fruit and very delicious capuccino made by the mother of Paollo.The room, number 2, was big, really really big, with air condition, and a bathroom that is good for people with disabilities. The room was very private and they gave as a bottle of champagne and a greetings card as a present for our wedding.I think they speak english, spanish and of course italian in the hotel, may be some other language.We payed 180 euros for 2 nights with breakfast included.
