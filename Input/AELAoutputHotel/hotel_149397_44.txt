{"text":"Ok, but wouldn't go back. My family and I (a party of 9) stayed at Bavaro from Aug. 10-13. Our vacation in D.R. was until the 17th; however we ended up transfering to another resort. Bavaro was ok. It happened to be that week they were sold out. It seemed over crowded. I felt like I was in Disney World because of how many people. The rooms were clean and very spacious, I have no complaints. The food was exceptional, I didn't expect anything less. However, dinners were hectic. Buffet dinning room always felt over crowded. We had to wait for plates a few times and it was hectic getting a waiter to serve you drinks. The lines for the food stands were also long. The only place with AC in the whole resort was the room. The trolly's to get from your room to the main dinning hall or main plaza were also hectic. At night, for the most part, we had to wait at least 15 minutes for one. Most drove by full and we had to wait for the next one. The main pool with the swim up bar wasn't too clean. Guests would leave their empty cups around the pool and I never saw staff cleaning the area until closing. And again the pools seemed crowded to me. The beach was beautiful, no complaints. By the 3rd night we asked to transfer to another resort, that compared to Bavaro was amazing. Much less crowded, new (just opened in January) and over all exceptional. Bavaro is beautiful due to it's landscaping, parrots, flamingos, birds, flowers etc... and the old Dominican country feel that it takes pride in. But if you're looking to feel relaxed, not to hustle and to be close to everything with just a short walk from your room; I don't suggest Bavaro. As hot as the weather is in D.R. you would think that an A.C. dinning room would be a must in such a large resort, but it's not. Oh, and one more thing, the theatre where you except to enjoy a nice show. You don't. It's located in the main plaza, no A.C. and it's open so while some are trying to enjoy the show, others are at the bar, and others walking to or from the buffet. In other words you barely get to enjoy the show. One more thing, if you have pre-teems or kids around the age of 8-11; it's not a very kid friendly resort. To sum it up, we were not going to leave our kids in what the called their Kids Club, a small fenced in area on the beach where the kids could play ping pong or basketball. And any kind of entertainment or night life (other then the casino which is outside the resort) shut down by 11pm. But if you decided to go, enjoy. But for the same amount of money you can stay at a few other locations.
