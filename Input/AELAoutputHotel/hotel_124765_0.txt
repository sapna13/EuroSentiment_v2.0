{"text":"Wonderful hotel, affordable and great location We booked our hotel stay for 4 nights about 2 months ahead and got a really good deal through Travelocity for about 88$ per night. The hotel is being renovated, so you cant really see the facade. But, as soon as you enter, its perfect. It's beautifully maintained(everything is brand new). We checked in late at night and the staff was very courteous and helpful. Room service is not 24 hours, that's the only thing you need to watch out for. We asked for and got a room on the 19th floor- away from all the street noise, and with a pretty good view. We had a glimpse of the bay even. The higher floors have even better view but they were still under renovation. The bathroom was clean and housekeeping was excellent. There isn't a business center, but they do have a computer attached to a printer just for printing your boarding passes and checking in online - that's good enough! It's right at the corner of Powell and Sutter - on the cable car line. Getting in at this stop is much better than walking down to union square where the lines are too long. There is a Starbucks right opposite the hotel. Walgreen and Loris diner are right across the street. Everything you could need is a block away at most. I repeat myself, but the location was perfect! Sorry, we forgot to take pics of the room. The bathroom toiletries were from bath and body works. The reception can provide maps and directions to most of the places you would want to visit. Chinatown is just 2 blocks away. Union square is about a block away. I would recommend not driving and parking in SF as the costs are high and public transport is readily available. Most places are a cab drive away at most. ","annotations":[]}
