{"text":"Perfect Location, great experience!!! We stayed in Residence Foch in July as a surprise Birthday getaway and what can I say - we simply had great experience and fantastic memories. It has been 7 years since I last visited Paris and to tell you the truth I had very mixed feelings when my husband told me that he had organized a week-end in Paris for my Birthday, I thought that I would much prefer a trip to Barcelona, but how wrong was I. We flew from Shannon to Paris with Ryanair and what was suppose to be 1h30min flight became 1h10min thanks to great flying conditions. From Beauvais airport there is a bus to Port Maillot and from there it is a very short walk to the Hotel. From the minute you step out from the bus and take first breath of Paris air you know that you are somewhere different and magical :)Although it was nearly 11pm by the time we made it to the hotel we were greated by a very nice receptionist, check in was very fast and smooth. We were given our key and shown to the elevator as our room was on the 4th floor. Hotel itself is very small, with narrow staircase and tiny elevator, but myself and 6'3 husband and suitcase didn't have any problem to fit in:) As my husband told me that he got exellent price from hotel's web site I didn't expect much from it, but I was wrong again:)Yes, room is on the small side but it has everything you need and bathroom is quiet big. In the room there are huge windows so you can open them in the morning and smell fresh bread and croissants:), there is flat screen TV, air conditioner and ironing board and what I liked the most - room has Paris character, you know straight away that this room could be only in Paris and nowhere else in the world. In the morning we had breakfast in the dinning room downstairs, it is continental but we definitely didn't leave the room hungry:) What I liked the most about this hotel - it's location, it is close enough to all tourist sites, only 2 min walk to the Arc de Triomphe, but far enough to be able to blend in with locals and it is located in a very quiet district as well. Also there are alot of great restaurants near by, the best we tried was a sea food restaurant (sorry can't remember the name) at the end of rue de Malakoff, 2 min walk from hotel towards Port Maillot with a great price of √à√\u2020√ü?7 for 5 course set menu (including oysters and foie-gras!!!) Staying in this hotel gave us such a great energy every morning and high spirit to go out and enjoy every minute of our trip and coming back in the evening felt like coming home:) It's been nearly 3 weeks since we came back but myself and my husband still raving about it and I am sure all our friends are tired to listen about it :) and we plan to come back in a very near future. When visiting Paris again we will only stay in this hotel, unless we won a lotto and could afford to stay in George V, I would love to try it out:) My only advise to anyone visiting Paris - take it easy, start your exploring of the city by just sitting outside one of numerous cafes with a cup of coffee or a beer, breathing Paris air and absorbing this fantastic atmosphere around you, watching people passing by and loving every minute that you spend in this fabulous city.
