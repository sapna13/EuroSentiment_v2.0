{"text":"Terrific Place Just got back from two weeks at the Laguna. Beautiful place, would highly recommend. My partner and I went + our good friend. We thought Bali was nice, but the hotel is what made it for us. Pools everywhere and landscaped such that something beautiful around every turn. Great beach and constant service everywhere inside and out. Restaurants are good. We were surprised not more people stay for dinner. The Indonesian restaurant has some terrific offerings and so does the seafood restaurant; some wow experiences, we thought. Bravo.Spa is beautiful and good. The three of us each went twice for several treatments each time. Can get cheaper and good elsewhere in Bali, but still good prices at the Spa compared with what we get in New York! The hotel has butler service, which amounts to quickly delivered complimentary coffee, tea, and extra pillows\/etc. Also a daily complimentary 3pm tea at the Indonesian restaurant which is just darn nice-- delicious little cakes and other tastes; feels like an intimate gathering, and had a bit of entertainment each time we went. Currency Exchange rates are decent at the Bank office at the hotel (i.e, NOT at the hotel itself, but rather at the Bank which has an office at the hotel). There and in most places in Bali, they give you a better rate in exchanging US$ if you have $100 bills, rather than $50s or $20s. Further, many places in Bali (though not the case with the Bank) will NOT accept $20s that are dated before 1997. Transport is cheap, whether taxi, or car w\/ driver. Easiest and cheap to have the Concierge call you a taxi for smaller trips. For our longer daytrip we arranged through the hotel and got a driver in a nice, air conditioned minivan for US$13\/hour, though we could have done for less if we booked outside the hotel.Various Advice\/Hints\/Notes: √à√\u2020√¶?Bring laptop because hotel has wireless in many places. √à√\u2020√¶?At low tide walk out and if you're lucky you'll see locals catching octopus! √à√\u2020√¶?Try the hotel restaurants, including when they set up a show and cordon off an area for a dinner; food is just very well done. √à√\u2020√¶?Don't drink the water anywhere in Bali, even to brush teeth; ask your butler for more free bottles of water! √à√\u2020√¶?Not a lot of kids at the hotel. √à√\u2020√¶?The rollaway bed for our friend was a very comfortable single bed. √à√\u2020√¶?There is a great little outdoor Jacuzzi\/plunge pool\/etc. area at the Spa that all guests can use even if not using the Spa, which is underused and terrific, including a foot therapy wading pool which I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ still trying to figure out how it works. √à√\u2020√¶?You can use Starwood points not just to pay the nightly rate, but for everything else at the hotel. √à√\u2020√¶?Most places in Bali charge an extra 21% on meals, etc., which covers both tax and gratuity, so usually no need to tip unless you want to. √à√\u2020√¶?Bring bug spray for evenings (otherwise can get bites on ankles). √à√\u2020√¶?Have a nightcap in the outdoor gazebos in front of the ocean at night; easy to find free ones in the evenings. √à√\u2020√¶?Around the corner from the Hotel is √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??he Bali Collection, which is a mall of decent shops and restaurants. √à√\u2020√¶?Highly recommend the cooking class at Bumbu Bali, especially the early AM visit to the markets, a cultural treat the way the guy does it. √à√\u2020√¶?We found Balinese wine (and thus, most house wines in Bali restaurants) to be extremely sweet, so beware! OK, back to work until the next vacation!Cheers,Fourdoor ","annotations":[{"endOffset":843,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":837},{"endOffset":848,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":845},{"endOffset":848,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":845},{"endOffset":907,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":904},{"endOffset":985,"mention":"cakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":980},{"endOffset":1694,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1690}]}
