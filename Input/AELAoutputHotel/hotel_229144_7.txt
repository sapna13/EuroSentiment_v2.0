{"text":"Throughly recommended My partner and I have just returned from a four night stay at the Hotel Jan Luyken. The hotel was excellent. The rooms are small but this is to be expected in a cramped city like Amsterdam. Having said that, the size of the room (303) was not a problem, the room was very clean, modern and had a great boutiquey feel. The location is ideal in my opinion, its far enough out of the main centre (Dam Square) so its quiet at night but close to the excellent Rijksmuseum. Take trams 2 or 5 from Central Station to get to the hotel. The same trams can be picked up from the end of the street and will get you to Dam square in under ten minutes. The hotel can provide you with a Stippenkart which gives you 7 trips on the tram (or bus) for 8 euros. Also, the hotel will lend you a bike should you need one. We used bikes for the last two days and wish we'd done it right from the beginning. Believe me, i'm not a cyclist but i really enjoyed cycling in the nearby Vondel Park and going to the street market (mon - Fri 9-5pm) on Albert Cruyp Stratt.Also, get your museum tickets from the hotel. They get an allocation delievered each morning - so get to reception early. You will not have to queue.Last tip, make sure you book tickets to Anne Frank House online. The queue was around the block on Wednesday and we strolled straight to the front!! ","annotations":[]}
