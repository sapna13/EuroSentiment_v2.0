{"text":"Best 1 star Ever! Was a little hesitant to book this hotel as it was only a one star, however am glad I did. Getting to the hotel from BCN airport was extremely easy as you take the AEROBUS to Pl. Catalunya (under 4 euros), where the hotel is only a short walk away. Check in was easy and we were up to our rooms. The hallways were completely shaddy. The room was a lot better; I was relieved when I saw the room to see it was not as bad as the hallway. Room was clean, the bathroom was in good working order, aircon worked great, and they give you a free bottle of sparkling wine. The view was hilarious√à√\u2020\u2022? you looked onto someone else√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ apartment, a little awkward to open the window and see some kid playing video games. We also found that long distance calls were extremely cheap. The breakfast was good√à√\u2020\u2022? for free√à√\u2020\u2022? it was served in the bar next door. Location was excellent you could walk to tons of places. Front desk was helpful with suggestion. We were leaving for the airport at 3 am and advised the front desk the night before√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√πere told to pay that night as the overnight staff did not know how to use visa, also asked if we could have snacks as we would not be able to have breakfast, which they gladly gave us. Next morning our cab was ready and we were on our way. Excellent location, Excellent value√à√\u2020\u2022? you forget about everything else. ","annotations":[]}
