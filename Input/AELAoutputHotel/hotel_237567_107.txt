{"text":"Great service, staff, location My wife and I stayed at Hotel Fita in Amsterdam on Sat-Sun, June 9-10  was very impressed by the hotel and its staff. Check-in and check-out were very easy and quick  the two staff members I dealt with went out of their way to make sure our stay was as comfortable as possible.The breakfast was great: eggs, bacon, cereal, orange juice, coffee, cheese, pastries, bread. The included laundry service and international phone calls are definitely a plus.Hotel Fita may look a bit outside the city if you're looking on a map of Amsterdam but it is only a 5-10 minute walk (completely safe) to the Leidsplein, where things go on all the time. Plus, both the Van Gogh Museum and Reijksmuseum and Vondelpark are probably a 2-5 minute walk from the hotel.One thing I wasn't aware of, though: there is no air conditioner in the room, but that's typical of European hotels and made no difference in our stay or comfort level. Also, the room we stayed in had a ceiling fan, which was nice. The bed and sheets were clean and comfortable. The bathroom was spotless and everything worked fine--plenty of hot water and in-room facilities. Hair dryer, wireless net access, etc. Nice flat screen TV as well.One thing to note, in the interest of full disclosure (I didn't see this mentioned in other reviews): there is a school or daycare on the same block and kids run around a lot during the day (we left on a Monday morning and this was the only day we saw\/heard this). Probably not an issue for tourists but if you planned to sleep late during your stay it might affect you. Just putting it out there...Take the Connexxion shuttle from Schipol -- we were dropped off second from the airport (maybe a 10-15 minute ride). The Hotel Fita staff gladly reserves your trip back in advance for you. No need for a cab.Another thing I didn't see mentioned is that there is a long street a block away from Hotel Fita that contains a lot of high-end shops, restaurants, cafes, etc. Plenty to see and do in the nice, secure, and quiet neighborhood around the hotel. This is definitely a plus, especially when you consider how crazy things get in the Leidsplein and Central Station areas in the evenings. it was nice to be in the craziness during the day and be a very short walk away to nearly total quiet at the Hotel Fita.I completely recommend Hotel Fita and would stay here again without hesitation.
