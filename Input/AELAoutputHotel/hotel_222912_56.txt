{"text":"Mixed feelings about the agora If we had not stayed with friends in this hotel - one of which lived in Paris for 18 months and told us that it is an above average hotel in Paris then I would probably rate this hotel at average. The room is small to say the least. It was hard to get 2 people and 2 suit cases in this tiny little room.The recent reviews on the church bell in the morning are also accurate however it only rang on 3 of the 5 mornings we were there so we must have been lucky because the mornings it did ring we were awake from 6am.As far as the facilities of the hotel - The room is so small that you an not get an ironing board in your room - You have to go to the laundry in the basement to iron your clothes which is a little odd and inconvenient.The bathroom is small but clean.The LOCATION is great - very close to 3 or 4 Metro stations, 5 mins walk from the Latin Quarter and Notre Dame. Cheese shops, Laundromat, wineshopes, supermarkets and Bakeries all very near by.In summary - if this room was any where but Paris I think you would pay a maximum of 75 Euros for the room and that would be fair, but Paris is an expensive city and if you want to stay there and not have to pay over 200 Euros a night, you have to make comprimises - I think you could do a lot worse than the Agora but go with realistic expectations and you will not be dissappointed ","annotations":[]}
