{"text":"# 1 Best Vacation Ever We stayed at Dreams Resort from May 5th - May 12th. This was honestly the best vacation I have ever experienced. First I just wanted to say hello to all the amazing couples we met Billy  Lauren from NJ, Mike  Melissa from GA, Shawn  Brittney from D.C., Matt  Katie from PA and the No. 1 person I fell in love with was Mamajuana form D.R. This was me and my wife's honeymoon shared together. We are both in are mid twenty's. To start off please DO NOT READ any bad reviews. This was seriously the best vacation I have ever experienced. We had a direct flight from Baltimore, MD to Punta Cana. When we arrived at the Airport as you will pay a $10 Customs fee. Customs and Immigrations were a breeze. After that you will experience the famous hour adventure from the airport to the resort. Just close your eyes, hold on tight and pray to make it there alive. Once we arrived at the resort we were in an all. This was the most beautiful place I have ever been to with the palm tress, flamingos, parrots, monkeys and etc. Check in took about a minute and are room was ready on arrival. We stayed in a deluxe room # 1305. We had fantastic view of the beach and the pool. The beach was awesome. Go right near the coral if you want to go snorkling. This is where I saw all the colorful tropical fish. We got all are drinks during the day at the pool bar. If there are alot of people trying to get served just walk right behind it and get a drink at that bar. I did tip a dollar after most of all my drinks but alot of people did not. We always got are chairs right by the pool bar. This is where all the games and activities take place. You will need to get up by at least by nine to reserve a chair. Also I would advise packing a water float and water shoes. We had ate at all the restaurants except for the French. All the food was EXCELLENT and Im a very picky eater. Also we ordered late room service almost every night. Get the delicious pizza's and nachos. Not everyone follows the dress code of Men needing to wear long pants and collared shirts. I did not see anyone turned away. We did go the the Disco almost every night after the shows at the theater and had the best times. Alot of drinking, dancing, and fun. The resort also has a game area that included pool tables, ping pong, fuse ball, a bar and even a mech. bull you can ride. As for shopping they do allow the vendors to come in the resort some nights. They can be a little pushy to look at what they have to sell. I advise to talk the price down as low as you can go. We took a 5 minute walk right out of the resort and did are shopping. This was the place to go to shop. All the vendors had different stores with all kind of gifts and souvenirs. The resort also had a nice gym and spa. The spa is the place to go. Me and my wife received a nice relaxing 25 minute message. Last but not least I want to thank all the workers. They are some of the most out going, nicest, wonderful people you will ever meet. Louis, 50, M.J. and Mickus you are the greatest.
