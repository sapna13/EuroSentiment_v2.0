{"text":"Location, location, location 10 years a go I stayed a week on my honeymoon on the Marriott Champs Elysses (a gift from my father in law) and promised my wife that one day I would take her back there . 10 years later, in a much better economic shape, we went back. I had accumulated Marriot Rewards Points and decided to use them in Paris to fulfill my promise. Being both the Rennaissance Paris Vendome and the Marriott Champs Elysses category 7 hotels (Marriott ratings) I decided on the Renaissance after reading reviews here and listening to friends that have stayed in both.I was shocked when I entered the hotel. This one does not have the glamour, luxury or size of the Marriott and thought I had made a huge mistake. But to tell you the truth, this hotel grew on me, and at the end of my stay I could say that I will definitevely go back to this one as oppose to the Marriott. The reason: LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. Probably the best location in Paris, near everything (we like walking as oppose to taking the Metro) as other comments mention. If you need the Metro is 2 blocks away. If you want to walk, this is near everything. Our room was very small (the size of a cruiseship room, but with a much better bathroom), but was cozy, modern and impecable. Great bed, great shampoo, lotion and soap (Bulgary), an electric towel warmer and super giant brand new towels, a LCD (Sony) TV hanged in the wall and sheets+conforter that you dont want to get out of bed (You have to though, you are in Paris). Personel is ok, nothing extraordinary but works ok. I used the swimming pool one day just for curiosity after a long day of walking (10 hours) and was pleasently surprised (a little cold though). It is small but very modern. Did not eat brakfast in the hotel. Who needs eggs, toast,etc, while there are great boulangeries and coffee everywhere? So this is my advice: Dont get turn down by your first impression of this small boutique type hotel. It has everything you need in a Perfect Location.
