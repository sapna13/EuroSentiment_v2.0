{"text":"Not a bad place at all! The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The hostel was really well located, a short walk to the red light district but far enough away to be out of the chaos and to feel a lot safer. It's on Groenburgwal which is not on Rembrandtplein but is quite nearby. We got a bit confused on the way there as there's another hostel called Rembrandt Square (Plein means square in Dutch). Groenburgwal is on a canal and is quite a pretty little street. The area is quite quiet at nighttime but there's no shortage of coffeeshops and the hostel has an all night bar if you need it. The room we had was very dark and the mirrors were tinted brown for some reason - if you wear make-up that might be a bit of an issue. The others in our group got a room on one of the higher floors and it was much airier and brighter but they did have to hike up a lot of stairs. The shower wasn't bad at all, good pressure and plenty of hot water. All in all I think we did pretty well with this place. If you are a very picky person this might not be the place for you, this place is not perfect - but you will pay a lot more to find somewhere that is. It was clean, safe and the beds were comfortable. Certainly not a luxurious place but for the price (in Amsterdam) I think we got a very good deal. Other places had so many horror stories I was quite worried about staying anywhere but I don't think you'll come to much harm staying here! Just a warning, be prepared for very steep stairs. I would definitely stay here again. ","annotations":[]}
