{"text":"Ritz - some good and some not so good stuff My husband and I just returned from Bali where we spent 6 nights at the RC at Jimbaran and then 6 nights at The Viceroy in Ubud (see separate review). The RC is quite nice - it has spectacular gounds and very nice pool areas (as per other reivews) as well as a private beach which is wonderful albiet down 184 steep stairs.The RC is however quite far from other hotels \/ towns - at least 20 minutes by taxi (taxis are cheap and plentiful but it can be a bit of a drag not to be able to walk anywhere). The restaurants are good (not great) and charge 5* prices (as do all other 5* hotels in Bali).After the first night in a standard room (which had partial ocean views and had been redecorated) we opted for a Club Room at $170 extra pn - it was an identical room with full ocean views but the Club extras simply were not worth the additional money.I had 3 spa treatments and they were top notch - again US$$ prices. My one gripe is that the famous hydroponic pools at the sps cost an additional $40 per person per 2 hour visit - quite OTT.The RC's top restaurant is Dava - located in the villa area - it has a spectacular setting and excellent (eclectic) food. As an aside we went to Ku De Ta one evening for dinner (in Seminyak) - and it's a great overall experience - try it !!
