{"text":"Great Location Friendly Service TERRIBLE COFFEE I had the pleasure of staying at the Mayfair at the end of a two week visit to Venice and Paris. I only spent one night but the most impressive aspect of the Mayfair is the Customer Service. Lori and the entire daytime staff treated me like an old friend. Lovely large bathroom with towel warmer and big deep bathtub. After 2 weeks of cold weather and dashing about it was a welcome relief to take a long leisurely bubble bath. There were nice bath products as well as a vanity area. The bed was a little hard but the room was spacious and lobby was charming. There is nothing that hasn't been said about the location. It's fabulous. And again the daytime staff was beyond reproach. Adorable Christmas Tree in the reception area. Very personalized services by day staff in every way. Even an umbrella stand full of nice large umbrellas available for guests. A really nice touch. The staff, particulary Lori, went out of their way. BUT:EXCEPTION: The late night auditor who was on duty the evening of December 30-very unpleasant and when I asked to purchase a 30 minute Internet Access Card he told me that all he had left were 1 hour cards. A ridiculous inconvenience and expense. I was the only one using the Business Center that night. In my opinion they should NEVER be conveniently OUT of 30 minute Access Cards.TERRIBLE COFFEE AT BREAKFAST: The most important part of my breakfast is always the coffe. The Mayfairs COFFEE IS TERRIBLE. UNDRINKABLE. I've had coffee and that is not coffee. It's a weak, dishwater messy concoction they CALL coffee. I had better coffee on the overnight Artesian Night Train from Venice. Since nobody could unintentionally make coffee that bad I came to the conclusion that the Mayfair must INTEND for it to be that bad so you don't want more. Truly terrible.MINI BAR: Prices for items in the mini bar were reasonable enough; however, there was no posting in the room OF those prices and there should be. I don't mind paying for these things when I am on vacation but what I do NOT like are surprises and the feeling that there is no full disclosure. Let's face it if you want\/need a Perrier at 1AM you're going to take it from the mini bar and I loved the selection and convenience. but what I do NOT like is the feeling that something re: the prices is not properly being disclosed.Thank you for reading my review.
