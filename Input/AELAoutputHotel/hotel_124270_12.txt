{"text":"It had goo points, it had bad ones. Stayed here with my husband over the Canada Day Long Weekend. We decieded to stay here due the low price and the proximity to South Center and Seattle. My Husband and I dont drive so we have to rely on the bus. the bus was very close to the hotel and it only took 1 bus and 10 min to get to both destinations. We usually stay by the airport and though we could have stayed at a better hotel down there we chose this one based on those two things. Now for the good things, besides the bus. We like that it was next to a Jack in the Box, the fridge and microwave were good to have. 12pm check out, nice shower and really good airconditoning.Bad, plastic on the matress, a broken coffee maker (which was replaced with a new one after only asking TWICE). A NON heated pool, which they said was heated and a brkoen hot tub which was neither hot nor were the jets working. The Hot water was good but the hot and cold taps being reversed in the show is not good. Lastly, staff that didn't seem to have a clue. I use the saftey dep boxes at the hotels I stay if they don't have an inroom safe and the hotel does advertise that they have them but when I went to inquire the lady at the desk didn't know what that was even though I could clearly see them from the desk and then on one of the nights (we stay 5 nights) I went to get something out of my box another staff person actually opened my box in front of me and started taking out my contents. I repermanded her IMMEDITALY to not touch my property. Would we stay here again? I don't know. We really did not spend to much time at the actual hotel as we were out every day and except for the bed, the room was good by our standards. Very clean but I don't like plastic on my matress and box spring. I personally did not eat the breakfast and we did not use the shuttle. I think staying by the airport has better hotels. We might but maybe only as a last resort if we can;t find anything better in our price range.
