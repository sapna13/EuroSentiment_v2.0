{"text":"Very Good Experience After reading reviews of this hotel I was skeptical, but it was not at all like any of the negative reviews. The hotel and grounds are beutiful. The place was empty so it felt like we had the place to ourselves. The pool is great, especially the swim up bar. If you are a beach person, forget it, this isn't the place for you. The food was better than expected from the reviews. I live in NY and am used to great restaurants, it isnt 5 star gourmet, but it is better than what people said here. We ate the hibachi one night which was very good. we ate on the other side of Nami the next night and the food was good, but the service was lacking. If you just relax and have some drinks its not a big deal, you are on vacation. The sushi was excellent, very fresh. And one of the more creative lobster dishes I have had. as for the italian and steakhouse I cant comment.The breakfast buffet was fine, typical breakfast buffet. and lunch by the pool was fine as well. not gourmet, btu if you are getting sandwiches or a salad what do yuo expect? Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. They all want to help even if they can't figure it out. It took us awhile to locate a bottle of sunscreen when the shop was sold out. (at a carribean resort, explain that?)The one thing that did ring true from other reviews was the musty smell in the room. I have had this at other carribean resorts and chalk it up to the temperature outside. After 5 minutes its a non issue.All in all, it was a great experience and would go back.
