{"text":"If I too, can live in a hotel. Wow. Let me begin by saying that I expected it to be good, but not as good as it turned out to be. I was so very, happily surprised.I booked a king waterview suite which acutally had a better view of the Bay Bridge and some water. Valet were professional and nice. Check in was quick, actually, we checked in at 7pm on a saturday night. Anna at front desk, was nice. Americano was happening with corporate types and hipsters.The room. Wow. I mentioned on online reservations it would be an anniversary weekend for my boyfriend and I. They placed rose petals in the shape of a heart on the bedand a complimentary bottle of champagne in an ice bucket with two champagne flutes on the table, a 'happy anniversary' card, and a cd playing electronica (the more relaxing kind) on the beautifully lit bedisde table. Didn't cost me extra. It was all complimentary. We loved it. What an awesome staff.We had dinner reservations at Foreign Cinema, so we asked if they could call us a taxi. Actually, there is a shuttle car on site. It cost us $20 excluding tip. Better to take a cab if you want to save some cash, or are not going on a date. But in our case, we were on a date so we went with the Lincoln shuttle car instead.When we came back from dinner, we were actually still quite hungry. (Though tasty, yes, Foreign Cinema serves small portions).So we went downstairs to Americano. Unfortuantely they stop serving food at 11pm. The barback, Louie is a really cool person. We took our drinks outside on a small table near the heating lamp and enjoyed the ambiance on Embarcadero and the water.After that, we returned to our room at about 1 am, still a little hungry. Apparently, guests were ordering Pizza as there was a pizza delivery man going back and fourth from floor to floor delivering food.We're glad we ordered from Cable Car Pizza. Pretty darn good food for delivering at 1am. Good tiramisu too.We drank champagne, even in our beautiful rainfall shower, lol.I don't find this negative, but you can hear people in the halls. Muffled though. I even heard a sneeze. I didn't care, but what if they heard us? Oh well. lol!The Sugar Fresh products are so good. Smells light and lemony.I love love love the pillows! I will be calling the hotel to see what kind they are so I can buy a few!In the morning, Discovery Channel was taping a bike race outside our window on Embarcadero. We watched most of it while getting ready for the day. People were crowded around, taking pictures of the bikers and getting autographs. A cool thing to see.It was check out time, unfortunately. Anna, at front desk, offered to hold my bags til I got back from shopping around the city, even though I was already checked out. I still was able to leave my car with valet til 5pm too, not a problem.I will definitely be back. Definitely! Great staff, chic, modern relaxing decor, great services, great view! Loved the place from start to finish.
