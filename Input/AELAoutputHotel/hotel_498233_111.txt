{"text":"Perfect! Well almost perfect I am in New Orleans to help build houses of Habitat for Humanity and this hotel was on their list. I checked Trip Adviser and it got a very good review. I TOTALLY AGREE! This is a wonderful place! There are some negatives, but they were totally out of the hotels control. But you do need to be aware of them.The rooms are small and the general manager sends a letter (e-mail) to customers explaining that the hotel is a historic site, so every room is a bit different. My room, while very small had a 20 foot high ceiling with exposed beams (very cool).The hotel is VERY clean, including the rooms\/ lobby\/ etc.Breakfast is free. No fruit, but you can get yogurt, breads, cereal, or make a waffle. The Coffee was HORRIBLE! NOW THE BAD. If you are unlucky enough to get a room in the back of the hotel, it is on an alley. The trash (or somebody.... Delivery?) comes at around 5 AM!!!!! If you are coming from the west coast you will be TOTALLY IRRITATED waking up so early.Like I said, out of the hotel's control. I am sure many hotels in the city have the same problem.Last time in New Orleans I stayed at the French Quarter Courtyard By Marriott. This hotel is MUCH nicer, Cleaner, rooms are better..... Etc, Etc.I would stay here in a heartbeat!TIP: Great sandwich place one block down Poydras St. called mothers. There is always a line of locals!
