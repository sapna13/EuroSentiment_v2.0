{"text":"THIS PLACE IS GREAT!!! My wife and I recently went to Punta Cana for our honeymoon. We wer originally scheduled to stay at Dreams, but since a road was flooded we were booked for one night at Iberostar Bavaro. The next day we went to Dreams and didn't like it. We paid some extra money to come back to Ibersotar Bavaro because we liked it so much!I'll try to be thorough so that this will be helpful for you - after all, if you are thinking about going to the Dominican, it is likely a big decision for you. To start with, the room was very nice, very clean, very comfortable and inviting. The staff: AWESOME! I would say that over 90% of the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The staff is a huge reason why we will return to this resort. As for the beach, it was beautiful! Soft, white sand with extremely pretty blue-green water and nice cabanas everywhere with some shade (in case you don't want to get burnt in the direct sunlight). Also, the pool is big and beautiful and has a very nice swim-up bar.The food choices were abundant and very good. It is impossible to go hungry at this resort. After a few days of overindulging in drinks and food, we finally 'toned it down' for fear of gaining a ton of weight! :) One of my concerns regarding the resort was the issue of restaurant reservations: I was concerned that we only got a few guaranteed reservations during the stay. Don't let that concern you. The main buffet that is almost always open has soooo much good food that it is not a concern. In fact, this buffet is just as good if not better than some of the restaurants. I would recommend the Japanese restaurant and the French restaurant. The French restaurant is very elegant and very romantic. Even if you have never tried French food, you should love this place. Most of the restaurants will also have a 3-person band sing to you and they're very charming.One of the nice things we liked at the resort was the entertainment. Every night around 9:30 p.m. there is a stage performance next to the main bar and it is usually quite entertaining. Our favorite performance was a Newlywed Game Show that was hysterical!One thing we liked about the resort was that it had a European influence. There were plenty of French, German, American and Latin citizens. For the most part, most of the people that stayed there appeared to be classy and polite. Most of the children we saw appeared to be well-mannered. We met alot of very nice people there who we will remain friends with once we return from vacation. Also, we had alot of fun beach volleyball games. One nice thing about this resort is that it is fairly close to the airport, so it doesn't take very long to get there.This place is a safe bet and everyone we met there was very happy to be there. I hope this proves helpful - this place is GREAT! :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":793,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":788},{"endOffset":846,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":842},{"endOffset":846,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":842},{"endOffset":999,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":995},{"endOffset":2447,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2443},{"endOffset":2580,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2576}]}
