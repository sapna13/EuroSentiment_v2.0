{"text":"AMAZING! We stayed here for a week, February 9th-16th. This resort is amazing! It is paradise!!!! It is huge, which we liked because we like to walk and the grounds where gorgeous and well maintained. They also have trolleys running all the time, so if you do not feel like walking you can jump on those. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and spotless. The service all around the resort was excellent and the workers where very helpful and friendly.The food was awesome. The Ala Carte Restaurants where wonderful. We did not have a bad meal. The beach is very nice and clean. And the ocean was gorgeous. We where always able to find chairs even if we did not get down there until noon. The pools are very nice as well, and chairs where a little harder to find there, but you just needed to get there earlier in the morning.There is so many things to do at this resort. Tennis, beach and pool volleyball, soccer, basketball, mini golf, massages on the beach or in the spa, horseshoes and boogie boarding. There is also banana boat rides and parasailing for a extra cost. The entertainment staff has activities going on all day. There are different animals that you can get your pictures with...monkey, parrots, lizard, etc. There is a shopping area at the front of the resort. It has shopping, karaoke bar, disco, and casino. The lobby bar definitely had the best drinks. And the atmosphere was very fun and relaxing.Make sure to email you room requests and Ala Carte restaurant requests before you go on your trip. They are very good at accommodating these requests. Also, we found tipping the bartenders and maids is a good idea. And they are hard workers...they deserve it!I would return to this resort again and again! Enjoy your trip!!!! ","annotations":[]}
