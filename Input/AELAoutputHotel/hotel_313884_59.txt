{"text":"a wonderful vacation My Husband and I stayed at the Princess from 6\/26 to 7\/3 for our 15th wedding anniv. We had a great time! The resort was beautiful, our room was great (building 5, close to the beach and pool). We received a very nice welcome when we arrived, loved the fruit punch! We were able to get into our room early and we felt the room was perfect! The beach is fabulous and the beach beds......so comfortable! The pool was clean and refreshing. It would have been nice if the pool was open at night though..it's still hot and a night swim would be nice. We met some wonderful people....hi, San Antonio, Georgia, Virginia and Liverpool, England!! The staff was wonderful, we have no complaints....the girls\/guys at the breakfast buffet, bartenders, animation team (Pablo, Luis, Celina...) were great!Our room was cleaned well, I liked that they knocked on our door around 6:00 pm each day to ask if we needed anything. We didn't get turn down service each night, but that's okay. The only (small) complaint I have is not enough bath towels. But if you could find a maid in the hall you could get more. The food was okay, not the best, not the worst. The best dinner we had was at the Shangay in the resort next door. It was definately my husband's favorite! The fondue restaurant was good, it's different......it's a long time in there. Fortunately, we did not get sick. We heard a lot of people talking about stomach problems. I actually gave Imodium out to people. Since we've been home our stomachs are a little off but nothing major. We did one excursion to Sanoa. Pedro from VIP travel couldn't have been nicer. He was very helpful, had a lot of information and booked our trip for us. Unfortunately it rained almost the whole trip! It was cold, wet and lots of mosquitos on Sanoa. If you go, bring your bug spray!! Miguel was our guide (from VIP travel) and he was very nice. He spoke very good English which was helpful when we had a sightseeing tour on the bus ride. We loved our vacation and we would definately go back to Punta Cana Princess!
