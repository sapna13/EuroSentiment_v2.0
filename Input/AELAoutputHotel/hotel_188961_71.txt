{"text":"Beautiful hotel We stayed in this hotel for one night in November and it was fantastic from the second we arrived. The hotel staff were excellent and made us feel welcome and relaxed throughout our stay. I have stayed in 5 star hotels before and have sometimes felt uncomfortable by the snobby attitudes of some of the hotel staff when they know that you have booked the hotel at a discounted rate and are not as wealthy as some of the other guests. That was far from the case in hotel 41. We were given complimentary champagne when we checked in and then taken to a beautiful room overlooking buckingham palace. The room was immaculate and had all mordern facitlites you would expect and more. The shower was incredible! Our breakfast was inluded and we were told we could have it in the room for no extra charge. We simply filled in our breakfast choices and hung it on the door before we went to bed with the time we wanted it to arrive. The next morning it was brought to the room exactly at the time we ordered - delicious! The location of the hotel is perfect, just a few minutes walk from victoria station and the underground. There are also lots of resturants surounding the hotel which offer lots of choice if you want to eat out.  I cannot praise this hotel enough it was well worth the money and was a treat for both of us. I would definately stay here again.
