{"text":"I'll be back! I use these reviews all the time, so here's mine! I stayed at the Argonaut for one night (10\/1) with a friend who had never been to San Francisco before. I read many reviews from many hotels, but for this trip the Argonaut was the right location at the right price. We had an early flight arrival (9:00am) to Oakland, so I had requested an early check-in. There was a room ready when we arrived, so they checked us in with no problem. We were on the second floor (#232) with a Park view and didn't notice thin walls or ceilings, but we may not have had anyone next to us. There was a Marathon going on the street in front of the hotel, so the valet actually went down the street to where I had to park and got the car. A word of caution - parking is $36 (in\/out included) +$5 parking tax per day. You don't really need a car to get around SF (its hard and expensive to park), but I find its cheaper to rent a cheap car than pay shuttles\/taxis to OAK airport. However don't park a the hotel - park a block away on Beach St. at Lahaina Gardens garage for $18\/day (no in\/out privileges). The hotel is squeaky clean, and I found everyone to bend over backwards to help with directions, etc. Jason (the Front Desk manager and Mark were very helpful). Remember, you have to request turn-down service and request a coffee-maker for your room, but they are both free. This hotel is in a great safe touristy location and its easy to get other places in the city via cablecar, bus, or taxi. Oh, and the nautical decor is tasteful - not Gilligan's Island! Have fun (and check out the sea lions on Pier 39)! ","annotations":[]}
