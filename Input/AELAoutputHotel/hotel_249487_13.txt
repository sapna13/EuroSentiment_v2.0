{"text":"I expected more I went to the hotel in the afternoon because my friend was having a wedding at the water club ( the top of the hotel) . I heard rave reviews of how modern it was and how it was a boutique hotel, but if you call the sound of water and a few blue neon lights in the hall way modern ,then this is practically it. It has a tremendous ocean view, but it's in the isla verde area where the tourist store area is like 4 to 5 miles down (pretty far). The bathrooms in the public area (second floor) were not clean enough, but the hotel staff took care of it quickly. There was a balcony area on that same floor that had tiles with oranges on them. It was a nice area for smokers but as soon as it started raining we were getting wet because the white canopy covering us was tattered and full of holes, which was odd considering how clean and well kept some of the other public areas were.The room was actually a suite on the 10th floor. I was waiting for something more like the rest of the hotel (the whole blue neon lights and waterlike fountains) but it was quite ordinary except for a few glass closets and bathroom areas. The decor was quite off beat which included a telescope (with no working eye piece) a bunch of random literature from the 1960's (themes that had nothing to do with each other) and a small complimentary basket of random stuff with a monkey toy which you had to pay for (mind you this is not a hotel for kids.) . The bedroom had a nice comfy huge bed but with an odd abstract painting of ( I think) a woman above the bed on the cieling that had nothing to do with the water motif. The balcony was also quite small (you could fit 4 people crunched) but had a good view to the beach.All in all it was a good stay, the staff was amazing but the amenities were poor and the rooms and hotel were a lot less glamorous than what was advertised for my money's worth.
