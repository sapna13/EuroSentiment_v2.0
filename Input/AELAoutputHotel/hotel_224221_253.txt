{"text":"Surely a hidden gem in New York City We stayed at the Library Hotel from 3 to 9 March 2007. I was attracted by the library concept around which the hotel is designed and, after reading numerous highly positive comments on this Web site, decided to book. We were not disappointed; in fact, staying at this hotel made a wonderful trip even more wonderful. The hotel is remarkably located a few steps away from the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue and from Grand Central Station, which means that you can access the subway in a matter of minutes. You are also just two minutes away from the New York Airport Service's departure stand. The hotel, which comprises only 60 rooms, is very intimate. The 14-story building measures about 16 feet in depth, which explains that no more than six rooms fit on each floor. The rooms, though simple, are functional and very well designed, with a superb bathroom (plush towels and bathrobes, powerful hairdryer, much shelf space to spread whatever liquids and powders you have); there is also turndown service every evening (with dark chocolates). Given the length of our stay, we chose to book a room with a Deluxe\/Queen bed. After seeing a neighboring smaller room in which the maid happened to be working, we concluded it was really worth paying more. In fact, with taxes, the room did cost $412 per night √à√\u2020\u2022?expensive, but this is New York.The hotel's real plus is the free offering of continental breakfast, free wine and cheese from 5.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m., and coffee, cookies, etc. round the clock. This enables you to save a lot on breakfast and, if you need to go to a show, concert, or opera, taking a good wine-and-cheese snack before going to the performance is fast and convenient; and if you feel like having a light snack with, say, a herbal tea after the performance, you just have to help yourself.In accordance with the design concept, each room is stocked with books on a given topic; should this topic not be to your liking, the lobby and the Reading Room (where you eat) have an extensive selection of books on several topics. Surely the Library Hotel must be one of New York City's hidden gems. You have that very pleasant feeling of staying in intimate and cozy surroundings, not in one of those gigantic hotels without personality. The only annoying feature was a vent in the bathroom that forced cool air (without any way to stop it), which is not really what you want when the temperature is as cold as it was during the first week of March (around 15-20 degrees Fahrenheit). Finally, I would add that, in a hotel of such quality, I wish that the form of address of some of the staff members were not Hi, folks! but something at least a little more formal.
