{"text":"Great price, okay experience I stayed at the Inn at Queen Anne for three nights in mid-January of 2007. The price was very good -- $79\/night -- and the room was fine. It was old and shabby, but clean and comfortable. Having a kitchenette with microwave, stove, sink and fridge was great, and the room had a surprisingly large walk-in closet. The service was friendly, but no one warned me that the desk staff leaves at 11:00 pm. Calls to the front desk after that hour are fielded by staff at another hotel, which can be problem -- for example, I needed to request an iron and ironing board for the next morning and wasn't able to get one because the guy at the other hotel couldn't get anyone at the Queen Anne to answer the phone. Also, the Inn at Queen Anne has no elevator, which wasn't a problem for me but could be a big problem for some.The other downside was the noise. This hotel seems to have no soundproofing at all between the rooms; on my first night I had to get out of bed at 2:30 AM and go ask my next-door neighbors (who had some kind of party going on) to please hold it down. And in the morning, the plumbing noise is deafening -- every morning I was awakened at about 6:00 pm by the showers in the rooms around me.However, the location is great; this hotel is just north of the Space Needle, and smack in the middle of what seems to be Seattle's bohemian-hip neighborhood. There's an excellent CD shop just around the corner, as well as several restaurants and a Safeway. So if you're a deep sleeper and don't need first-class accomodations, this hotel is a good bargain.
