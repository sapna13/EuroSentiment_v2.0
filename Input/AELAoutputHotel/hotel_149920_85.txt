{"text":"I hate germs and bad service.... Neither was a issue... I was a little hesitant about Priceline because whatever the reason I was unable to read the reviews for this hotel. However, I read the reviews on the hotel via trip advisor and they were average but this review will be the pure unadulterated truth. First of all I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ a germ phobic and simply must stay in a clean hotel. Ok we booked our trip and it was painless. We received an email staying that the snorkeling trip was cancelled due to weather. I became worried what√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ going on with weather. Long story short the weather forecast was thunderstorms daily (So I called the hotel and was advised that it had rained daily but for the moist part the weather was great so I trusted this and proceeded with our trip. We paid for prepayment parking in the Ontario Park and Fly (Do not do this Priceline may not be aware bust they are a rip off Priceline charges you per day and then they billed us per hour uurrgghh) So we fly in the Puerto Rico without incident again Priceline may not be aware of this but Budget is horrible rude rude when we arrived Angel was arguing with a customer on the phone and making faces to us that the person was rambling. We were not happy to have to deal with him after a 9-√à√¥√ú flight but what the heck the customer was probably rambling and Angel was probably unprofessional. Yes Angel was very unprofessional I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ an insurance agent and understand the additional insurance and their job to sell it. Angel seemed to take it personal I declined the coverage, which is weird, but something quickly I dismissed not to my knowledge he continued to discuss my decision with my husband after I walked away. We were not pleased. We go to the Marriott in out stained seat, smoke filled rental car. The hotel was stunning; the room was ready but had two beds? I was told Priceline requests the double beds to maintain a lower price and we can change rooms no charge (great) Stephanie was awesome she also hinted to us about possible upgrades (we upgraded to first class on the flight and it was so so so very sad. I was not worth a 1.00 but we gave them 300.00 for the seats. Anyway, our room was upgraded to 609 for 25.00 GET THIS ROOM! You have 1 King size bed, and two balconies I mean large balconies one is pool view the second is ocean it made the trip it really did. The gym was great I used it twice my husband daily, the restaurant with the buffet was our favorite we found a small mom and pops restaurant in Kauai (Eggberts) with the world best pancakes this place is number two, clean plates and silverware and great great food. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ afraid of buffets but enjoyed this one daily in 6 days for twp people we spent about 400.00 on three meals daily be prepared! The Hotel is the only one in the area not the El Condeor or the Ritz that is within walking distance of local stores and restaurant, star bucks is across the street J and the other hotels don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have shopping (Gucci, Louis Vutton, or just simply souvenirs and a beach none of them) Ok before I end TAKE the tour through the Rainforest via Priceline not the hotel it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ just like the real thing the tour guide was a proud man proud of his people√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ history and the beautiful island he was so great! He made us think made us laugh and allowed us to really experience Puerto Rico. We had lunch in some small family restaurant in the Rain forest the food wad great the show was awesome (you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l see the show when you go ps what do you think about the dog on the roof) Thank you Marriott San Juan Thank you Priceline. Budget please get it together! Oh yeah were 33 years old saved don't drink, smoke or gamable and had a blast oh sorry so much but go see the Old San Juan Fort.
