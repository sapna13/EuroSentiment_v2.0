{"text":"It's only been downhill to this point I virtually lived at this hotel throughout 2003 one week on one week off.The things I liked about the hotel as a facility are pretty much the same. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ small, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not a tour bus drop zone and very close to all the key elements of what people (visiting) like the about the city of Sydney.So what√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ happened since 2003 apart from a minor name change? What was a somewhat utilitarian feel has become cold, boring and devoid of any human warmth. From my memory of the Hotel the staff augmented its short falls, housekeeping was good and reception had friendly professional efficiency.I arrived for two nights stay in May, coming to reception at 1.30pm I was asked to wait, I sat in reception whilst they readied my room, at 3pm I approached the staff to find that the room had been completed 40 minutes earlier. Even though I was sitting 15 feet away, even my bags had been sent up, they did not inform me. Front desk staff was not exactly run off their feet in the time period so there was no excuse for the oversight. I maintain a personal view of the service industry within hotels in Sydney as being superficial, disingenuous, and almost pretentious. My recent experience in this hotel did not change my view. I walked up to the room passing a tray of food left outside the room next to mine. It was ready for pickup. On the tray was a half eaten pizza. The room itself I liked it appeared well presented and maintained this was in contrast to the corridor carpet, damaged decor and paint chipped door architraves.The room service I had later that night was on time and the quality was good. I left the room the next morning 8am, my room service food tray was still outside my door and I walked past the pizza tray still in situ from the previous afternoon Returning from work that day, about 5 pm I was surprised to see the familiar, now petrified pizza still sitting there. When I came back from dinner that night about 11pm it had finally been removed. On a bright note the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µump house√à√\u2020\u2022?bar and restaurant at the back of the facility remains as a significant jewel in the facilities crown however do not be surprised, as a paying guest you are shut out of the hotel facilities in favour of √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µrivate functions.√à√\u2020\u2022?\/p> ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1422,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1417},{"endOffset":1779,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1774},{"endOffset":1779,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1774},{"endOffset":1924,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1919},{"endOffset":1924,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1919},{"endOffset":1924,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1919},{"endOffset":1924,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1919},{"endOffset":2173,"mention":"crown","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Crown_Royal"],"startOffset":2168},{"endOffset":2173,"mention":"crown","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Crown_Royal"],"startOffset":2168},{"endOffset":2173,"mention":"crown","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Crown_Royal"],"startOffset":2168},{"endOffset":2173,"mention":"crown","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Crown_Royal"],"startOffset":2168},{"endOffset":2173,"mention":"crown","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Crown_Royal"],"startOffset":2168},{"endOffset":2173,"mention":"crown","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Crown_Royal"],"startOffset":2168},{"endOffset":2173,"mention":"crown","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Crown_Royal"],"startOffset":2168}]}
