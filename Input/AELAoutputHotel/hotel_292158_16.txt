{"text":"Great holiday We have just returned from 2 weeks at the Grand Palladium Punta Cana Resort and Spa. The hotel grounds and public areas were kept very clean and the gardens were amazing! the only thing that let the hotel down was our room! we paid to have a junior suite with a seaview but were put in a loft suite with no sea view advised reception we were in wrong room and the rude reception staff told us to pay $20 per person per night to get our seaview which we were not happy with. On arrival in our room the mini bar was empty, had no bath towels and tiles had fallen off the wall near our jaquzzi bath our bed sheets were stained and had holes in also the shower leaked also tv did not work very well and we experienced 3 power cuts each lasting around 10 mins there were no emergency lighting in the rooms or in the public areas so there was a complete blackout! also our hairdryer plug did not fit into the wall properly so experienced a few unsafe sparks! This was our only complaint with the hotel. The evening entertainment was the best i have ever since fantastic dance acts especially michael jackson you must see this show! the food was of a good standard we only ate in the buffet every night as there was always a good choice of food. They always had chips and a pizza\/pasta bar, salad bar and a good choice of good hot meats and deserts are amazing so be prepared to put on a pound or two! the buffet staff were sometimes plesant but did like to shout animal noises across the restaurant which we did not think was appropriate! i have been to 2 other caribbean islands and this has the best beach! there are so many excursions to choose from we did the buggy extreme. You can do anything from watersports to a monster truck safari, the beach always had security so we felt really safe and the only people on the beach othe that tourists were the excursion sellers they hardly approached us but when they did we politely said no and they left you alone. The mini train is great fun and a great way to get around the resort. So a great holiday overall the only thing that let it down was the room! and a few staff members mainly reception staff!
