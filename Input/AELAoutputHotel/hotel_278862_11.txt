{"text":"Bad...Real Bad Just like the other reviews; it was bad, real bad. The room was stuffy, and there was no thermostat. If you opened the window you had very loud noise from a late-nite bar located in the same block coming in along with the noise from the restless natives walking by. Since the pillows provided were completely flat, I asked for additional ones. After the second request I received the pillows, at the front desk door, and had to take them to my room myself. Oh, and those extra pillows? I am not making this up - had blood stains on them that obviously could not be washed out. Room service was, literally, non-existent. The bedding was never changed along with the trash can in the bathroom over the five nites I stayed there. I think this place is some kind of flop house for the low-income set. The walls and woodwork are dirty and battered, as if from forty to fifty years of abuse, and everything looked like it was painted by a crew of nine year olds. The hotel clerk greets you as he emerges through a filthy blanket hanging in a doorway leading from an equally filthy back room. There is no phone or clock in the room. Thats the bulk of the bad news. Heres a couple of positives: you get a televsion and internet access, hot water worked (thru ancient plumbing) and, with all the filth, I expected to see roaches or mice or the like, but saw none.
