{"text":"Fantastic Location Stayed at the Sofitel for six nights for our 25th Wedding Anniversary. From the moment we arrived at reception we were treated with the utmost courtesy. At reception we were congratulated on our anniversary (an e- mail had been sent when booking) and on arrival at our room (25th floor) we discovered a bottle of Champagne had beenleft for us along with a personal letter from the manager. Our room was actually a suite with its own living area and a wonderful view towards Times Square. Staff were very friendly and the Concierge was wonderful. He recommended excellent restaurants and even booked them for us. The location is excellent on 44th Street as you are between 5th and 6th Avenues so you are only 5 mins walk to Times Square and the same distance to the Rockefeller Centre. Sacks 5th Avenue is about ten minutes and is beside St. Patrick's Cathedral. Beside the hotel is a wonderful Greek restaurant called Kellari (not anywhere like the rubbish you find on Greek Package Holiday) and along the same street is a very good but reasonably priced Italian Restaurant called Osteria al Doge. Breakfast was not included in the room rate so we ate out. There is a diner called the Red Flame which was okay and always busy but try the Brooklyn Diner on 43rd Street. Breakfast may be twice the price but the food was beautiful and decor was very appealing too!On our first night we ate in the hotel's restaurant called Gaby. The food was very good but New York has some excellent restaurants so do try to get about. This was a perfect trip but if the hotel isn't up to scratch then the rest of the holiday is downhill. In this instance The Sofitel excelled themseves and I woulddefinitely stay here again. ","annotations":[]}
