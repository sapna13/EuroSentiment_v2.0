{"text":"An Unforgettable Place I had always wanted to spend Christmas in London. This year we decided to go ahead - however finding the perfect hotel proved to be something of a challenge. And, we admit that as jaded New Yorkers we can be a hard pair to please. We wanted something luxurious, yet friendly, with quality we could trust that wasn't a chain. In the end we decided to go with the Draycott. The room we stayed in, complete with antique furniture, warm lighting, comfortable bedding and romantic fireplace could not have been more inviting. We almost didn't want to leave!The tiniest details were thought of: our names on the door (one was incorrect at check-in, but by the time we returned from a quick errand it was fixed, without our mentioning it), the fireplace roaring when we stepped into our rooms, the efficient turn-down service, the Christmas Eve gift, the evening champagne, and nightly hot chocolate, the list continues. The concierge made thoughtful suggestions that perfectly suited our personalities and tastes for everything from lunch to a place to have a pint. The rest of the staff went beyond the call of duty by offering us tips, anticipating our needs, making friendly conversation, and leaving us alone when we wanted solitude.We have stayed in hotels of this caliber before, but never before have we felt so at home, and so sad to go. If you are planning to stay in London and want a warm, romatic and absolutely memorable hotel that will be as much a part of your travels as your sight-seeing, then you want to consider the Draycott.
