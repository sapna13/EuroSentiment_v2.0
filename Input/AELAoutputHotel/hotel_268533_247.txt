{"text":"The Argonaut Hotel My wife and I were at the Argonaut hotel from June 1st till June 8th. The room we had was very large (rm. 438) overlooking the park, and the cable car turnaround. The hotel is very well located if you are interested in Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel is very clean and the staff are all friendly and very helpful. The rates for the room are pretty high 239 per night with another charge per night of $33 for tax and whatever else. If you are planning on doing a lot of eating, bring a lot of money. I would recommend Scoma's Restaurant(if you don't mind waiting about 45 minutes for a table) And I would think at the prices they charge they could have a few chairs outside for the 30-40 people usually waiting. I would also recommend Lori's Diner in the Ghiradelli building. It has a beautiful view of the harbor. It has a continuous flow of oldies music, and an old time diner feel, and is reasonably priced. The last piece of advice I will give is VERY important: If you think you are going on a summer vacation to San Francisco, and go with only shorts and t-shirts (as I did), you better bring a lot of money for jackets, sweaters, long pants, and maybe even gloves. Because you will be buying them. Keep this in mind. A famous Mark Twain quote is The coldest winter I ever spent, was a summer in San Francisco ","annotations":[]}
