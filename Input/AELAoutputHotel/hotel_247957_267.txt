{"text":"A nice value! We stayed Jan 3-10, 2008. Overall, very satisfied with hotel, and thought it was a good value for the money. First off, Punta Cana's beaches are world class. White sand, palm trees, and clear blue water, with waves breaking all day long. Definitely, one of better beaches in the world. The weather great too (low 80's, sunny.)Airport surprisingly efficient, and ride to hotel very well organized. The hotel grounds were beautiful. 3 nice pools stretch in loops on interior part of hotel. The food on whole was very good. The kitchen staff makes some things very well (omelet, homemade donuts, fish etc.) And other things, not so good. Just take your time looking through buffet, and you'll find some good stuff. The wait staff and security are professional, efficient and very personable. We brought our three sons (including a 3 month old infant) and the staff fawned all over them the entire time. The Dominicans seem very family oriented and frankly, we felt more comfortable in the DR, then if we had gone to Florida like we have in past.Some of the not so great things. The hotel staff's english is not great. You may have to ask for things several times before you get it. The room was small. We have 3 kids, and were surprised when we opened door to our room and there was only 1 queen size bed. It took 3 hours and 4 phone calls to get a cot.PLEASE READ THIS: The timeshare people will harass you upon arrival. They can easily soak up 3-4 hours of your time. Since they don't make it clear to you when they are soliciting you, I will tell you what it is all about. They start by having plants around hotel practically attack guests to get them to commit to attending presentation. Once they get you to attend, another person comes in with a pitch of cutting out travel agent which will save you 40% on future trips. Okay, good so far. But then you learn you will have to pay $400 a year in maintenance fees. Hmmm, going downhill. Then after the 3rd hour, you learn that for the privilege of getting a good rate at 50 Occidental Hotels for 49 weeks a year, they want 20K of your money up front, and $4500 on the spot. I had no interest but didn't matter to them. Since they had wasted so much of my time and waited until last possible moment to reveal details, I asked them to put everything in writing. They flatly refused. They said they don't do this unless you plop down $4500 of your money on the spot. Wow, $4500 to get written details of an agreement? Disclaimer: I do not claim that this is exact deal you will get offered. My comments only based on my 1 experience. However, my guess is you will get similar package. So if this sounds like anything you might be interested in, go for it. If not, save yourself 3-5 hours on your vacation. When approached upon entering hotel, clearly say NO to anyone who wants to discuss anything like this. They purposely try to confuse you when you arrive by not making it clear on what they are doing. Now you know, just say NO!!! right off the bat and don't give an inch!So, wrapping up, the Dominican Republic is a wonderful, highly under-rated place. The beaches are beautiful, and the Occidental is a clean, safe resort with a wonderful wait and security staff. The hotel staff needs more training to make this a 4 star hotel though. The time share hard sell left bad taste in my mouth but I still recommend this resort without reserve. The Domican Republic is a bit more raw then other destinations in the Caribbean and not as polished. However, if you can live with this, get ready to experience the best beaches in the Caribbean at a great price!
