{"text":"Overall positive experience at Le Littre We enjoyed our one week stay at Le Littre. We did not experience the breakfast - simply because nether of us eats that much in the morning and it's expensive at 20 euros per person. There are lots of lovely little places nearby where coffee and croissants are just delicious. Our first room was not satisfactory - on the sixth floor, and while it was reasonably spacious and the bathroom was good it was disappointing for the price and we slept very poorly because of a loud and disturbing mechanical noise. As soon as we brought this to the attention of the staff they moved us to a much more acceptable room - also spacious, with very good facilites. The second room, unlike the first, was much more charming.The staff were attentive and considerate; the housekeeping service was very good; and the location was excellent. The Le Littre is close to the metro, restaurants, the open air market on Saturday, which should not be missed, and all of Paris is accessible from this hotel - we chose lots of walking, but equally, the Metro and bus services are great.One criticism - and it's not particularly serious is that the hotel's internet service can be spotty - so be aware. Having said that they were very helpful, to the ability they could be, in making sure we got access when we could. We also aren't sure if they take the postal service seriously - we paid them to send some cards and a letter for us - two weeks later they haven't arrived. That may be of course be postal service and not the hotel.Overall - we would recommend this hotel - but be clear to tell them what you want and what you need.
