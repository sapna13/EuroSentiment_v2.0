{"text":"Nice I have just returned from a 3 day trip to Berlin and a stay in the Park InnI arrived as part of a large group close to midnight yet check in was quick, efficient and accurate and I was in my room on the 16th floor in a matter of minutes. I am aware however that the coach that arrived at 2 found that although their rooms were pre paid (not just pre booked) ended up in a nearby 5 star hotel (at the Park Inns expense) because the Park Inn chose to overbook. Don't you just hate it when hotels do that?Anyway my room was very modern with a double bed (well 2 twins put together) and a small table by the window. Plenty of cupboard and hanging space and overall, a perfectly good room. As mentioned in other reviews the the glass walled shower does mean that you should only ever share one of these rooms if you are happy for the person you are sharing with seeing you naked in the shower.The room was served by wireless internet access for which there was a charge however as I use iPass I cannot tell you how much it would have cost but it did work fine.The mini bar was of the over flowing type by which I mean that there were other items such as bottles of water and crisps spread around the room which were all to be paid for if used. The cost of the minibar was not cheap although I don't think the words mini bar and cheap go together anywhere anyway.As the weather in Berlin was stunning this week (27 degrees) I spent some time up on the rooftop terrace on the 39th floor. It cost √à√\u2020√ü? to get in and did seem a bit makeshift but had a bar, music and deckchairs and the 2nd best view in Berlin (the first being the TV tower next door) so √à√\u2020√ü? was cheeky but a cost I was prepared to pay.Breakfast was however a joke.It is a large hotel and the breakfast area is large as well but there is no seating help so you just find yourself a table if you can. One morning, 2 of us spent the best part of 10 minutes walking around trying to find a table and some people were starting to argue about people taking their tables. This is plain daft and the hotel needs to do something about it.Transport from the hotel could not be better. It is right next the the station where you can get over ground trains, under ground trains, trams and busses. You can buy an all day ticket that covers the whole system for √à√\u2020√ü?.30 which offers fantastic value for money considering the trains were frequent and quick. I caught the over ground from the hotel to the ICC which is the other side of town and it took 25 minutes door to door. The same journey by taxi took 45 minutes.So overall a good hotel in a good location and I would be quite happy to stay their again if staying in Berlin.
