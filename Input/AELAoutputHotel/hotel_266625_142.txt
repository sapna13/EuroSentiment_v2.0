{"text":"Loved the Sirenis Cocotal From Joanne (Madame X). We (a party of 4 adults and 5 kids ranging from 10 -17)were at the Sirenis Cocotal Mar 28-April 4\/07. After reading many negative reviews on this site, I was very nicely surprised with this resort. I think the people who complained are just people who like to complain or else they're all a bunch of rich folks who were trying to save some money. Our room was nice, clean and decently deocorated. The grounds are well kept and clean. The food was fine. When you go to a place that has such a variety of food you are bound to have somethings that you don't like. Trust me, our kids don't like everything we put on the table! The pool and ocean are wonderful and the staff, happy and friendly. If you great them with a smile and Ola, you're sure to get one back. We are from Central Alberta and we've had snow and cold since October so I'm sure as heck not complaining when I come to a beautiful place like the Sirenis Cocotal. I don't spend a lot of time in my room or hanging around in a restuarant. I can do that at home. As for bugs, well I saw a couple but not nearly as many as I see here in the summer. You complainers out there, don't come to Canada in the summer!!!!My only complaint has absolutely nothing to do with the hotel. If you don't like Quebecors (and I hadn't really expericenced them til now) don't go to the Sirenis Cocotal as the place is crawling with them. I have never met such a rude bunch of people in my life. On my first day I was waiting to use the facilities in one of the the nice clean washrooms. There was one woman ahead of me. Another woman from Quebec (she told us where she was from) came into the john after me. When the next stall came available she just ducks ahead of me and goes in. She must have thought that I just liked to hang out there. There were many, many, many, times that we got butted in front of in line by a French speaking person. You have to stand on the person in front of you's head so they know you are in line I guess. They also do this with their children, so they make sure they go up with bad manners as well. Unbelievablely rude people. That aside, the resort is great for a decent price and I would recommend it. Beware of the Mamajuana!!!
