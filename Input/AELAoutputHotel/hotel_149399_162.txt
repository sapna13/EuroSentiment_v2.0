{"text":"OK-but Royal Service not worth it Overall the Melia is a beautiful hotel-the grounds and main areas are gorgeous. Lots of wildlife everywhere-peacocks, flamingos....The rooms, however, are outdated and need a major overall. The Royal service rooms are the same-need a major renovation....just so other guests are prepared..there are bugs...the couple we were travelling with had a very big cockroach in their room the first night...not good! We know this is normal in the Carribean but we have been to Cuba twice, Mexico once, and this is the first time we have seen a cockroach in the room. If you are not prepared for this..then be advised. The hotel is big and somewhat noisy. Even from your rooms, you can hear music playing. The hotel is essentially a family hotel, so if you do not have children, this can be very annoying. Even in the royal service area, there were lots of kids.The resort is big-not as big as some people were making it out to be on this site-the walk from the Royal suites to the beach was about 5 minutes max. The walk may be a problem for some-but the average person should have no complaints. We even saw a peacock and her babies one day. There are rides available for those who want it-we never had a problem.The beach was ok-Cuba beaches are better. Lots of seaweed (which didn't bother us but may bother others). There is not a lot of shade, even in the Royal Suites section on the beach. We went to the beach in the afternoon because that was the only time you were guaranteed shade. The royal service side has a bar right on the beach which was very nice...the other side does not have a beach bar (you have to walk to the pool area (which may be annoying for some).The vendors on the beach are an absolute pain and they are the #1 reason why we will never go back to the Dominican. They are annoying and demanding and a nuisance....they will walk beside you on the beach until you agree to go to their shop (at that moment) or you get rude and tell them to get lost. Further, the vendor prices are outrageous...so high that I cannot even understand the reasoning for this approach. Further, the prices are so inconsistent-the same necklace could be $12 dollars at one stand and $22 dollars at another stand 50 feet away...my advice, buy all souvenirs at the gift shop or the mall...cheaper prices and better quality. Unfortunately, there are no romantic walks on this beach. The beach next to the Melia and Paradisus is public and not clean-there is garbage everywhere (wear shoes).The food is very good in all the restaurants and the royal suites restaurant. That said, both my husband and I are suffering from a major stomach bug (unfortunately, to be expected, especially when the water is not safe to drink and you are eating at buffets). Though we didn't drink the water, you cannot always be sure with the food preparation.The service was good in the restaurants and bars-forget tipping because the service does not change--believe me a dollar goes nowhere at this resort-maybe $10 or $20 dollars. Apparently, this is the same everywhere in the DR. One of our Tour guides (Outback Safari) basically told us that a $1 tip goes nowhere because of the rate of inflation-we thought that was a bit rude.The maid service (even in the royal service) sucked, even when you tipped. If you managed to get service, it was minimal at best. The royal service guests are supposed to get turn down service-we got it twice without calling...the rest of the time we had to call and demand it...we were not pleased.Overall, if you are looking for the royal service or the extra service do not go to this hotel.....The Royal service is a waste of money. If you choose Royal Service demand that you are put in the Royal Suites area- we were put in Villa 44 which is technically the Caribe. The overflow of Royal Suites guests are put in there - there are no king beds, and you do not get the Royal Maid service at all-the four of us demanded that we be moved to the Royal Service area and we managed to get the rooms on the third day. This is not acceptable given the extra money you are paying. We have stayed at the Palladium in the Royal Section and the Sandals Cuba VIP and the service was much, much better. Don't waste your money in this hotel--it is not worth it!
