{"text":"shophouse room was lovely I don't usually write reviews of properties teeming with reviews, but after my first stay here, this hotel has jumped to #2 (tied with the Yokohama Grand InterContinental) of my all time favorites.This hotel was recommended by my husband; I've stayed in the Hilton, Sheraton, Swisshotel and numerous others in Singapore. What I liked about the IC (and particularly the shophouse room), was the feeling of something with a little bit of history, while not lacking in modernity. The lobby was a nice size - not overwhelming with high ceilings or overly crowded and busy. It felt welcoming. The shophouse room was comfortable with chairs, small table as well as desk and chair. The room is tastefully decorated according to the InterContinental standard. Flat screen TV makes the room feel airier. The bathroom amenities were nice; there is a bathtub and separate shower stall with glass door. Hot water was plentiful and the shower head worked great. Bathrobes are provided.The bed itself was very comfortable - not too hard and not too soft. The pillows were fluffy enough without giving me a neck ache. The only complaint is that the daily refreshing of the room was erratic. Upon arrival, fruit and mineral water were provided. The second day, nothing. But, provided again on the third and fourth day. Similar situation with the newspaper - first and second day, The Straits Times; third day, nothing, and I departed too early on the final day for paper delivery (they were just being delivered to the bellman as I was leaving).The odd thing about a wake up call is that you get one 5 minutes in advance from a machine; the second call (on time) is from a person.Bugis Junction is attached to the hotel. There is a largish Cold Storage supermarket (larger than some of the other locations in Singaporean malls); this one has a deli and hot foods to go. As Singapore is well connected by MRT throughout the shopping \/ hotel areas, this hotel is convenient to just about everything. Service is not as good as my #1 favorite, ICC BKK, but adequate. I didn't have time to check out the gym, as I took a couple of long walks to Chinatown to do some great shopping for souvenirs (probably a bit better than Orchard Road shopping due to the concentration and close proximity of all of the vendors).
