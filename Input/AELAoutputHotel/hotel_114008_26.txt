{"text":"What's not to Love? If you aren't blown away by this hotel then you really need to stay home because you won't be happy any where. This resort is exceptional in terms of rooms, service and ammenities and the extra touches. Yes it is expensive...very expensive in fact and yes the dining options are silly high priced, but if you go there knowing you will pay alot then you will not be disappointed in your stay. The meals themselves are very well prepared and presented so for the very high cost, you are getting quality delicious meals so if you paid the high price and received poor food and service, then it is a real problem. I recommend a trip to a grocery store to purchase snacks, breakfast items, etc. and keep the fridge stocked and then head into the city if you want to find something less expensive for dinner although Honolulu restaurants aren't much cheaper if you want a quality meal. The service was very good from all levels of the resort staff and the property is absolutely stunning! The dolphins add a wonderful touch for families to view even if you dont want to spend the money to do the actual encounter with them. The beach is beautiful and the Kahala area itself is a very upscale neighbourhood. The complimentary shuttle is a real bonus. No need to do a car rental as they are very dependable and always on time (make advance reservations to guarantee a seat). This way you dont have to worry about crazy Honolulu parking or having an extra dinner drink. The rooms are just beautiful, very simple and classy and spotless with HUGE beautiful bathrooms to enjoy. I can't think of a single reason not to stay here, the only down side was the high food costs but as long as you are prepared, there are alternatives. ","annotations":[]}
