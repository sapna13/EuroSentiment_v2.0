{"text":"Beautiful Resort - Loved It! Just returned yesterday (June 3rd). There were 11 people travelling (ages ranging from 3 years old to 56 years). We had a great time.The resort is very well maintained. You will always see someone cutting grass, trimming trees, power washing the sidewalks, etc.Our maid was excellent - if we needed something, we just asked and we had right away. Our rooms were cleaned every day around 10:00 am, clean sheets every day, towels, stocked mini-bar (tons of water, Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, 7up, Orange pop, beer), coffee, etc. We needed extra towels the first day and they sent us about 20 towels. The one thing that they do forget is face cloths but just ask, they do have. Our floor lamp was broken and the plug cover was coming out of the wall, the maids' supervisor saw this and had maintenance come right away (within 10 minutes) to fix because she said it was dangerous for the little one.We had no bugs in the rooms and no one in our travelling party got any type of bug bites at all.Food was very good - tons of selection at the buffets, same with the snack bars. We did the Gourmet a la carte (not the best, slow service and not very much food), the Seafood (way too much food as the starters are a buffet style and then you get your main course afterwards) and the Japanese (food was really good, tons of it and it is really different to have the chef cook right in front of you). There is a snack bar in the Pueblo Principe that is open from 10:00 pm to 7:00 am - they offer hamburgers, cheeseburgers, chicken burgers, tuna, chicken, ham and cheese sandwiches and nachos and cheese - not bad, especially if you want food late at night).Evening entertainment in the Theatre is more geared towards the kids which is fine (Lion King, Circus, etc). The entertainment in the Pueblo Principe wasn't all that great. Didn't go in the casino but went a couple of times to the Disco - wasn't bad - we made our own fun anyways so we didn't care. Evening drinks are best at the Lobby Bar - great service!Beach is fantastic - very clean, warm water, tons of chairs (never had to get up early to get chairs and we had 11 people). The main Beach Pool is a little too warm but clean and there are activities going on there during the day. Size of the resort is not as bad as people say. The trams run every 2 - 3 minutes (at least 3 running at the same time) but you can walk from the beach to the main lobby in about 10 minutes anyways. Very easy to find your way around just read the information that you are given and the large book in your room and you'll be fine.All in all - this was a fantastic resort and we can not wait to return at Christmas time.
