{"text":"One of the best! We had never stayed in a Silver Cloud hotel (it's a west coast chain) but liked what we saw online. Got a good rate and asked for a non-smoking room, the highest floor we could get. We only booked for one night, just to be on the safe side. We ended up getting the best room in the entire place (ask for Room 745). It was on the top floor, southwest corner and was a king suite, which means it had a separate room for the bed (love the cushy linens!). The living room area had a gas fireplace, a flat screen above it (there's one in the bedroom area too), a fold out loveseat, deak, mini-fridge, microwave, dishes, bar sink, French doors that open to a view of the harbor and even the Space Needle! There is no balcony, but a railing so even while you're standing in the room you feel like you're outside. Because we were on the end, we also had windows to the south in both the living area and the bedroom area. Two sinks, tub\/shower... On Tuesdays there is an appetizer\/wine\/beer reception from 5:30-6:30, and every day there is a nice Continental breakfast in a great 3rd floor room that has outside balcony seating. Plus, there is a pool, exercise room, business center, free internet, and a free shuttle that takes you to Peyton Square, the Space Needle, or Pikes Place Market. It leaves every 30 minutes and will pick you up to bring you back with just a phone call. Talk about service! We added an extra night to our stay and would have stayed more but we decided to head up to Canada. A gem. Oh. And ask for Christine at the desk.. She was fabulous.
