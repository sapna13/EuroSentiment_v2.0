{"text":"Loved the tub, but there are some quirks We were intrigued by the Japanese Hydrotherapy Suites, so we opted to spend a bit more to try it out. Since the tubs, when fully filled, weigh a lot, we expected to be on the ground floor and we were. The tub was FANTASTIC, as was the rain showerhead. BUT, the one downside was that the tub is basically right next to the bed. No biggie, just be prepared. We thought it would be in the separate bathroom area, but it wasn't. Also, for some reason, the bathroom wall (shower  toilet) didn't reach completely to the ceiling. Thus, every sound made in the bathroom could be heard in the room. It's not a big deal for couples I guess, but if you're bunking with a friend or family member, just be aware of that! Otherwise, the hotel was nice and clean, service was fine (although after the first night, the cleaning staff took the hotel-provided robes and didn't replace them, and didn't refill the in-room coffee supplies). The continental breakfast at the adjoining restaurant was initially a bonus for us, but it left much to be desired. It consisted of single-serve cereals, toast\/englishmuffin\/bagels (which you toasted yourself at the end of the buffet, often resulting in a long wait), oatmeal, hard-boiled eggs, a couple of fruit choices, Yoplait yogurt, juice and coffee. After day one, we opted for the Starbucks across the street. OH, one other quick note -- the hotel does have high-speed internet, but only if you have a wireless card. We thought they might have ethernet cables, but there was no option for that, so we had to upload our vacation photos on dial-up. Needless to say, we decided to wait until we got home, and just bought an extra media card for our camera instead!
