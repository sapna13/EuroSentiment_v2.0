{"text":"beautiful resort had lots of fun! foodThe food was alright. You've got to remember that it's buffets. A buffet is never great wherever you go, even in 5 star restaurants right here in canada or the states. There is a wide variety and themes every night (italian, american, gala etc...). We went to the gourmet restaurant (had filet mignon was excellent, do not order the souffl√ã√\u2022√ñ for dessert, it's a brownie. The other desserts are excellent though) ,the italian (was o.k.) and the japanese (was good except for the desserts-cupcakes with sauce or fried ice cream- fried in same oil as main courses), the decor is magnificient and the service impeccable. Don't be afraid to eat the food even if it's lukewarm (as is sometimes)you will not get sick. We didn't and ate everthing even the hot dogs on the beach. I saw them replace food with new batches so they follow guidelines.BUGSWelcome to paradise! During our whole trip saw 5 mosquitos (was bitten once-take your malaria tablets if your paranoid like me or have your kids take them), a few flies (amazing considering all the food that is served outdoors). Since it is very humid you will see a few millepedes on walkways and in your room- if you're on the first floor. Remember though you don't attain bug free paradise without lots of pesticide. Would not want to stay there too long.BEACHfabulous beach! The water is blue and the waves are not strong (if you like 'em like that) . For some unknown reason there is no seaweed if you swim on the bavaro side (where the volleyball net is). Lots of chairs and places in the shade. If you're concerned about boobs on the beach (for your kids), didn't see much ( ratio of 1 per 50). The interesting thing was that 9 out 10 going topless were over 50yrs old-go figure! SERVICENever seen better service in my life! Everyone is polite, smiling and will get you what you need in a flash. The maids and some of the people clearing dishes speak only spanish but if you ask them something they actually go get someone who speaks english.ENTERTAINMENTThe shows are alright. They dance really well! Contrary to everybody else didn't like the Michael Jackson show the best (no one can really compare to the original). The entertainment at the beach\/pool was fun. Warm up exercises, dance lessons, bingo, sexy guy competitions etc... . It's fun if you participate!DECOR AND CLEANLINESSThe resort is beautiful. The decor is fabulous. Decor is very important to me -don't like to see anything shabby, this place did not dissapoint. As for the cleanliness everything is spotless even the beach (they clean the glasses and cigarette butts off the beach- so if you smoke please feel sorry for the guy who cleans and put your butts in the garbage before you leave).DRINKSBest drinks are at the lobby bar. They serve you in real glasses(they serve plastic on the beach-for obvious reasons) and the drinks are not watered down (as is the case at the beach\/pool-again for obvious reasons). The wine is o.k. no different than the house wine you'd order over here.FUNFun is what you make of it. If you have a crappy vacation don't blame the resort. I had a fabulous time and the resort did it's part by meeting our expectations.
