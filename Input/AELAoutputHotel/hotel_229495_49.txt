{"text":"Everything you expect from a Marriott First of all let me say that I booked this hotel so I could use my Marriott rewards points and save on the exchange rate. We used the Connexxion airport shuttle that someone else referenced in another review. They were very helpful and efficient. Upon arrival, we were immediately asked if we wanted to upgrade to the club level. For 50 Euro per night I thought it was a little too expensive since you basically get continental breakfast and access to a computer. The room we received was very quiet and clean. We chose a courtyard view to stay away from the street. Rooms are small by US standards but ours was big enough to have one suitcase open and still walk around. Room service was spotty. Although they cleaned every day and changed the sheets when we asked, they left glasses unclean and mirrors not wiped down. We did dine at the Pizza hut restaurant. The food was much better than any US Pizza Hut I ever went to. However, the other room service wasn't very good. The food we received was far undercooked, even though we asked for well done. I had to ask to have it taken off the bill over the phone, as well as when I checked out. The location of this hotel is great. It's within easy walking distance of the museums, the Leidseplein, and a lot of shopping. And, the tram is super easy to catch across the street. My biggest complaint about this hotel is that you get nickel and dimed on everything. Internet is 20 Euro if you want to use it in your room. There's no free wifi and even the business center is expensive. The only inclusive is the free coffee in the lobby if you manage to make it down there before 10am. All in all, if I had the points, I'd stay here again. If I had to pay for it, I'd look elsewhere first. If you plan on booking, you should know that this is a very business centered hotel and you will be charged like a business person. It's safe and nice and will cost you ","annotations":[{"endOffset":360,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":356},{"endOffset":883,"mention":"Pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":878},{"endOffset":1607,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1601}]}
