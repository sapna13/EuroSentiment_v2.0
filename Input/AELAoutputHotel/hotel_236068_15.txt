{"text":"Adequate rooms, strange policies The Hotel Washington is located in a very nice part of Amsterdam, close to the Rijsmuseum and ConcertGebouw on a very peaceful side street. The rooms are comfortable, although the decor leans to dark colors. Everything was reasonably clean, and the breakfast was adequate. One note: the stairs are incredibly steep and there are lots of them.However, the management of this hotel seems to view customers as people to be policed rather than welcomed. There are signs all over the hotel about the policies on visitors to the rooms, check-in, check-out, the times the the rooms can be cleaned, no loud music, etc. All of this is fine, but the attitude of the staff seems to be that they are there to keep the guests in line, rather than create a friendly environment. For instance, I misplaced my room key (the usual plastic card type) and asked for a replacement. I was reprimanded and told that I would be charged 10 Euros for the new key and another ten if I needed another one. I was also told that it was against hotel policy for me to visit my traveling companions in their room (no visitors in rooms!) for a drink before dinner (they were staying in a suite; we are 66, 62, and 47 so it is not like we were planning to throw a giant party and ask people in off the street.) The friendliest creature there was the cat. I would stay there again because it is a good facility, but don't expect anything but hassles from the staff.
