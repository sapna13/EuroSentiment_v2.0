{"text":"Excellent Honeymoon!! My husband and spent our honeymoon last week at the Excellence in Punta Cana. We had a great time and would go back again. Here are some highlights and some things that I would have liked to have known before our stay (in no particular order) . . .1. Book your airport transfer before you go. We booked with Prieto Tours and were whisked away as soon as we got to the airport. We were given an overview the next morning by Johnny. He was great. He was available at the desk everyday during our stay and we asked him lots of questions. It gave us a great piece of mind.2. Have a lot of ones on you when you arrive. The hotel can give you change during your stay but we tipped a lot before we even got there. 3. Excellence was beautiful! Always clean and well cared for . . . BE CAREFUL of wet floors. I slipped and hurt my knee and everyone we talked to knew someone that slipped.4. It rained all week but we still had a great time!! We enjoyed eating, drinking and just playing games in the lobby (santo domingo plaza). If you see someone with a green shirt, you can ask them for a game. Curl up on a comfy couch and they will serve you drinks all day long!5. Get out early to reserve your favorite spot at the pool. People complain about this, but hey, if everyone is doing it . . . then do it too!! 6. The food is kinda weird. Some things are VERY good and some things are just missing. Dont expect too much from the seafood, especially the Caribbean lobster (it's not Maine!) We thought they did beef very well! Especially in Chez Isabelle (our favorite) . . . get the Chateau Briand - YUM!! We didnt care for the room service, but the hot dogs when you come out of the Disco are delicious! At least at 1:00 a.m. they were!7. Favorite people . . . everyone that works at Excellence is SO NICE!! We tipped all the time but they never make you feel like you need to. Our favorite server was Kelvin at Chez Isabelle. What a wonderful man. We wanted to bring him home with us! Our other favorite person was Franklin from the activities team. He sat with us and put up with my 100 questions about the Dominican culture. He is very smart and his English is advanced for only working there 10 months! We also had a blast with him at the Disco later that night. He danced with me and talked my husband into participating in the beer chugging contest (which he won). Ha. Also, our housekeeper Juanita (building 10) was so nice and friendly. I never met the minibar attendant, but we loved him too! 8. Excursions . . . we did the snorkeling (Caribbean Festival). Being from Florida, we thought it wasnt very good. Too crowded and not much to look at. The boat was fun. We did enjoy the 4-wheelers and swimming in the cave. Get your own. We thought it would be romantic to share a 4-wheeler but there is nothing romantic about what it does to your butt! I would do it again, but get my own! We cancelled our horse back riding - it was too much with the 4-wheeling. It takes along time to get out to the difference excursions. Johnny nicely refunded our money. We booked a massage instead. It was wonderful. The spa is beautiful. 9. Bugs . . . we had NO problems. No bites. Nothing. Maybe because we didnt go to the beach much - just the pool. Not sure but I was blown away to read about the mosquitos on here. Maybe we arent sweet enough?!10. Excellence Club . . . worth the upgrade!! Amazing food all day. We ate breakfast there everyday. And grabbed delicious happy hour treats for our room. They take care of anything and everything. It was nice to have the computer access and the bartender was great. I would definately reccomend it if you can afford to do it or it is something special, like a honeymoon! I think that's the hightlights. Overall, we thought the resort was beautiful. We had lots of rest and lots of fun!! We can't wait to go back and take all of our friends.
