{"text":"Large familky vacation 23 of our family members travelled to Melia Caribe, some stayed for 1 week Feb 7-14 and some stayed for 2 weeks Feb 7 - 21. We had an amazing vacation but for the sake of being brief, I won't repeat what has already been posted by the positive reviewers. Everything was absolutely wonderful! Our group included babies right up to elderly people and all generations in between. Not one person was sick or had a problem of any kind. We used most of the facilities including all the restaurants, kid's club, tennis, golf, bars, disco, karoke, etc and didn't have a single complaint. Golf can be prebooked on the Cocotal website for a fee of $25.00 and for our group this worked out perfectly. We all knew our tee times before we left home and they ranged between 7:00 and 8:00 AM everyday, money well spent. The course is beautiful and well run, make sure you take your coupon from the hotel guest services or they will charge you and then refund it when you bring the coupon back. If you are a single golfer, go hang around the golf carts at 7:00 AM and you're sure to be picked up by someone looking for a fourth as only foursomes can play. Be early! If you are taking the bus, allow for travel time, it's almost faster to walk. You can store your golf bag at the clubhouse for $5.00 for your entire stay.There are 2 identical sides to this hotel and when booking a large group be aware that you won't be able to book a family suite and an adult suite right next to each other. All the family suites, child care and kid friendly stuff is on the Tropical side and the pool is always full of kids. The adult Caribe side suites have sitting rooms, the Caribe pool is quiet and has no kids but can be very rowdy at the swim up bar. This pool is great for adults who want to swim and suntan without being bothered by other people's kids.I can also sympathize with the people from New York who had a bad experience as I believe we were there at the same time. The first week Feb 7-14 was absolutely amazing, we could go anywhere anytime and do what ever we wanted. There was no problem getting reservations for dinner, we even got in without reservations! There wasn't a lineup for the buffet, there were lots of chairs available at the pool and beach, you could walk on and play tennis anytime and have your pick of suites. The second week Feb 14-21 was a completely different story! It seemed like all the adults checked out and every adult who checked in had at least 5 kids! I think several school holidays coincided with this week, it was full to capacity and it was completely overrun with kids. I have stayed at at least 10 different all-inclusive resorts and I have never seen anything like it! It was more difficult to book reservations and they were very stict about their numbers, pool chairs were a bit more difficult to find but this was also because of greedy people putting towels on chairs that they never used. We already knew the system and worked around the kids, like staying at the pool later and eating later and avoiding lunch at the pool buffet to eat at the Marketplace (which was absolutely fabulous!)  Because the property is so large, you could spread out and not be bothered by other people. The beach is unbelievable and great for walking, the food was top notch and the people are friendly and helpful. It is definitely a European's destination and Russian, German, Austrian, British and Spanish were the largest groups. We had a great time and would return in a heartbeat!
