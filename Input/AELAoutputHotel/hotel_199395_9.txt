{"text":"Perfect location and service minded I stayed 4 nights in the hotel to attend a conference. The first thing which appealed to me is the very central location of the Palace Hotel...it is really in the hart of Berlin (next to the shopping street and next to the parks). This is a huge advantage when one is attending a conference.The hotel is not brand new or very design...but it is not outdated or looking old either. Just say it is not the hippest place in town.The service however is simply perfect; the staff does its best to make your stay an unforgettable event, all of them are so friendly, we really enjoyed this.What I really enjoyed is the breakfast buffet.....a large selection of fresh fruits is part of it...even buttermilk is available. They have different kinds of tea. I looked forward every morning for the breakfast experience in this hotel. (they have a choice of 5 free newspapers 3 German ones and 2 in English at your breakfast table). The SPA was also very nice, they have a finnish sauna next to the iglo room where you can cool down. The swimming pool was nice as well and there's enough space on the SPA terrace to relax and have a drink.They know how make you feel well. As usual in Northern Germany, you can go nude into the sauna and the adjecent public showers (but not at the swimming pool). The temperature of the sauna was √ã√ë√∏ point and the herbs they use gave a pleasant smell. The only minus is that you need to pay an additional 7√à√\u2020√ü?to use the sauna (but not the swimming pool, which is for free)Our room was perfectly cleaned up every day. They send in a controller to check the work of the cleaning staff. Again, the staff is very friendlyOur room was very large and spacious, I enjoyed it For me an internet connection is important. They offer wireless and LAN internet...the quality was broadband as well the price...I don't see why one has to pay 88√à√\u2020√ü?for a week., I don't need to put coins in the shower even to get it working :(I was very pleased with the overall and outstanding quality of this hotel.
