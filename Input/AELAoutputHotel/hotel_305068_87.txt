{"text":"Very Good We stayed here for 3 nights and we had a fantastic view over the water. Just couldnt stop looking at the view. One morning we opened the blind and a cruise ship was going past, felt like it was in the room. The view at night is very nice.We ate in the oriental resturant one evening this was very good.The breakfast was very good, so much to choose from, pastries, juices, cereals. fresh fruit, dumplins, hot food including bacon eggs ect. cheese breads and lots more.On our first day we went to Aberdeen and took a boat along the river to see the sandpanners very good. Then we went to The Peak one of highest parts of Hongkong a very good view of the city from here, we went down by the tram which was good. After this we went to Ocean Park to see the Giant Pandas. Its very hot here so drink lots of water and try and keep out of the sun.On the second day we went to Stanley Market, this was very good and worth going to lots of stores and some good things to buy if you look carefully.We also went along Nathan street lots of shops but you do get bothered a lot by people trying to get you to go into there shops which I didnt like very much but still worth haveing a look.Also went on the star ferry across the water which was ok.Really enjoyed Hongkong and would love to go again one day.
