{"text":"Nice stay at the Novotel Stayed for seven nights at the Novotel Century to attend a conference at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. The hotel is in great proximity to the centre with a covered walkway about 5-7 mins walk from the hotel. The hotel is located in downtown WanChai amongst what I'd call the bathroom and hardware district. This is a quiet part of town between the bustle of the hostess bars on Lockhart Road and the frenzy of Causeway Bay\/TImes Square.The MTR is less than 5mins walk away and trains arrive every 3-4mins til late. The Star Ferry Pier to Tsim Sha Tsui (Kowloon) is also 5mins away and only costs $2.20HK to catch acrossThe hotel itself is basic but freshly renovated with small comfortable rooms. Initially upgraded to the top\/executive floor we couldn't handle the smell of smoke despite being told the room had been treated. We moved back down to the 18th non-smoking floor where we now had a harbour view... not badThe room was cleaned spotless everyday, 2 complimentary water bottles were provided each day, LCD TV and safeMy only gripe with the room was its small size, the beds are quite firm, lack of ironing facilities and the ever present slight smell of cigarette smokeThe breakfast buffet was quite good and the concierge\/reception staff were always helpfulA taxi to the hotel from the airport costs around $350HKD, taxis and all transport are cheap to get around in hong kong, however u should get the staff to write dwon the hotel or other destination in cantonese for the driver because there english is fairly poorThere is also pool, gym and sauna facilities at the poolCompared with other hotels around this are the Novotel was excellent value for money costing $1100HKD\/night for a partial harbour view Overall a comfortable stay and I would definitely return ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0}]}
