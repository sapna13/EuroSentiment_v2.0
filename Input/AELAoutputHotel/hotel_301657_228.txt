{"text":"Great Deal Stayed at the Park Hotel Nov 21 to Nov 27, as indicated in previous reviews. Conceige was helpful. They gave maps of subways, directions and recommended routes with options. (we should have utilized them more.) Would I stay here again - Yes. And the lobby, yes is very quiet, dragging your stuff on the nice wooden floor is not adviseable. Not the hotel for your if you're looking for cultural ambience scene. And you want to smooze with the locals.Room size was was great - premium room with seating. (paid 3,000 yen for extra bed.) They converted the seating to a fold out bed. (for my 13 yr old dau and her 12 yr girlfriend.)Toiletries includes -shampoo, conditioner, body gel, soap, razors, bath salt, wash scrub, q-tips, makeup cloth and nail file, toothbrush and paste, body lotion and a hairbrush. They have a blow dryer, pajamas, terry cloth robes, slippers, tv, nice room lighting, radio, tv (and lan available.) Bed was comfy, no tower view, but thats ok. I was more pleased with the room size. I've stayed at Shinjiku Washington Hotel - now that is small.Didnt get the pillow fitter service as raved in other reviews.They have excellent complementary coffee and tea for your morning dose.We didnt eat at any of the hotel restaurants or used the other hotel services.Recommendations: Check your bearing. We probably should have checked out the Carretta Bulding - several reviews indicated that there are shops and restaurants on 1st and basement floor. Japan has great food. Wish we had more. I kinda feel like I didnt eat as much as I should have. I notice the Via La France (which isnt too bad of a walk about 5 minutes. Shibashi station is another 7 minutes from there. We took JR to Akihabara - and that was another 3 minute from there. (in route we found a great food store - grocery, bentos, fine candies, cakes, all kinds of food things you could picked up.) Fine Foods Fair (I think was the name) We even went back the morning of the day we left.In the same building as Via La France - 2nd floor they have around 12 restaurants all in a row. I was told by hotel that the restaurants areon the 41 and 42 floor of that building. Usually last order for restaurants are around 9:30 pm so had to eat at the English Pub twice - and do the prime-rib thing. Prices is not as cheap as you'd like it to be, but not bad.We found the am\/pm store and went there the first three nights - finally found the Family Mart store (yes, the Family Store is very close (just right out side the hotel.) Hotel has two elevators. If going the subway and trains easier to switch elevators on the 1st floor - security guard will help you. (they look stiff but very helpful. (the elevator is hidden behind a wall. (but thats your ticket to get below ground level.Did a walk to Ginza from the Park Hotel. With baby and stroller. A test of endurance to walk through the constructed overpass. I'm sure it would have been a better walk without the staired overpass.
