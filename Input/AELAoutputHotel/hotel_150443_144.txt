{"text":"Fantastic We have stayed in a number of hotels in the world and the Condado Plaza has the most unique rooms we have seen. Don't let the exterior of the hotel fool you. Guest check-in is on the second floor Mezzanine level and connects by overland bridge to the casino and rest of the hotel. Major renovations are still being done on the Mezzanine floor but there is a great Italian Restaurant on that level. We arrived late and they were happy to serve us at 12:00 midnight (It is open till 1:00 am on weekends although the guest services book says it closes at midnight.We had been upgraded by Mr. Neuman to an ocean view room and it was beautiful. The view to the ocean and to old San Juan from not only the balcony but also the windows on two sides of the room is spectacular. You can't beat the sound of the waves on the beach immediately underneath your room.The rooms themselves are brightly decorated in a contemporary style with a very comfortable pillow top king bed, an ultra modern L shaped couch, marble working table, and flat screen tv. The bathroom is huge with a completely glassed in shower and double sliding glass and wood doors.Contrary to what I had read in previous (all older) reviews, the staff we very professional and friendly. We would like to specifically thank Mr. Neuman for his speedy personal response to all the questions and concerns we had before booking. No canned response here like in many of the large chains (if you can even find someone to contact). He had advised us that the hotel had undertaken major initiates in staff training and it shows.We can hardly wait until the renovations are totally finished so we can return to this beautiful property.
