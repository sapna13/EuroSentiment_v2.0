{"text":"Liked to leave the hotel When making the reservation I thought it's good to take a hotel directly at the Rampla - but it's not! The Rampla is full of tourists, homeless and by far not clean. So the location of the hotel already has been the first problem. Better to stay at a relaxed and green area of the city and take a taxi down-town if you want to go there.As a Platinum SPG member at first we got one of the quite small standard but renovated rooms. They try to make it design but with grey\/brown\/red they got it quite 80's style... red leather armchair...After I complained about the room and pointed to my Platinum status they gave us a quite shabby unrenovated suite (also withou any view) on 6th floor. The most amazing point of the room was that there's a window from the hall to the bathrrom where you can directly look to the toilet. Whos idea was that??? Imagine the maid comes in...Another problem of the hotel is the internet connection. In the room it's √à√\u2020√ü?20,00 plus tax (I really ask myself for what some hotels still charge money for internet access). In the business center it's free - but the computers are often occupied by children. WiFi exists at the lobby and at the business center, that's it - and it costs √à√\u2020√ü?20,00. Thanks a lot!Another issue is breakfast. While staying at Sheraton (and some Westin) for SPG platinum members breakfast (or lounge access) is included at the Le Meridien it's not. I really don't understand why SPG can't unify their goodies for all Starwood hotels.Well, we reduced our stay from 2 nights to 1 night only and were really happy to leave. ","annotations":[]}
