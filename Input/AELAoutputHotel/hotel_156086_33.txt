{"text":"A Great Choice We had a great stay at the Camino Real earlier this month. We were there 4 nights and stayed on the Club level. Each room cost us $170 dollars (a weekend rate, I think). There was plenty of vacancy, so you might try the internet for a better rate or negotiate to get one. We would have done so had we known how (relatively) empty the hotel was (probably not more than 50-60% full). We were glad to have stayed on the Club level. The hotel, as noted by others below, is beautiful and very comfortable. The architecture is great, the public areas clean and elegant, the restaurants excellent (we ate at the Italian one the first night to avoid having to go out and the food was excellent but perhaps a bit pricey), the rooms spacious and nicely designed. Room service was prompt and good, and housekeeping was very responsive. With three kids, safety was important, and we felt very safe in the hotel and allowed our kids to roam around as necessary. A nice and perfectly adequate breakfast was served each morning on the Club level with meats, cheeses, cereals, breads, fruit, yogurt, etc. It was a nice way to start the day.We were a family of 5 and needed two rooms. As it turned out, while there are connecting rooms on the Club level and elsewhere, we should have spoken directly to the Club level to ensure that our rooms were connecting. Our kids are old enough so that it was not a problem, but it was an annoyance that the left hand did not know what the right was doing (or capable of doing). One negative regarding the hotel is perhaps the location during this protest season. We pretty much felt as if we needed to take a cab or car everywhere. In that sense, it is not as nicely situated as Polanco (some say the hotel is in Polanco, but if it is it is at an extreme border). Regardless, that negative was not great and we would certainly stay at this hotel again and not hessitate to recommend it to others. Finally, we too tried El Fogoncito (behind the hotel). We enjoyed the tacos, quesadillas and beer. Good value, clean, and fun. Thanks to those that suggested that we try it.Our trip report can be found at: http:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/ShowTopic-g150800-i164-k750296-Trip_Report_August_4_7-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html ","annotations":[{"endOffset":119,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":115},{"endOffset":436,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":432},{"endOffset":970,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":966},{"endOffset":970,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":966},{"endOffset":1039,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1035},{"endOffset":1082,"mention":"breads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1076},{"endOffset":1097,"mention":"yogurt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Yogurt"],"startOffset":1091},{"endOffset":1117,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1113},{"endOffset":1117,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1113},{"endOffset":1245,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1241},{"endOffset":1245,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1241},{"endOffset":1245,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1241},{"endOffset":1309,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1305},{"endOffset":1309,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1305},{"endOffset":1309,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1305},{"endOffset":2010,"mention":"tacos","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Taco"],"startOffset":2005},{"endOffset":2023,"mention":"quesadillas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Quesadilla"],"startOffset":2012}]}
