{"text":"mui bien Just returned from a one week stay (July 5 - 12). This was our (wife and 8 yr. old daughter) first experience with the DR. I guess it is all about expectations.....we booked last minute and got a great deal. The only negative about the whole trip was our Canjet flight. Talk about low \/ no frills!!!! Even the crew was not up to par. I thought maritimers were friendly.Anyhow, back to the Catalonia. Arrived rather late due to MTL. airport baggage problems. After a nice air conditionned 15 minute bus ride to the resort, we checked in rather quickly and got a ride to our room in Villa 9 (half way between the beach and the restaurants \/ lobby). Unfortunatelly, all the restaurants were closed so we had to settle for some ice cream. I found out that evening that although I spoke 3 languages fluently, I regretted not taking spanish courses in school. Languages spoken by staff varied but the order is 1- spanish 2- french 3 - english 4 - italian.Like in every other establishment, you can tell pretty quickly what staff was genuinelly happy to be serving the guests and who was there for the tips. The tone was set pretty early as our bus guide literally asked for us to tip the bus driver after his 5 minute spiel telling us in a nutshell not to drink the tap water. We pretty much tipped everybody from the maid to the restaurant staff (including buffet). These folks barely make enough to get by so in their defense they need the tip. When I checked out I asked the clerk for some change for a $5 (by the way US currency is fine....forget about Canadian) so that i could tip the baggage handlers etc. He actually had the balls to ask me if it was for him and that he only made $200 a month and the baggage handlers made more than he did. I told him that we North Americans tip because of the service we receive, not because he thought he was underpaid. My wife was a little more direct and told him to change job. I just spent a whole paragraph on tipping.....The food: a la cartes were pretty good. My favourites were:1) Italian2) Mexican3) Japanese4) SteakhouseWe only had supper at the buffets twice since we ate at the beach barbecue one evening. Most of our luches were at the swimming pool snack bar. Great pizza nd rotisserie chicken. Also had hot dogs \/ hamburgers \/ nachos available.Ate most of our breakfast buffets at the smaller restaurant between the pool and the beach. Selection slightly smaller but the view more than made up for it. Nothing like starting your day with a nice omellette a little coffee while looking at the ocean. Beach bar attendant Martin was always smiling and seemed genuinely happy to be mixing drinks...thankfully the alcohol is watered down or some people would not make it past noon.Although the shows are not broadway quality, the costumes and choreography alone were well worth it. A quick word about the entertainment staff. I have never seen harder working people. These young folks are on the beach at 10:00 and in the disco til 2:00. They are always smiling and in a good mood. Special hello to Angelis. Also a special mention to the pool waiters who run around all day in long black pants (for some reason).Pool and beach were wonderful. The room was fine but honestly we spent very little time there other than to sleep. They had a Domenican night where locals came in to sell their wares. Why I am not sure especially since most if not all of the stuff is fake. I am a big cigar afficionado and was smoking while walking around. Everyone selling jewelry and trinkets came up to me. Nobody selling cigars came within 20 ft. of me.
