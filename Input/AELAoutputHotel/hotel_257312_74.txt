{"text":"Extra care and attention We stayed at Simpsons of Potts Point in April. It was the end of a trip to New Zealand for me and my mom, and a short two night stay in Sydney. We were so glad to be at Simpsons. Jackie and Keith were attentive hosts along with the rest of the staff. We stayed at some wonderful places in New Zealand, and Simpsons topped off our trip with a wonderful lasting memory. I still wish I could wake up and go down to the conservatory for the yummy breakfast. The YOGURT! Yum! We were given complimentary passes to a nearby gym (yoga classes etc. if you have time) but unfortunately didn't have time. Keith sketched out the perfect day for us as we had one full day in Sydney. We walked all over (through the Royal Botanic Gardens) --took the ferry to Manley and Shelley Beach, dined, swam, went to the ballet at the Opera House that night and had a full beautiful day. Keith also arranged our taxi for the morning back to the airport. And Jackie and whoever was on staff to cook in the morning allowed us to come down to breakfast early so we could catch our taxi. The nicest staff!! The sitting area is a great place to go read or use the computer (complimentary) or have a glass of port or sherry (complimentary) or borrow a book to read. Our room was a bit musty, but we aired it out and used our wonderful lavendar oils in the bathroom. It is an old house full of charm. Our room wasn't the fanciest (don't remember the name or number--it was very yellow inside and on the second landing level) but the hotel was wonderful over all. We needed two beds. The birds in Sydney are incredible and they serenaded us in the morning. It was a bit of luxury that wasn't horribly overpriced in an expensive city. I will go back if I am ever able!!
