{"text":"Just Back from Amsterdam Marriott My husband and I have just returned from our 8 night stay at the Marriott Hotel in Amsterdam. Our flight from the USA arrrived into AMS at 6:30AM and after quickly going through customs and avoiding baggage claim since we do carry-on whenever possible, we headed downstairs and took the train to Central Station and then the #2 tram which lets you off a short walk from the hotel. (You can take the 1, 2 or 5 tram to the hotel from the Central Station) All in all an effortless trip and very inexpensive (approximately $8 per person).Upon our arrival at the hotel we were told our room was not ready, which we had expected since it was 8:00 in the morning. We were directed to the 9th floor Executive Lounge since my husband is a Platinum Marriott member. What a great perk to have use of this lounge..........a great breakfast every morning, afternoon snacks and cocktails and evening coffee, tea and deserts. Also, located in the lounge are 2 computers with high speed internet connections available for use at no charge (in room internet costs 20 Euro per day).The hotel is very well run. The staff is very polite and everyone that we encountered spoke excellent English. The newly renovated rooms are excellent, large enough, and the bathrooms well appointed and very modern with brand new fixtures. The location of the hotel is excellent due to the close proximity and an easy walk to the major museums, abundant shopping areas and varied restaurant choices. We had a rental car for 3 days and utilized the hotel parking, no problem, although at 30 Euros per day a bit expensive.As far as the hotel, I can say not a negative word about the facility or the staff. As previous reviews have mentioned, the outside appearance of the hotel might lead one to have less than great expectations. But once inside everything is terrific! We would not hesitate to stay here again while in Amsterdam.
