{"text":"Service with a smile! Recently stayed for 3 nights at Elan and felt like we were leaving friends when we left. Staff was kind, helpful, and gracious. Agree with previous posters in that looking out across to Taco Bell or Goodwill was not thrilling while sipping our free wine or eating the above average continental breakfast -(Thrilled to have a hard boiled egg, granola choices, fresh fruit, yogurt, bagels, good pastries,etc. to choose from that kept us filled until lunch.) Negatives- The room was small, had an overpriced honor bar,(which was kindly removed when asked so we wouldn't be tempted,) no microwave,nor vent in the bathroom,the walls are not soundproofed so we did hear neighbors showering and muffled conversation in the morning, and the cost for valet parking was $19.50 a night! But being on a tight budget and hating to pay for parking, I parked on the side street (Croft) each night when we returned from our siteseeing, put a few quarters in the meter, then parking was free until 8 am when I put a few more in until we headed out for the day. The valet was so friendly we chatted every day and I apologized for not using his services. He was nice enough that he actually looked out for my car and checked the meter to make sure I was on top of it. Loved walking down Croft and other residental streets in the neighborhood to enjoy the Spanish architecture. Cheap eats  fun shopping at the Beverly Center 1 block away. Location was central to all we did and comfortable to return to.. Would definitely stay here again.
