{"text":"3 Stars Hotel Not A 5 Stars As Riu Claims Where to start√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>What a dump..Seriously this hotel needs some serious renovation..It all started on the day of our arrival at the hotel, came in around 11:30pm checked into our room and 2 minutes after checked out..because of the bad smell. They found us another room that one too smelled..they had no more rooms left..so what do you think they did√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√∂hey told us we had to wait to talk to the manager in the morning, because they can't make any decision without the manager being present..so where are we suppose to sleep?? No way I was going to go back into that room..so we slept on the couch at the reception area..it didn't seem to bother them at all√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√ßreat customer service. The next day came, they actually found us a clean room with clean sheets and no smell√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√∂hank you very much. I would seriously knock out a couple of stars of this hotel rating. Riu's claims it's a 5 stars hotel, Sunquest who we booked with claimed it was a 5 stars then when that room incident happened we complained to the Sunquest representative at the hotel and he said that sunquest has never advertise that this hotel was a 5 stars, when they did, false advertisement and I would rate this hotel as a 3 stars not more not less. Then later on find out that they overbooked the hotel, they had to upgrade guest to other Riu's some got lucky and stayed at the Palace..for the same price as Taino. I find that funny how when we were sleeping on the couch at the reception no rooms in all of those 5 hotels were available..!! Now that they overbooked this hotel they can actually found space to accommodate those people UNBELIEVABLE. Food was ok, restaurant a la carte big disappointment, I actually didn't gain any weight..??? Then again I ate fries for 7 days..(good fries)Positive aspect of this hotel..All 5 Riu's are right next to each other, depending on what hotel you are staying at, you have access and what I mean by access is (Bars, pools, hotel, restaurants) we stayed at Taino so we had access to Bambu and Naiboa, if your staying at Riu Macao you have access to Bambu,Taino and Naiboa and if you're lucky enough to stay at the Riu palace Punta Cana..you have unlimited access to all Riu hotels.If I had to pick between all 5 Riu's I will pick Taino (for sure not for the accommodation and the great landscape)..it's more of a younger croud..it seems the guest at the other Riu's always made there way to our hotel..the beach is always crowed (good luck finding a lounge chair)..our pools full, the bars are always busy, loud music..if you walked to the other hotel no one's there.. (people that go on vacation to read stay's there ( Macao and Palace)..if you are on vacation to party and have fun ..then Taino it is.I also enjoy the Caribbean Street where you can find various stores, they also have a Casino and a dance club called PACHA on location, Hair Salon, Spa, cigar shop and a flea market close by about 10 minutes walk.Closing remarksEven though the hotel was not what we expected..the staff did make it up to us, got 2 bottles of rum in front of our door the next morning, got treated to Palace Punta Cana for dinner, unlimited a la carte restaurant, they honestly did go out of their way to make us happy.
