{"text":"get the Firenze feeling many people I've met were slightly dissapointed about Firenze, as the city doesn't have the romantic flair you might expect, althougth it has beauty in abundance, way more then any other city. In most cases it's hidden behind a facade. It's a brilliant place, and i can higly recommend it, but if there's anything that does indeed live up to the expectations of a renaissance place, it's this orto de medici. It's a great location for whoever seeks to visit the city's nucleus. I would recommend a taxi from the staion to the hotel (+\/- 11 √à√\u2020√ü? unless you don't mind towing your luguage through a less appealing neighbourhood for about 15 minutes.The hotel is charming, well maintained, nice atmosphere, and a helpful and friendly staff (though you might see several different faces at the reception in one day...) The rooms are nicely decorated, there's a good and clean bathroom, and the breakfast is far above Italian average (but still below Brittish and German), with a buffet and served in both a breakfast salon and a little terrace. If there's rumour in the hotel, it's not coming from the street outside, but from other high heeled guests, and from from the old style doors, which look very nice, but can by no means be shut quietly.Over all, a highly recommended place for travellers seeking to visit the art treasures of Firenze, and who don't need marble in every room, but prefer a touch of authenticity and warm, refined, style.
