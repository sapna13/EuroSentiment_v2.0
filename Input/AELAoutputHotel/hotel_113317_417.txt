{"text":"Truly Marvelous Experience at the Casablanca! Having just returned from a whirlwind, two-day trip to NYC, I wanted to give a completely heartfelt recommendation for the Casablanca, so that other travelers like us might have the benefit of staying at this lovely, accommodating oasis in Times Square.My nine-year old daughter and I planned a short trip to New York as she was so very keen on finally getting to see the City that never sleeps. After much stress and sticker shock over the cost of hotel rooms in NYC, we settled on the Warwick. However, one look at the unique style of the Casablanca and the glowing reviews offered on Trip Advisor, and we were sold. Although the price was very steep (for us) at $329, the Casablanca was entirely worth the additional $50 or so over the cost of other, more stately hotels in the City (we had booked the Warwick for $279).First and foremost, everything positive other travelers have said about the Casablanca is true. Honest. No - really! The continental breakfast was far more than that...the day that we enjoyed it, the hotel offered delightful mini-pastries and croissants, fresh bagels, oatmeal, freshly hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, fruit and granola, and juice. Not to mention that the espresso machine made espresso quickly and easily - to die for! I stopped buying outside coffee and just stepped into the lounge for my fix!Secondly, the staff must be commended. We arrived too early to check in (around 11:30 AM), but our bags were held and we were allowed to enjoy the benefits of the 24\/7 second-floor lounge immediately (cookies, espresso, cocoa). The staff at the desk, bag check and lounge were exceptionally accommodating. And when we returned less than two hours later, our room was ready, despite it being well before check-in time.Notes on our room - big for NYC. Simple, but nicely appointed - just like the website shows. The bathroom was lovely. We had a queen room, and it was plenty large for two people. And all reports of this hotel being right in the thick of Times Square (only about 1\/2 block away) and yet quiet as a church at night - absolutely TRUE! I couldn't believe it, but it was darn quiet at night. Lovely. And the corridors and common areas really carry a lovely Moroccan flare, as intended.The next day, the hotel held our bags for the entire day, gratis, and again, allowed us full use of the wonderful lounge (wine, cheese, espresso, fruit) all day. This was a godsend after a day spent rushing around NYC. We were able to grab our bags at the end of the day, recharge in the lounge and head to Grand Central Station refreshed.Casablanca isn't a posh modern hotel (like the W) or an old stately standard (like the Warwick). However, it is elegant and the very best a boutique property has to offer. It's location is wonderful, the staff are exceptional, and the perks they offer really make the difference. My daughter had the trip of a lifetime, largely because this hotel really went the extra mile for us. I would recommend this hotel for everyone from business travelers (free wi-fi in the lounge and rooms) to families traveling with kids (free library of DVDs in the lounge from which you can snag a movie to take to your room) to couples seeking a quiet get-away that is close to everything.
