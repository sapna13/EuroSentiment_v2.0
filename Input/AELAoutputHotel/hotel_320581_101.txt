{"text":"Excellent Location, Excellent Staff, Excellent Rooms...I'll always go back When I went to Tokyo in late November of 2007, I happened to go on the week of the Japanese Labor Day, so there was actually a problem finding available rooms anywhere because of all the Japanese living outside of Tokyo coming into Tokyo for the holiday weekend. Because of this, I stayed at The B Sangenjaya for two days and the remainder of my trip was spent in the Sunroute. I'm not a biased reviewer at all, but there is nothing wrong with the Sunroute whatsoever. Everything is pretty much great. I'm the type of person that doesn't really complain about anything in particular, but there was honestly nothing to complain about at the Sunroute. The hotel has a really great atmosphere from the lobby, to the rooms themselves. The rooms are more spacious than you would think being in the location in which it is. There's a nice tv with more than enough channels, an excellent bathroom, and all around cleanliness throughout the entire hotel. More importantly, it is about 4 minutes walk from Shinjuku station. A lot of people say that certain hotels are close to this station, but this one honestly is. I'm not sure why the prices for the Sunroute are so reasonable based on the style and elegance of the hotel and the location, but I'll definitely take advantage of it everytime I go back to Tokyo. I'll be going to Tokyo again in late February and I have already reserved at the Sunroute. To tell the truth, the only reason I would stay anywhere else in the Tokyo area is to just experiment with other places. The Sunroute has an edge in my mind now, so I feel sorry for the other hotels in the area ^_^ I highly recommend this hotel !!
