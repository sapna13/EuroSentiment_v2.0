{"text":"Atmosphere and Service The hotel had an old San Francisco feel that created a wonderful atmosphere and ambience.I booked with the Chancellor primarily because of the reviews on Trip Advisor, and I wasn't disappointed. This is a great hotel. I requested a room with lots of light and a view if possible, and I received it. The staff was incredibly helpful and the food (I only had breakfast) in the restaurant was very good.As for the room (I was in 1003), it was on the small side. For one person it was quite comfortable but probably not what you are looking for if you want a romantic getaway. I loved the bathroom with the huge soaking tub and the window that looked out onto the fire escape. There was wonderful natural light in the bathroom which is something you won't find at other hotels. I could picture Sam Spade crawling out the bathroom window and escaping down the fire escape when the person he was investigating arrived back at his room.There was a big window in the room which i always left open a bit. You could definitely hear the street noise, but I got used to it quickly and it created a feeling that i was really in the city. The flashing pink sign from the starlight dance hall across the street softly flashed through the window at night. Someone might find that irritating, but I found it charming and it didn't interfere with my sleep.The free wireless worked perfectly for me.The bed was very comfortable.The closet was spacious, but the drawers on the chest under the TV did stick , and I figured out I couldn't close them all the way.The staff were all sweet, solicitous, and polite. I was only there for a few days but they recognized me and treated me with familiarity.The lady selling the tours I would call the Tour Nazi. She's very intimidating, but I think she is an independent contractor with the hotel. HOWEVER, the assistance she did give me was right on target and just what I needed. Just be prepared for her firm, no-nonsense manner.Unfortunately, I had to cut my stay short in San Francisco and at the hotel. I had to check out earlier than planned. I gave the front desk the appropriate notice, and they didn't blink an eye about it or give me any grief.I could go on and on about the hotel. I would definitely stay there again. However, just because there are well-deserved high reviews of this place, don't expect a luxury hotel. This is a hotel for mature, reasonable people who want a nice, comfortable place to stay in a great location.
