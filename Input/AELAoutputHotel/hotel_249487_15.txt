{"text":"A complete disappointment!! This hotel is a complete disappointment! Although it claims to be a boutique hotel on the beach, it lacks any of the amenities a boutique would offer. The rooms are definitely minimal; there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a bed placed conveniently in the center of room, blue fluorescent light fixtures (nope, they are not on the building exterior, but in your room to serve as the room√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ only lighting) and sheer curtains to cordon off the bathroom. The obtuse armoire that can barely equip your carryon luggage is mismatched and beat up alongside a mini-bar that is in no better shape. The room d√ã√\u2022√ñcor reminded me of a seedy motel with bare white walls, fluorescent lightning and floating bed perhaps just a mirror on the ceiling is what√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ missing. The food is inedible, despite which part of the hotel you eat from √à√\u2020\u2022?the rooftop bar or the restaurant; it all comes from the same kitchen. The hotel staff offers incompetent concierge service, the few times I tried, was advised to visit old San Juan or a shopping mall because El Yunque was too far (you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° have better chances of getting advice from the valet [William\/Kevin] or booking tours\/visits yourself). The gym was closed during my visit for renovations so that was one less of the few features available. The pool is so small you may as well call it a wading pond albeit on the roof. The √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âlub√à√\u2020\u2022?as the hotel is referred to on the island caters more towards a late night party scene than to its own guests. If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e looking for a relaxing or rather pleasant holiday, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° recommend the Intercontinental, the El San Juan or the Ritz hotels, all of which are nearby. This hotel claims big but offers little√à√\u2020\u2022?\/p> ","annotations":[{"endOffset":671,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":666}]}
