{"text":"A Perfect Stay at the Perfect Hotel We booked the Antiche Figure as a result of the reviews in TripAdvisor, and we were not disappointed! We were in Venice for a few days before leaving on a cruise on the Zuiderdam.We arrived on September 27 after flying from NY through Madrid, taking the 3 Euro blue bus from the airport to Piazzale Roma (the only place in Venice that vehicles are allowed). The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Piazzale Roma (it would have been five minutes as they suggest, but we were each pulling two large wheeled suitcases up and over the two bridges which were a bit challenging).When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the manager, who offered us a choice of two rooms - and insisted that we go up and choose. The rooms are beautiful (even though we had one the lower cost red rooms) and the bath was marble with a wonderful shower.Once up and the room chosen, our bags arrived in about two minutes. We then went down (it was 2:30pm) and asked the manager if there was anywhere in the area to grab a quick lunch. He directed us down an alley next to the hotel to a series of small shops including a bakery and pizzeria.Having eaten, we returned and asked if there was a short walk we could take before we started thinking about dinner. He pulled out a map, told us how to get Vaporetto (water bus) tickets (a 3-day pass), and mapped out a route for us to San Marcos via water and then a walk back. It seemed aggeressive, but it was perfect! By the way, you can pretty much throw your map away in Venice. Despite what you read, you are never really lost. You see yellow signs everywhere for San Marcos, Rialto, Piazzala Roma, and Ferrovia (train station). Since the Antiche Figure is near both the train station and Piazzala Roma, just follow the signs until you get to the Grand Canal!The staff sent us to Osteria al Veccio Pozzo for dinner, a simple restaurant where we got the simple light meal we needed before crashing.The next morning, we went to the Antiche Figure's breakfast room where we found just about anything you'd want - from delightful pastries to cereal to juice, to meats and cheeses, boiled eggs, etc. The hostess was consistent with the rest of the staff - going overboard to be helpful - everyone was even asked whether they wanted cappuccino!Back for more advice from the staff, and then a day's run around the city. Their recommendation for dinner was Trattoria Antica Bessetta, where we eventually resorted to a map - it's not easy to find! But was it worth the effort! We met the owner, who told us about a trip that morning to the Venice Pescheria (open air fish market near the Rialto) where he found the perfect turbot, which we ordered. He brought it to the table in the foil in which is was baked, and then worked like an artist to prepare the perfect presentation on our plates. This place is well worth a visit, but make reservations. It was fully booked when we left....Another restful night at the Antiche Figure, followed by check out and detailed directions on how to find the free shuttle bus that runs between the Piazzale Roma and the pier (we had previously contacted Holland America Line and they told us that there was no such bus) which was right where the staff told us it would be.Visiting the Antiche Figure is like going home, even though it may be your first visit. The staff makes you feel like family, and they have practiced their art well. We spoke to others who had stayed at other hotels - even one in famous Bauer for more than twice the money - and none could rave about the hotel, its staff and service, as we could.If you're going to Venice, do yourself a favor. Stay at the Antiche Figure - you won't be disappointed!
