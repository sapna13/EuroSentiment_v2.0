{"text":"A++ Staff, A++ Pools, D- Room Service! We stayed at the Biltmore for four days during a corporate event. Rooms: They had initially put us in a room in the Village area. The room, decorated with mission style furniture, overlooked a garden and was spacious and clean, with a dresser, desk, two comfy chairs, side table, king bed, and flat screen tv. Our friends had rooms with a balcony and I love sitting outside reading so I requested a change to a room with a balcony. The staff were extremely accommodating about making the change. We packed our bags and they moved them for us. When we came back in the afternoon we had been given a room with a balcony, again overlooking the garden, in the Paradise section. Again the room was clean and had a flat screen tv and king bed. It had the balcony I had asked for but it was MUCH smaller! It didn't have room for the dresser and while it was a reasonable size, it felt cramped compared to the other room. To tell the truth, I wish I'd kept the larger room! So take your pick: smaller room + balcony, larger room + no balcony. Staff: Professional, helpful, polite, accommodating. Everyone we came in contact with, from Reception to the Pool staff, was top notch.The Grounds: You will walk. A lot. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but if you are mobility restricted it can be an issue. The Resort is large and sprawling so be warned, if you are in a room in one of the farther buildings and you are attending an event in the McArthur Ballroom, it's right on the other side of the property and is a bit of a hike. Lots of fountains, gardens, swimming pools, and everything is meticulously tended. btw: If anyone from the Resort reads this I'd have a small suggestion, on the way from the lobby to the Paradise building there is a concrete Japanese Temple on a rock. It doesn't look right just plopped there like an afterthought. It's an anomaly in a place as carefully planned as the Biltmore. The Buildings: The Resort itself is beautiful and it was a pleasure to stay in a place that had been designed with such style. We noticed that as sometimes happens in Wright's work, style occasionally triumphs over function, but it is lovely nonetheless. And ignore the picky people who complain about the carpets, plastic toilets in the rooms or whatever. Some people can never be satisfied. It's a beautiful and extremely well maintained Resort, and it's a pleasure to visit. And finally, I must mention the room service. If you have any choice, don't. We had to order in one evening because my husband was feeling ill. I love french onion soup and was eager to have some because I was sure that in a place as prestigious as the Biltmore, it would be real french onion soup. Can I tell you how disappointed I was to taste the same nasty oversalted beef soup base I can get in any restaurant? I sent the first bowl back because it was so salty it was inedible. The second bowl seemed almost as bad as the first but I was starving by the time it came and ate it anyway. The gruy√Å√\u2022¬¥re cheese on top was correct and lovely, but the overall it was very disappointing. One bowl french onion, one bowl chicken noodle, one grilled cheese, one small milk, one cr√Å√\u2022¬¥me br√ä?¬∞l√ã√\u2022√ñe = $50. Expensive and disappointing. Overall the Biltmore was a treat.
