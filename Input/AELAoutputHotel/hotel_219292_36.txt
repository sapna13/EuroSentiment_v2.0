{"text":"Almost, but not quite We stayed at the Wyland Waikiki for 14 nights in early September 2008. When we booked the hotel via our travel agent we requested a room on a high floor as I had read some reports about traffic noise and I had hoped this would have helped.We arrived at the hotel at about 9pm after almost 24 hours of travelling from London and were very tired. The staff at the front desk were helpful and gave us a room on the 11th floor, just as we had requested. The bad news was that it was in the second building that runs parallel with Royal Hawaiian Avenue.The corridors in the second building are open air which obviously lets more sound in the front door of your room. Even on the high floor, the street noise was very loud at times. I can see why though. There were no jams around the front door to the room which meant when the door was closed, there was a quarter inch gap around the rim.Also the hole in the wall into which the air conditioning unit had been installed was probably slightly too big for the unit, and although no visible gap was apparent, a great deal of street noise did seem to be coming through the air conditioner.We kept the air conditioner on all day but at night, the location of the bed relative to the air conditioner meant it was loud and it had to be turned off. It stayed quite cool in the room though so this wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ much of a problem.I suspect that the proximity of the building to Ala Wai Blvd was a major contributing factor to the noise as its a long stretch on road, and is the quickest way from one end of Waikiki to the other. Because of this it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ uncommon to hear engines revving loud, or the police car sirens at 2am.For the best experience, my advice would be to try and get a room on a high floor in the main building (which has enclosed corridors, like a regular hotel) with the balcony facing the pool. I believe this would provide the greatest amount of protection from the street noise.On a positive side we had a nice view of the mountains from our balcony if we looked left, more hotels if we looked straight ahead, and towards the beach (even though we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see it) if we looked right.The bed was extremely comfortable and well presented and the bathroom was modern. It was nice to have free access to two computers in the lobby and this allowed me to print off some vouchers that had been emailed to me for some tours we had booked.The free 15 minute phone calls from the room was also a great bonus as this allowed us to easily make reservations for different activities. Its a short walk to the beach from the hotel, and about a 2 minute walk to some of the major pickup points that tour companies pick up from.The room was clean and nicely decorated, although could have benefited from a fresh coat of paint in some areas that were slightly warn, e.g. behind one of the desk chairs which had apparently rubbed against the wall too many times.
