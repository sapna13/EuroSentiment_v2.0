{"text":"Faultless Stayed in a Club L room for 5 nights, and I can't think of a single complaint. The room was smallish but well thought out, so it didn't feel cramped at all. The bed was probably the most comfortable I've slept in. The huge flatscreen TV could be watched from the bath, thanks to the glass wall on the bathroom. The club was great - the best in any hotel I've stayed in. Drinks served all day, with sparkling wine until 6pm and then Mumm until 1am. There was a lavish afternoon tea and good canapes in the evening, followed by a dessert buffet. There were plenty of computers and two great massage chairs. Continental breakfast was served in the lounge, or you could choose the very comprehensive breakfast service in the main restaurant (incl dim sum, miso soup, sushi, congee on top of the usual staples).The staff were great - we didn't have one unpleasant experience. Contrary to some reports, I found the staff to be more genuine and friendly than in many large hotels. In addition, the turn down service was so comprehensive they cleaned the bathroom! This is a bit environmentally indulgent, but it is very luxurious to have a clean bathroom and dry towels for both your evening and morning showers. The pool facilities are very nice, with steam room, sauna and oriental hot tub in the change rooms, as well as a jacuzzi next to the pool. The gym was really good, with plenty of equipment, personal tvs on the machines and great views.We found the location to be ideal - Mong Kok is definitely a less touristy area that Tsim Sha Tsui or Central, which for us was a bonus. The MRT is in the same building as the hotel, but it is actually quite an interesting walk down to Tsim Sha Tsui from the hotel. We enjoyed walking to the Temple St night markets for excellent seafood, and from there it is another short walk to the many outdoor bars of Knutsford Terrace. The mall below the hotel is a shopping destination in its own right. Will definitely stay at the Langham Place again - it was a faultless experience.
