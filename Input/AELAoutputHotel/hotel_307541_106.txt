{"text":"..I miss it already!!!! We arrived in Bali having flown via Kualar Lumpur. It was a long flight but if you fly with a good airline they do all they can to make it bearable!We were supposed to go to Bali for our honeymoon but could not due to the close timing of the incident in Kuta. However, I was kind of glad we didn't as we had the most incredible trip in the end, which I doubt nowhere could match....However, Bali is an amzaing place, inexpensive, safe, friendly, beautiful, but the hotel was albeit very nice and the gardens superb. I found the rooms to be a little old particularilly the bathroom! However, this was in some way made up by having a room with a balcony over the regency lounge where live balineese music would be played in the evening..magical! The pools were lovely, but felt due to the surrounding trees and flowers the 'green' pool could have been cleaned more often throughout the day. The overall design of the gardens and pool were wonderful, and the beach (at high tide) is lovely, but low tide is not a post card pitcure. Although you can see the most sacred mountain from the beach. when the tide is out you can walk out into the weeds and see the largest star fish I have ever seen...up to 30cm in diameter! There did not appear to be anything nasty in the seaweed, but would suggest wearing rubber shoes if you want to go out far!!!The hyatt had a lovely reception, greeting you with flowers, music and a cold drink. The breakfast buffet was great and we looked forward to the fresh fruit and pastries daily. However, the price of food and drink in the hotel was outrageous. We did not eat once there for dinner. There are so many very nice restaraunts in Sanur. Recommend Ming  The Village I was amazed that these restaraunts managed to produce western food to a high standards, but of course their own cuisine was excellent too, but sometines you get a little fed up with the hot stuff. The fish in and around Bali is the best, exquisitte and would also recomment The Wantillian on the beach, walk along the beach path (left out ot the hyatt) anfd you will find tables on the sand, live music and the fish caught that day on the menu.....lovely.We did not explore enough of Bali, and do want to return. I would go back to the Hyatt as sanur has a good balance in terms of tourists etc...the Hyatt is supposed to be the best hotel in Sanur and we certaily did not see any other to question that. Taxis are very cheap...you have 2 kinds one is a van with bench seats which are very cheap, but would only use those to go up and down Sanur. Otherwise the taxis are good and also inexpensive we went to Kuta 3 or 4 times at a cost of 40,000 rupiah (about √ä√£¬¢2.50) each way.Bali is safe enough to travel around without a guide, the people are so spiritually guided they dare not commit crime nor offend anyone, quite a change from most places in the world. Avoid going with the fixed tour agent tour, unless you are prepared to only be taken to pre-arranged shops etc where pricres are far higher (due to intro commissions etc)Bali is fabulous and have never felt so much at peace, and this is down to the kindness of it's people...you must go! the temples are like nothing I have ever seen......I have got to go back and explore the west!
