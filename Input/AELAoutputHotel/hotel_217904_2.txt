{"text":"Cute little Hotel in great location Hotel Gates is located in a great section of Berlin. Subway is close by - around the corner and down the street and so is a number of cafes, pasteries, a print\/photo shop, book store, a t-shirt\/jean store etc etc. If it was a nice day, you could walk to the Zoo Palast, or take the subway one stop. Hotel is very clean, adequate, geared for business person or someone attending a film festival, convention centre or for anyone who needs to stay in touch with the world via internet, or needs to get any information.Buffet was amazing. Great quality of food, big selection, and they changed a few items every day. Dining room, was huge, immaculately clean, and the wait staff were friendly and all spoke English which I was grateful for. Same with front desk staff. Very professional, friendly, English was perfect, and staff were very helpful. Some of them however, mainly the night staff would look at you suspiciously if they never saw you previously. After an exchange of pleasanteries and with your door key in hand, they were fine after that - just be patient with that.Housekeeping was very friendly. If you needed to sleep in t'll noon, you would be left alone . You should always put the do not disturb sign up even though when I was in Bologna, Italy, the staff there didn't seem to respect that sign.Overall nice stay, very clean hotel, spacious, simple decor, nice balcony view, large bathroom, white clean tiles, a girls best friend - a removable shower head with great water pressure and adequate amounts of hot water. Large bathroom mirrors and room for accesories. Ask for towels only if you absolutely need fresh towels.
