{"text":"Amazing Amankila We have just experienced the most amazing holiday at Amankila.The special treatment started at the airport where we were greeted by smiling Amankila staff , given refreshing cold face towels and cold drinks, then transported in airconditioned luxury to the beautiful resort.Our villa was amazing- a beautiful free standing building, totally private, with a magificent view of the ocean. We had a private pool and there were so many unexpected luxurious touches. Every night our pool was beautifully lit by candles. A huge bowl of delicous fruit was supplied every day, a basket of tuber roses arrived on the first day to spread a heavenly fragrance through our suite, jars of sweet and savoury biscuits were continually topped up , jugs of iced water always supplied, and a never ending supply of fresh towels. Every night a little treat was left when our bed was turned down - sometimes chocolates, sometimes little bottles of perfumed oils or bath salts. While we had a fantastic view of the ocean and the surrounding country side, we had 95 steps to descend to get to the restaurants and the beautiful tiered pools! This meant we had 95 steps to climb to get back to our villa! It did take some effort but we considered it good exercise allowing us to further indulge at the restaurants!Every day we were given a menu listing the daily specials available at the restraurants. We thought the restaurants were great. The chef, James, spoke to us on several occasions and we thoroughly enjoyed all our meals. The Risterfel dinner by the tiered pool, beautiful candles everywhere, was fantastic - , as was the Satay Dinner at the Bale Tirta Sari - candles to light up the path to the bale high up on the mountain side, our own private chef and waiter - so peaceful, so unique . Great location, great service, great food.We enjoyed watching the gorgeous local Balinese children performing a dance one evening -very entertaining, they are so graceful. Also enjoyed receiving the lovely offerings the little girls made each day. There was lots of information available regarding activities to fill the day. We did an early morning trek with an experienced guide, through rice fields and some very isolated little villages. Great scenery - magnificent views of Mount Agung and also the vivid blue ocean and the green of the coconut palms and rice fields. We also went snorkling and cruising on the Aman XII. I had never been snorkling but had a ball. Felt very safe with the Amankila guide close by. Very relaxing lying on the roof of the boat while we were cruising, and we enjoyed a delicious lunch on the way back. Relaxing by the pools was a favourite past time for us - either the magnificent tied pools, the beach club pool or down on one of the bales at the beach where we were treated with delicious shot glasses of sorbet. Pure bliss!One of the best things of all about our holiday was the staff at Amankila . Tracy, the general manager is an absolute delight, very welcoming, obliging and easy to talk to, and she obviously has full respect and confidence of all the staff. They were like a big happy family. They were discrete, happy, friendly, always smiling, knowledgable, and they all knew and called us by name from the minute we arrived. Not once were we asked for our room number, nor to sign any restaurant dockets! They always knew who we were! Quite amazing.I can't say enough about this amazing place. I haven't mentioned the beautiful private beach, the yummy afternoon tea every day at 4pm on the library steps, the spa treatments, the availablilty of a buggy to take you from the beach back up to your villa, the fantastic gift shop full of beautiful uniquely Balinese goodies (which are surprisingly inexpensive), nor many other activities that we didn't have time to do.  We only had five days at Amankila - it was so comfortable, unpretentious and relaxing our five day stay was timeless. Congratulations to the management and staff on providing such a magical experience. The attention to detail in every respect was truely remarkable. Thank you.
