{"text":"A place to stay, for sure! I had booked this hotel for a very short trip in Frankfurt. I do know the Marriott standards, so I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° expect something good. That was the case.The room was booked directly from the Marriott website. Nothing fancy there. There was some packages to choose for and also regulars rates, with your choice of room. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° choose a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬©omance Package√à√\u2020\u2022? No romance as I was alone, but it comes with a free upgrade to Executive floor, a plate of fresh fruit, a bottle of Champagne, a three service diner at the restaurant, free in-room Internet Acces, free Minibar, and of course free access to the lounge, on floor 44.The room was small regarding US standards but correct in size for an European√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ one. The view was really good (floor 39). Everything was fine in the room, with a king bed and a load of pillows.The bathroom was just perfect, probably refurbished recently. There was slippers and bathrobe.The health room on level 1 is big enough, with all you need to train yourself. There is also steam, sauna and whirlpool. Too bad that the last one was very very cold! Do not count on a pool (Yes, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a shame).My diner at √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√®rasserie Ici√à√\u2020\u2022?was really good, but the service far too slow!Overall, my experience was really good, with very helpful and friendly staff, from check-in to concierge, from lounge attendant to business center crew. There is still some point to improve, but the place worth your money.I will, for sure, stay here again in the future ","annotations":[]}
