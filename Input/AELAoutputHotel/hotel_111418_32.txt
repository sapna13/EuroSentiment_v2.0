{"text":"Horrible Experience I hve been traveling extensively for yers and this was one of the worst experiences I have had. I booked a room in March for a wedding on June 14th. Unfortunately one of the grooms immediate family members got sick and the wedding was moved to September 13th. I called on April 2nd to move my reservation. The first two people I spoke with said this could not be done my money was gone. When booking my reservation it said no where that the room was non refundable. I asked about this and I was told that there are no refunds for rooms booked online. This was my first major gripe what major hotel has this type of policy. I was changing my reservation 2 and 1\/2 months ahead of time this is crazy. I then explained I was not canceling but moving the date and explained the circumstances. I was still told the move was impossible. Finally I got a manager in the hotel told me I could move the date to September 13th. I did this over the phone and was content that even though it was a process it was done. However when I called to confirm two weeks ago they had no reservation for me nd no knowledge of any phone calls. I was actually told there was a traacking system for every phone call and they had nothing showing I had ever called. I called 10-15 different times! After expressing my frustration to two other people I was told to leve a message for the reservations manager. I did so twice on Aug 30 and 31st and never recieved a call back. I gave up and made a reservation and a nicer area hotel. To me what it comes down to is the the Boston Park Plaza hotel stole 300 dollars from me and I would never trust them with a credit card. I will never stay there or at another starwoods hotel again (I am a starwoods member and will be canceling my membership). I am an easy customer to please and have never given a bad review. This was a horrow show. Shame on the Boston Park Plaza hotel.
