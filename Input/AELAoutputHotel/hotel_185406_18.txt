{"text":"Can't go wrong - a very very very good hotel I spent one night at the JW Marriott in Mexico City just before Christmas. It was my first real experience in Mexico City, and I have to say, both really exceeded my expectations. Among the group of us who stayed at the hotel were several people who boast that they will only stay at the Marriott. Even among the Mexico City residents we were with, the hotel was second only to the Four Seasons in terms of preferred hotels, and at about 50% of the price (my room was $229 and rooms at the Four Seasons are in the mid $300√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂).Among the positives:1. The location √à√\u2020\u2022?Mexico City is unlike any place I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been to. Even flying in you are blown away by how sprawling and dense it is. I compare it to my hometown of Los Angeles √à√\u2020\u2022?imagine flying over Los Angeles and instead of seeing detached homes everywhere you see apartment buildings - that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Mexico City. The Marriott is located in the Polanco district at the edge of the Chapultepec Park in one of the most upscale neighborhoods in the City. There are treelined, Parisian style boulevards, great cafes which are open late (we started dinner at midnight √à√\u2020\u2022?NY hours), and all sorts of shops. You√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e very close to museums. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ great to be within walking distance to so many places. Very European.2. The rooms √à√\u2020\u2022?I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ find much wrong with the rooms, they were better than just about any urban, business hotel that I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been in √à√\u2020\u2022?Manhattan, Chicago, San Francisco. First off, great first impression √à√\u2020\u2022?the oversized wood doors are set within these little alcoves so that you feel like you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e going inside some sort of temple. Inside, great bed with nice comforter and cushy pillows. The bathroom had green granite countertops, a nice enclosed shower (though I felt guilty about my water consumption, the blistering water pressure was sure a treat). The door got in the way of the toilet, but not a big deal. There were stone floors throughout and exceedingly nice and comfortable wood furniture. Large windows offered great views of the City. From my room I could see the beautiful rooftop blue-tile pool overlooking the Bentley and Hummer dealerships along with a nightclub, an elementary school, a 12 story apartment building, a sprawling mansion with a prison-style wall encircling it (complete with barbed wire) and a 25 story office building, all within one block. That√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the wonderful schizophrenia of Mexico City.3. The service √à√\u2020\u2022?check-in was flawless √à√\u2020\u2022?very friendly, very English fluent staff with a near instantaneous processing. They seemed to have staff at every corner to assist you with where to go and the staff was genuine and warm. The people who handled the morning wake-up call (both to reserve and to wake me up) were noticeably friendly √à√\u2020\u2022?and I like the personalized wake-ups vs. recordings. Check-out was simple. I have been to several Mexican resorts and have generally received gracious service there as well, but this was impressive for me to see in a business hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?it ranks up there with some of the best business hotels in the US. I prepaid for a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ªegular cab√à√\u2020\u2022?to the airport on my room bill (see previous posts) and it cost 3750 pesos √à√\u2020\u2022?I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe seen the other reviews and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not sure if I got ripped off but I appreciated the convenience. The hotel and rooms were very spotless throughout.4. Restaurant √à√\u2020\u2022?I had breakfast and lunch in the restaurant and thought it was very good. Reasonably priced, quick and attentive service. I love Mexican breakfasts and this one was up to snuff. A great mix of residents and visitors really gave it a cosmopolitan feel as well √à√\u2020\u2022?neither touristy nor businessy, and that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ tough to do (and neither American nor Mexican which is great).5. Cool architecture √à√\u2020\u2022?the lobby is pretty impressive, as are some of the great views from the hallways, and the building all in all is great. It looks a little bit dated and monstrous from the outside but it works when you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e inside. They were in the midst of redoing the lobby when I was there.The little I could find wrong √à√\u2020\u2022?1. It annoyed me to have to pay for internet usage (2500 pesos for a full day, 1250 for four hours)I like trying new places, but if I am in Mexico City again I would like to come back to the JW Marriott first and spend some more time there. It was a very good experience.
