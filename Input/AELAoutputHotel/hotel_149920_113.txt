{"text":"Beautiful Property.......Take a sweater! My wife and I were looking for a Marriott property that might be a fun vacation. I travel quite a bit and stay at Marriott very often, so once a year we decide to go somewhere warm. Last year we stayed in St. Thomas at the Frenchman's Reef Marriott, and decided to try Puerto Rico this year. The hotel was immaculate. We were greeted at the front desk and received an upgrade due to my Marriott status. We had an ocean view room which was very clean and enjoyed the king size bed and flat screen TV. The pool area was very large, but too many trees around the pool which blocked the sun. We had to move our lounge every hour or so to find the sunny spots. Also, San Juan is very windy, and I am not talking about soft tradewinds, these were very strong at times and blew our towels and shoes around the pool deck. We asked some of the locals and they confirmed that it was always that windy. If you are out of the sun and the wind picks up it can get very chilly. Pros1. Very Clean Hotel2. Very friendly staff3. Tuscany Restaurant was amazing (Get the Osso Bucco)4. Pool Bar made great drinks (Get the Rum Island Tea)5. Other food choices right near the hotel (Go To Level 25 at the La Concha Resort)6. Starbuck's across the street.7. Executive Lounge at hotel was great for a light breakfast.Cons1. Windy....Very Windy2. No sun at pool3. Beach was nice, but wind gave it a sandblast effect.4. View down the beach was of old abandoned buildings.5. Food at La Isla not so great.
