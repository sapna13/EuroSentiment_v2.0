{"text":"Average I read what travellers wrote about this hotel prior to me leaving to Punta Cana and I was scared and nervous as to what I would experience at this resort. The process of getting from the airport to the hotel was brutal- waiting 2 hours on the bus for everyone to load thier luggage and find there bus was unbelievable. We arrived 2 hours late at our hotel destination, the staff greeted us and we checked into our room. Yes, they make 2 single bed to form one queen bed. My boyfriend and i werent too happy about that, yet another couple did end up getting a real queen bed. Staff was alright, they didnt seem happy or enthusiastic. The club was dead every night, so it isnt your party hotel. The food was alright and honeslty I can't complain that it was horrible or it was amazing. You are travelling to another country where they have limited resources to everyhting, so dont expect fine dining. The beach bar had better food, less selection but it just tasted better. The roast chicken is good :)The best part of the trip was the beach! 5 out of 5 on that one! White sandy beaches and blue blue water is what i asked for and i got it. People were really nice there, alot of Europeans and Canadians. The excursions were fun as well, i recommend the tropical storm (catamaran trip)....it was a really good time despite the bad weather we still made some good memories. The Doon Buggies was ok, the buggies werent working properly so it was a bit frustrating. Over all, would i go back to Punta Cana? Sure! Would i go back to LTI? No thanks i would try something else.It wasnt bad but i had a much better experience in Mexico.
