{"text":"Could be better This hotel is best suited for a short stay or overnight stop. Having traveled extensively within the Marriott brand, this hotel falls short of expectations. Would not recommend this hotel for a family vacation or long stay. On the positive side, the hotel does have a nice selection of restaurants, bars and buffets, though they are a little on the expensive side. The hotel itself is updated with nice furnishings and large LCD televisions. Airport noise was not a disturbance inside the hotel, it is well insulated. On the negative side, this hotel is not the cleanest Marriott in which I've stayed, but it is not the worst either. The beds and pillows were quite uncomfortable and during the week the hotel began some renovations of the pool area and casino. Nearly all slot machines were closed (they left five 1 cent slots, but cleverly--and to my disappointment--left all the high roller slots. The beach service was very good, but be advised that they have only a handful of umbrellas for guests. On the weekends it can become a fight for the umbrella--leave your chairs and someone takes them--I even saw someone run over and pull am umbrella out of the sand when a couple got up to walk. This was irritating. Staff service was also not up to expectations, especially for an elite member. Also note sand fleas are active at dawn and dusk. While signs in the room indicate the hotel will provide insect repellant, we found this difficult to obtain. The front desk looked at us like we were crazy when we asked for it and then told us they did not have any and to try again later. The jet traffic also effectively ruins the pleasant beach experience, which is very active during certain times of the day. In summary, would not stay at this particular hotel again.
