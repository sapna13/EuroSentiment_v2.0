{"text":"Sleepless in Seattle 2: Avoid room 233! The positives:Most of the front desk staff were incredibly nice and helpful. Free breakfast with waffles, muffins, breads, danish, bagels, fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, assorted cereals, and juices. Great coffee in the lobby and at the restaurant.Aveda toiletriesThe negatives:I had a room that directly overlooked the alley between the hotel and IHOP next door. This alley housed the dumpsters which were emptied at 3am and 5am. I was on the 2nd floor (room 233) directly over where the trucks were parked so got the sounds of breaking glass loud and clear. No sleep at all after having arrived from the east coast well after midnight.After the 5am garbage truck wake-up call, I gave up on sleep, took a shower, and went downstairs to speak to the front desk clerks. They were sympathetic but said oh yes, the garbage trucks. I asked to be moved, but the hotel was booked. They said I could come back around at 10 or 11am to check but they were booked solid again that night. Meanwhile I had to go to business meetings in Bellevue on no sleep.I called my corporate travel agency and asked to be moved to a sister hotel in Bellevue. The agent arranged it but told me that the front desk manager (Tammy) was upset that I had not given the hotel a chance to rectify the situation!!!! Apparently she had not been notified of my 6am conversation with her staff. Tammy then told the agent that she would refund my remaining 2 night prepaid stay if I got there by 2pm; it was 1:20pm at this point so I had to rush to Seattle from Bellevue, and surprise! there was heavy traffic in Seattle. Anyway I made it there and happily checked out.My stay at the Silver Cloud Eastgate was far more pleasant and restful. The Silver Cloud Broadway needs to reconsider subjecting guests to the ridiculous racket that seems to be a regular occurrence given the nonchalance of the staff to my complaint. Otherwise guests beware of the 2nd floor alley rooms.
