{"text":"Simply Majestic... We just returned from a week long stay in Punta Cana at the Majestic Colonial. For a 4-star hotel, this place provided a 5-star service and everything was available at all hours of the days and nights. The hotel provided plenty of activities during the day and night at no extra cost but also offered off campus excursions for an additional price. We did not engage in any off those. They seemed a bit pricey. My wife participated in the pool aerobics and dance classes every day, while the men enjoyed volleyball and water polo. Plenty of seating with and without shade is available by the pool and beach. The sun can be brutal, pack a lot of sun-screen. Upon arrival, you're greeted with a drink called La Majestic and cool wet towels. You can make this drink alcoholic by telling them to add rum. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ offered non-alcoholic for the obvious reasons. This drink is the staple of the hotel and must say, it beats your standard pina-coladas and Hawaiian punches. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful with all our needs. Since the hotel is never fully booked or over booked, majority of the room views will be either full ocean view or partial ocean view rooms. The rooms with partial ocean view, face the pool and that in itself is just as pretty a view. Our room had a Jacuzzi in it. The room bar is complete with candy bars, water, soda and beer and is replenished every day. Breakfast\/Lunch\/Dinner: The hotel requires you to make reservations for The French and Japanese restaurants...MAKE'EM. They are upscale and the food is delicious. Japanese food was the best, followed by the French and all others are pretty standard. Between those two, the steakhouse, seafood and buffet, it turned out to be enough variety for a week long stay. The steakhouse and seafood place is huge and therefore divided into two sides. They√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e both on the beach. You can always ask them to serve you dinner on the beach with timely advanced notice. You can have dinner under the moonlight on the beach while being serenaded by a musician. Breakfast: Two places were open. Almost like a college cafeteria with different stations offering different types food, but better quality than your normal college cafe. Eggs, fruits, juices, bakery, meat, low-carb\/diet stations and cooks if you want something made especiallyfor you.Lunch: There is a choice of few places, but if you're baking in the sun at the pool or the beach and after having a late breakfast and drinking all morning, anything is edible. A sandwich, pizza slices usually sufficed, but there is more.If you're in an All-Inclusive package, the concept of tipping is almost non-existent. But we did leave tips for the staff we got to know over the 6 days, and the ones that went beyond their service delivery, especially the bartenders and maids. Go see Pablo and Frances at the plaza bar. This package includes the shuttle to and from the Punta Cana airport to your hotel. Depending what hotel you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e staying at, it can take anywhere from 15mins to an hour to get there. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother renting a car, the roads are smaller and local drivers are erratic and there is no sense of direction when driving. Nightlife: Casino, Disco  Sports Bar, Local Shows. Nothing extravagant, but still well put together. This is a vacation spot for a little R  R, if you're looking for a wild night life; visit the other side of the island. This place died down around 11:30pm...but started hopping around 6:30pm, just before dinner. Currency Exchange: Don't bother converting, take the dollars.
