{"text":"Despite the Miamitude and uneven service, this is a fine hotel We just returned from our second trip to the FS Miami. In many ways, this is a great hotel. It actually has a great combination of an upscale business hotel and a resort. The location is perfect as it sits right on Brickell with easy access to downtown Miami, Key Biscayne, South Beach and Coral Gables. The views of the Bay are wonderful. The rooms are not overly big but are well decorated and comfortable. The outside area is great as it has a wonderful lap pool area with a kid's area and another lounging pool. The service is usually efficient but not particularly friendly. Miami, in my opinion, continues to be one of the least friendly and snobby cities in the nation. To some extent, this is also found in the Hotel. We waited forever for service at the outside reastaurant and received horrible service by the pool. I was so outraged I called the front desk from the pool area to complain! To be fair, the manager came out to the pool to address my complaints and the service improved dramatically after that. It was a shame that is what it took to get good service. The room service was prompt and pleasant. The woman who answers the room service breakfast call is wonderful..friendly and efficient. When we checked out, the agent at the front desk basically lied to us about not being able to redeem a gift card which we found to be very disturbing. Be prepared to deal with the attitude, lack of friendliness and service issues. It is visually stunning and a wonderful place to relax and see the city. ","annotations":[]}
