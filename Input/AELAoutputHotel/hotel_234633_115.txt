{"text":"Wonderful Hotel Stayed at the Hotel Residence FOCH for a week in May for my Partner's 40th birthday. Booked on-line which was very straight forward, although we did have alittle trouble finding the Hotel when we first arrived (my fault for not printing out the little map - just get off at the exit for Avenue de Malokoff) and it's a 2 minute walk. Our room (50) was fine not enormous but quite sufficient space for us plus it had the added bonus of it's own terrace, through the bathroom. (I had picked this up from Trip Advisor -my partner thought it was a cupboard so got a pleasant surprise).We visited the Musee De L'Orangerie to see Monet's Waterlily paintings (just off the Place de la Concorde) and they were stunning and I would highly recommend a visit.RER service to Versailles from Porte Maillot station, very easy just change trains at Champ Des Mars - Tour Eiffel and catch any train with a name beginning with V. Versailles Palace very beautiful, we did a costly but excellent guided tour, very knowledgable French lady, learnt alot.Staff at this hotel are all brilliant and were always pleasant at all times, they were very helpful. Nelly recommended a fabulous restaurant (Le Petit Bisto - I think). Special Birthday meal and well worth the money with the very special touch of a glass of champagne from the hotel. Our meal cost about √ä√£¬¢100 but was one of the nicest steaks I've ever tasted.We will certainly return to this hotel but will perhaps try to get a superior room next time (not because the other rooms are not good but just for the extra space and perhaps a front facing balcony.One last thing, do climb the Arc De Triomphe at night (284 steps) it's well worth it for the view....oh yes if you visit the Pantheon there is a little bistro just down the road (1st one you come to) that did a fantastic Ceasar salad for 8 euros each.Thanks again to Nelly and staff, we had a wonderful stay.
