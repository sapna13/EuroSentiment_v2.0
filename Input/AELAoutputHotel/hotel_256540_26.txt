{"text":"Great personal hotel I've just left the Establishment, having stayed there for 11 nights for business.I found the hotel great and by the end of my stay was really sad to leave!This is a small hotel that is part of a sort of complex (I use this word loosely), of bars, restaurants, night club - all of which you can indulge in or not - your decision and the hotel is kept seperate from the facilities.Room: I stayed in room 54 and it was great, plenty of space, good facilities, great bed and internet access was free of charge.Turn down service was very thorough and the cookies each evening are dangerous for the waist line!Towels and linen were devine, one thing I dislike is hotels that use bad versions of these, and it certainly didn't feel like the case here.Without a doubt one of the best rooms I've stayed in while on a business trip.Location: This was my first time in Sydney, so I was unsure of the distances between the tourist attractions and also the different neighbourhoods. So it was a pleasent surprise to find that the hotel was in the perfect spot, just a few minutes walk to Circular Quay, Harbor Bridge, Opera House and add 10\/15\/20 minutes onto this for Darling Harbor, Oxford St, Darlinghurst.Hotel Facitilties: As I mentioned the hotel has a number of bar's and restaurants that, as a guest you will have access to. I didn't venture in to any of these, mainly because there was much to see outside of the hotel!I did access my room via the Establishment Bar a few times, and although is a beautiful bar to look at with amazing architecture, the whole place felt like a bit of a meat market and just not the kind of bar I woudl hang out in...but if that's you thing then it woudl be perfect!There was also a small work out room which you could access at any time with the your room key. I went a number of times and was always the only person there, they have free weights, treadmill, bike, crosstrainer, swiss balls and soem other bit and peices. If there are any keen runners I was reccomend the route from Circular Quay, past the Opera House followign the water around to the botanical gardens and then cut through there to get back on to Bridge street - such a wonderful route with amazing veiws!Staff: I found everbody I encounted really friendly and helpful and I'll stay at this hotel again without hesitation.
