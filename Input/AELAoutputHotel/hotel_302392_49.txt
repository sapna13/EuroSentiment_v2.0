{"text":"Always outstanding Our fourth stay (for our 10th anniversay), our third in a hard to beat ocean view private pool villa with beach view across the lawns from the front terrace and a large truly private Balinese pool in the rear along with a raised dining deck with views to the ocean. Each villa and its surrounding walls are beautifully built of coral with a very royal Balinese style and feel. It may be 30 years old but you'd never know it as it is maintained in pristine condition, we think it is the most under rated of the 5+ star hotels in Bali and we have stayed at most. It is unassuming and understated from the road but once inside it is just a wonderful haven with personal service at your fingertips. Service is not frenetic and over the top like the Ritz Carlton it is just unobtrusively there when and as you want it. The beachfront breakfast is a highlight as is the fine dining restaurant. You can walk out into Seminyak to cheap eating if you want  the hip Ku de Ta is next door etc. Granted it is not cheap but by comparison it offers fantastic luxury, quality  value against the others. We went onto the serene Oberoi Lombok for a second stay (see our review) then back to the Ritz Carlton in Bali for a couple of days (huge, isolated from Jimbaran so you are captive, expensive, and nice enough but definitely not in the same class as the Oberois).
