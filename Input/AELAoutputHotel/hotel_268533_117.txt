{"text":"Perfect location, very cool hotel The Argonaut is, in my opinion, the only place to stay in San Francisco, especially if you have kids. It's location on Fisherman's Wharf is great, because it is at the quiet end near the lovely park. I can't say enough about the excellence of this hotel: The staff were fantastic, nothing was too much trouble. The decor was spot-on (sophisticated and funky, but also the kids loved it.) The nightly happy hour was hopping. The kids loved the freebie treasure chest pick each day. The room was comfortable, decorated nicely, lovely amenities. Loved looking out the window and seeing the Park and Cable Cars and people walking about. Okay, maybe a little too much street noise, but if you stay here, there really isn't a way around that. The windows are pretty sound proof. The conceirge was helpful and knowledgable, the front desk went out of their way to give good service. The only sad note was the passing of Bubble the goldfish, as he was quickly christened. In the morning my son gave us the bad news of his demise. I told the front desk guy, he asked if we wanted another, but we didn't want to risk it. Loved that the museum was located in the lobby, though I understand that is temporary. Was a little disappointed in the breakfast at the Blue Mermaid, which was more miss than hit. The food was just never hot or fresh enough. Apart from that though, this place was a great choice for our 3 night stay. ","annotations":[]}
