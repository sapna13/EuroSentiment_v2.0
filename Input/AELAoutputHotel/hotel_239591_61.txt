{"text":"Great location, cost effective Hotel is down some side streets 5 minute walk away from the main street of La Rambla with its metro stop of Liceu - so you are within easy reach of the rest of the City via the metro. Location wise the hotel is great but during the night the side streets were a little daunting and saw a girl get her bag snatched √à√\u2020\u2022?just keep your wits about you and you will have no problems. There are lots of lovely local bars and cafes near the hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?much better value that those of on La Rambla √à√\u2020\u2022?found lovely tapas bars and ate with the locals. Found one bar just down the street taking a right out of the hotel which was a good night and one lovely one set in the walled garden area found by walking out of the hotel taking a left and left again and there is a large wall opposite √à√\u2020\u2022?go through the large gate and to the left is a lovely little outside bar area √à√\u2020\u2022?kind of set in a walled garden area. Would advise taking a stroll in the opposite direction to La Rambla and exploring the area were you will stumble across the most wonderful bars and restaurants at much better value. Took a room on the fourth floor, room was nice and clean, laminate floors throughout and a wonderfully powerful shower, plasma TV √à√\u2020\u2022?only downside was that the laminate floors meant that when the cleaners came round in the morning the noise from the corridor was greatly amplified. Breakfast was continental √à√\u2020\u2022?ok √à√\u2020\u2022?as I love a full English breakfast √à√\u2020\u2022?not so keen on the sausage and egg provided as it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ what I was used to so I got by on the tea and toast - but everyone seemed to be enjoying it - if you prefer something heartier then there are plenty of cafes around.Found the staff helpful and the taxi drivers knew where the hotel was so no trouble finding it. Over all I think I would stay here again, location was great and for the price the standard of furnishings and quality was top notch √à√\u2020\u2022?would recommend.
