{"text":"Wow!!! We loved the Ocean Sand We were at the Ocean Sand from Nov. 12th to the 18th. We went with four adults and three teens. I was a little concerned for the teens because they were looking to do some partying and I had heard that this place was more for families. Our teens, ages 16 to 18 had a blast. They say it was the best holiday of their life. The sports bar and the disco kept them entertained at night. We were fortunate in that they met up with other teens that they became very close to very quickly. Some of them will probably be friends for life. Our room was more than I expected, one of the nicest I have seen. It was always clean and the fridge was always stocked. A dollar tip with a thank you note seemed to help. The staff were always helpful, friendly, polite and happy to see you. The grounds were unbelievably spotless and beautiful. The food choices were overwhelming. If someone complained about the food, then they picked the wrong items for themselves. There are hundreds of choices at the buffet. The drinks were flowing from early morning till 2am. You can order any drink from water, beer, Baileys, Drambui, but don't forget to try the Mamauana.........only a few or you won't remember the rest of the day. Overall, I would have to say that this is the nices resort I have seen. There is nothing that I can think of , that any other resort might have that would have improved our holiday. I would definately recommend this resort. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1128,"mention":"Baileys","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Baileys_Irish_Cream"],"startOffset":1121}]}
