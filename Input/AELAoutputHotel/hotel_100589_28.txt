{"text":"Welcoming boutique hotel for the road warrior I stayed at the Roosevelt April 10-15, 2007, here for the Amer. Assoc. of Clinical Endocrinologists meeting. I'm a journalist and an experienced business traveler and I really enjoyed this homey, pleasant hotel. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. It was great to come home to this place, especially if you're tired of the cookie-cutter chain hotels. However, I choose the Roosevelt because it was cheaper than alternatives. Note it is a 100% NO SMOKING hotel.The lobby of this smallish hotel has a fireplace, an excellent literate library with many books worth reading, and there is a FITNESS ROOM with a few cardio machines and a free weights set. (The hotel should advertise that Fitness Room. I didn't bring my gym shoes but made do.)My room was very small, but adequate for working, and flawlessly appointed. There is a free Internet connection in the lobby, so I checked my email for free multiple times a day, but otherwise you have to pay for Internet on a daily basis. There's a Starbucks with excellent working tables right across the street where I could get my WiFi fix. Also, the express bus to the airport stops right across the street, in front of the Hyatt -- doesn't get easier than this; costs $10.25. The location is excellent -- a short walk to the monorail to the Space Needle, an even shorter walk to the Convention Center, tons of shopping, and great restaurants. BE SURE to eat at Von's, which is attached to the hotel. They fruitwood roast their own meats and make homemade vanilla ice cream. The bacon in the morning is baked with brown sugar and tastes amazing. Also hit the Cheesecake Factory, yes it's a chain and it's jammed, but the fish especially is really outstanding. The cheesecake is the fluffy kind and comes in dozens of flavors.
