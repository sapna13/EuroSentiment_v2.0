{"text":"Don't Be scared off by bad reviews!! Just returned from the Bavaro Princess on the 12th and I can't believe some of these bad reviews. I have traveled to many islands in the Carribean and this was my second time to Punta Cana. The first time my husband and I stayed at Secrets Excellence. The Bavaro Princess is a beautiful resort employing wonderful people. I did not meet one person who did not go out of their way to greet us, even if it was in their native language of Spanish. The people who need to speak English can, maybe not as well as us, but I can speak Spanish as well as them. The service in the restaurants is a little slow, but the reason we go to these places it to be on island time, right! The food was not bad, I've learned from my trips to the Carribean what I can and can't eat. I can not touch the beef on any of these islands, it is not the food itself that is bad, it is just not what my American stomach is used to, so I stick with what I can eat and there are plenty of choices. As for saving chairs at 6am to lose them by 7am, it clearly states in the directory that saving chairs is not allowed and any unattended chairs left for more than 30 minutes can be taken over by someone else. So you see, no need to call the police. I didn't have a problem finding chairs on the beach or the pool deck, some people just want a prime spot all of the time, not very realistic. The rooms were beautiful, much larger than average and I love the arrangement. Maid service was excellent, they couldn't do enough for us. Landscaping was also excellent, I don't think they ever stopped working. Platinum Club was definitely worth it, location of rooms alone was a big plus. We were right next to the beach. All of the people working in the plantinum lounge were also wonderful and their English was very good. Guess what though, I tried to learn as much Spanish as I could while I was there, even simple things like hello and how are you. The staff really appreciate it when you try and they are more than willing to help you learn. Maybe that is why I recieved better treatment, I showed and interest in learning to better communicate with them. Didn't mean to go on this long, I just get tired of listening to the spoiled Americans whine about how terrible their trip to a third world country was, be realistic, you are going for the beach, the relaxation and the experience. If you are looking for gourmet food and a true 5 star hotel, there are plenty of those right here in New York , although, you may not find many people speaking English there either. One last thing, my trip to Secrets Excellence cost twice as much as this one and the resort was beautiful and the food a little better, but I would definitely go back to the Bavaro Princess. Any questions, please feel free to email me.
