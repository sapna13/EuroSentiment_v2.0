{"text":"Old world charm LOCATION: The hotel is not that close to the shopping part of the CBD. Rather, it is at East Circular Quay which is near the Opera House, Domain and Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA). It would be about a ten minute walk to Hyde Park, which is closer to the very centre. ROOM: We stayed in a standard room with a queen size bed which was very comfortable. The interior decoration of the room reflects the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬∂ld world charm√à√\u2020\u2022?of the entire hotel. As such, it can look a little tired. Our room also had a very small balcony which looked out onto the buildings next door which was quite nice. There is a TV although it isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ flat screen and there are not as many channels available but there are movies on-demand, including several recent releases. The marble bathroom is quite spacious and they provide products such as shampoo, conditioner, moisturiser, body gel and soaps. One of the wonderful things about this hotel is that they provided bathrobes and slippers √à√\u2020\u2022?something that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not found at every hotel. There is in-room broadband internet access if you have your own computer but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ only possible to purchase it at a cost of $29 for a 24-hour period. SERVICE: When we arrived at 11.30am, our room was already ready. The concierge at the hotel was particularly helpful and everyone was generally really friendly. I was impressed with the prompt, efficient and polite service. AMENITIES: There is a very small gym on the fifth floor (which is hard to find) and the equipment is not very modern at all. There is also a sauna and an outdoor swimming pool with a quaint little courtyard area. IN-ROOM DINING: The meal we ordered arrived within 16 minutes which was quite prompt and the food was of generally good quality. The menu is also somewhat more affordable than most other five star hotels in Sydney. ","annotations":[]}
