{"text":"What a view!!! We had a little trouble finding this condo. Driving along the main road in Waikiki there are 3 Resortquest hotels, I think. There was not a sign for where to turn. I called the front desk and they came out to the road to meet us. We were on the 32nd floor which normally would freak me out but the view was worth it. We had an oceanfront room, I thought with the price difference was well worth it. There is a convenient walkway to the beach. Upon checking in they gave us a pail, shovel and sifter for our kids which was a nice surprise. While these are inexpensive and there is an ABC store right on the corner, it was nice just to have it and go right to the beach. There are no restaurants to speak of right nearby except McDonald's. Since we arrived late and were starving after our 9 hour flight, we tried to get room service and were told 45 minutes since they get it from another hotel. There are, of course restaurants in all the nearby hotels, but with two tired and hungry kids I really did not want to take them into a hotel.The room was decent, a little musty smelling maybe from the ocean air. The bed in the master bedroom was hard as a rock and the pillows flat. The a\/c in the master controlled both bedrooms but to have it cool enough in the master the other bedroom was like an ice locker(you can open the windows to combat this). Up where we were we did not hear the traffic sounds other than the occasional rescue. The dryer took forever!!! Plan on turning it on at least 3 times for a normal size load. I would recommend this condo. It's a convenient location, the waterview is amazing. While I enjoy a plush bed at a luxury hotel, with kids this condo has everything you need.
