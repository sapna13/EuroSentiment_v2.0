{"text":"Your DREAMS really will come true! I first want to write that I have read some of the reviews on this site and do not understand ANY of the negative things said about this resort! We stayed at Dreams April 4-11th. There were 16 people in our group. The reason for our stay was for our wedding ceremony.The bus ride we took from the airport to the resort was about 45 min. It is not as bad as everybody says it is.. it was actually enjoyable seeing the scenery. When we arrived-we were greeted with extremely friendly staff and enjoyed champagne and fresh cookies. Check in was very easy and painless. FOODEverybody in our group loved the food. My favorite was the buffet for breakfast. Everything that you could possibly imagine was there! All of the other food was great as well. POOLThe pool made the resort. It's huge! Even when the resort is at 100% capacity, it never feels crowded. There are plenty of chairs and floaties! MISCGrounds were in perfect shape. Everything was very clean. The scenery is beautiful.WEDDINGMy ceremony there was beautiful. The wedding coordinators think of everything and they take care of everything. It is so stress free. It was the most amazing ceremony! The photographers at the resort take beautiful pics. STAFFThe staff also makes the resort. Everybody is so friendly. Everybody is so willing to help. The entertainment staff works extremely hard and they an incredible job. I cannot say enough great things about this resort. I do not have one single thing that was a disappointment. I have absolutely no negative things to say about this resort.
