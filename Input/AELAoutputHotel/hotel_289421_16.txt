{"text":"Excellent Location\/Perfect Trip I planned a family trip to Madrid to celebrate my husband's birthday. Our daughter flew in from LA to join us on a flight from Newark. Unfortunately for my son in college, he couldn't join us. I checked numerous travel books and read countless reviews to find the best hotel for us in Madrid and I found it. It's excellent location allowed us to walk to Plaza de Santa Ana for the tapas bars, to Prado and other museums, to the Sol, Plaza Mayor, Gran Via and the Opera. We took the metro to Palacio Real and Serrano just for the ride. It is truly a central location and yet you don't have the throngs of pedestrians at your doorstep. It was quiet enough but not too quiet. Tip #1: If you will have an early arrival, email the hotel to request an early check-in. Our room was available in half-hour of checking in. Tip #2: Walk to the Sol and purchase water, soda and snacks at El Corte Ingles supermarket at the basement instead of indulging in treats from the mini-bar. Tip #3: Skip the hotel breakfast for 15 euros. The Cathedral restaurant is on the way to the Sol for a full sit-down breakfast for 5 euros. The Museo del Jamon was great for midnight snacks. The hotel staff may not be the friendliest but they are very helpful. I have been all over Europe all these years and this first trip to Madrid has made it my favorite European city.
