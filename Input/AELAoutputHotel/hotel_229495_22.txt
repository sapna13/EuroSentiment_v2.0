{"text":"Nice hotel but sketchy city and people We stayed in the Marriot in the city center of Amsterdam for two days. We had never been to Amsterdam but have been to The Netherlands several times. We like the places and people so far but Amsterdam was our least favorite and the Marriot had something to do with that.It was hard to get to from the central train station. We walked for at least 45 minuted before we finally got to the hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 11 am and our room wasn't ready yet. No problem for us because we wanted to explore the city. They offered to hold our luggage so we could go out and about. Everything okay so far.When we returned at 3 PM our room wasn't ready still. Eager to freshen-up we inquired how long it was going to take. 15 minutes the staff said so we opted to wait in the reception area. We ended-up standing around for at least 40 minutes because all the local businessmen seem to use the lounge to keep meetings. No one of the staff offered any drinks or otherwise. When the room was finally ready (after asking at least 6 times) we got a key and that was it. We went up to the room and didn't find our luggage there. We called down to the reception and they appologised for not returning it to us. Then they told us to come down to indentify it but never offered us help to get it to our room! How rude! They didn't even have a cart to use.The room was nice and the hotel itself was great, but the people ruin it. It might be an Amsterdam thing because everyone seemed to be rude. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a New Yorker so I'm used to something. But this was out of the ordinary.The upside is the location of the hotel and the breakfast which is nice. But honestly we won't stay here anymore and we won't visit Amsterdam anymore either. Been there, done that. Never again!
