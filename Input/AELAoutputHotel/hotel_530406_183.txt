{"text":"Do not go there!!! My family and I stayed at Ocean Sand, wanting to celebrate my husband√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ 50th birthday. The Ocean Sand Golf and Beach Resort is architecturally beautiful hotel, located at the very close proximity to a long, white sand beach. That would be enough, if guest\/customer services were not so slow and I have to say very incompetent. I feel that the place that I would want to go back to would need to have both even on the average level. In the case of Ocean Sand disproportion between buildings beauty and services that we got was unbearable. To start off with a LANGUAGE BARRIER, more then 90 % of the front line staff DO NOT speak English and it is very difficult to get your message across. Just to illustrate: my son√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ language did not reach his room after 4 telephone calls and waiting in the room for more than 2 hours. I went to speak with someone at the reception and after they gave me run around, the fifth person that I spoke with understood that I lost my key and took me back to reception where I started my search. I found his language left unattended in the lobby area by myself. ACCOMMODATION: My husband and I got a room on the third floor and our children on the first, despite that we were promised adjacent rooms. In our bathroom we did not have hot water, and after it was fixed, the water pressure was so low that I often had to take my shower early in the morning or late at night, not to mention daily calls to homemaking services for towels that were not left in the bathroom. I could go on with things small like this and you can think that I am hard to please person, but those little things on your vacation are important and I did not want to spend time trying to fix jobs that were not properly done. FOOD: Excellent varieties, 5 ala cart restaurant, however every night one or two of them were in recess. When we decided to go to the Italian restaurant (on the exact day of my husband's birthday), we had to wait for our table for more than 30 minutes (you do not need a reservation for any of them). Food in the restaurant was not representation of the typical Italian food. From the food that they had, I chose salmon that I had to return because it had no taste and was dry like a bone. ENTERTEINMENT: I could not resist, but feel that Ocean Sand is under funded for this activity, since the night entertainment was comprised of mixed audience and staff show. We had ONE night of a good show program featuring local dancers representing Dominican Republic culture. I could not understand that a day staff would work hard at night to get audience involved in dancing or some other activities on the stage and provide entertainment for the rest of the audience - I hope I did not confuse you here. One would expect better supprt and more help from hotel managers and\/or supervisor, but anything that we needed did not go any further than give me a 20 minutes, only to never hear back form them. I have to give them a credit, since we were warned about √à√\u2020\u2022? minutes of Dominican time√à√\u2020\u2022?which equates to 30 min Canadian, and it would be funny if we did not need any help from them. Over all, we had a very poor experience staying at this hotel and most likely will NEVER go back and certainly would not recommend it to any of our friends or anyone that we care about.The rest is up to you, and I wish you a good luck if you still decide to go there!
