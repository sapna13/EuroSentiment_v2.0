{"text":"Fantastic Just returned froma hectic two day break in Amsterdam with hubby celebrating his birthday. It was our first time and let me say a big thankyou to all previous reviews about this wonderful vibrant city that helped us make choices about where to stay.We finally decided on the Banks Mansion and it certainly lived up to all your helpful info.We got a great deal on Opodo-much cheaper than the recommended prices, and the free bar was worth the while. It is the only hotel in Amsterdam that offers this service and it saved us a fortune.The hotel is nicely decorated, with tasteful art deco furniture and furnishings (cept the upstairs carpet which was a bit whacky). The beds are really comfy which is very important to us,and the rooms spotlessly clean. Staff were very helpful and friendly but unobtrusive.The hotel enjoys a great location, and very easy to get to and from, tram stops just outside. Also, our concerns about transport were unfounded as Amsterdam has a very good, efficient, fast, cheap and regular system which makes life very easy.everywhere was easy to walk to from this hotel and although we could have got the tram everywhere we enjoyed the canal walks-even in the rain. The shops are lovely, really unusual and it makes a pleasure to see something different, and quality is good. I took a DK mini guide and the recommendations ofr restaurants ect were spot on, namely BOJO's , an inexpensive Indonesian near Leidisplein (think thats how u spell it ) huge portions so share and save. Jordaan area was funky and interesting too.Well its getting longer by the minute so will sign off now, but abs advise you to go and have fun-we did. ","annotations":[]}
