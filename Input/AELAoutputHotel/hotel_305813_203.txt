{"text":"The Reviews Are true!! I chose this hotel based on the reviews from the TripAdvisor.com website. I was not disappointed.Just to be clear, this hotel is not located on Hong Kong Island (the postcard views of the big buildings). It is on the Kowloon side in a neighborhood called Mong Kok. The hotel could not be more convenient though. It is attached to a very modern mall (Langham Place Mall) and you can access the subway (MTR) from this Mall. The MTR will take you into Hong Kong Island (Admiralty stop or Central stop) for HK$ 10.50. The cost of transportation in Hong Kong is very reasonable (e.g. subways and taxis).The hotel is very well appointed and the staff could not be nicer. I was there for 6 days and the level of service stayed very high the entire stay.Make sure you check out the gym\/spa on the 41st floor. The view from the Relaxation Corner is great. You can see the skyline of Kowloon and Hong Kong Island as well as the harbour. Every night at 8:00pm, the buildings on Hong Kong Island put on a light show. It is one of the world's great skyline views.There is a Starbucks and a McDonalds located in the Langham Place mall if you can't seem to leave the US behind. There are also some cool street markets in the neighborhoods around the hotel. You may never eat Chinese food again after visiting these markets, but they are definitely part of the Hong Kong experience.Make sure you take a trip to the South side of Hong Kong Island (Repulse Bay and Stanley). On a clear, sunny day, Stanley seems like Italy or Greece to me.Have a good time and stay at the Langham Place Hotel. You will not be disappointed.
