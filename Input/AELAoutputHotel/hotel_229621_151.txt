{"text":"Charming Hotel, Pleasant Service, Excellent Location! My husband and I just returned from an incredible trip to Paris. It was our first time visiting the romantic city and we had an unforgettable time. For three nights we stayed in a Superior Room at the Splendid Etoile hotel. We enjoyed everything about it. Our room\/bathroom was large and comfortable, the elegant d√ã√\u2022√ñcor was warm and inviting, and the view of the Arc de Triumph from our balcony was amazing! We found the staff and concierge were pleasant and helpful. One morning we asked the concierge for restaurant recommendations for dinner and he happily made us reservations at a wonderful French restaurant down the street called √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºe Petit Colombier.√à√\u2020\u2022?The fixed price menu had great choices and the overall dining experience was excellent. Another appealing feature of the hotel is the convenient location and access to public transportation. There are many taxi stands, RER and Metro locations surrounding the hotel. (We purchased a 3-day Paris Visite pass which granted unlimited travel in Paris using the RER, Metro, and bus systems. This was a great hassle-free way to travel the city.) Also, the Air France Shuttle (20 Euros\/person round trip) is relaxing way to get to and from the airport. The shuttle leaves Charles de Gaulle airport and travels to two locations in downtown Paris. One of the drop off\/ pick-up points is right across the street from the Splendid Etoile.We recommend this hotel to others looking for a Parisian hotel with charm and elegance. We would definitely stay at this hotel again on our next trip to Paris. ","annotations":[]}
