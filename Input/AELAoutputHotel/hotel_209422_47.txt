{"text":"really nice time I stayed at the Hilton Waikiki Price Kuhio over the 4th of July weekend. First, I must say that the Hawaiian people are the most warm and welcoming of any people I've met all over the world. Everyone at the hotel went out of his\/her way to say aloha and to ensure that my stay was wonderful. The hotel is newly a Hilton and completely renovated, however why weren't the hallways air conditioned? The location was very nice. It was only a few blocks from the beach and right in the heart of Waikiki. The plasma TV and all other amenities are great. The bathroom was very hip and modern (I hope you aren't very tall, or you won't fit in the shower). The lobby was great. The front desk never had a line, and although I never ate from the restaurant, the room service (prepared there) was delicious.Now, I am able to overlook almost any minor detail at hotels, but two things stood out to me for which I feel I should comment. The walls are paper-thin. I should have called the front desk to changed rooms, but that's just not my style. I'm just the type to wait it all out all the noise that kept me up until 4:30am. I honestly don't know what you do about noise pollution in a hotel, but for over $250\/night, I didn't want to hear all of that.Secondly, the hotel has no self parking. They charge $25\/night for valet. OK, for a major city, that's not bad. However, for $25\/night I want my car now. The 4 times I went to get my car ranging from 12 noon to 7 pm, it took almost half an hour. The valet parkers were very busy and always appologized, but for $25 a night, I don't want to wait. I think they need to hire more valet, or offer self parking. I arrived at the last minute to the airport from the long wait at the valet.Overall, I think the Hilton Waikiki Prince Kuhio is a very nice Waikiki vacation. All in all, the value for the $ you spend is good. If they could sound-proof the rooms and offer $5\/night self parking, this would have been a perfect vacation.
