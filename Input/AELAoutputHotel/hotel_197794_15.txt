{"text":"This is the best hotel that we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe ever stayed at After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor (and despite a couple of negative ones) we decided to book this hotel. We are so pleased that we did.We stayed there for three nights from the 10th April along with two of our friends. Bi the way we are both male\/female couples who can be very sociable.The hotel is situated along a quiet canal yet only five minutes walk (two minutes if you know the area) from Central Station and five minutes walk from the main red light district. It is very unassuming from the outside, just a gloss black door and the building number on a plaque.We were welcomed by Onno and offered complimentary drinks (most welcome after a long journey) while he checked us in and made us familiar with a couple of hotel rules and what the hotel and Amsterdam had to offer. We were given a front door key as well as a room key each so that we could come and go as we pleased. Visitors are allowed in the rooms but you are responsible for them. Onno showed us to our rooms and helped us with our luggage.We had booked room 31 (√à√\u2020√ü?95 per night) and our friends had booked room 34. Our room was situated at the front of the building with superb views over the canal. It was bright and airy, tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean. It had a King Size bed, 32√à√\u2020\u2022?LCD TV, DVD player and a Stereo Radio\/CD player. There was also a Safe deposit box, Minibar\/Fridge, tea\/coffee making facilities, direct dial telephone and free wireless Internet. I used the Internet quite a bit during the weekend without any connection problems. (There is also a internet accessible laptop in the hotel lobby that you may use. The ensuite bathroom had a bath big enough for two with shower over. In addition to this there was also various fun equipment in the room (we can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ talk explicitly about this here but if you go the the hotels website you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l know what we mean) which we put to good use. Oh, and there aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ many hotels that have a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ülease disturb√à√\u2020\u2022?sign to hang on the door as well as a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≠o not disturb√à√\u2020\u2022?sign. We wish that we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° spent more time in our room.Breakfast was served 10 - 12 during the week and 10 - 1 on Saturdays and Sundays. It was excellent. It consisted of tea or coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice, cold meats and cheese, eggs to order, cereals, fresh fruit, yoghurt, bread rolls and toast, condiments. All served around one large communal table which lead to some intriguing conversations with the other guests.When it was time to checkout, because we had an evening flight Onno said that we were welcome to leave our bags there and collect them later when we needed them.To sum up, rooms spotless, food excellent, lovely relaxed atmosphere and the hosts Onno  J√Å√∫√¢rrich were genuinely welcoming and very friendly. (Perhaps some of the bigger hotels should send their staff here to show them how it should be done.) We look forward to returning.
