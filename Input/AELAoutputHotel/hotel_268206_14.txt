{"text":"ughhhhh -you have got to be kidding where to start:the positive;it is located in an area easy to do some nice shopping ,go to pubs ands restos and the area is enjoyable and charming.cons:the same cannot be said for the surly very sullen staff woman at the desk when there was a problem with our bill and refused to contact the manager -because apparently the manager only works mon-fri -not the weekends,blah blah blah. she was very reluctant and resistant.My oh my was she not a happy camper.to a point its not her fault -she doesnt get paid enough anyway-its really a reflection of the corporation itself.note: basically this is not a 'regular run ' style hotel. think of it as having a landlord who contracts out workers and its being (barely) run like an apartment building. hotel room; scruffy at best ,worn out dingy scratched , holes in the walls due to shelves and wires changed in placement and the staff did not bother to replaster and paint. over.you can hear your neighbors.bathtub was not too clean (helloooooooo- some Javex would santize things)frankly I have stayed at the crappy youth hostel in manhatten and this hotel managed to badly remind me of that experience.at around $160 US dollars a nite that is an expensive reminder.waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpriced for this junk.go to a youth hostel i(except for the one in manhatten -lol )nstead they will be cleaner than this place and feel more luxurious.breakfast -if you got there early enough. decent for what they had on offer.croissants, danishs, bagels.cereals, coffee tea,juice-like stuff. lots of fruits. although the bad part is they had a ' temptation fridge'nice 'dole' brand fruit juices and various yoghurts. it was always locked! could never get one product.very very strange.I was there for a small convention and we used the various rooms there for classes and demos and I will say I did like those rooms and such.they were spacious, sunny ,comfortable. but the place was barely heated .I felt frozen half the time.but overall the 'hotel' feels like 1.it was in its prime and popular over 15 years ago2. it was converted from perhaps an apartment or condo project3. management is not doing good because the staff is really really really showing it.4. for gawds sakes renovate. already!I swear the youth hostels are in way better condition than this place.
