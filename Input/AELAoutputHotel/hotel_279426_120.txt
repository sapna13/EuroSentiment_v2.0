{"text":"Loved it but a bit pricey I stayed at this hotel in September this being my last stop before heading back to the UK. A friend and I managed to get a good deal 3 nights but paying for 2 nights only. We felt the hotel was tastefully decorated and furnished and our room exquisite. We had an honour bar which we did not use.We did not really take advantage of the hotel facilities as we were out sightseeing most of the time and therefore did not use the restaurant and gym. One of the lifts was out of order for the entire 3 nights stay so there was only one working lift which meant you had to wait a while, this wasnt really too much of a problem. The staff all appeared very young but extremely friendly and courteous, a special mention to Anthony the bell man who was helpful when we first arrived. We stayed during Labour Day weekend which meant San Francisco was extremely busy, this coupled with the cooler weather and overcrowded cable cars was quite difficult.The location of the hotel along Geary st is very convenient as it is close to Union Sq the main shopping area with plenty of bars food outlets, clothing and shoe shops. However I felt San Francisco on the whole was extremely expensive and this was reflected in the prices we paid for food, the hotel and travel as compared to other places in California. I probably wouldn't to stay at this hotel again however I had a good experience.
