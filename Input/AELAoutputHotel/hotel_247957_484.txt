{"text":"The beach is amazing but .... I'll start from the beginning, first day got room in building 12, dropped off stuff and down to the beach. Beach is awesome , the nicest beach I've been to yet. Back to room, we find that the power is off. Oh well, took a nap. Wake up couple of hours later, power is still off and it's dark. I had to go to the front desk and get another room as it seems our building is the only one without power. I got another room and was told that it was only for the night. No help to move our stuff. Get new room, toilet constantly runs. Oh well at least it has power. Stuck it out in that room. Maid was a guy and did an ok job of cleaning the room but was always late in the day. Forgot to leave towels one day. Don't use the glasses in the room unless they're wrapped in plastic - the maid washes them in the sink. Use the bottled water to brush your teeth and rinse off the tooth brush too.Food - very good. Never had a problem finding something to eat. Don't eat the mayo - it never gets refrigerated and will give you the trots. Three out of the four of us got sick from the food. It looks better going in than when it comes out. I had to get a shot so I would get better. The doctor is great. (he's also very busy ). Get travel insurance if you're going here. You will need the medical.Nothing ever seems to get fixed when there is a problem here. The same problems I read about here are still happening. Power failure, annoying ,pushy condo sales people. Bad service.No change for large bills. People getting sick.Overall very disappointing and not worth the money. The beach is a 10 but the resort is a 3.Good luck if you decide to go to this one. I'll stick to Cuba. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1695,"mention":"Cuba","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cuban_sandwich"],"startOffset":1691}]}
