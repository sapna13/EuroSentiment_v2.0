{"text":"Thank you singapore The Shangri La Hotel epitomises much of what Singapore has to offer. Great city views, fantastic hospitality, excellent food, lush gardens and perfect business facilities.I wish I could have stayed more than 3 nights in this hotel. My wife and I had booked the cheapest rooms available as we were planning to use the hotel as a base and spend most of our time exploring Singapore. Upon arriving we were very surprised to be taken directly to our room for check-in by a courteous and knowledgeable member of staff, who quickly got the formalities over with; and then helped us with our many queries about Singapore. The room and bathroom were large and had all the ameneties one would expect of a modern 5-star hotel these days. We had a great view of the city and the lush gardens surrounding the hotel. We were so happy with our room we wondered how much better the more expensive rooms could possibly be!The public areas and the huge lobby were decorated in a combination of contemporary and oriental styles. We never had dinner at the hotel, but the breakfast was out of this world, leaving nothing to be desired. You could try something different for many days and still be very full each time. We also had some drinks and snacks by the pool, and like the rest of the hotel the standards were exceptional.I loved the fact that the pool was not gimmicky and was large enough for a proper swim and relative privacy. I took my laptop to the pool one day and was surprised to be able to get free Wifi there. I don't know whose wireless router I was using, but thank you for letting me check my emails!The only problem with the hotel is that because it is in a residential area (a lovely green prestigious neighbourhood by the way), taxis are not as common as the hotels in the commercial districts; and at 'peak times' you can be in for a few minutes' wait.If you've already booked this hotel, don't worry, well done, you've made a great choice.
