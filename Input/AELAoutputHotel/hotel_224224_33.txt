{"text":"Impressive as you expect for a Ritz We stayed in December for a business\/pleasure trip. We traveled with our 3 year old daughter. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful, especially with her. For example, front lobby staff would watch her while I got stroller, etc ready to get out the door.The rooms do see a little dated for a Ritz, however it was very clean and the housekeeping service was great.We stayed in a room that allowed club level access that had a lot of free perks. I highly recommend booking a room with this access. There was food, drinks (water, soda, wine, tea, etc) out all day. This was great with having our 3 year old along. Very easy to stop in for snack on our way out or way in. Each night was tapas with sushi, cavier, etc. Very high end. We normally eat out when in NYC, however since we had our 3 year old we ate the majority of our meals here.The club access also has a conceirge. They were very helpful and knew our names from the first time we stopped in.I also become sick during the trip and the hotel doctor was fantastic. His office is very close or he will make a house call if you are too sick to travel to him. Fortunately, I had an ear infection so it was easy to stop by his office.We are planning on staying at the Ritz again this week and hope for the same wonderful, welcoming experience.On a side note, we stayed at the Peninsula on our prior trip and while as impressive, I did not find the staff as welcoming and our bill was not correct. It took over an hour to fix and there was another couple at the counter with the same problem.
