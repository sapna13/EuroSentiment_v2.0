{"text":"Luxury Under Construction My brother and I stayed at the Renaissance for a few nights following a month of touring across Europe. I used my Marriott Rewards points for the room which would have been otherwise out of our price range. I had read the reviews about the construction, but I chose to stay at the hotel anyway due to its central location. The construction was not really an issue on the interior, however the exterior of the hotel was being worked on when we stayed. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. I felt they went out of their way to be helpful to make up for the construction. Location-wise the Renaissance is in a great spot for touring the city. The Centraal Station, Dam Square, harbour and Red Light District are all easily walkable from the hotel. The concierge was very helpful with directions and maps. We even purchased tickets for the Ann Frank House and a canal tour at the desk, which saved us time and let us avoid the lines. The rooms were amazing! Clean, crisp and bright. I have stayed in several hotels across Europe that are considered 3-star and they would not have met the North American standards for 1-star hotels. The Renaissance was by comparison 6-stars at least. It had all the comforts that a Canadian tourist expects from a hotel; fridge, alarm clock, turn-down service, room service. All or most of these things had been missing from the other hotels we'd stayed in during our trip. All in all, I would stay at the Renaissance again should I have the opportunity and the funds.
