{"text":"Almost splendid My husband and I stayed at the Montebello for 3 nights the week of July 10. The hotel is a short 10 minute walk from the train station and about 15 minutes from the major attractions (Uffizi, Accademia, etc.). This normally would not present a problem but proved challenging during record setting temperatures (high 90s,) and a taxi strike. The hotel was a welcome oasis. We experienced none of the problems with the air conditioning, internet, or flooding mentioned by previous reviews. The staff was wonderful. They reserved the Uffizi and Accademia for us so we did not have to wait in line. The concierge recommended a great restaurant a block or two away, Il Profeta. They serve a GREAT tiramisu! They also pointed us in the direction of a self-serve laundry that was right around the corner. Breakfast was included; however, it was awful! Mostly hard, dry pastries, cereals, one chafing dish with runny eggs and limp bacon. Although a short hike to the city center and shopping, the Montebello is very close to many restaurants and dining options. Take advantage of them. Other nice finds in the vicinity: an internet cafe, small grocery store\/market, a newsstand with english language newspapers. The primary reason I rated this 4 instead of 5 is the room. Beware the rooms in the basement. They are EXTREMELY tiny. Barely large enough for the the two twin beds that were pushed together. The flat screen tv was also very small. The size of a screen on your average laptop. The bathroom, tiny and poorly designed. I'm 5'9, medium build. When sitting on the toilet, my knees were almost touching the facing wall and I had to reach about 3 feet for the toilet tissue. The shower is open i.e. no door; and because it was under the stairs, the ceiling sloped and narrowed. My husband is 6'1 and could barely stand upright in the shower. Also, because the shower head is facing the outer room, you could not turn on the water without it spraying all over the bathroom. After realizing this we took baths for the remainder of our stay. I would stay here again; however, I would request another room.
