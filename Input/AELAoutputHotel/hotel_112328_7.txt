{"text":"Nice on the surface - but everything than professional or reliable Being a Guest @ the Clift of San Francisco gives you great first impression - nice and stylish lobby with sofas made from \/decorated with ivory teeth (Is that being allowed to be imported into the U.S.?).The room consits of cool designed interiors with added mirros - infinity style - so don√à?√¨t stay in there too long you my get dizzy ;-)They Serve Breakfast - dishes start @ around 25$ - the lame Continental Buffet is @ 30$ way to expensive - way tooooooo!Room Service is alway plus a lot of additional charges - not just the Tip.Valet Parking!!!It√à?√¨s a unbelivable 65,-- US$ per Night.Valet Parking is lame - I have waited a couple of times more than 30 Minutes for my ride.Restaurant and Bar are nice - lots of shiny people hanging out there - but as experienced - just get rid of their overdose in the lobby - honestly - we came back from a nice dinner and two guys were vomiting over the whole nice lobby - my wife will never go to the Clift again.Go there for a drink, Party or Dinner but never think of staying there to enjoy San Francisco or a business trip.Btw. Business - Internet access is 14,50$ thats fair - but the bandwith is maybe 28.8 Modem Century - absolutely unacceptable.Staff is friendly - but that only helps a bit - we celebrated my birthday - and expected a little message by the management - but nothing appeared.Sorry for this review - but be warned - we will never choose them again - there are way better options - like the W and other nice Places.S.F.
