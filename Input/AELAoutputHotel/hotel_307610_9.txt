{"text":"Disappointing stay We have just returned from a week in Bali, during which we stayed at Padma Bali for just one night at the Deluxe Chalet.When we arrived at noon, our room wasn't ready yet, which was expected, so we walked around to check out the pool and the beach. Beach access was close by, pool was huge and packed.When we were brought to our Deluxe Chalet, it reeked like cigarette. It's almost as if I was in a lounge\/pub before smoking was banned. We notified reception right away and they sent someone to come and spray our room with air freshener. The guy suggested we stay in the balcony while the air con circulates the air freshener sprayed room. After half an hour, the room still smelled bad, but it was a little bit better, the pillow cases were saturated with cigarette smell, so we called front desk. They did politely apologize that the hotel is fully booked, so they recommended sending the air freshener guy again. At that point, any suggestion sounded promising. Almost as soon as we hung up, my boyfriend stepped on a big wet spot on the floor next to the bed, turned out the air con was leaking! We were both laughing so hard because it was quite a ridiculous situation. So I called reception again, they said they'd send someone soon. I kindly reminded her that we were the stinky room too so it was easier for her to send people. She apologized again. The maintenance guy came with a ladder and knew what to do right away so I'm guessing that the air con leakage is a recurring problem. He brought air freshener too! We left for the beach while he was fixing up the place and when we came back we were happy to see dry floor and a bottle of air freshener left in the room for us. We sprayed again for the 3rd time since the cigarette smell was still quite apparent. Ironically there was a 'do not smoke' sign right at the front door knob.The pool opened until 9pm, we went for a swim at 8pm and it was really nice then. Only 5 other people around, the pool bar was still open, you can order a drink and swim around under the stars while waiting for your drink. Indeed the pool at night was more appealing than at day time. We went to the main restaurant for dinner after some pool time, by then the buffet was closed, so we just ordered 2 dishes and 2 drinks. My Oolong Tea came in a can and my boyfriend ordered a glass of ice lemon tea. That ice lemon tea was responsible for his stomach problem for the rest of the trip. We suspect it's the bad ice in the drink. His upset stomach remained for a week since then. Overall we were disappointed with Padma Bali because of the all the great reviews here. Maybe it was just our bad luck with the smoky room\/leaky air con\/bad ice. I hope it doesn't happen to you.
