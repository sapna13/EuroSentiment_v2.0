{"text":"Ola - Barcelo Bavaro Palace!! March 2008 - Our family just returned from the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. We really enjoyed our March Break vacation. This trip was the first time I booked through Travelocity . We found the hotel and grounds very clean and well maintained. Our room was spacious (for 4 people) complete with a large bathroom area and separate bath\/toilet area. Very good hot water for showers. Note: do not drink tap water and they provide bottled water in the rooms. Good ceiling fan and air conditioning in the room. Our room faced a lovely garden area. Bar fridge in room stocked with beer, Coke products and bottled water. (Tiles in bathroom shower area needed some attention.) Dining: There are numerous restaurants to choose from at the Palace. La Pina was great for lunch. Fresh fish, beef and chicken are grilled before you. The produce was fresh and crisp. There were cute 'grass huts' to sit under, nice tables and no floors....just sand!! The view was perfect - palm trees, white sand and gorgeous blue\/aqua water. The Dominican restaurant was very good - it showcased Dominican food except the portions was at lunch were huge. The large buffet restaurant served breakfast, lunch and dinner - lots of variety - they had made to order omelets, pasta. If you stay at the Palace, you can dine at the other Barcelo hotels. Our family enjoyed the Italian Restaurant at the Beach Hotel. The Mexican was okay. We did not try the French or Spanish Restaurants - there was a charge to eat there. Drinks: Great!! The bar by the pool was very fun. Activities: The entertainment staff by day were great - to include kids and adults. They had smiles on their faces and danced spontaneously. They had different contests for the appropriate age levels. There was: tennis, volley ball, bocce ball, sandcastle making for kids, dance lessons, etc. We enjoyed the use of the Laser and Hobie sailboats, windsurfers and kayaks. We enjoyed the pool and\/or the ocean complete with palm trees for shade. The beach is very clean and great for walking.... you can walk\/run for miles. We rented Segways by the Casino. These are motorized stand-up scooters. The hour ride was plenty. The US dollar is the currency of choice. Note: I cashed a traveler's cheque at the front desk was given pesos, not US dollars. The safe in the room was a plus and easy to use. Be prepared to try to speak Spanish! English is hit and miss. There were little shops down the beach - hair braiding, henna tattoos, jewelry, t-shirts, etc. Be prepared to haggle...they all want you to visit their 'shop'. We went on a snorkeling excursion and the fish were fabulous. Note: Bring bread in a plastic water bottle to attract the fish. The Barvaro Beach was invaded by spring break young people...I recommend the Palace for families and couples.
