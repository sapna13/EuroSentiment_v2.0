{"text":"Caution on the food Lovely, lovely resort, pool, staff. We had a marvelous honeymoon suite (my husband  I of 20 years and our 14 year old) in #7 bldg. I guess a newer one of the buildings. No problem with room. Maids are awesome. Teen club was perfect for our teen to hang, play wii, pool, ping pong, dance, etc...To balance this however was the fact that we all got terribly sick starting 4-5 days into the trip. My daughter is a vegetarian and did fine - she even ate salads and drank the water in the restaurants, ate fruit and drank non-alcoholic drinks so our MD was thinking E.Coli infection. Never been sicker. Missed work for 3 days on our return and was put on anti-biotics. IF you go - please tip - these guys make a small salary and a dollar to them is huge.By the way - this Dominican resort posts No Topless around the resort. Also, we couldn't really swim - the waves were ridiculously rough and random sharp rocks made for a dangerous combo but the pool more than makes up for it. Also, Gustav was passing overhead. Only rained 2 days for 20 min each day but was overcast pretty much 5 of the 7 days which was OK. (I'm light-skinned). My husband did the $100 deep sea fishing trip - didn't catch anything (they sell dramamine in the pharmacia in the hotel)- also had to laugh...they had viagra too.The boys in El Patio were a riot - silly bunch - like to laugh and joke. Japanese habachi not worth the trouble for us - good food but quite the hassel to get in.
