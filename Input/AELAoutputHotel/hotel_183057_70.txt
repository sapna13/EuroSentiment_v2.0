{"text":"Nice suite hotel in a good location I stayed at this hotel while attending a large meeting at the Conference Centre. While the conference provided buses from this and other hotels, it was more efficient to do the 15-20 minute walk back and forth. This walk, incidentally, can be done underground and inside buildings the whole way if you are there during bad weather. It is not the most convenient hotel for the Conference Centre but definitely convenient to what appears to be the Times Square of Toronto, the area near Queen and Yonge, where there is the best shopping and other tourist venues. It is close to the Hockey Hall of Fame and a reasonable walk to the theater district. I did not experience any of the problems some other reviewers complained about. I believe this hotel has undergone substantial renovation recently. My room was immaculate, the bed quite comfortable, the two TVs fine, and no odor of smoke and certainly no mold. The check-in was quick and service friendly. I did not find the elevators particularly slow. Though I was above the 10th floor but below the more expensive rooms at the top of the building, there was some unadvoidable traffic noise from the street, but not too bothersome. I was on the street side of the hotel away from the neighboring building. Those who hate all noise can ask to have the trade-off of being in a quieter room on the side next to the neighboring building. The view on the street side is not all that nice anyway--just some city streets--so you aren't missing much if you get the blocked view some others have mentioned. Others complained about the small lobby--so what? Who wants to spend time in the lobby when there is a nice suite to spend time in? I'd rather the hotel spend its money on the rooms than a fancy lobby that one is likely just to pass through. There is a nice large hot tub and a small fitness center on the top floor, I for one prefer this to a pool anyway. The breakfast room is too small to handle all the guests if the hotel is full, and to compensate for this you can ask to have free delivery of breakfast to your room, a clever way for the hotel to get around this problem. Breakfast was okay, fairly standard fare. The Eaton Centre has a nice market where you can buy take-out food to heat in your room's microwave and store in the refrigerator for an evening you want to relax inside the suite. Parking is an extra $16; across the street was a cheaper parking lot, but I preferred the safety of my car inside a garage. I am a very experienced traveler and have had rooms as nice as this one elsewhere. I was satisfied with everything but the price and the fact that internet was an extra $10 for 24 hrs rather than being included. Our conference organization did not do a very good job negotiating prices with any of the Toronto hotels; I could have gotten a better price by calling the hotel directly instead of booking through the conference at what was supposedly good rates. I would stay here at another trip to Toronto if I could get a good price on this hotel (though if I was attending a conference, I'd aim to be closer to the Centre next time; those hotels were already booked, however).
