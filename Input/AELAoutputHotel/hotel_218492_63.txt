{"text":"Would not recommend to anyone The arrival was smooth, got to our rooms quickly and then the horror began. We were with 6, 3 couples each in seperate rooms. I think after 5 minutes in our rooms we were already back out asking each other if their room was just as bad. In 1 room the airco didn't work, the bed was broken. In the others the door off the dressing closet fell off and in room nr 3 the door jammed so bad you had to force yourself to get inside. Bathrooms were very outdated and rust everywhere. Also in the block on the opposite side off the road they were upgrading the rooms so you could hear construction works going on all day. Complaining at the front desk didn't work so the next day our travel agent had to arrange new rooms which luckely enough were not 20 years old.In the restaurants the personnel hardly speaks english and the service is terrible. Mistakes in drinks ordered, tables not fully decked out so you had to take knives or forks from other tables to make yours complete. Asking for coffee resulted in a 10 minute wait which made you think they forgot. If you arrived a bit late for breakfast a lot off tables were dirty so you had to scrape together clean stuff from different tables to make your own, the staff just didn't know what to do, food on the floor was not picked up, we watched 9 waiters walk by a pizza on the floor before someone finally picked it up.Every 2 days a complete market was setup around the swimming pool with salesmen pulling your arms and really annoying you when you just wanted to get a drink from the bar. Bartenders were unfriendly and they just looked like they hated their job. Toilets beside the pool were horrible, in the men's room from the 6 toilets 5 were just filled with fecies, like they were not cleaned in weeks. We went to our rooms every time we needed to go. It seems since the name changed from Sunscape to Grand Oasis everything started to go wrong.We just got home yesterday 29\/07\/2008 and I had the worst holiday in more then 10 years, money not wel spent.
