{"text":"Awesome Resort Great Resort! This place was amazing! One of the best vacations I've ever had and I've traveled all over the world and have stayed at many nice resorts, plus I live in paradise in Florida so great review is something special! As for Restaurants you have to make all dinner reservations when you arrive. As for Breakfast  Lunch: Mirador is outside and very casual, El Caribeno is in inside and air conditioned both have great food, a little more upscale. For dinner...must try Romantico...super nice candlelite dinner. This is the only restaurant that requires a dress code, ie: kakais pants and a polo shirt are fine for guys...dress shirt and tie is not required. Very Romantic and a must for one of your nights. Bamboo is a great Japanese Restaurants with Teppanyaki (that's where they prepare the food right in front of you at a table, what a great show) or you can do the sushi buffett. In between Romantico and Bamboo is an awesome Martini Bar, go there before your reservation and have a cocktail. They make great martinis...I heard great things about Avocado which is a American Steakhouse that may guests raved about as well, though I didn't have enough days to check out. All the drinks were top shelf...and since you're in Puerto Rico you need to try some Rum Drinks, try the Rum Punch at the pool and Mojitos are delicious. Don Q and Barcardi are the Puerto Rican Rum Favorites. If you get the basic room you will be so pleased, we had a king bed and it was huge...all rooms are suites. This was my 3rd vist to Puerto Rico and I would go back in a heartbeat. I didn't do any Spa Services but heard they were execellent. This is a great place to visit on a honeymoon, anniversary, or just a get away and even with babies\/kids. And if anyone is getting married there...wow you'll love it, they have beautiful area for a ceremony. Enjoy your stay.
