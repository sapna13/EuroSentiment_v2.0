{"text":"Love this hotel! This hotel was a 100% pleasant surprise. From the mixed reviews, I was a bit nervous after booking -- could not have been more pleased with the place. When you first arrive - don't be surprised that it's in a street that seems more like an alley (it was my first time in Barcelona and apparently many of the streets are like this). The staff is exceptional -- every last person treats you as if you're in a 5-star, white-glove hotel. Stefano at the front desk is especially helpful and has great restaurant suggestions.The rooms are not strange in the least - they're incredibly practical and perfect for a business traveler who likes boutique style and doesn't take themselves too seriously (it's definitely not your grandma's hotel :) Good bed. Excellent size safe for laptops. Wireless and wired Internet. Marvelous shower and good towels. Terrific lighting in the bathroom and nice details, like a vanity area. The separate, private lounge across the hall is a small and comfortable space that is perfect if you need to work in your room - feels like you have a little ready-made office. The little cafe room downstairs that's open all day and fully included in your stay is a nice touch. Best moment ... I was late down for breakfast one day and they had just closed the breakfast room. Instead of turning me away, they said they could make me a continental breakfast ... I thought that in itself was very nice and hoped for a croissant and a cup of coffee. But they brought out so much food - one plate of breads, another of pastries, then cheeses, then meats, then sliced fruits ... just beautiful. That was the type of service I experienced from the moment I arrived until the moment I left.I wish I'd like the rest of Barcelona that much. Hopefully, Camper will open other hotels (maybe Paris or London?) so that I can stay more often ...
