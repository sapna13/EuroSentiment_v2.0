{"text":"Great Location - But nothing to rave about I bypassed a number of hotels suggested by my travel agent based on the reviews posted by tripadvisor members. I selected the Santa Maria Novella Hotel because of all of the rave reviews about the location, level of service and overall quality of the hotel rooms. While the location was superb, this hotel definately wasn't worth raving about.My earlier travels to Europe had set my expectations of the hotel. In general European hotels tend to be one star behind, in additon to being smaller and more minimalist in room aminities in comparison to American hotels. Santa Maria Novella was no exception. Overall the hotel itself was decent except for the persistent smell of rotting trash we encountered every day on our hotel floor. The room size was typical as was the comfort level of the beds. The marbel adorning the bathroom was rather nice, but nothing spectacular. The breakfast was fine, offering both Italian as well as American options to choose from. These were the highlights. Here are the lowlights:We arrived to a cold reception from a dark-haired, olive-skinned gentleman working behind the desk (I specify only because, I never got his name and he was the only dark-haired man working behind the desk during our stay). He was perhaps the unfriendliest of them all. When we arrived to check in, we inquired about area tours. Our trip to Italy would only be four days and we wanted to maximize our stay. He pulled out a tour booklet for CAF tours and a map of Florence, slapped them on the desk in front of us and sent us on our way. No offer to advise us on the best tours, or any additional information. We ended up using the map to find the tour company office and walking over there to book for ourselves.A day or two later, we encoutered him again, and asked about our options for booking transportation and a tour for a day trip to Rome. He pointed arbitrarily across the square and said go over there, under the arches and someone there can help you book something. I'm sure we weren't the first guests to ask about tour options to other cities, so I find it hard to believe that he didn't have any additional information. Later that day one of his colleagues, a woman, provided a little more info, but still wasn't very helpful. She provided a more approximate location of over there, under the arches and the name of the place. After asking some other American tourists visiting the area (who had received more info and assistance from their respective hotels) we were able to piece together a great day trip for ourselves. We hopped on the Eurostar train to Rome and kind of played it by ear. Despite the obstacles, we still managed to have a fantastic trip. Was this hotel horrible? No. Would I rave about it? No. It was centrally located and generally clean. However, nothing at all to rave about. Although, I can't forget about the exceptionally friendly Giorgio, a bellboy who did best he could to help us when the front desk staff wouldn't.
