{"text":"Awesome!!!!! Hello All,All right, better late than never!!!! I have been meaning to post this for a month and I am finally getting around to it. It has been on my conscience because I read every word of every review every posted on this resort and feel I could bring something to others looking for some info. Im going to do this a little different than prev reviews cause it does get somewhat repetitive. Here we go. Food awesome. Service awesome. Room awesome. Resort awesome. Get the idea? It really is great all around. Now that that is out of the way here are a few less published facts and tips.You do not need a power adaptor. We bought one and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ need it. All of our stuff (hair dryer, camera, laptop etc. all worked off the electrical plugs in the room.Laptop does fit in the safe. I have a Gateway 2 yrs old and not small by any means. If you have a normal size laptop it should fit fine. No concerns with bringing it. Resort felt very safe. Safe if free also.Learn a little Spanish or get a pocket Spanish-English dictionary. The girls were all about this before we left and I though it was a waste of time. But at 3pm when you are all drunk trying to explain something to your new best friend the bartender, It is almost impossible. We ended up drawing pictures and using hand gestures to figure out that Andy lives in Santa Domingo, and is going home in a couple days to see his son and wife.Tipping is something you always hear about. Everyone asking to please tip cause they are soooo poor. Here is my take. The same people get all the tip money. The same bartenders, all the maids, and serving staff. We tipped very well to everyone, but in retrospect I wish we had of given a larger percentage to the people that don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see allot of tip. (the gardener, busboy and the less traffic bars.) I really believe that the maids and popular bar tenders do a great job and deserve a good tip, but these people are really coining it. I bet you that they make up to 10 times there salary in tips. The guy that keeps the grounds in such beautiful shape may see a tip a week. Do as you please that is just my take.Premium drinks are hiding. If you get in with the bartenders, you will drink like a king all week. A good tip early, and some conversation with the bar tender go a long way. World famous Nelson at the pool bar is really great. Everyday, all day, I was at the pool bar and we had a great relationship. When I would walk by the bar on the way to the beach or somewhere and I would hear a whistle from 200 yrds away. Look over and there is Nelson arms in the air as if to say √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬Æhere do you think you are going, get over here and have a drink with me.√à√\u2020\u2022?As soon as my toes hit the pool Nelson had a big smile a wave and my drink was started while 3 others were waiting to order a drink. If the bartender likes you, you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to ask for the good stuff. You just get it!!! Lots and Lots of BOOBS!!!!! Like it or not, I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ care, but there is no way around it. I think it has something to do with adults only resort. The good, the Bad and the Ugly!!! From 18yrs old to 70 yrs old. Some really beautiful girls too!!! Sorry honey. A la Carte√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ no reservation and unlimited visits. This is a real bonus. You could literally eat at all 4 every night. Grab a group of new friends and visit the Fondu restaurant. It was great.Drink water not just booze!!! One of our group got dehydrated and passed out. Off to the medical center on the resort (which is as good as any clinic in Canada!!!!) Into an ambulance (which is not a donkey and wagon) and off to the hospital, I.V. in arm. They said the hospital and service was world class. $1600 later she will drink more water next time. Luckily she had insurance through work.This is starting to drag on. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l end this now. Hope this helps. Hello to all our new friend√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√ºou know who you are. Hope to see you all at the weddings next yr. JB ","annotations":[]}
