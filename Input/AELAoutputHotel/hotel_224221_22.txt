{"text":"Wonderful Hotel We stayed at the Library for seven nights in late October. It is an amazing hotel that well deserves its high rating in Trip Advisor.As others have observed, the location is very central and provides great access to restaurants, Times Square and other sights. Staying at the Library is different from staying at a regular hotel. It felt more like a like homely club. This is because of the friendliness of the staff and the extras you rarely get from a hotel: the complimentary breakfast and wine tasting\/ nuts\/ cheese in the evening were fantastic; tea and coffee can be made at any time of the day in the dining area, so the American convention of not providing an in room electric kettle was not a problem;  small touches, such as the handwritten weather forecasts with the evening bed turn down, were really appreciated and helpful.Our room was the largest available (Junior Suite) and quite roomy enough. The room and bathroom were beautifully appointed. It did have one disadvantage - it faced Madison Avenue, so was probably noisier than other rooms (which fronted the quieter 41st Street). We quickly worked out that, by leaving the air conditioning on overnight, the traffic noise was pretty much blocked out.Our only gripe was that we were unable to pay for the accommodation in advance. As the Australian dollar plummeted from about 98 US cents when we booked the room to 65 cents when we stayed, this was a problem! But leaving this aside, the Library Hotel is strongly recommended as a wonderful place to escape in New York.
