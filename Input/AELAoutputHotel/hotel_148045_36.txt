{"text":"Not For Beach Lovers We stayed at this resort for four nights in June. Myself, husband  15 year old daughter.Pros: beautiful views from most areas of the resort; lots of shopping, dining, activities. Especially liked the Godiva chocolate shop - it made for a great dessert stop in the evenings. The rooms are large, recently renovated, well-equipped. Las Brisas breakfast buffet was excellent and the view fantastic! We also ate at the Italian and Japanese tepanyaki restaurants - both were very good, although expensive. Food at Iguana's on Palomino Island was just average, but it came quickly even when they were very busy. Service in general was good - friendly, helpful employees. Lastly, we thought the Cocqui waterpark area was beautiful. There is an infinity edge pool right near the ocean that we really liked. Much nicer than the pools in the main part of the resort. Even though there were lots of kids around, it seemed more peaceful. Rides were limited, but fun. I would definitely recommend it, especially for those with younger children. Cons: Of course, very expensive, but we expected that. I don't feel we got too bad a deal because we did an American Express package that included 1 free night, breakfast for two each morning  one-day Cocqui waterpark passes for each of us. We also stopped  bought some food  beer, wine, etc, so that we wouldn't always be buying the $10 drinks. (which were very good, by the way, especially on Palomino Island.)The poor quality of the pools  beach areas were my main objection. Be aware that the main pool areas are very shallow (like 3-4 feet), so not very good for adults to swim in. The water was also very warm  a bit cloudy. Having a pool at home - I know what it means when the water gets cloudy - something's growing in there that you don't want! Also, there were areas where the columns  tile around the pool areas were crumbling. Bit surprising considering how nicely maintained the rooms were. There were two hot tubs - but one wasn't heated at all. Oh - and if you have any physical disabilities - DO NOT stay here - for some reason, they can't seem to keep the elevators in working order. Biggest negative was Palomino Island - it's fine if you just want to sit in the chair  enjoy the scenery. However, almost no swimmable areas, lots of rock  seagrass as others have said. I've been to lots of other Caribbean resorts that dredge out swimming areas - for what this resort charges - they could afford to do that. We are also into snorkeling  found that to be poor. We also wanted to rent waverunners √à√\u2020\u2022?but the rental stand was never staffed. And you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ walk around the island coastline very far, either. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ mostly rocky along the shore except for the one beach area. The resort has really only developed a small area of the island, the rest is undeveloped scrub brush. Last negative - it is rather isolated - this didn't bother us for the first three days -there's enough to do for that long, but by the 4th day my daughter  I were ready to go somewhere a little more lively. The only evening entertainment is dining  the casino.To sum up √à√\u2020\u2022?if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e looking for an upscale Caribbean resort similar to what you would find on other islands √à√\u2020\u2022?like Bahamas or Virgin Islands √à√\u2020\u2022?this won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ compare. We went because we wanted to hike the rain forest  swim in the Biobay (both excellent, by the way!). But if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e looking for a beach vacation, this isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ it.
