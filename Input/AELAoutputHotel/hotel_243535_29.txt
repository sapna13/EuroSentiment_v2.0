{"text":"Great location for short stay, a little bit on the noisy side... Stayed here for one night prior to an Alaskan cruise from SF in mid May. Weather was nice in the high 60's-70's Hotel is conveniently located short 5 minutes walk from BART ( less than $10 pp) Powell exit, though we took shuttle (Lorrie, about $30 for 2) from airport since we got 3 big piece of luggages, didnt want to lug them around even for 1 block.Hotel is centrally located closed to Union Square  across from Parc 55 which I also stayed years ago, a different class of hotel. Since this is just for 1 night and per TA recommendation I though I gave it a try. Hotel reception is fine, staff are friendly and efficient. I didnt need much help from them since I've been to SF many times but they are there when one does need help.Stayed on the 3rd floor, room was slightly stuffy when first entered which immediately opening the window helped since there was cool breeze. Kept window opened all night and a fan in the room helped circulate air, so no problem there. Only problem is for the night we were in, there were some night owls on the street making strange noises, plus some garbage truck or street cleaning vehicle were making noises that was kind of annoying but can get used to it. For those who are noise sensitive can be a problem.As others have mentioned, free continental breakfast on 5th floor and free internet use on 3rd floor. Within 10 to 15 minutes walk, one can cover Union Square, Westfield Mall, Chinatown, access to cable cars, buses, BART etc. A fine 2-3 stars hotel that cost us about $145 (tax and fee included).Also if one likes Chinese food, Tian Sing is in the same building on ground floor. I understand one of the chefs from Yang Sing (which I've been to few times) opened this one. They are both quite good for dim sum.
