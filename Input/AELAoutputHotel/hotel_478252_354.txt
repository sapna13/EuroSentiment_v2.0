{"text":"Very relaxing vacation Just returned from a week at this resort √à√\u2020\u2022?Jan. 17 √à√\u2020\u2022?24. We stayed here before in January 2005 in building 2 which is right on the beach and had a wonderful vacation. This year when we booked we asked for an upper room close to the beach and got a ground floor in Bavaro Primier which is about as far from the beach as possible. I was a bit disappointed but I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not one to make a big fuss over things. As it turned out, the Primier area is very nice. It is like a mini resort. It has it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ own pool, large and very quiet with swim up bar, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ own buffet restaurant and snack bar, 2 of the a la carte restaurants and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ own small lobby. Since we went on this vacation to rest, we actually enjoyed the area very much. It was just a 5 minute tram ride to the beach.The weather was cloudy and rainy for the first few days so we just sat around the pool and relaxed. When we finally got to the beach, we found it very overcrowded down by the water. There were always enough lounge chairs on the beach but we liked to stay back under a palapa and the beautiful palm trees. My husband enjoyed the volleyball which seemed to go on continuously all day. The only place I ever felt crowded was on the beach next to the water and at the beach snack bar. I found absolutely no problem with the service although we only ever tipped our maid and the waiters in the a la cartes. We found that everyone bent over backwards to serve us no matter if at the bar or buffet or even the tram drivers and all tried to use a little English. You must remember that there are a lot of Europeans staying there so it is not just English these waiters have to learn but German, French, Italian, Russian etc.We went to 3 restaurants and had no trouble booking for 7 pm. We first went to the Dominican restaurant. It is actually an open air snack bar through the day just around the corner from our room. The food was amazing. I had a white fish cooked in coconut milk that just melted in my mouth. I should have asked for another serving!The Mediteranian was also good. It was more √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√\u2020ourmet√à√\u2020\u2022?type and the food was again excellent. My husband had √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢he best steak he has ever eaten√à√\u2020\u2022?and my chicken was amazing as well.Our third choice was the Japanese. I was slightly disappointed in it. At the Japanese restaurant we went to last year in Mexico, the cook put on a wonderful show and we were even offered saki to drink Not so here. The cook just stood there and cooked √à√\u2020\u2022?very little √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºhow√à√\u2020\u2022? the vegetables were over cooked and everything had way too much salt on it. But the sushi and soup were very good. The bed was hard but we liked it that way. We got both thin and plump pillows so we had a choice. The rooms were cleaned to my satisfaction and the sheets were changed twice through the week. One day the maid forgot to leave towels and another day she forgot to leave water. A quick call to our lobby got both items in under 10 minutes. We got a few bites. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ pretty sure these bugs are called √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≤o see-ums√à√\u2020\u2022?because you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see them but you sure feel them. But I only got about 4 bites. One year in the Bahamas my legs were absolutely covered with bites so this wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really bad in comparison.Any other problems we had were airport related and these bothered us far more than any little problems at the resort.If you like a small intimate resort, do not go to Bahia Principe. This might not be a 5 star if you are comparing it to Hawaii but it is's one of the best in D.R. We have travelled extensively in the Carabean and from our experience we always say if you could take a 5 star resort from Mexico and put it on the beach in Punta Cana you would probably have a close to perfect resort.
