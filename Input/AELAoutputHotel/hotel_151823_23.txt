{"text":"Not the Intercontinental, But Better Than Advertised I spent four days at the San Juan Beach Hotel in late January. Before making the trip I read any number of reviews of the property. Some of the criticisms I read were valid, but several were not.LOCATION: The hotel is a twenty-minute cab ride from the international airport during rush hour. It is in the middle of a tourism zone that is heavily policed. Unless you are a total couch potato you can walk along the Atlantic shore to Old San Juan in forty-five minutes. While there is no beach of which one can speak at the hotel property, there are two within a quarter mile, one on the Atlantic and the other at the entrance to Condado Lagoon.COMMON AREAS: The carpet in the hallways leaves much to be desired. The restaurant is closed, and there does not seem to be any renovation taking place. The lobby, the bar area, and the breakfast area are all clean and comfortable, but they are by no means posh. The pool area is clean and well policed. The pool is not large, but it is well maintained. Only one of the two elevators was in service, but it was more than adequate to serve the number of guest the hotel can accomodate.AMENITIES: There aren't many on sight. There is a health club east of the facility that sells daily memberships. There are restaurants in the immediate vicinity, but none on the property. Breakfast is continental.ROOMS: I stayed in a double room. The room was large by any standard. The room was clean. The bedspreads were worn. The mattress was a bit soft for my taste, but definitely up to mid-range standard. I saw and smelled less rust and mold than I have come to expect from mid-range beach hotels in Florida. The bathroom sink drained slowly so I fixed it (Room 810 if it matters to you). New linens arrived during my stay.STAFF: The staff was as friendly and cooperative as one could ask. Even housekeeping was pleasant and attentive. The general manager and the desk clerk made sure we had access to all of the attractions the island has to offer, even arranging special transportation when needed.CONCLUSION: The hotel has been under new management for roughly nine months, and the results are beginning to show. There are better hotels in the area, but this has to be one of the best bargains. Unless you intend to spend your entire stay in your room, or unless your idea of a basic hotel is the Omni, this place is worth a look.
