{"text":"Beautiful, stylish hotel Let me make this clear from the start, Hotel 1898 is not cheap. However, it is gorgeous. It is very stylish and chic without being all trendy and aloof! The reception staff were very helpful every time we spoke with them. They provided lots of eating recommendations and had three or four books worth of menus and pictures to help choose. The only issue was with the staff at the roof top bar who didn't seem very keen to come over and get you more drinks (although we could have gone up and got them ourselves if we weren't lounging on the big sofas in the sun!).We had a deluxe room which had it's own balcony. That was a definite advantage and we ate breakfast there each morning (although we did buy our own from the supermarket a few doors down rather than pay the 19 euros each the hotel wanted). The bathroom was a reasonable size with a lovely deep bath, and a huge shower head. Also the room was very clean and was serviced well each day.The food in the restaurant was superb and the service extremely friendly. The complimentary appetizer was delicious, and the other courses were just as good. It was the nicest restaurant we ate at although we were a bit unorganised at booking other restaurants - which is advisable if you want to go to a top level restaurant, we missed out on one promising venue because they were jam packed all evening. After reading other people's comments about the noise level from La Rambla we were a bit worried about being able to sleep. But there was no noise issue with our sound proofed room (which of course won't work if you open the window - there's no need as the room was very well air conditioned!). We slept soundly each night in the huge bed which you can customise with the pillow menu!
