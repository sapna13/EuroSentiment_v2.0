{"text":"brilliant hotel. We stayed at this hotel in agust of 2006 for a week on our honeymoon. On arrival we were presented with a glass of sparkly cava very nice and our room was upgraded free of charge to a suite seeing as we were honeymooners, excellent touch! the breakfasts are brilliant and cater for all tastes.didn't eat in the hotel in the evening instead ventured down to the seafront and there is an excellent italian restaurant and chinese down there all reasonably priced infact dirt cheap! the hotel bar prices are excellent and as for the staff coule not have rated them highly enough they were really friendly and couldnot do enough for you. the outdoor pool was great and ideal if you are on a short break and we used the indoor facilites at the spa once but agree it is a little pricey they could offer better deals for long term stay etc. this is the only fault we could fine, the rooms are spotlessly clean and all in all it is a brilliant hotel. Location excellent nice and quiet at night but not too far from the city centre, we took the metro about a 5mins walk to the station. We are going back to the hotel in 2 weeks 6th march for my husbands 40th for a couple of days and looking forward to it. All in all can't rate this hotel highly enough. if you are looking for a friendly place to stay that's cheap and spotlessly clean hers's your place! some would say it's not that cheap but come on for what you're getting it is a steal. the h10 barcelona is the place to stay, we love it so much we have joined there h10 hotel club and intend to go back at least twice every year if not more and later in the year we are taking our kids too. book it you won't be disappointed!
