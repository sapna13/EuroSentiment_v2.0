{"text":"What a gem! We were very happy with our stay at the Orchard. Based on tripadvisorreviews, we booked a 6-night stay at the Orchard at the end of March.We got a very reasonable rate ($135\/night) from the hotel website using our good old-fashioned AAA discount. We could not have been more pleased with the hotel. The location is fantastic. It's set a couple of blocks north of Union Square, giving you easy and quick access to Union Square, the Financial District, Chinatown, and the Embarcadero. Even though the hotel is in the middle of everything, it's located on a relatively calm, quiet street. It definitely feels like going home to walk up the short hill away from Union Square to the hotel. There's also a small grocery store on the same block where you can pick up snacks and anything you forgot from home.Inside, the hotel is very nicely appointed. Check-in at the marble-tiled lobby was smooth and quick. The rooms are clean, bright, and fresh. The beds are very big and comfortable, with soft white sheetsand fluffy comforters. The bathroom in our room was bright with clean, white tiles, and lots of Aveda bath products. High speed Internet is included, but unfortunately our room (on the 7th floor) did not have wireless. The complimentary breakfast buffet was a fantastic way to start the day. We took the newspaper that was delivered to our door down to the restaurant and enjoyed their freshly brewed coffee, toast, jams, cereal, fresh fruit, bagels, and juices every morning. The Orchard caters to a range of different groups of people. It is a great option for couples looking for a romantic weekend, business people wanting close access to downtown, and families with older children wanting a nice place to stay on vacation. We will definitelystay at The Orchard again next time we are in San Francisco!
