{"text":"Big and Brash - But we loved it! We stayed at Star City for six nights, having been recommended the aparttments by some friends. It's a huge entertainment complex close to Darling Harbour. We arrived very early (around 6am in the morning) but despite this unearthly hour the reception desk were very helpful and checked us into our apartment straightaway. Even if this hadn't been possible we could have used the pool and leisure complex to get freshened up after our long flight.We were staying at the apartments with our three daughters, aged 8, 14 and 16 and there was loads of space. We had two bedrooms and two bathrooms with a bed settee in the living area. The kitchen was really really well equipped with everything we could possibly have needed - and all the utensils and cooker, hob, fridge freezer etc looked brand new. The swimming pool was a slight disappointment in that it was quite small and very cold! However, we were so busy that we didn't need to use it more than once anyway!We couldn't have been more pleased with the apartment itself - although it wasn't especially cheap. I think we paid around √ä√£¬¢1250 for 6 nights. Although it felt slightly out on a limb - transport links to the hotel were fantastic. It was a five minute walk to Darling harbour - where there are scores of restaurants, bars, shops and attractions and of course ferries to Circular Quay...Although we were aware of the casino when we came downstairs we were never bothered by any noise from this or any of the many bars and restaurants in the complex itself. If you're expecting beautiful views of Sydney's amazing harbourside you'll have to pay a premium. And if you're wanting cosy and personal service - forget it! But this was just what we as a family of five needed. And we loved it.
