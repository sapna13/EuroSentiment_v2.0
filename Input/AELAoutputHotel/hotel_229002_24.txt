{"text":"Beautiful hotel I paid over $350 a night to stay in a single room. The hotel was not bustling at all. I was disappointed that I couldn't be upgraded to a double room given the fact the hotel was far from busy. The hotel lobby, bar and rooms are impressive. The service is just okay. I wouldn't say I felt welcomed each time I came back to the hotel, nor was there that personal attention for someone such as myself travelling on my own. You can definitely come and go in this hotel and not talk to anyone. The breakfast was very good but I was disappointed with their bread selection (after all, this is Florence!) but the selection was more than adequate. The room when I arrived still had hairs in the shower and the sink, all the more reason to be annoyed with the hotel as I had specifically treated myself to a 5 star hotel at the end of my 2 week, 4 city, vacation and this room was the least clean of all my hotels. The bathroom was very small. My room was on the ground floor and pretty noisy. And, out of all my other hotels who offered free wireless, this one had to charge 14 euros each day for internet access. The hotel only had one restaurant really close by, as in around the corner, and overpriced. There were no gelato shops or shopping right outside the door. The closest attraction was the bus terminal and the duomo about a 10- 15 minute walk. I would suggest staying closer to the city center. The staff really wasn't that helpful or courteous but they weren't rude by any means either. I felt since I was staying in a single room, they didn't feel the need to provide the level of service I am often used to when travelling for work and pleasure.
