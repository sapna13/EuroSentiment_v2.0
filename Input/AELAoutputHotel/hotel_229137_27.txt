{"text":"Perfect location We booked this hotel for a romantic weekend in Amsterdam. Though normally too expensive, we managed to wait for a hot deal whith reduced price. And a hot deal it certainly was.Besides of it's very romantic atmosphre the hotel has one major benefit, namely the location. In one word: super. Walking from the Amsterdam Central Station to the hotel takes 10 minutes because it's only a few hundred meters away. The Keizersgracht, were the hotel is lying, is in the middle of old Amsterdam. Whatever you want to do or see, most of it can be done walking from the hotel or by channel taxi-boat. This last option is a wonderful way of travelling through Amsterdam, check it yourself. It has a stop near by the hotel. We stayed 3 days in Amsterdam (and got the Gay Pride Parade as an amusing and exciting extra) and wandered for hours through cosy streets along the channels and did two very long channel trips which has lovely views. Also the visit at the Zoo was nice. We spent the evenings at Leidseplein, Central Station area and the famous Walletjes in the Red District. There's a lot of very good restaurants and caf√ã√\u2022√ñ's in all kind of styles, so all of you will find something to your taste. The Rembrandt Museum, the Anne Frank House and all of those famous spots are very near by.Our hotel room was very nice, tidy and quiet. It had a romantic and authentic touch to it and all kind of services were available.The hotel staff was exceptionally kind and helpful and they were able to give smart and solid advise on all kind of things concerning Amsterdam.Allthough breakfast had to be paid as an extra, it hads all we needed and wanted. Meat, fish, vegetables and fruits, dairy, everything was fresh. Coffee and tea were also really OK.If you ever want to travel to Amsterdam and experience the romantic inner city, this hotel is one of your best options.
