{"text":"Not bad after all The San Juan actually grew on us over five days. I scoured the reviews and decided that the negative reviews of this one weren't worse than negative reviews elsewhere (especially for the money). With that in mind we didn't go in with high expectations and wound up having a great time. It's not exactly a honeymoon haven, but it was great for three women on a budget ($80\/night). The major con is that the bathroom wasn't that clean when we checked in, nor did it proceed to sparkle even after tipping housekeeping daily. It could have been a lot worse, but a few mysterious hairs here and there make you wonder when it was last scrubbed down. Also, the water pressure was weak--manageable, but noticeably weak. The pool is kind of a waste of space, but who goes to South Beach to sit at a hotel pool?Other than that, it was perfect for what we were looking for: a cheap place to crash in a convenient location. The beds were comfortable enough. The room itself wasn't huge but big enough to spread out, and the mini-fridge was a big help. It was nice to relax on the porch with a beer and people watch between the beach and the bars. The staff was pleasant. We never felt unsafe, completely grossed out, or otherwise uncomfortable. I would definitely recommend the San Juan to budget travelers in need of a decent place to crash, and we would definitely return next time. ","annotations":[]}
