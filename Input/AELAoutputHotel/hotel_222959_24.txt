{"text":"A nice change of pace A group of friends and I who travel to New York annually to reunite, relax, and see a show or two decided to forego our usual digs in MIdtown\/Time Square and camp out at the Ritz Carlton Battery Park. We booked club level rooms (only one of our rooms got upgraded to bay view after the first night) through American Express Platinum Travel. We were very pleased with the service, food presentations, and accomodations on that floor. Yes, there was the carpet stain here or there and no in-room coffee as discussed by previous reviewers, but all in all, compared to other crackerbox NYC rooms, this one was just fine. The view, once we were moved to a bayside view, was fantastic. The staff throughout the hotel were genuinely kind and greeted us at every chance possible. We also had two children (7 and 10) with us on this trip in one of the rooms, and at no time did the staff treat us differently. I had one issue with the front desk staff not handling our check-in correctly. I specifically called several days ahead and gave explicit instructions regarding not charging my friends who were to check in earlier than me (it was a birthday surprise). I was told that it would be taken care of and no problem in typical Ritz fashion. Although they completely flubbed this up, my stay from that point on was nice enough that I let it slide. The location is out of the way if you're new to the city and want to concentrate on the Midtown and Uptown touristy things. If you're not scared of trains and taxis to get up that way, I'd definitely recommend this Ritz Carlton. Oh, and ask for Raquel if you're on the club level. She was the epitomy of Ritz Carlton's commitment to service.
