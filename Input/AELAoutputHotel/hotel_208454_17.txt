{"text":"Ideal base in New York Just back from a 4 night stay at the Sofitel and enjoyed it. We stayed in room 2021, the bed was so comfortable and the bathroom had a large shower. The only down side was that we booked a smoking room and had that confirmed in an email but when we arrived no smoking rooms were available so they said that although our room was officially non smoking they would send us up an ashtray, and despite that and also asking the chambermaid twice, no ashtray ever arrived over the 4 days that we stayed but it did not detract from our stay.As others have said the hotel is in a great location being only 2 blocks from Broadway. As we were only on the 20th floor we overlooked the roofs and back walls of other hotels but did have a great view of the Chrysler Building which looks brilliant at night when it is lit up.Others have mentioned the Red Flame diner as being good, the food is very good and it is only about 100 yards from the hotel, turn right when leaving the hotel.Another good place for breakfast is Ellens Starlight Diner on Broadway, about 51st Street and Broadway I think.For dinner and drinks try the St Andrews bar, again turn right when leaving the hotel and it is 1 block down and on the left, the food is very good and they have English beers on tap and a mind boggling array of whiskey.Overall we enjoyed the stay and Vladimir on the concierge desk was very helpful, pleasant and knowledgeable. All other staff were pleasant and when we left the doorman got us a great deal on the trip to Newark airport by getting us a Lincoln town car, a nice little touch of luxury, and it cost $15 dollars less than the yellow taxi that we got from Newark to the hotel when we arrived.
