{"text":"Came for the (nonexistent) view, loved everything else We really enjoyed our stay here, although not for the reasons I expected.Lured by the prospect of a view of Luxembourg Garden, I booked a standard room (all with views overlooking the gardens, according to their web site). Once there, I saw that the view consists of the back of the Senate building and some very tall trees. Possibly the rooms on the top floors might see something of more interest, but the only standard room then available, on the first floor above ground level, offered not much besides traffic noise, from two directions. Just as well, then, that the hotel had upgraded us to a superior room, on the same level but facing the picturesque side street, with minor traffic noise that was tolerable except for the morning trash collection.But never mind all that. Our stay was pleasant from start to finish, beginning with the staff's cordiality during the discussion and inspection of room alternatives.(Recommendation: Ask for a high floor room when you make your reservation.)Our superior room was large for Paris, and beautifully traditionally furnished. The bathroom had classic marble styling but a modern tub\/shower with a constant temperature control that really worked, and separate faucets for the rainforest shower and the telephone showerhead.We were quite happy with the selection of delicious fresh French breads and rolls, one of the delights of morning in Paris, so we never tried to order an egg dish for an extra couple of euro. Others have noted that the selection doesn't compare to an international hotel buffet, but it was fine for us. The weekend server provided French cafe au lait, but the weekday lady, who spoke little English, brought us weaker American style coffee even when asked for cafe au lait.The location, across from the gardens and near many restaurants, was fine for dining, great for strolling in the gardens, and a pleasant five minutes walk to the student quarter and fifteen to the touristy area near the Seine. So we got to enjoy restaurants frequented by locals, in a very nice neighborhood, with no t-shirt shops or tourist trap restaurants (but an easy walk to them if desired). I am convinced that almost every hotel in Paris is three or four blocks from a Metro station, not closer, and this one was no exception.For a pleasant, comfortable visit to Paris, this hotel is ideal.
