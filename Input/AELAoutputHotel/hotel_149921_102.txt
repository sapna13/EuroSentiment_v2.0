{"text":"Wish i had stayed longer Just spent a few days there and I had a pleasant experience from the time i arrived until the time i left. Will definitetly go back if i find a good deal on rooms as the hotel can be pricey.The grounds were beautiful, the pool was immaculate, the breakfast buffet was well stocked and varied. I went to Morton's steakhouse for dinner as well and even stepped into the starbucks for breakfast on another day. I wish i had had time to try out the spa!I love the open air lobby and my only inconvenience was that my room had two double beds and the one bed closest to the mini fridge had to be moved away in order to open the fridge. My room overlooked new construction unfortunatetly, so what would have been a nice view of the water, is now a parking lot and a new tower. I got construction noise around 9am or so but nothing too bad. I'd sleep with the balcony door open and had no outside noise all night so that was great (from either the cars or the villas guests that i faced. I even got to use the business center to print my boarding pass and the guy at the desk was helpful and very courteous. There is a gelato place on the corner at the entrance of the hotel with a subways and around the corner was the bus stop heading into old san juan for just 75 cents. (exact change only).
