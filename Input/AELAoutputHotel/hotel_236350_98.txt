{"text":"Overall Okay - but faced serious customer service challenges I stayed at the Sofitel St. James this past April for a long weekend after being in south England on business. As this was my first time in London (other then flying in and out) I choose the Sofitel based on the reviews from this site and I have to say that overall I was pleased with my stay. The location is wonderful, the rooms are exceedingly comfortable (I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think hotel bathrooms get better then this!) and the staff is pleasant and helpful √à√\u2020\u2022?I should know! I do however have a slight bone to pick with them. My check-in proved to be a nightmare! After arriving at around 10am (much earlier then the posted check-in time) much to my pleasant surprise a room was available and I handed the very pleasant woman behind the reception counter my credit card and that my friends is where the troubles begin. While trying to pre-authorize my stay their system declined my credit card, I explained to the receptionist that this is impossible, please try again, and she did √à√\u2020\u2022?declined again, ultimately she tried three time, three times their system declined my card. I finally handed her my personal bank card and after declining that two times their system finally accepted it on the third attempt after breaking down the room nights. Now stay with me here because that now totals 6 attempts by the hotel on two different cards at around 1400.00USD per attempt. I finally made it up to my room and after getting settled I got on the phone with my credit card company to try and resolve the issue and they tell me that they see the transactions and all the transactions have been approved, the Sofitel has now charged (are holding) me 3 times on my credit card and 2.5 times on my personal bank card! Their system was wrong. I make it back down to reception and try to explain what my credit card company has told me and request that they release the excess charges. You would think that this would be a simple matter for a hotel such as the Sofitel √à√\u2020\u2022?45min later it proved that it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ so simple. Ultimately I was on their phone in reception for the better part of an hour bouncing back and forth between my card companies, the Sofitel receptionist and their VISA vendor trying to explain to the Sofitel that the charges had been approved, even supplying the approval codes to no avail. FINALLY √à√\u2020\u2022?after much headache the problems were thought to be resolved and I was able to go on about my evening. This is where I feel they dropped the ball a little bit: I understand that technology has it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ glitches and things don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ always run smoothly but the problem was not with my cards, it was with their system, and after fighting this for much longer then the hotel or I cared to did they offer a bar credit to buy me a drink? Maybe comp a breakfast? Did they offer any kind of extension of service that showed that they truly regretted the inconvience I faced upon check-in? NOPE!! While I was not looking for a hand out, some token of appreciation for my patience as a valued customer would have spoke volumes! I must take a moment and say to the credit of their staff that the young women behind the counter during this nightmare was very helpful (given the fact that she was just as frustrated as I was). Fast forward a few days and upon my check-out I was assured that all matters had been resolved, the correct card had been charged (I had asked them to remove my personal card from the file after all had been sorted with my credit card) and it had only been charged once. Wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ that have been nice!I get home back to the States only to find out that they have charged my personal bank card once and my credit card twice. To try and make an already long story short it took multiple conversations and faxes and emails over months to finally remedy the situation and never once did I get anything more then a haphazard apology tag line on the bottom of an email. And while yes, I do believe that a sincere voiced apology can be more then sufficient (maybe a phone call guys?), when you are in the service business and you stumble to this degree sometimes a little extra bit will go a long way to ensure repeat business, especially in such a competitive business as London hotels go.
