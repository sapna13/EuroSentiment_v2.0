{"text":"H2O fine, weird smell\/air We arrived with a request for a room away from stairs and the elevator (cuz the noise usually keeps me up all night), the staff was incredibly nice and helpful. They 'upgraded' our room, which based on other reviews meant we got a room with a partition :-D The shuttle\/ free mini-van rides to downtown was in operation (please, show some courtesy and tip the drivers). We also tried the grocery store and the local metro bus. It was so great the bus is free from the stop closest to the hotel on Route 16 throughout downtown, so once you've parked your car at the CS you don't really need to pay to park downtown and deal with getting yourself lost on the confusing streets. I think they generally tried to follow a grid design but some parts are just darn confusing to the OOT (out of town).We had no water pressure problems we thought the shower\/tub was actually a really nice size. There were 2 main problems we had: the air in the place had a weird smell the entire stay. It was like a budget-priced imitation vanilla-scented cleaner was used throughout. Waking up each morning we had a pretty awful taste in our mouths that we did not experience elsewhere, incl at home nor the hotel we subsequently stayed at in Portland. The other issue was that there is no dresser, just a tiny closet, so no unpacking. We would stay here again, but maybe only after we bring an electronic air-cleaner for our room.
