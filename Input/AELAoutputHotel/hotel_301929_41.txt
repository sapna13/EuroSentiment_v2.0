{"text":"My experience with Nikko Bali I stayed 10 days (02.-12.06.2007.) at Nikko Bali Hotel and I have to say that this is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever seen. The hotel itself is located on the cliff overlooking Indian Ocean, scenery around hotel is breathtaking, ocean views and panoramas are beautiful and, most importantly, the staff is extremely professional, kind and polite. The rooms are spacious and the breakfast is excellent. Hotel has 5-6 connected swimming pools and hotel beach is also very good, although for less experience swimmers hotel pool is better solution due to strong and unpredictable ocean waves. There are also some shortcomings. Hotel is located in the isolated part of the Nusa Dua area which is good for security reasons but bad because the village of Nusa Dua is accessible only with taxi. The prices of food and beverages are much higher (average dinner is about 350.000 IDR or EUR 30) then in neighboring Nusa Dua or Kuta. Since we were staying 10 days we had discount of 20% on all food and beverages that we consumed but we had to emphasize that every time (sometimes even more than once) when we were signing bills for consumed FB. Since there is high percentage of moisture in the air the room furniture has soaked up the moisture and therefore there is a bit unpleasant smell in the room. The room was very clean but it needs serious refurnishing. The bathroom, although not very dirty was not clean as it should be in a 5 star hotel. But those are all minor shortcomings and I can say that I had excellent time in Nikko and would return again in the same hotel if I were to go to Bali again. ","annotations":[]}
