{"text":"Great Resort We stayed here from November 13 to the 20th. The resort itself was very beautiful and clean. It was huge but there are cart buggys that make circles around the resort and help you get where you are going. The food. Everything tasted great and all. The choices were quite vast. We ate all but the Platinum resteraunt and I have to say that the service was slow. Some of the waiters were forgetful and the portions were too small. The appetizer for the seven of us was 6 small cocktail shrimp in the Japanese resteraunt. We waited much too long for our desserts which were spoon sized. Needless to say, all of us were releaved when we ate at the buffet in the main lobby on the last day. I hate to be one of the food complainers but count me in as one of the ones that got sick from the food. I am pretty sure that it was the meat. I had an upset stomach for a lot of the trip and a mild fever for one of the days. The beach. Not much to add. It was beautiful and everything you can expect for a beach from paradise. The weather. Not really part of the resort, but I was worried when I noticed that it was supposed to rain showers the whole time that we were there. There were only a couple showers throughout the whole week during the day. Each lasting no more than 10 minutes. An exception was when a huge storm hit on around Nov. 17-18 when it was beginning to get dark. The mini hurricane lasted for a couple hours, bringing with it the loudest thounder I have ever heard. One time it came so close to the beach that it literally made everyone jump 2-4 feet. Remember, mostly those who have something to complain about write these things, so don't let this be representative of everyone views that went there. I am not going to go there again simply because I don't like going to the same place twice. I missed the place the moment I shut the door for the last time.Have an incredible time! ","annotations":[]}
