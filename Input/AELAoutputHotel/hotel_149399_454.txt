{"text":"Some of the good, Some of the bad We just returned from our trip yesterday and wanted to write before I forgot. It is helpful to have some opinions of others. Our stay in the DR was average. The weather was just perfect, with a constant light breeze. Not a drop of rain! First of all if you are with kids, it becomes difficult. There are alot of families, so very kid friendly. So big that you or the kids could become lost just going to the bathroom. Forget about it if you have to leave the beach for a drink, your not coming back for awhile. We stayed in Royal Service, worth the money. Can't imagine the service without it. The service is the worst that we have every experienced. The language barrier is terrible. If you don't speak Spanish, your in trouble. It is not a requirement to speak English or another language. Nobody ever has a smile on their face, it was if you were a bother to them. We ate breakfast in the same place every morning, and everyday it took 30 minutes just for a cup of coffee. If you wanted something, you needed to get it yourself. (That was with Royal Service) Don't wear anything but flats, walking off your food is no problem. All you did was walk. They had a tram, but between the fumes in your face and the pace of about 1 mile an hour, you were better off walking. So all that food and drinking, not one pound of weight on. Over all I will not go to the DR again, definitely not the Melia Caribe. Depending on your standards is how I recommend this resort. High standards don't even consider. I am not bitter about my trip, just disappointed in the resort.
