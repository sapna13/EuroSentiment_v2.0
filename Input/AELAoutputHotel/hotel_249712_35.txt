{"text":"Do not confuse the Westin with the Wynn or the Wyndham Do not confuse the Westin with the Wynn or Wyndhamhotels, the Westin is not as nice as the others. This hotelis located in the crowded Times Square area. I had hopedfor it to be a few blocks from the madness, but it is rightin the middle of it all....the tourists, the glitzy signage, andall...the hotel itself was nice but uninspiring....and overpriced.I was told that my room was a special upgrade with a viewof the city and river. It was nice but some of the details such assloppy workmanship (poor caulking in the bathroom, poor trim around the baseboard, cheesy table with worn velcro) and city smells inside were noticeable. I was a solo travelerand my room rate was $429 per night plus tax, so for onlytwo nights my cost was just over $1000! The internet chargeis about $18 per night, or you can pay as you go in their business center off the lobby starting at $6.95 for 15 minutes.If you like being in the middle of the craziness, just one block from Times Square and one block from the Port Authority, then this hotel is for you. The hotel restaurant, Shula's, is famous for their steak (minimum $55) and also serves an expensivebreakfast and lunch. Their are plenty of reasonably priced cafes and walk in restaurants (Cafe Europa, Ben  Jerry's) nearby.I also stayed at the Hilton Mid-town, 1335 Ave of the Americas,during this trip, and I believe it is a better value than the Westin($100 cheaper per night, great location, better service, beautifulrooms on the 33rd floor, wonderful quality inside air for a city hotel).
