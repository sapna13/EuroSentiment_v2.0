{"text":"Fantastic base for New York stay! Just back this morning from our first trip to New York and 5 days in The Casablanca.We've had a really fantastic time and my feet are absolutely killing me... handy tip take VERY comfortable shoes and use the subway, the 'little' walks soon add up and take their toll.The Casablanca is a perfect base, literally just off Times Sq, subway just round the corner and within walking distance of most of the big attractions, Chrysler Building, Grand Central Station and Empire State building.Really friendly staff who would happily do anything with a smile. The free cheese and wine in the evening is a real social base for catching up with other visitors and their hot tips. There's also free internet access for booking tickets and checking in for flight back etc,If I was being really picky the bed was smaller than I expected in America but it stood up to any European City, was exceptionally clean, comfy bathrobes and even had complimentary DVD's available for when the days walking the sights had taken their toll. (Breakfast at Tiffany's has a whole different outlook when you've just been there!)Tony's restaurant next door is amazing. It's family style dining so you order a dish and it comes on a big platter and serves 2-3! Fantastic atmosphere and really great food. You can also order it in for room service. I've spent 33 years researching cheesecake and I can honestly say that their NY cheesecake is the best I've ever tasted!I'd really recommend the Casablanca and we'll definitely stay here again next time.Couple of other tips - if you'd like to visit the Statue of Liberty monument inside you can only do that through prebooked tickets - I did it through the Statue cruises website before I went over. It also meant only queuing for the security check and not tickets too. Ellis island is great and the audio tour really helps.When it comes to the Empire State building I had prebooked tickets but the queue was so big we decided to upgrade to the Express Pass. It would have been cheaper to do this online but it was so worth doing I would recommend it! The queue was outside and about 3 hours to get to top. Express pass meant we were there in about 5 minutes. When you have so many other things to do it's not great to spend it queuing.All in all a great city and I can't wait to go back!
