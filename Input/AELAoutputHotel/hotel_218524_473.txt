{"text":"Very Nice for a Quiet Vacation We just returned from a week long stay at Excellence. Overall it was very nice. We may go back but it was not, IMHO, one of those vacations where you immediately say that you just have to return. It was VERY NICE, but just too laid back. I think I saw more books being read than on any other vacation I have been on, and we travel 2 times every year for the last 25+ years.Here's my opinion on some aspects of the resort:Faciliites- very clean and well maintained. Restaurants- good to very good food. Never had to wait more than 10 minutes for our group of 8. We did have to split up into 2 groups to eat at the French Restaurant (even though they never did use all the tables). Be prepared to spend 2 hours or more for your dinner. They really take their time in bringing out the courses.Pools- very nice, especially the large pool. We did have one day where there was a LOT of debris floating on top of the pool. It was pretty nasty. For some reason they did not skim the pool the previous night. The cascade pool was deserted most of the week. Just a few people sitting around reading books.Bars-- Conveniently located all around the resort. Good variety of alcohol including Bud, Bud Light, MGD and of course Presidente (which is actually very good). I am a tequila drinker, and I would have liked to see a better variety. Cuervo, to me is not a premium tequila, but that was the best they had.Shows- For resort shows they were quite entertaining. It was not a waste of time going, and with nothing else to do in the evening, I was a good fun night outRooms- large and very comfortable. We did have power issues virtually every day. The power did go out daily, but it was not an inconvenience, except for the day that everyone was washing up for dinner. The resort was probably at 1\/2 capacity during our stay, and that included about 30-40 people from New York that came because it was srping break. (they did not come together).
