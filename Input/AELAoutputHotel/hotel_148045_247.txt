{"text":"Save your Money - Find another resort - We just returned from 6 days on the resort. While it was nice to be on vacation, the resort was not worth the money. At $500 per night, there are many places that you can stay that are cleaner, newer and more high end.A couple of points:- We were lucky to be in the new renovated rooms. The room was clean and refreshing. The bed was great and the bathroom was very large. A cheap shower curtain and a ripped couch were the only issues with the room. It was in appropiate that they charge a 25% hotel tax for the renoviated rooms. They did not advise it at check in.- The food was terrible and overpiced. Every place you ate, the menu was the same. - Fine Dinning - The resort has 3 high end restuarants for dinner only. The food was good, but everthing was 2x what should have been charged. - Grounds - The resort is beautifully located on the cliffs, but without easy acess to a beach, made for a major disappointment. The private island is not that great. You have to wait for a ferry, which only runs on the 1\/2 hour and the ride is about 15 minutes. After all the dealing, it is not worth it. Because of the inconvience, we only went to the island one time and spend all the time at the pool. The island was not that great. - The trams - you have to take a tram down to the lower part of the resort. Most of the time that we were there, one of the trams was broken. Everyday we spent about 30 minutes waiting in line for the tram.- Activities - the pricing to snorkel, fish, sail, etc. were so over inflated, that we did not spend the money.- The Golden Door Spa- We really enjoyed the treatments and the staff were fantastic. The spa seemed to not fit in with the resort since it was so much nicer than any spots on the resort. The only negative about the spa is that it was SO EXPENSIVE. But once you are at this resort, you are looknig for some relief from your overpriced reality. ","annotations":[]}
