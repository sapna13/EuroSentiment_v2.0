{"text":"Fantastic Hotel, extremely helpful staff Stayed at this hotel 7th-9th January. Rooms provided everything we needed, very clean and smart. Great views from balcony. Great bathroom with fantastic power shower. Staff were extremely helpful with all the questions we asked and there were plenty!. In great location, 30mins and a 22 euro taxi from airport. Metro and bus route just around corner, most sights within walking distance. You will be walking alot, but there are lots alternatives. Recommend buying tegeta ticket-6.4 euros-gives 10 trips on either metro or bus, can use for as many people as you like , just put card thru bus\/metro machine for as many people are travelling. Also Touristica bus good,@ 20 euros, 3 routes-red,yellow and green, u can get listing of route on barcelona web page or plenty info given at hotel. Went for 40th birthday and 30th, extremely recommend eating at La Crema Canela, good choice for vegetarians and meat eaters alike which our group of people had both-address Madoz, 6-just off La Ramblas. Fantastic seasonal choice Starters @4euros\/Main @ 8-10euros. Also great vegetarian restaurant is Sesamo and Organic Orgasmic. If you go into the market just off La ramblas 'La Boquera' there is a stand there for Organic Orgasmic-great stand up food, and they will tell you how to get to restaurant-all veggie and organic, we had huge meal for 8euros each! Definitely go see Casa Batlo, and make sure you get lift up to top, and visit La Sagradia Familia and do the same-all Gaudi's work, jaw droppingly amazing. Weather was great while we were there, like a sunny day here. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1340,"mention":"veggie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Veggie_burger"],"startOffset":1334}]}
