{"text":"Excellence blew me away! Spent five nights at the Excellence Punta Cana from December 21-26 2008. My only previous all inclusive stay in the Dominican was at the Bavaro Princess, and let me say, there really is no comparison.From the moment you arrive from the airport, you can sense the decadence. The resort grounds are in perfect shape, and the smaller size - at least by mega resort standards - makes getting around the resort simple. We were in room 3101, and quickly realized that upgrading to an Excellence Club, swim up, or ocean view room really isn't needed. That said, while spending most of our time at the Cascade Pool, we figured on a return trip a swim up room would be a nice indulgence.The rooms are spacious and beautiful. The minibar was stocked daily and very cold! The bed was firm as indicated in prior reviews, but that's exactly how I like it.We spent most days at the Cascade Pool, which is nice and has a secluded feeling. Never a problem getting a chair, towel or floatee. The beach was nice, and the waves made boogie boarding quite fun. And let me say, the absence of kids makes enjoying the pool and the beach that much easier.On to the food. What better way to start each morning than room service breakfast in bed? It was great not having to head down to the buffet in the morning. The room service was quick and tasty, and whenever I asked if I could customize my breakfast, the answer was, of course!.Now, I know that lots of people fret about the food in these resorts. Let me say, we LOVED it. Here is a quick synopsis of the food we tried:The Grill: Perhaps our favourite. Ate the grilled Mahi Mahi and the Mahi Mahi baguette for lunch most days, and instantly looked forward to it the next day. Perfect spot for lunch.Spice: Tried the grouper fillet on night one (a little salty) and the shrimp Pad Thai. Nothing like the Pad Thai we have at home, but delicious nonetheless. The seafood soup appetizer is also great, but I would skip the sushi next time around.Toscana: Very nice for dinner, but the lunch buffet was not my thing. I prefer to stay away from buffets whenever possible.Chez Isabelle: Wow! You really feel like you are in a 5* restaurant here. I had the Nicoise salad and the Sea Bass, and it was incredible.Lobster House: As others have pointed out, a bit of a letdown. Not bad, but not great either.As for the drinks, the selection of wine is impressive, and as all have said, the Coco Locos, served in a fresh coconut, are something I will be dreaming about for a while.We met several couples that have been going to the EPC for years and it is easy to see why. After our trip to the Bavaro Princess we were eager to see what other resorts have to offer - that curiosity is now gone - ALL future trips to the Dominican will be for return visits to the Excellence Punta Cana - a true first class resort!
