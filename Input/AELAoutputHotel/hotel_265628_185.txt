{"text":"You will enjoy this place We have just returned (24th April 2007) from the Sirenis Tropical after a 2 week holiday staying in P block. Here is what I have to say:Firstly you need to remember that this is a third world country with a tropical climate and the native language is Spanish. With a tropical climate comes tropical inserts and wildlife. It does not hurt to learn a few simple Spanish words\/phrases such as √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022?lease√à√\u2020\u2022?and √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022√¶hank You√à√\u2020\u2022? Trust me it helps and its polite.Grounds: Well maintained and very nice even after a two hour downpour the gardeners were out cleaning up the leaves. They were always cutting down coconuts and would provide you with one or several if you asked, nicely and paid a small tip.Rooms: They were clean and tidy and must have the best air con I have ever known whilst on holiday. It was just like walking into a fridge.Food: Variety was good, although I have to laugh at one translation, which read √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022?igs Meat√à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022?it was pork. We only tried the Mexican, Italian and Steak House restaurants but we preferred to eat in the Buffet. There is no problem booking into the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022√¶hemed√à√\u2020\u2022?restaurants. Staff: What can I say? The buffet\/restaurant staff always ensured you had a full glass of iced cold water or alcoholic drink and they were very friendly. A BIG mention must go to the entertainment staff. They were great. If you go to this resort try and meet Henry or Jensy and just mention the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022?azy Alcoholic English√à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022?that is how we were known. Daniel at the pool bar and Antonio in the Lobby Bar also need a good mention. All we did was tip them when we started drinking and tipped them when we finished. It was not much to us but believe me these guys\/gals are not paid as much and you and me. Even so you will never see one member of staff without a smile on their face.Bars: Juan on the Beach Bar Grill kept us entertained all the time. Your glass will never be empty. Can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ remember the name of the drink but it was something like √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬ßamajoanna.√à√\u2020\u2022?Try the all the Cocktails (not in one night), there are great.Entertainment: Day time brilliant, you may be asked to join in darts, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√Ütretchie strechie√à√\u2020\u2022?water polo etc but if you say no they will not harass you further. As mentioned above Henry will have you in stitches with his wigs etc. We did not see any of the nighttime entertainment in the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022¬Æntertainment Theatre√à√\u2020\u2022?but we did partake in the Saturday night Bingo. The Lobby bar had singers on each night with songs from all nationalities.Beach: Great, plenty of sunbeds and clean. Pool: Best one I have ever been in. Summary: It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ that good we are also planning to get married there in April 2008. We also met a couple that were staying there for the third year on the trot, so it can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be all that bad as some have mentioned. The only downside is that some guests forgot to pack their manners. If you go you will soon find out which nationality I am referring to.And lastly don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think too much about the negative reports on this review site, this resort is ace.
