{"text":"A wonderful surprise I decided to stay at the Sheraton Amsterdam Airport Hotel at the end of my sister and my month-long excursion through Germany and the the Netherlands. Our flight left at 8:45, so we dreaded having to leave from the Roemer Hotel in Amsterdam at some ungodly hour. We stayed in a regular twin room for only 150 Euros. I knew before arriving that it was a bargain, but the surprise was the hotel itself. The Sheratons outside of the US are certainly a much better class of hotel. The service was friendly, efficient and attentive. Access to the business centre to use the computers was very easy. The room was large, well-decorated, and the bathroom has a separate shower and tub. The public areas were bright, open and modern. The view from the glass elevator was dramatic. The hotel had a very nice feel. We had a choice of the the second floor lounge and restaurant or the main floor bar for dinner. We chose the bar, which had fabulous food and great service. I felt sorry for all the suits who were huddled together talking or sitting eating their solitary meals. If that is their lot in life, then at least the hotel fed and sheltered them very well. Our previous Amsterdam hotel was four times the price and gave us not much better of an experience. If you're staying in a business-style hotel in the city, and even if you're not, the Sheraton Airport is worth seriously considering; it's an easy 10-minute train ride away from the central station, and you get tremendous value for your money. I'm not sure what the previous reviewer was talking about when she\/he discussed the restaurants. The Mezzanine contains both a lounge and large restaurant which serves a breakfast. I've stayed many times in Club Level Rooms, but at this hotel, if you're on your own dime, I wouldn't bother, since the standard rooms and level of service is excellent.
