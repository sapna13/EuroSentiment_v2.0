{"text":"A Wonderful Stay at the Shiba Park Hotel Our family of five just returned from a wonderful trip to Japan (Tokyo and Kyoto). In Tokyo we stayed a total of nine nights at the Shiba Park Hotel. The staff there is very courteous and their english is very good. We had no problems at all with regards to communication. Services including safe deposit boxes and foreign currency exchange were right there, no need to go to a bank. The concierge desk was fully equipped to answer all of our questions, book tours, book transport to Narita Air[port as well as most other tourist needs. Bell staff were courteous, spoke good english and even refused a tip. Excellent marks to the staff.The rooms were large for Japan standards. We had a very large three bed room with a huge bath on the 12th floor of the annex. Our other room was a two bedroom unit on the 10th floor of the annex. It was also very large by Japanese standards for a two twin bed room. Each room had its own climate control as well as a TV with three english speaking channels (CNN, BBC and Bloomberg Financial). Japanese channels were also available. Very entertaining, even though we did not understand a word of what they were talking about! Pay channels were also available. Vending machines were available on most floors, though we found the convenience store at the end of the block to be less expensive and offer more selections.We ate breakfast every morning at the western cuisine coffee shop. It was a full hot\/cold breakfast buffet. Very pricey, but similar to most all other Japanese hotels for a comparable breakfast, about $20\/person. There is a Starbucks and McDonalds a short walk away. We ate dinner one night there after a late tour. Dinner was less expensive than breakfast! We didn't try any of the other restaurants in the hotel as they were pricey and there are several choices for meals of all kinds within a short walk.Location was very good. A three minute walk to Daimon subway station, five minute walk to Hammamatsucho (JR) train station. As you may know, there are always many restaurants near train stations.The overall appearance of the hotel is nice and clean. The hotel facilities are somewhat dated, but most fixtures are updated and fully functional.I highly recommend the Shiba Park Hotel.
