{"text":"Hands down, my best hotel experience! My sister and I just spent a week at the lovely Hotel Zandbergen. I have been to Europe numerous times and have stayed in a number of different accomodations. This was my sister's first time to Europe. We were both thrilled with our choice of the Zandbergen.The BB lies between Museumplein and Vondelpark. The neighborhood is residential and very very quiet. There are two tram stops on the #2 line within about 100 feet of the front door. The #2 runs to Centraal Station and just about anywhere else you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e going to want to go in the city center. The longest it took us to get to Centraal Station was about 18 minutes. So you have the convenience of accessibility with the comfort of a nice, quiet residential area. The hotel itself has secure access, which is another plus for females traveling alone.The room was dead quiet and immaculately clean. We had room #19 off the lobby, but there was a main door to our room, a short hallway with a bathroom, then another door into our room. The double doors helped squelch any lobby noise we may have heard (which was none!). The two single beds were comfortable and the room was cool even on the three hot days we were there. Breakfasts were buffet style and ran the gamut to all cold offering (cereal, pastry, meats, fruit) and hard boiled eggs which the host did as you waited. The coffee was out of this world. Oooh la la! The host has recently taken the hotel over from the Vonks, who I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° never met but had read about extensively on Trip Advisor. You√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° never know that he was new to this business, if he is new to it. He is incredibly hospitable, knows when to offer up information and how much to tell you, is eager to answer questions and was genuinely interested in seeing that our experience was all that we had hoped. We were treated like royalty. It was a very warm and comfortable environment, and this carries over the rest of his staff as well. As my sister said, it felt like we were coming home every night.I cannot recommend this BB enough. In many, many trips to Europe, this was my best accommodation experience. Hands down.
