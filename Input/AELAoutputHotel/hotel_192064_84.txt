{"text":"Great choice. Great atmosphere. Great people I stayed at the hotel from the 24th to the 28th of April 2008. I booked it after I read the excellent reviews here. My flight was late so I arrived very late at the hotel but I found everything to be ready and waiting for me. Truth be told there was a mistake with my room but I must say that they fixed it ASAP and with no problems. So please take that into consideration. Mistakes are human and the important thing for me and what I am choosing to remember is how swiftly they were dealt with and the manner in which that was made. What I am trying to say is speak up and your issues will be addressed. And solved. In my case every little or big detail I asked for was dealt with exceptionally by the people there and always with a smile. Non of them seemed to be bored or seemed to do things mechanically. The staff is extremely helpful throughout the hotel but not oppressive. They give you room to breath sort of speak. On another note I loved that people throughout the hotel greet you when you pass by them at any time of the day. Gives the place a very friendly atmosphere.  Being disabled I was a little apprehensive about staying there because allot of the reviews on Tripadvisor state that it is not suitable for people with disabilities. Because of my condition I need things the average traveller does not.   Let me tell you that I did not find a problem whilst I was staying there. The hotel is accessible with lifts and rooms with ramps if requested. There is no ramp in the entrance of the hotel but rest assured if you need help they will help you. The rooms are a little cluttered but if you wish to have more manoeuvrability you can ask for things to be taken out of the room and it will be done swiftly. That is what I did. Some things I had moved around and others I had taken out of my room and replaced with others. (in my case chairs with good back support were needed and not the average chairs in the room). Breakfast was lovely. I was given special seating and I used the pillows provided. They even went out of their way to bring me fresh cinnamon and honey with my pancakes and waffles. (Something I am sure is considered very strange in the UK but is very common practice in my country). The bar is very nice and they play nice piano music there in the evenings. It also offers snacks and light meals that are more affordable than the ones in the restaurant. The first night I was taken to room 415 and it was a very nice room but a bath rather than a shower. After that I was moved to room 219. It did a shower as I had requested. Rooms were also of a good size considering we are in London. The rooms seemed to be soundproof. I was not bothered by any noise from the rooms next to mine. Being on the second floor I did not seem to have any problem with noise as I have read on some other reviews here. I found the library a nice and relaxing spot to sit in. Takes you away from most of the noisiest parts of the hotel. There is also wifi access throughout the hotel which is brilliant and it did come in handy especially on the day I was checking out and was waiting for my shuttle to come. There is easy access to green park tube station. It is just a few minutes away and easy to get to. Next to Green park tube station there was a MS in case I needed anything and it is not out of my way even one step as it is right next to the station. So I just stopped there before heading back to the hotel. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this hotel and am planning to stay there again. I recommend this hotel to everyone. The one thing that really needs much work at the hotel is their coffee. Neither the breakfast coffee or cappuccino that I tried were drinkable. I ended up having an extra coffee from one of the coffee shops near the hotel and\/or Starbucks throughout London.It is no fluke that this hotel is so high up on London hotels list on this site. I can't wait to go back there! Had a wonderful time.
