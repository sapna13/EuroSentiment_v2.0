{"text":"Where is the coffee, helllooo? I had a specific issue that was handled very poorly by the (probably overworked and underpaid) staff at this hotel. I took home the letter from the manger - Chris Torsleff - from the notebook in the room where is says he hopes the hotel 'exceeds your expectations' well actually it failed to meet industry standards. I found a major discrepancy between services advertised vs service provided when it came to trying to get a cup of coffee at 5 AM. The in-room notebook states that 'Barnie's Coffee Kiosk opens at 5 am daily' and the hotel proudly advertises in the lobby they brew Starbucks - neither was true. When I came down to the lobby for my coffee, no one was there, I had to yell for a front desk person, I asked him where was the coffee - he said no weekend service, I had to walk to Circle K down the road. I went back up to my room and brought down the notebook and showed him the part where it says '5 am daily' and he was perplexed, shrugged his shoulders and said they are always closed on weekends and he didn't know why it said that in our room literature. I find it hard to believe I was the first person to bring this contradiction to his attention, actually there were lots of people (airline personnel) milling around and I heard several mentioning 'coffee'. Then, when the onsite restaurant opened at 6 am, I went to get my Starbucks and mentioned how I had been waiting since 5 am for it. They told me a very weird story about 'the woman who runs the Starbucks machine was in a car accident and they were trying to cover....√à√\u2020\u2022?asserting only one staff member was capable of doing it?! And then they gave me the WORST cup of coffee I had ever had. It was SO not Starbucks, and I intend to cc this comment essay to them so they know to check up on the property's representation of their product. They still charged me more than 2x what the same cup would have been at a Starbucks - $2.44 (didn't even offer to comp it to me for the mis-advertised 'opens at 5 am') and I returned it after two sips, saying no way it was Starbucks, and I didn't ask for a refund and they didn't offer. I spent $35 on room service at the hotel and travel to Phx often, but I will avoid the hotel in the future as I was very disappointed in the service. The staff really didn't know how to handle a client, and no one seemed very concerned about the fact that Starbucks - a very famous name with an excellent reputation, was being represented so poorly.
