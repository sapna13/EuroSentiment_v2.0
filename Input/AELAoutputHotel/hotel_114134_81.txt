{"text":"Super Hotel! We have just returned from 2 weeks at The Lenox and had a fabulous time.This is a great hotel in every way - staff, location, cleanliness and facilities.It is a two minute walk to the Copley T-station and walking distance to everything from Boston Common to the shopping at the Prudential Centre next door. The Irish Bar in the hotel, Solas, has a good atmosphere and serves great food. The City Bar also in the hotel is a more salubrious cocktail bar which makes super cocktails and is really relaxing. It is very busy at weekends. We ate at Azure Restaurant in the hotel once and had a good enough meal - not good enough to return though!All of the staff at the hotel were excellent - friendly and helpful yet so professional at all times. The Lindt chocolates on the pillows each night was a nice touch as was the complimentary water in the rooms each day. Two small things that slightly irked me was the fact that there were no tea\/coffee making facilities in the room and also that whilst we were there they were laying new carpet on the corridors and stairs and the hammering started quite early. Not great when you are having a lie in on holiday! We thought it a little strange that we had been given notification that the windows would be cleaned (didnt see or hear that) but not about the noise from the carpet layers. As I have said these are very small things in an otherwise excellent hotel and if in Boston again I will definitely be staying at The Lenox.
