{"text":"Good Time at the Oasis Don't believe all you read . . . was freaking out after reading some of the bad reviews for the Grand Oasis - but everything turned out fine. We booked our trip thru Cheap Carribean and stayed at the Grand Oasis from August 16 - 22 - 2 adults, 3 children (16, 10, 9). Requested adjoining rooms in building 5. Rooms were old, but clean. A\/C worked well in our bedroom, just so, so in kids' room so we kept adjoining door open and ceiling fans on. We left a note requesting extra towels and bottles of water and $5 daily for the maid and we received both. Beach was beautiful, but something needs to be done about the people who reserve chairs and don't show up all day. We were still able to pull some chairs together under a plam tree in the shade even in the late morning or afternoon. The lazy river was very nice and not many people used this pool. Our room looked onto the adult pool and many times saw children in it. The grounds were being cleaned up constantly - always someone raking, cleaning or picking up discarded drink glasses. Food was OK. We did not drink any of the water - which was always offered at lunch and dinner - nor did we eat too much fruit or any salad. Still 3 of us experienced a slight stomach disorder the last 2 days - could of been from the ice in drinks??? Overall, a beautiful place to visit and for $1,500 (not including air) for 6 nights all inclusive for 2 rooms and 5 people - a great deal!
