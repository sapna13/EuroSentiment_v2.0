{"text":"Perfect My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Lumembourg Parc from August 4th through the 9th. I chose the hotel due to the extremely high ratings on Tripadvisor. The hotel definitely lived up to it's number one rating. This was our second trip to Paris and third trip to France.We arrived in the morning after our overnight flight. The staff was extremely friendly and quickly checked us in. Overall the building was very nice. This is a small but very elegant hotel with traditional decor. The lobby has a well stocked bar with a Espresso machine. The elevator is a glass enclosed lift that overlooks a small welcoming courtyard with a small fountain.We booked a standard room. Typically we book superior or deluxe rooms, but we figured most of our time would be outdoors. I believe the Hotel Luxembourg Parc does have larger rooms available compared to what we chose. The standard room is an expectedly small Parisian room, but very well furnished and comfortable room. The bathroom was well appointed with marble and modern fixtures. This particular room had two twin beds together side by side. They were a bit firm for our taste, but still comfortable. There were plenty of pillows, room to stow luggage, and even a small welcome gift. The hotel is amazingly clean.The hotel staff gets an A+ in this review. All of the staff made our stay very enjoyable. We were assisted with restaurant recommendations and reservations, directions to various destinations, and transportation information.Breakfast was available each morning in the hotel dining room. A selection of croissants, breads, yogerts, cheese, and cereals were available. Staff provided coffee, espresso, juice, and other beverages each morning.In terms of getting around Paris, the nearest metro stop is St. Sulpice, which is a short five minute walk away. The RER B Luxembourg stop is nearby as well as a number of other Metro stops. All of St. Germain and the Latin Quarter is within walking distance. We recommend obtaining a street map and locate the various metro and RER stops in advance.Thanks to everyone at the Hotel Luxembourg Parc. We will certainly stay with you again next time we are in Paris.
