{"text":"Absolutely great 4th anniversary at the Excellence Punta Cana My wife and I booked a stay at the Excellence Punta Cana for August 11-18 to celebrate our 4th anniversary. We had researched other resorts, and Excellence was highly recommended on the web and by friends who were married at the resort. From the moment we walked up to the resort it was pure Excellence. We felt comfortable and very welcome the whole stay. The entire resort was spotless and the staff was constantly working on keeping it that way. Every one of the staff members you walked past always had a smile on their face and made it known it was their job to make our stay the best they could accomodate. We would like to send special thanks to the bellman CARLOS. He was very courteous and befriended us from the beginning. We would like to thank the entire staff of the Excellence Club; whether it be the concierge, waiters\/waitresses, mini bar stocker, or the maids, all were very helpful and friendly. We were replying to their Como estan? by saying EXCELLENTE! at the end of our first night.We would also like to send a special thanks out to FRANCISCO, ISABEL, and JULIO on the entertainment team. The entire entertainment team did an excellent job throughout the day: excercise classes, games, spanish classes, volleyball, water polo, ice-breakers, disco, etc. They worked very hard to make sure we had fun throughout the day. However, Fransico, Isabel, and Julio took time out to personally get to know us and make sure that we were always having a good time! That was very much appreciated by us. The grounds of the resort were immacualte and very lush and green. The a la carte restaraunts were great and catered to our every need. We will definetly be back to this paradise since our stay was perfectly Excellente! thanks to the staff and accomodations......
