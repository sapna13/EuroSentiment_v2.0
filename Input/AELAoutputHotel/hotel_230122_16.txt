{"text":"Adequate hotel The hotel is best described as ok. Location wise, it's really not very good at all. You're only about a 10 minute walk to the nearest tram (Hoekenes) and these arrive pretty regularly - takes about 25 mins to get into town. However, the area around there is not good and walking to the hotel after the dark was pretty nerve-wracking!! No incidents, but not pleasant walking through blocks of high-rise flats.We actually arrived quite late and our room had gone, but luckily for us we were given a suite. Great! Hold back with your expectations - the suite is on the top floor and simply is a larger room containing an additional double bed (looked like a couple of z-beds placed together). It was clean and tidy and had all the usual things you'd expect. In terms of a room, I couldn't complain and the bed was very comfy.We booked the airport shuttle to get back, however, when I checked, the woman had failed to tell the shuttle bus we needed to be picked up! I complained and we were given a taxi (which the hotel paid for) - still, very unimpressive service.I didn't have the breakfast so can't comment.Overall, not a bad hotel - does the basics well, but use it as a bed for the night and nothing else. Don't pay a lot for it - we searched the internet and got it for about √ä√£¬¢35 a night - probably a good price for what we got, but not worth a great deal more. Does though provide a nice contrast to the over-priced city centre hotels.
