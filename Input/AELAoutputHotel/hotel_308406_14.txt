{"text":"Great hotel! We stayed for 12 nights in a ocean view room in June 2008. Very nice and clean room. Good selection for breakfast. We tried the beach front restaurant, great for lunch and they had two prices for every item on the menu, one for regular size meals and one for small meals. The small portion was more than enough for lunch. Very nice pool and beach area. Although we didn`t travel with kids it seemed to be very family friendly with some kind of big sunlounges with shade reserved for families and a pool for small children. The hotel offers massage at an outdoor pavillion by the pool area for 99.000 rupih for an hour. It was very often full, so it`s a good idea too book when you arrive at the hotel if you know that you will be spending some days by the pool. Great activity program with yoga, water activities etc. The hotel has a taxi counter with fixed prices to Kuta, Seminyak etc. It is a bit more expencive than finding a taxi on the street, but it is very well operated (it says on a sign that it is owned and operated by the local village) and we never waited more than 2 minutes. The best ting about the Grand Mirage was the outstanding service. Everybody who worked there were really nice and helpful. We asked the reception several times to help us with reservations at restaurants and pick up and reservations to tours, spas etc. and they were really helpfulll and did everything with a smile.There are som shops and restaurants just outside the hotel. A 5 minute walk to the left is Bumbu Bali, really nice restaurant with excellent balinese food. The other restaurants outside the hotel that we tried was ok, but not outstanding in any way. There are also a couple of massage places just outside the hotel. We went several times to Alternatif, a very simple place with only curtains to separate customers, but they gave really good massages and it was very cheap.We had several trips to Kuta and Seminyak for shopping and dining while staying at the Grand Mirage, and with traffic it took us up to 45 minutes one way. So if you think that you will be going out every night you might consider staying in Seminyak, Legian or Kuta. We actually stayed in Seminyak later in our holiday and although we loved the shops, restaurants and atmosphere there, we missed the Grand Mirage : ) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":81,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":77},{"endOffset":344,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":340},{"endOffset":1534,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1530}]}
