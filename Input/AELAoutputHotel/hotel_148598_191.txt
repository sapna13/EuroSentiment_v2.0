{"text":"Beautiful Views.....Other Issues Though We booked our trip through Travelocity and got a REALLY good deal. Thus, we may have a skewered view in comparison to someone who paid more for their trip. We arrived on Tuesday Oct 30 around 4:40 in the evening. Check in was great! We had been upgraded to Ocean View (we had two rooms). Amy at the front desk was friendly, helpful and gave us a few extras. The rooms are average. I have stayed in nicer rooms, but like I said I paid much more for those. I will tell you that the grounds, view, pools and the beach are gorgeous! The food and drinks are expensive as said in other posts. We stopped at Walgreens and picked up some bottled water, beer, sodas, juices, chips, etc. This made for a fairly inexpensive Happy Hour. We ate lunch twice at the outdoor grill. These prices aren't too hateful and they did not say a word when I and my teenagers ordered off the 12 and under menu. We also ordered room service for dinner twice. Fairly reasonable prices and VERY mediocre food. We ate at Richies (gorgeous view and good food but expensive) and at LAS VEGAS (beautiful classy restaurant with good food but also VERY expensive). By our last day we had to eat at KFC just to make it home with any money! We went across the street to the Rainforest one day. Beautiful, but I was a little bored.We also drove 1.5 hours to get to Aricebo to see the SETI satellite. The drive up the mountain was one of the scariest I have ever taken. The locals there are not very considerate drivers and one almost ran us off the mountain! However, being the geeks that we are, seeing the large satellite was pretty cool. Wasted a whole day of beach time, though!My husband was disappointed that they could not get enough interest to start a Texas Hold Em game, but I tried my luck in the casino every night and found that I was not very lucky! However, on the last evening I did hit a straight flush on 3 card poker for about $700. This covered my losses with a little extra. Would I go back? Probably not because we like to try different islands and places when we vacation. Overall I give the resort a C+, however if I were to separate the grounds, views, and swimming apart, I give them an A!
