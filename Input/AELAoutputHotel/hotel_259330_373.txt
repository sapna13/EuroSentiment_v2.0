{"text":"Upgrade now I went to the Grand Paradise over Thanksgiving for a week. It was our first time in Punta Cana. The beach was the most beautiful I have ever seen. Like a postcard. The water was perfect. Big waves were fun. The pool area was great. Very clean but my husband was bugged by the little ants. Don't leave your drink down. The outside was lovely. My problems began with the room. First put into room 3121. Dingy, poorly lit and stunk of must. Stuffed up the nostrils type of musty smell. Had to wait until next day to move to 3114 which overlooked the pool. Much better and didn't smell anywhere near as bad. Still worn out and dingy but better. Maid service was awful. Would get room made up and clean towels just in time to dress for dinner. Make sure you hang up your towels so you can use them again in the morning. I left a good tip everyday but that didn't seem to matter. The food was awful. Thank goodness they had bread and butter. After 3 days stomach went south. I ate the frozen pizza and fries for lunch because I figured that was more safe than the buffet. Tried a few resturants. Service almost funny and food tasted all the same. I have since talked to my TNT rep who more or less told me that this is one of their most popular resorts and they have had no complaints. I told them to read the reviews on Trip Advisor!!! They made me feel as if I was just a pain. I have been to Mexico, Aruba and Bermuda a few times. People so much nicer and places so much better. I would go to Punta Cana again---in a few years-- and pay more money to go to a more upscale place like the Riu. I don't like to go on vacation to get sick and have cock roaches. All booze is low end so if you want a good drink make it yourself. Also don't stay in THE Club. You have to take a 5 minute tram ride. No views what so ever. Upgrade to garden view NOW. Try and have fun but bring your meds.
