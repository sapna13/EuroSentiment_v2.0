{"text":"Excellent base in Hong Kong We were looking for a base to explore Hong Kong with our 2 young children and booked the HP after reading earlier reviewers comments which by and large were pretty close to the mark in terms of our experience. We booked an Ocean Suite for the four of us and the Hotel had no problem putting in two additional roll away beds (HK400++ ea) for the children in the lounge\/kitchenette room. The view of Victoria Harbour provided a spectacular backdrop with everything from ocean liners to Chinese junks literally sailing past the windows but it is worth noting that the hotel's location means that you will only get a glimpse of the 8pm light show from the hotel. However as mentioned in earlier reviews the location, whilst not right in the middle of downtown, is still really quite good as the cross harbour ferry to Central is virtually at the doorstep, taxis are always at the door and are extremely cheap (our most expensive trip was from the base of the peak tram on HK island back to the hotel - HK90.00 including tolls, most other trips were HK30-50) and the hotels shuttle bus provides a terrific half hourly service to TST which will drop you off in the best possible spot to see the show. The accommodation and service was of the standard you would expect for this level of hotel and the staff were professional and courteous.The roof top pool has an amazing view of the HK skyline.There are plenty of shops, restaurants etc just a short stroll from the hotel including banks and supermarkets etc.The only slight criticism we could make is that the breakfast buffet, whilst adequate, is probably not quite up to the mark when compared against similar standard hotels we have stayed in, in other parts of Asia. We ended up going to local coffee shops\/cafes instead - offering an easy breakfast alternative.In summary, were we satisfied -yes, and we would probably happily consider staying there again next time.
