{"text":"stonefaced staff I have read some of the reviews about staff. It is true, you can tip, it makes no difference, or do you even get a smile from them. One of the beach bartenders made me feel like i was intruding on her cell phone call. Knowing a few words in spanish is very useful here, 99% do not speak english.(or pretend not to) Food wise, i found it much better than other resorts in Punta Cana, but i would bring immodium anyways. There is a beach buffet for lunch, though it is small, and a bbq burger stand on the beach, as well as a 24 hr pizza shop (good pizzas) Maid service is hit and miss, once again , they don't speak english. They like to clean early in the morn ( if you miss that, then, hit and miss when they come back) Either they run out of supplies, ie towels, toilet paper or they just don't care if you have it in your room or not. Tipping them does not seem to matter either. On the first night there, while on our balcony, one of the guys that delivered supplies to the building chatted us up. He was tipped well, every night he would drop by and we had a list of what we needed, ie towels, bottled water, beer, coffee etc. He merited tipping, only person there that cared, and actually smiled. Rooms need upgrading, they are basic, but do need new beds and fixtures, otherwise roomy and never ran out of hot water.
