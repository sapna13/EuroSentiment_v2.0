{"text":"Outstanding value, can't beat the location We found a pay-for-2-stay for-3-night special on a European website (Turquoise Tours and Travel, out of London). Total cost for two adults, including breakfast, was $285.The hotel is situated less than 100 meters from the metro station Temple, or about 250 meters from the metro Republique. Our flight from the US arrived at CDG at 9:45 a.m. and at 11:10 a.m. we checked into the hotel.Hotel staff is very friendly and appeared to appreciate our speaking French to them but obviously spoke English well. The room was rather small but not too small--typical size for Paris. It was not claustrophobic. Quiet windows, a very clean and modern bathroom, very nice shower, daily fresh towels, soap, and shampoo; comfortable (=firm) Queen-sized bed. (Note: The hotel has no rooms for three persons or more.) Small flat screen TV with lots of cable offerings; good lighting in the room; only one AC outlet; free WiFi in the hotel, included in price. Breakfast (great coffee, OJ, cereal, croissant, cheese, eggs, jams, bread, joghurt, no meats) is served in a bright, totally newly refurbished breakfast room--very happy, clean, and just refreshing. There's an outside veranda for the sumer months.The location of the hotel is fabulous: A Velib bicycle station is located maybe 50 meters away, giving you immediate access to the Latin Quarter (10 min), Marais (6 to 7 min), Opera (15 min), Louvre (10 min). neighborhood is safe, relatively quiet. There's a large Monoprix grocery store just around the corner, 2 min walk. We've stayed in lots of different places in Paris and this is our new favorite (apart from the two in-town Hilton properties, but you don't get in there for this price. :))We'd highly recommend this property, especially if you can score a deal the way we did.
