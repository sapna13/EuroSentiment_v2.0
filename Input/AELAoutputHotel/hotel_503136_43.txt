{"text":"Noisy! Having just returned from staying one night at this hotel I felt the need to give an honest opinion about it. Given the fabulous reviews most people have given I felt quite confident about booking this place. It was easy enough to find(although none of the locals had heard of it) and first impressions were good - trendy smart reception area, smooth background music, comfy leather furniture etc. Our room was a studio apartment on the 6th floor with a large roof terrace(the main reason for booking).The immediate impression of the room was quite good - modern,light but a somewhat cold feeling.We had asked for a double bed - it looked tiny and felt like a large single( no good if you happen to be 6 feet tall and used to king size! During the day the room seemed OK and not too noisy, but at night the traffic droned on and on and on and on!!! Also our tiny bed was next to some crucial plumbing and I was woken everytime anyone in the hotel used their bathroom.I found it impossible to sleep because of the noise and spent the night tossing and turning in the tiny bed with a cheap mattress.I was consequently too tired to appreciate Barcelona the next day and resented parting with 140 euros when for √ä√£¬¢15 I had a great sleep at the Stansted airport`s new Travellodge! The staff were also incompetent and frosty (it took over 30 minutes to check out because the receptionist was obviously computer illiterate. In short this place is mutton dressed as lamb and I wouldn`t even rate it as a 1 star hotel.What a rip off! ","annotations":[]}
