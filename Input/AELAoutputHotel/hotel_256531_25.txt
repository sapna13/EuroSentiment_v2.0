{"text":"OK for the price We got a cheap rate on Secret Hotel deals on lastminute.com, but if we had paid any more, I would have felt ripped off. ROOMS: The rooms were OK- enough for 2 people, but we wanted a triple share, so things were very crowded. Also, no extra linen or cups etc were brought up for the third person, even after the second day. We had to ask every day for the extra's. The bathrooms have not been done up, so are very old and needing a renovation. The rooms are not very quiet- we could here EVERYTHING that went on in the room next door, to the point where we nearly left. As for the room cleaning, where do I start???? It was truly terrible. One day (as a joke between ourselves to see if it would be cleaned) we deliberately left a used coffee cup on the floor and some screwed up paper nearby- it was all still there in the afternoon and the cups were not replaced with clean ones.LOCATION: The location is just on the outskirts of Chinatown, so pretty close to everything. No complaints re the location for the price- there are hotels that are in much better areas, but they are also much more expensive.PARKING: Parking is about the cheapest in Sydney at about $12 a night. It is usually about $25 a night elsewhere.OVERALL:I would stay here again if the price was right, but wouldn't spend over $150 a night for it. Just not worth more. The downstairs service was good and the desk staff were really lovely, but room service and cleaning was TERRIBLE!!
