{"text":"Fabulous vacation I just returned this morning from the Melia Caribe in Punta Cana, and am already missing the tranquility.The staff was very polite, attentive, and responsive. A call for a repair in our bathroom was responded to very quickly.The landscaping was fastidious and the botany was lush and striking. There are many photo-opps of unusual flora and birds just on a routine stroll from your villa to one of the many restaurants.The food overall was quite good. However, as a vegetarian, creating a balanced meal was somewhat complicated. Many vegetarian staples (i.e. beans or potatoes) contained bacon or lard, though this was often conspicuous. Less obvious were hidden meats (i.e. in vegetable soup), though the waitstaff was bilingual enough to answer questions as to the content of food, and even went out of their way to bring me veggie soups that weren't even listed on the menu. They are also capable of altering an entree for you to suit your dietary preferences.If you are looking to be entertained, this resort will not let you down. I attended two of the nightly performances, both of which were quite professional and entertaining. There is also a schedule of games (pool and beach), Spanish lessons, aqua aerobics, stretching, Merengue lessons, and beach olympics to fill the schedule. Though I didn't travel with kids, I think there would be plenty of activities to keep them busy. The ocean is very warm, with mild waves and no undertow, allowing great conditions for swimming and kayaking.My only complaint, though minor, was that the workers are constantly traveling around on the paths of the resort on mopeds, spewing quite a bit of exhaust that was constantly tainting the otherwise fragrant air. Yes, the people pitching the timeshare option at me constantly were somewhat pesky, but they could be politely and quickly turned away.Overall, I highly recommend this resort for your travels.
