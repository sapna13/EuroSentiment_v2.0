{"text":"Unbelievable!!! My boyfriend and I went to this hotel from October 5th to the 12th it was wonderful!! We just got back last night and we already want to go back and are recommending this hotel to anybody who plans on taking a vacation. We felt like kings a queens and had so much fun. On our way to the hotel they did the check in on the bus from the airport (which is about 30 min from the hotel) and gave us our room keys and bracelets, this saved a lot of time and was very appreciated. We were then greeted with dancers, music and drinks and taken to our rooms right away to be able to enjoy our trip as fast as possible! We were in the Royal Golden part of the hotel and closest to the beach. We were in villa #4 and couldnt ask for a better one. This gave us access to 4 a la carte dinners and we booked them right away and had no trouble getting the times and restaurantes we wanted. We ate at the Gourment (favorite), Italient (excellent), Japonese (awesome) and a BBQ by the beach (did not like this one as much...was a buffet and similar to the main buffet). The rooms are really nice, spacious a clean! We always had nice towel arrangements and flowers in our room everyday. The first day we got there it was cloudy and rained and at first we were very disapointed but thats something you can't control. But then we saw that the rain dosent stop very many people, the pool was full the music was going and we just swam up to the bar and made the best of it! But the rest of the week was gorgeous!The beach was beautiful with light soft sand and the turquoise water! There wasn't any debris or seaweed on the beach ever! The water was also warm and the waves were not to big so it was nice to swim in. And believe me when that sun comes out you will be in there! We spent most of our time at the beach and the main pool and is was very clean, lots of chairs (the beach too) nice water temperature and never too crowed since there are so many other pools on the site. There is a swim up bar in every pool and the servers are so much fun! There are shows every night and after the shows the dico opens. There are always a lot of people at the discotheque which is surprising for most resorts! The music was great and the animation was too. The resort is big but I found it perfect! There is a little train that comes around every 2 minutes you never have to wait but you can also walk it very easily and we did that often. Anyways all that to say we had a great time met some wonderful people and cannot wait to go back. If anyone wants to cantact me feel free I have much more to say about this beautiful paradise!!!
