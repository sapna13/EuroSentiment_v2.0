{"text":"Reasonably Comfortable but has a Foreigner Price mentality ! We stayed 4 nights at the City Garden (Business) hotel, arriving on the 19th July and checking out on the 23rd July this year.First impressions, the hotel looks great from the outside, the door staff were freindly, and taxi's are easily obtaininable from the hotel forecourt entrance, the hotel is located very nicely near the Fortress Hill MTR stop, its about a 5 minute walk crossing a busy intersection, and up on the right, convenient for those who buy the 3 day tourist pass with Airport express journeys.On checking in, the Reception staff seemed a bit flat in terms of welcome, however, we checked in and were given a room on the 9th floor.The room on first inspection was quite big, we had booked a triple, and we found 3 well made up beds available, the bathroom was marble, good facilities, and the best set of amenities I have ever seen in a hotel in my life, in this one, they had put razors and shaving cream in small packets, something of a welcome, if you had not brought any shaving cream, it did the job and was a big boost to our first impressions.Sadly, the Aircon was a big let down, after staying in the Ramada Des Voeux road on a previous stay, with a fantastic room divided into a suite and bedroom area, with superb aircon, this aircon system was a big let down.We complained to the reception desk in the morning, and they sent up engineers to check the aircon, they confirmed it was not working.They then agreed to move us to the 10th floor, and sent up the porter to help me move in the afternoon, I had to leave my wife and her best friend in Disney, and take the train back to the hotel interrupting my sight seeing afternoon, to move rooms, somewhat of an irritation, when I got back, it took over an hour to move our things, including valuables from the hotel safe, and the porter left me stranded on the 10th floor, on my own, thinking we had finished moving, I then had to carry on alone, again not inspiring.The aircon in this room was better, but not by much, so we accepted it as you did feel cooler in the room, but then I noticed there was a put me up bed for the 3rd user, I was irritated by this and contacted reception about it, they said, they had to put in a fold down bed as this was all they had, again, no back up, irritating.In the morning, we could not make coffee for the 3rd person, because of inadequate coffee cups, I had to chase the maid down the hall, to ask for another cup and saucer and extra coffee sugar milk and tea etc, again irritating, but the problem was solved.Apart from the above, the room was nice, the T.V. very modern, and internet wi fi in the room, although it cost HKD 30.00 for 1 hours use, or HKD 300.00 for a week, but at least it was available.We did not take breakfast in this hotel so we have no comments to make about it, we went out in the morning for breakfast as there are so many restaraunts in the area, just to the left of the hotel in the next street is Yoshinaya, a popular eatery, and we ate there, I understand breakfast is around USD 20.00 UK 10.00 per head, and we did not use the Bar.The hotel was booked through a UK Travel website and we were charged √ä√£¬¢100.00 per night for a triple, however, I was speaking to a chinese couple who spoke good english and they only paid Hong Kong 600 dollars, I suspect, this hotel operates a Foreigner Price policy, where foreigners pay more than chinese visitors, although we expected to pay that price.This hotel is reasonable, its clean, and tidy, the rooms are cleaned daily, and the amenities are stocked daily, the location is good, and I would say I would stay there again, I think my experience may be a one off and would not wish to put anyone else off from booking, it seems reviews on this hotel are a mixed bag depending on the experience received.
