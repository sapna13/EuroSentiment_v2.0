{"text":"Fantastic location! I stayed at this hotel from the 27th - 31st Oct. It is in a fantastic location, very close to the ramblas and also to Catalunya square, where the tourist and airport buses depart from. Although there are so many shops, eating places and things to do nearby, this hotel is also on a street that is quite quiet at night and that felt safer than the adjoining streets. All in all, the location is fantatstic!The reception area is really nice and the staff on reception were lovely and very helpful. The breakfast buffet looked great, but on closer inspection the food was often greasy, stale or just not very nice! Still, we always got enough to keep us going and they did have toast, coffee and cereals. One criticism of this hotel is the lack of a good bar facility. If you are tired after a long day sightseeing and want to just come back and relax in the hotel with a drink, it's quite difficult as the bar closes at 11. They actually start cleaning up, closing doors and even turning lights off at about 10.20, so this is not somewhere pleasant to linger! Also you buy your drinks in the bar at the breakfast room and take them to a lounge area that is a bit tired looking and has no atmosphere.With no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, this bar was a bit of a letdown.The rooms were very clean and were adequate for our needs. They are quite small, and one of the rooms we had was a very awkward shape due to its location in the hotel but given that this is the city centre, we didn't expect a huge room. We had booked two rooms at the same rate but they were very different despite being just a couple of rooms apart on the same floor. One room was much nicer than the other and had adjustable beds. The other room did, however, have a fancy power shower and jets in the bath (the other one just had a shower attachment on the taps). Overall, the bedrooms and facilities could do with being updated, but the location of this hotel would make me want to return again!
