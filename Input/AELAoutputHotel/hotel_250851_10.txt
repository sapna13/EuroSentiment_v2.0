{"text":"Peaceful retreat in lovely surroundings Just back from 5 nights at the Hampshire Golfhotel (now called the BurgGolf Purmerend) and would definitely recommend it to those looking for a tranquil hotel in peaceful surroundings. We intended to stay in Amsterdam and use that as a base to explore the surrounding area but were glad we chose this hotel instead as it's so peaceful. Only 25-30 minutes on the bus to Central Station, and about 10-15 minutes on bus 113 from the quaint old town of Edam, which provides bus links to many other town such as Volendam (for windmills, clog makers and cheese farms).To reach the hotel from Central Station keep walking along to the left, across several tram lines and cycle paths, till you come to the Arriva bus stops. The bus to Purmerend is no. 107 and there are 4 per hour during weekdays, fewer at weekends. They're always on time, very clean and comfortable, and the majority of drivers speak very good English. It costs 6 euros per person for a one-day bus pass (available from the tourist information office opposite Central Station and also on the buses themselves) which can be used all day in the Waterland area and to reach Central Station, but not to travel around Amsterdam itself. Don't bother buying one-way tickets as they're much more expensive. For families the 10 euro weekend ticket is a very good deal. The hotel itself lacks some of the amenities that are often associated with 4 star hotels (no pool, gym or sauna, no air conditioning) and is very much geared up for golfers, with the reception being accessed through the golf shop. There's a restaurant, breakfast room, downstairs bar (wasn't open while we were there) and internet access in the lobby.There are ice machines on both floors and an unstocked mini bar in the room which can be stocked on request. We just used it as a fridge! The rooms are really spacious and comfortable (three beds in ours with ample room for another) with the ground floor rooms having patio doors leading out to a small paved area with two wicker chairs overlooking the putting green. Lovely to sit out in the evening and watch the hares jumping around, but not so good at night as I didn't feel comfortable leaving the patio doors open as I was on my own with two children. It got unbearably hot indoors as the temperature reached 30 degrees even at night.The rooms are very well designed, as there's a door separating the bedroom from the bathroom\/dressing area where the kettle  hairdryer are located, which means that the kids aren't disturbed while you have your shower\/make a cup of coffee\/dry your hair! Bathroom is pretty basic with sink, loo and bath with (very efficient) shower attachment. Loads of towels with extra ones in the cupboard in case you run out. There's also a safety deposit box in each room - we didn't use it but I suspect there's an extra charge.The breakfast buffet had various cereals, a selection of teas, coffee, juice, cheeses, sliced salami  ham, salad (unfortunately buzzing with flies which was off-putting), tomato, cucumber, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, bacon, little herb sausages, croissants, rolls, various breads, yoghurts, fresh fruit salad.All in all, a nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff, not particularly fancy but a good base to explore the lovely towns and villages in the Waterland region. Easy access to Amsterdam AND a peaceful night! Can't ask for more than that.
