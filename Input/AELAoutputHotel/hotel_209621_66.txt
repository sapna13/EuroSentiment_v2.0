{"text":"Disappointed with Normandie We selected the Normandie hotel based on reviews from other travelers and the fact that it is situated between Old San Juan and Candado\/Ocean Park beaches. This was our first visit to San Juan and we learned a lot about the best locations and hotels. I was very disappointed in the Normandie. Our room had a sour smell and the carpets were quite stained. The bathroom floor needed to be cleaned as the tile grout was black with dirt (supposed to be a beige color). The drop ceilings in the room and bathroom had dust and dirt coming out of them. The pool was fine...but don't expect any drink\/food service and get there early if you want a towel. Broken lounge chairs are stacked up along with various other trash items. The view of the ocean is very nice from the pool area but there is no beach (that seems safe) convenient to the hotel. The exterior of the hotel is literally crumbling in many places...this is the view you get when at the pool. The business center had leaking ceilings and empty paint cans stacked in a corner. The hotel definitely has so much potential...the art deco designs and the atrium lobby area are very cool but other details just seem to be ignored. I would recommend the Caribe Hilton located just around the corner! This hotel has its own, private beach a beautiful pool area and seemed immaculate. We ate there a couple of times as most dining seemed to be closed at Normandie. There are no local restaurants that are close to both of these hotels but the cab ride is just about 10 minutes to Old San Juan and costs about $9 each way. You can walk to the Candado beach area for a good selection of places to eat...about a 20 minute walk. Also, one reviewer said the noise was a problem at Normandie. I experienced this first-hand as there was a baby in the room next to us. She cried off and on most nights and it seemed like she was right in our room (poor sound proofing). There was a party in the 6th floor ballrooms on Friday night. We stayed on the 7th floor and the walls were shaking with the loud music until 1 a.m. We were there during 'off season' so the rest of the time the place was pretty quiet.
