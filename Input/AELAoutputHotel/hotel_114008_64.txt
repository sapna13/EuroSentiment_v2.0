{"text":"Loved this hotel! We stayed at the Kahala for six nights in August of 2007. We were there for our wedding (not at the resort itself) and our honeymoon. The service was some of the best service we've recieved at hotel (and we've done quite a bit of traveling in nice hotels). When we arrived our room wasn't ready and were asked to wait a bit, it ended up being about an hour. For this wait they offered us a complimentary dinner at one of their restaurants. We thought this was a great way to make up for us having to sit in the lobby for an hour :) When we got to our room we also had a bottle of chilled champagne waiting for us for being on our honeymoon. So thoughtful!From the first day on they make it a point to remember your name and actually call you by it the entire trip. Their valet service is wonderful, so friendly and helpful and extremely fast. We ate dinner at all of their restaurants and would recommend ALL of them. Hokus has fantastic food and our servers (Tony and Lisa) were so knowledgeable and so nice. The Kahala is being renovated right now so some of the rooms are done and some are not. We stayed in a room that hadn't been done yet but we didn't think it was bad at all. Of course if you look closely you'll see that it does need an update but it wasn't anything to complain about. WIth the service they provide it doesn't matter!! We had an Ocean Lanai room and we loved it. They have the room set up so that when you're laying in bed you can see the ocean and the beautiful view perfectly!The hotel is about 10 minutes outside of busy Waikiki so it makes it nice to not be in the city, but not be far away at all.The Kahala provides service like it should be. They truly make you feel like they value you as a guest. We can't wait to go back!
