{"text":"Not Horrible, Not Outstanding Just returned with my husband and kids 7 and 11. To put my review in context this is our 4th trip to DR, 2nd to PC and 6th all-inclusive experience with the kids. I also travel a lot for work and stay in 3 - 5 star hotels.For those who are new to DR travel, be aware that the star rating for these all inclusives is not the same as in the US. A 5 star all inclusive iin DR is like a 3 - 4 star in the US. Also, most hotels are all-inclusive because you really don't want to leave the property. It's not like other islands where you go downtown to shop, eat or see the sights. Stay on the property!In DR, we've always stayed at Iberostars, so we wanted to try a different hotel this time.To respond to the other reviews. Yes, there are definately more mosquitos than other resorts. I think because of the on property swamp and other ponds. Bring OFF. We did not have issues with bugs or bed bugs in our room. The beds were fine and we didn't have any problems sleeping.The staff at this resort speak significantly less English than my other DR and Cancun experiencs. In fact one night at dinner I overheard a woman ask the waiter where the bathroom was and the waiter didn't understand, so I assisted. My experience is that front desk, concierge, wait staff are much more bi-lingual. Especially on basics. The service is not as good as we've experienced elsewhere. The beach bathroom was often unclean, overflowing garbage, no soap, etc. At the Iberostar, they had someone assigned to each bathroom. At the restaurant our plates would pile up with no one coming to pick them up. One time, I moved them to another table and watched them sit there for some time before a manager came by and cleared the table.The food is average. All inclusive is not gourmet. It will get repetitive if you have a long stay. No restaurant was outstanding. The kids club has been moved to the reserve. The pool is very nice and the building has nice bathrooms, computers, big screen TV, playground, etc. However, the bar won't serve you if you are not a guest of the reserve. It is also a 10 minute walk or 5 minute tram ride from the main part of the hotel. The shows, as at most all inclusives, are high school musical level. They also start very late at 10:15. Not very family friendly. Not very entertaining.The beach is nice and we had no problem getting chairs there or at the main pool. However, there were little to no activities there for the kids. At Iberostar, the Star Friends find the kids and get them involved in activities.The landscaping is amazing and very tropical. The trams run often in the evening and less so during the day. The pool is a nice size and not too deep with many shallow areas for the kids. My daughter did horseback riding with the kids club and enjoyed it. It was free.I used the business center to check us in online and print our boarding passes. It is not a part of the hotel, so you can not charge the computer use to your room and you must have cash!Overall, it's not a horrible place. You will have a nice time. However, I've been to better and would recommend other DR or all inclusive hotels before this one.
