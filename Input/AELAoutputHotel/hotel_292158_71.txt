{"text":"whay a GREAT place to vacation my husband and i were there june 29 till july 6. we had a great time.dont let people fool you about these negitive reveiws because all of the this i was conserned about from reading reveiws we never came across. The grounds a beautiful. we were in thr honeymoon suite right on the beach. that was cool, we alwaysate at a new place every night. the buffet not up my alley but we had lunch there everyday and it was right by our room. we always were able to find a chair at the beach and at the pool no problems. there is always something going on somewhere. we mostly did the cosino at night though, we did not care much for the shows.not to worry about the language barrior cuz there no proplem at this resort everyone seems to know some english or you can point they will get you. just say hola! to everyone with a sime they will love you. Whith a small tip like a buck or two goes a long way and they really seem to appreciate it.we went on the reaf explorer and deep sea fishing. that was great! we also went parasailing and got couples massages on the beach. i would do it all again i have been around the islands some and this really is paradise. in talking to peolpe from other hotels really made us fell like we made a good choice with this one. just so you know its ok to go topless at the pool and the beach if you are concerned of that sort of thing. we mostly hung at our pool and it is a good idea to bring a insolated mug to fill up cuz drinks melt quick.my only dislike was the quilt on the bed i tosses it each night and got an extra sheet yucccthe food at the al carte was great but guy have to were pantsi will go back there!
