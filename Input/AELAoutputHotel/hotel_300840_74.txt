{"text":"Don't stay here!! This is without doubt one of the worst experiences we have ever had at a supposed world class hotel On arrival we discovered they had somehow cancelled our booking in July although they had confirmed with travel agent in November. We were told to go awayas they were full and we didn't have a reservation. They then demanded that we pay for the night which of course we refused and after much discussion they allowed us to go to a room. 3 adults in a room not much bigger than a closet and only 2 single beds! After we made several phone calls back to Australia and 24 hours later eventually the hotel admitted we did in fact have a reservation and we could stay in the closet sized room for the 15 day stay we had paid for. We of course refused and demanded the room we had paid for and finally had a real sized room although not a harbour view as we were expecting. Their website states the have queen sized beds. They don't they have 2 single beds and if you have 3 people you get a roll out for the 3rd.. The rooms were tardy and dirty and the staff were all rude and grumpy. We had been advised we could move to a harbour view room for the last 5 days which we accepted. It was also dirty and dusty and the air con was broken. We had blasting freezing cold air and it took 2 days to get a heater in the room. The bathroom leaked so every shower flooded the bathroom the toilet leaked and the plugs didn't work in the sink or the bath. They didn't seem to be bothered and not willing to fix anything. We will not be staying here ever again and we would not recommend this hotel.
