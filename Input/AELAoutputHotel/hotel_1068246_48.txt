{"text":"Peace of Mind After carefully reading all the reviews which all have a valid point, I have decided to write my based upon my staying there during and after the openning, here is my summary:  a. The Resort was not ready for openning on Friday 21, November 2008, however the staff from the owners (Rosita y Don Jaime), the General Manager Jose Maria to the young lady at the beach bar-Elegance Club (Jackelyn) did everything possible to exceed customers sastifaction under austere conditions. b. The Resort should be 100% completed by January 2009, and when this is done this Resort would not have anything to envy to the Paradissus Palm Real nor the Excellence, which are very very expensive compare with this one. c. The Resort is beautiful in all the sense of the word with few touches pinceladas as defined and conveyed to the customers by the General Manager all the way down to Roberto, Francis, Natividad, and Anibal). d. Services- there are not words to describe it. The smile, courtesy, and demeanor of all the staff employees are without a doubt the highest in the industry, this is indicative of the leadership and professionalims of Mr. Gutierrez . e. The Food was great in every restaurant I visited from the Botacio, el Asadito, Gourmet, French, Japanes, and the others (personally would like to recognize the midnight place where you could get a Burger, Hotdog, Fries, and all sort of drinks).  f. In summary, after all the pinceladas are completed this Resort will be one the FINEST in the area and for the price, luxury, and service it will be a very strong competitive for many years to come. As previously stated to the many friends (Canadians, British, Americans) that I met during my 7 days vacation, many times people paid for a shrimp and a glass of a Cook Champagne and expect an Alaskan Lobster and a glass of Don Perrignon (you get what you paid for). I will strongly recommend this Resort to anyone, as of matter of fact my family and about 100 people are returning on June for a wedding.CarlosSomething worth mentioning, one morning I went to the main lobby bar and ordered a Presidente beer, minutes later a young girl from New Jersey (Nadine 4 years old) climbed on to the high chair and sat beside me. She ordered a Pina Colada, I asked her if she likes the Resort, her response back to me was it is gorgeous.
