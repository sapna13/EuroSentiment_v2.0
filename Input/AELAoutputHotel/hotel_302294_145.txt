{"text":"Wow! We have just returned from the holiday of a lifetime thanks to the fabulous staff, and Manager, Mr Scott Swank, at the Pan Pacific Hotel! We had originally booked 2 deluxe rooms with a connecting door with no breakfast (Quite expensive) On arrival, we were welcomed by three very charming members of staff who presented me with red roses (It was our 15th Wedding Anniversary and my Husband's Birthday whilst travelling) and took a photo of us all (Family of 4 with 2 children) The photos (2 different ones) were presented to us later on during our stay in a presentation folder with personal hand written messages. We did not go to the check in desk but were escorted up to our ..........newly refurbished Business Executive Suite where check in took place! (Upgraded to beyond our wildest dreams!)We thought we had won the lottery as there were 3 bathrooms, 3 plasma TV's, dining and lounge areas as well as a contemporary 4 poster bedroom with a walk in dressing\/bathroom and a twin bedroom for my two children (Who were given beautifully wrapped teddy bears)On the dining table, there were two handmade cakes which were huge, one for my Husband's Birthday and one for our Wedding Anniversary. There was also fruit, chocolates and biscuits.Our upgrade included buffet breakfast each day, canapes and drinks each evening, round the clock snacks and even an invitation to a cocktail party! On the Saturday, we even arrived back from a day out to find two plates of cakes!Every single member of staff at the PP ensure that you feel like a special guest and we would have no hesitation to stay at this fabulous hotel next time we are in Singapore!
