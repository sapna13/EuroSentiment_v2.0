{"text":"Decent trip overall Buffett service is slow, it seems like the service staff per table is 9 to 1, meaning one service staff per 9 tables. So expect filling and re-filling of water to be slow. Get yourself fruit drinks, colas, beer, wine, etc yourself to speed up the thirst quenching process. Lots of food varieties, I recommend the fresh cooked section whereas they'll cook your eggs or omlette in front of you using real eggs not powdered eggs. During lunch, use this area too if you're food picky, as you can get grilled chicken, beef skirt steaks, and fish fillets cooked in front of you. If you prefer buffett style, numerous options to choose from. Pizza at many of the restaurants is ok do not confuse this with your favorite pizza eatery from home, but definitely do-able. Check out the Bavaro Steakhouse, which is included in the all-inclusive price - the Churrasco and the Sirloin cuts are worth getting. Both are better than average beef skirt cuts, but well tenderized in sea water which leaves a good taste - not too salty and brings out the taste surprisingly well. (Skirt steak is a cheaper cut, but if marinated right it can be very good). The Italian restaurant is ok and the Mexican Lindo is ok as well - had good table service at each, but the food is avg so it only gets the ok grading. Pool bar service can be slow, I found it's always faster if you want to the bar area where the beverage is located - for example if you want bottled water, move to the section of the bar that stores it in the area, same for other types of drinks. Most alcohol drinks are watered down - I expected that, plus they cannot make a Mojito if their life depended on it - don't even ask for this drink you'd be wasting your time. The cash bar is decently priced, but don't expect a huge variety like at your favorite watering hole. La Uva beach bar had rude and slow service, did it once and that was enough for me. Barcelo Bavaro Caribe has by far better landscaping than Bavaro Golf, Barvaro Casino and Bavaro Beach, the grounds looked great. The rooms were average, the ac leaked water from the ceiling during the overnight but it was taken care of the next morning. The ac does get cold, very very cold. Shower water pressure was avg, but usable. House keeping did a good job on cleaning and re-stocking the in-roon minibar (drinking the glass bottled Cokes tasted so much better than the canned Cokes here in the U.S.). They took care of the beach, raked it each morning to rid the seawood and debris - walk the beach and see other resort properties and compare, you should see the difference on how well Barcelo took care of it's beach maintenance. The pool was in good shape, even with large crowds. All in all, I would go back.
