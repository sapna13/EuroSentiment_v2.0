{"text":"But be sure to make your reservation for the TOWER, or you'll regret it. Above average, but listen carefully or you could wind up rating it a terrible experience.The Doubletree is right across from the airport and Doubletree is a superb name in hotels. But at this particular property you MUST ask for the TOWER rooms, and specify the EAST side of the tower. If not you'll be on the International Highway and SeaTac Airport side. And at all cost, DO NOT STAY IN THE WINGS. I repeat, stay in the TOWER, do not accept the wings! There, you've been forewarned! ! (For those of you who know Seatac hotels, this is the old Red Lion. Need I say more?)Priceline gave me an excellent rate of $52, but true to the adage of 'getting what you pay for' a lower-paying guest gets the leavings, and the front desk immediately placed me in a distant lower wing. As I walked the quarter mile through glass skybridges, up elevators, down elevators, through the convoluted maze, I had a strong sense of d√ã√\u2022√ñj√ã√ë√∏ vu... and it was true, I HAD stayed there before. The wings of this hotel were an afterthought; the 14-story tower building was a huge success, and of course greed made the owners try to expand on something good and ruined a wonderful hotel by adding the wings. To get to them is an alpine trek, dragging luggage down a hall, up an elevator, through the skybridge, down an elevator, up an elevator to the next, etc. on and on. You can drive to them and park outside, so for a family I suppose you could build a case for them. However the BIG problem is that the rooms in the wings are universally equipped with air conditioning and heating units apparently once the prototype of a JT8D Pratt and Whitney turbojet engine. Low, medium and high fan speeds are exactly the same, a roar that earplugs can't begin to silence. After two rooms I complained so loudly at the desk that the woman staffer upgraded me to the tower, and gave me a $15 discount voucher which I used quite happily on room service. Ironically the tower is older but much nicer than the wings.The rooms have been extensively refurbished and have silent air conditioning and comfortable beds. When I went to the ice machine and filled my bucket there was a black spot in the ice, and when I dug through it I found a swollen and frozen dead housefly. I'm glad I didn't fill my glass to make a cold drink, but that has to be a rare thing and I'm not holding it against the Doubletree... a fly in the middle of winter in Seattle? Hmm, maybe it was there since last summer and finally worked it's way to the... oh let's just drop it!About the d√ã√\u2022√ñj√ã√ë√∏ vu, and to risk beating a dead horse, I had stayed there years ago when it was the Red Lion, had the exact same experience, and vowed never to stay there again. Little did I know that Doubletree had taken it over, and was not the old Doubletree. (You can't win!) They have SUCH a good reputation but to take on properties like this erodes my faith in their name... That time I was there for two weeks and I was stupid enough to put up with the turbine pit for several sleep-deprived days before complaining my way into the tower! LOL!It's a huge hotel, reminiscent of a Las Vegas resort. Nice pool, steamy-hot outdoor spa, though the guests coming in through the extensive and far reaching skyway were all shivering and teeth chattering in the near-freezing air. Probably a better amenity in the warmer months. They have an outstanding exercise facility, and as far as food the pan-fried hazelnut crusted halibut on fettuccine made it all the way to my room in great condition for a dine-in meal that was excellent. All in all, Doubletree has done its best to run this pathetic property, but you you can't teach a pig to sing and you can't make a poorly thought out property work to their standards without major structutural changes by the owners. Dollar for dollar it pales in comparison to the nearby Hilton, which I had just stayed at for $50 Priceline dollars and loved it.
