{"text":"Great service - above average room We stayed at the Oriental in early July 06 for 4 nights as part of a 21 night Singapore - Thailand holiday. We arrived at the hotel at 11.00pm after a enjoyable flight from Australia. We were greeted by pretty much everyone in the foyer at the time of arrival. The lobby looks great at night. The service is brilliant.We were promptly escorted to our rooms and our bags arrived minutes later. We had asked about the Melt breakfast as our rate did not include it. We were told that it would be AUD $55 for both of us to have breakfast each day. We politely declined. If you can organise with your agent for a cheaper rate get it, otherwise, we found that there are plenty of places in Singapore that serve Kaya Toast (so good we brought two jars home with us) and coffee for two people for less than AUD $8. You just have to walk a little (less than 1 km). I reckon there was about 7 within the malls directly near the hotel. The best was at the Raffles Hotel cafe about just over 1 km walk (the one recommended in the lonely planet guide) through the numerous air-conditioned malls near the hotel.The rooms .... we stayed in a city view room. The view wasn't really of the city but of the back of Suntec Mall and another hotel. A little disapointing but i wasn't in the room to look at the view, you can do that on your adventures around the city. The bathroom is brilliant. The products in the room smell fantastic. The bath is massive and the shower was a rain shower and entirely marble. The rest of the room was a little dated for a 5 star hotel. I expected much better from the reviews on this website. The room was spotless, had a large floorspace and a good choice of TV channels (it had ABC Asia which showed an AFL game late one night!!!). It was nonetheless pleasant without being modern or over the top. The minibar prices were ridiculous but you expect that. The best part of the room is definitely the bathroom.Speaking of ridiculous, the prices of food within the hotel are outrageous compared to Australian prices and prices for other Asian hotel i have stayed in. For instance a steak will cost AUD $75+, 2 noodle\/rice dishes and a chocolate desert cost us well over AUD$65 (room service), and alcoholic drinks of any description start around AUD$8-9. Needless to say, we only ate at the hotel for that one room service. Otherwise, go to Boat\/Clarke quay, get a chilli crab (Brilliant!!!!!), pineapple rice, spring rolls and a few tiger beers\/cocktails (with a perfect view) for around AUD$60-70 for 2. If you're fit you can walk it, if you can't be bothered a taxi will only cost about AUD$5-7. Lunch around the city is also very good and cheap. The pool is good. It has a beautiful view of the harbour but has the ambience of an empty olympic sized swimming pool. If you want it for the sole purpose of swimming after a long day at the shops or zoo it is perfect, but compared to other pools in Asia, it it would be very average but for the view. On the whole, it is a great hotel but food and drink is pricey by Australian and local Singapore standards. I probably wouldn't stay there again but only beacuse i would want to compare another hotel to this one. Having said that, i would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking of staying there. From reading the comments on this website, i would probably recommend you get the club room. From memory, it wasn't that much more per night and the breakfast\/drinks\/ canapes you consume would offset the initial payment.Btw, Singapore on the whole is brilliant (4 days and you can see it all). The zoo is a must, chilli crab is soooo good, shopping in the malls, whilst extensive, is as expensive as Australia so you will find that you only buy what you really want. Jewellery at the chinatown markets was cheap. Get on the MRT Trains, they are very clean and super quick and cheap. The lonely planet city guide was great for sightseeing, maps and tips.
