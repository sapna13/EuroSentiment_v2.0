{"text":"after 5 months of traveling it was like coming home! We decided this year to take the vacation of all vacations and left on a five month, around the world adventure in May, staying in all three, four and five star hotels for the entire period. The Nadia was the last stop on our last leg of a month in Europe. We booked it based on the reviews on Trip Advisor, because although it did not have one of the standard upscale brand names that are all over Amsterdam, the reviews were all outstanding. We were not disappointed! From the moment of our arrival everything was beyond our expectations. Although not a standard run-of-the-mill, modern five star hotel, the genuine hospitality, friendliness, attentiveness and service at the Nadia far exceeded anything we had experienced in places we paid four times as much for. Add to that a real classic landmark building two minutes from the center of town looking directly onto the canals with snarling gothic gargoyles leering down from the roof! The Nadia is the real deal! And those stairs! Don't worry, they will run your luggage up and down for you along with anything else you desire, but just experiencing those stairs took us back to the Amsterdam of the 18th century! I wouldn't pass them up for an elevator any day. Osam and his family make you feel like you have come home to Grandma's house. So if you want to experience the real deal while marveling at Amsterdam and be within two minutes walking distance from the Palace, don't take no for an answer and beg Osam for a room with a balcony!
