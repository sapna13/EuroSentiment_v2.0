{"text":"Fabulous Four Seasons! Just got back from the Four Seasons for our honeymoon and had an amazing time. From the moment we walked into the hotel, everyone treated us like royalty. I don't think they ever say no to anything that you ask for! Since it was our honeymoon and I informed them ahead of time, they placed a plate full of chocolate covered strawberries in our room when we arrived and a nice note. It was really a nice touch. We booked our room online for $275\/night through the hotel's website with the 5th night free. I thought it was a good deal for how nice of a property you get. Even though we paid for the rack rate room (a city view) we were given a room with a partial bay view bc it was our honeymoon and I asked. When we got to the room, I saw that it was next to a large crane, so I asked to be moved. They were gracious in accommodating us and gave us an upgrade to a full bay view. It was gorgeous and we loved waking up each morning to a beautiful view. The rooms were not huge and could use a little updating (I was surprised that a 5 star hotel doesn't have flat screen TVs-- but then again, who goes to Miami to sit in their room and watch TV??). The bathroom was amazing-- all marble, a separate tub and shower and beautiful granite vanity. Overall, I would agree with earlier posts that this is a great hotel if you want to hang out by the pool. It might have one of the best hotel pools in Miami. The pool service was great. We never had trouble getting a cabana because the poolside area was not crowded. This makes a big difference if you are looking for a tranquil, quiet setting while you sunbathe (other hotel pools are crowded and you have to fight for a lounge chair). Beware that the pool side drinks and food do come at a price! $13 for a drink. We just went to the grocery store and bought some things to take down to the pool. We also liked that the pool was open 24 hrs a day, so you can take a late night dip if you like. Another nice feature is the use of the gym, which has classes and exercise equipment. The only cons I can think of are:--Food is expensive--Valet parking is also expensive (33\/nt)--You need a car to get around town. Note that you are *not* in South Beach, but in the downtown financial district. I didn't mind the drive, I actually preferred being away from all the craziness of SoBe and just going there for dinner. Overall, an awesome experience.
