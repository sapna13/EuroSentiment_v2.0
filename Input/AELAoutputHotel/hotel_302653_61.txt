{"text":"Wonderful Honeymoon I have stayed at this beautiful hotel with my wife for 10 days. It was a perfect honeymoon.About the area: Nusa Dua is completely separated and can only be entered through the main gate (you can only leave the area at the other gates by car but can not enter), where there is a 24 hours service with armed guards. They check every single car\/van\/truck so we felt that the place is really secure + there is another check at the entrance of every hotel. This is also the case at Melia Bali.The hotel was really nice and basically all Melia hotels we visited have been a positive experience. The hotel interior is great. You can really notice that the hotel was built somewhere in the 80s, still the welcome and the huge lobby with the ponds around is really amazing. The interior of our room was also great, we had a nice terrace overlooking the garden: the most amazing part of this complex. You can notice the smell of the AC (possibly damp) however you can live with that and it is not that bad as others have written. Some extras: many retsaurants and a bar within the hotel - they are expensive, but also good ones. Also try the hotel's beach restaurant. Yhi Spa is the hotel's Spa center: it is really fabulous but quite expensive, therefore we only tried once: the center was just refurbished in June 2006 - made on a very high standard. We also tried some other spas in the neighbourhood pretty good ones - still far from Yhi Spa's level (however also cheaper). Finally the beach: unfortunately Bali is not for beach lovers: the hotels's beach is in a quiet bay area, and there are dams which stops big waves, therefore the water is still but you can only enjoy it until tide comes, when it gets so shallow that you can easily walk to the dams (around 250 meters from the shore). Anyway the hotel has a great pool area, so nothing to worry about.  There is a shopping center in the nearby, however it is a bit expensive + there are at least 4-5 good restaurants at the main gate with many shops and exchange offices. Only use the offices of the biglocal brands, cos some private offices\/people offering exchange services on the streets try to cheat. Most restaurants offer free pick-up and return to the hotel: it really works. There are some really good seafood restaurants in the Tanjung Benoa area: try some!Hotel staff is very friendly, the breakfast is also nice: you can eat outside next to the garden ponds + there is a great variety of food and drinks. Good advice for romantic people: in the atrium of each wings of the hotel there is a field with sand. You can ask the hotel to put a beautifully drawn message (with Balinese ornaments) to the one you love. Enjoy your stay in Melia Bali in case you decide to visit!!!
