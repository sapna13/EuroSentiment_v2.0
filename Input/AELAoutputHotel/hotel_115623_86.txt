{"text":"Old-style snobbery Was in San Francisco on a last minute trip and had the week before stayed at the Marriott which for all the comments about its cheesy jukebox architecture was fabulous for the price and location - service was also fantastic and there was no snobbery at all given that we booked on priceline for what I thought was an incredibly good value rate (80 usd\/night).Unfortunately after my weekend trp to Las Vegas, the Marriott was fully booked so I had to book last minute online - pretty expensive anyway, since I only managed to bid for a room for usd200 without knowing which hotel. (afraid I can't remember which site, not priceline though which is what I got the Marriott from) Ended up getting the Intercontinental Mark Hopkins - which promised to be full of old-world charm and plushness.What a disappointment. Not only is the hotel quite inconveniently placed - it's quite a steep walk from Market Street, what really kills is the snobbery of the staff. When I checked in, the manager at the reception literally threw my credit card back on the desk back at me (so what if I got a last minute rate?! i did pay usd 200 a night anyway!!!) and was sooo impersonal. I was there with my boyfriend and even though my boyfriend was standing right next to me, he actually asked me if that person needed a key.Good grief. I thought, maybe it's just this particular guy, but the next day when we checked out and settled the bill for breakfast and some charges we incurred at the business centre, again, my card got flicked back at me...Room was decent, clean, nice view (since the hotel is on the hill) but nothing special, bathrooms a little dated. No smiles, no Did you have a nice stay? - I will never go back to this hotel again. Compare this to the Wynn and Marriott which I stayed at where the staff were simply wonderful, and both hotels actually cost less than this. Exception to this though was the porter who was a really kind old man and despite us leaving a small tip only in coins (my boyfriend had just lost his wallet and all our small change just before we checked in) he was extremely sweet still! Maybe the porter is the only remnant of what must have been a great hotel.
