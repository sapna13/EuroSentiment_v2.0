{"text":"Average for the price. Will try a different hotel next time. I stayed at the Littre for three nights in November 2006. The decor was pleasant, but I would not select this hotel for future stays in Paris. Having made my selection based mostly on previous Tripadvisor posts about the hotel, I am sharing my experience so that others can make a well informed decision based on what is important to them in a hotel. For me, it's cleanliness, comfort, and service, and I found the Littre lacking in the latter two categories. Here's why:The bed was hard and lumpy; it actually shocked me when I first felt it. My travel experiences (staying in hotels and private homes in France and throughout Europe, and also residing in Europe at various points) makes this difficult to forgive in a three star hotel with the Littre's rates, or even a two star hotel for that matter. In fairness, it is possible that this is not typical of all the mattresses in the hotel, and I did not bring this to the attention of the staff. The room was also small, but that is typical of a Parisian hotel and did not play a role in my giving the hotel an average ranking. A few small details: my room did not have a hairdryer (unless that shaver thing attached to the wall was also a hairdryer and I just couldn't figure it out after many attempts!); you may wish to specify that you require a hairdryer. Bring hair conditioner, they only provide shampoo (minor detail which I only include to help in your packing should you decide to pick this hotel). Other posts mentioned bathrobes; this must not be standard, as my room did not have one.I also very much agree with other posters that the staff was very clueless about restaurant recommendations. They were also of no help whatsoever when I asked if there was a way to make a local phone call from the lobby or a payphone. The gentleman at the front desk simply indicated that there was a phone in my room and that all calls in Paris cost money. I mentioned that I wanted to contact the Opera Bastille to inquire about tickets...but he did not seem at all interested in helping me with anything not directly related to the hotel. Later in the day I expressed this frustration to a French woman I met at the Post Office. She was shocked, marched me directly to her hotel, mentioned my dilemma, and the staff immediately called the Opera, waited on hold 5 minutes, and then inquired about tickets and wrote down the various price levels, etc.. They were more than happy to help.Also, when my itinerary changed and I needed to extend my stay another day, I asked if they could extend the same rate as my previous nights (I found a lower rate on a travel website). The first person (the same gentleman I menton above) said no, and quoted a significantly higher rate. I asked again in the evening, and another staffperson quickly said that yes, they could offer the same rate as the previous nights. I found this inconsistency very troubling.Positives about the hotel? It's clean, and the room's bathroom was gorgeous, it reminded me of an American hotel - big and modern. The shower was heavenly.A word regarding the hotel's location; Montparnasse is not the ideal area to stay in unless being near the Gallery Lafayette and the Montparnasse metro station is very important to you. Even if you are a shopper like I am, Saint Germain might be more to your liking.I hope this is helpful...enjoy Paris!
