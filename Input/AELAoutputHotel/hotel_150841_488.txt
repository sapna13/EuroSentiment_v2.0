{"text":"A very nice resort We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from July 15 - 24, 2006. If you have not already booked here, go back and look at the RIU Palace Punta Cana instead. We walked down the beach to it (over a mile at least) to find the RIu had nicer, warmer pools, thick and beuatiful gold towles, and no seaweed on the beach. but, if you have already booked the Iberostar Bavaro, don't despair. We did have a very good week there.First of all, you should request a room that is close to the beach. I did so through my travel agent. We received 1317 which was as close as possible to both the pool and the beach. Our room was very nice and clean. We saw no bugs and had no smells other than that of a different place from home. We did tip our maid three dollars and day, and we received everything we asked for such as bath gel and water. Only drink water from bottles and brush your teeth with that too. Do not buy any trips or packages from the beach vendors. We met some people who saved twenty dollars a person by doing so, but they found that what was promised was not the case. Stick with the reputable packages sold in the lobby. We bought beautiful conch shells on the beach from a scuba diver. We had no trouble getting them through United States customs, although I think that may not be the case if you are traveling to Europe. The Punta Cana airport is a nightmare. No air conditioning, no signs, no one speaks English. They do check all bags by hand. The open them while you watch and paw through them. It takes forever so take some water from the room and perhaps a snack if you have children with you. Remember, no fruits can go through customs. Also, do not wait to buy duty free liquor. There is nothing to choose from at the airport. Wear your coolest clothes too. Be careful what you eat. My husband had an omelet one morning and he allowed them to put what they wanted in it. Salmon!!!! Yikes. He did eat some of it, and was sick for two days. He also ate pizza with meat on it. I think they recycle food and and not always careful about how long some things are out in the heat. My son and I did not get sick, but we were more discriminating about our choices.The grounds are beautiful at this resort. The flamingos eat our of your hand in the main buffet. Peacocks are everywhere. It is well maintained and lovely. I did not find many people working there who speak enough English to hold a conversation, but that was not a problem for me. I like not listening to beach conversations and always having to hear other peoples' discussions.The beach bar is wonderful. You can have a rum punch and some french fries for lunch ( and a hamburger and hot dog if you are brave). The food was fairly good at every meal. The beach is wide and flat, with lovely tall palm trees. The water is warm and very few waves. It is not clear enough for snorkeling though. Some coral in the water, but not enough to bother with water shoes. All in all, a very good week at a very nice resort. Enjoy..
