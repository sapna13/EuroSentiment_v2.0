{"text":"Great all rounder but not luxurious Just came back from a week at the Affinia 50 which I booked on the strength of the Trip Advisor reviews. It was not the gem I expected after reading the glowing reviews but we were very happy and comfortable there and all-in-all the good points outweigh the bad points. However the number 9 rating out of all the NY hotels is hard to justify and might mislead future guests. It's a very nice place to stay and the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful but it's certainly not one of the top 10 hotels in NY! I have stayed at many of the big luxury NY hotels on previous business trips (including the Pierre, Plaza, InterContinental, Royalton, Sheraton etc.) and they are in a different league even on a bad day but then they are probably twice the price of the Affinia. So go to the Affinia if you want a nice comfy hotel that is clean, friendly, well located and economical especially for families and groups but don't expect luxury.I was there on my own with 2 teenagers and we had a Junior Suite on the 10th floor. The room was big and very comfortable but the decor and furniture was pretty basic and the kitchen and bathroom were a bit dated (tho perfectly functional). The towels had also seen better days so I wasn't too excited about the Aveda toiletries (don't people bring their own stuff?). The only real issue I have with the hotel is the noise from the street at night with the garbage trucks and other traffic. I bought earplugs from the pharmacy in the end otherwise I would have had a sleepless week. The quality of the windows leave something to be desired so if I went back I would request a room at the back and as high up as possible. Good points:The location - very easy to walk everywhere and lots of places to eat locally or buy your own food. Highly recommend the bagel place round the corner on 3rd Avenue for breakfast but NOT the luncheonette a few doors away that other people have recommended - its not good at all!The gym - very small but they have modern treadmills and cross trainers and I was mostly the only person there in the morning.The free wine  cheese midweek - this is a really nice idea. The staff - enough has been said about them by othersBad points:The area\/location - a bit tatty and not very picturesque but it's very central so that makes up for itLack of hotel bar\/restaurantPrice of the extras - I agree with the previous reviewer that $10 a day for internet is ridiculous and $15 for breakfast is overpriced no matter how much you can eat.But I would still recommend it especially for families as you can sleep quite a few in the large rooms and self cater so that's a big plus....
