{"text":"Great mattress and linens, but beyond that scary and disappointing I booked through hotwire, and it was an extreme disappointment. The pictures on the travel sites resemble nothing of the reality of this hotel. First, the location is scary, and not one I would ever pay to be in. I parked my new car under the security camera and hoped it worked. But when I found the outside door lock broken to the hotel I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a lot of hope for a working security camera. The restaurant was closed by a fire a few months before, and from the looks of things it is not coming back. The hotel appears to be badly managed and in poor repair. Most of all the doors going into the guest rooms were badly damaged and needed painting. In the hall going to the fitness room they had painted the walls, but failed to cut in the ceiling and corners. When I asked the front desk when they had painted the hall they told me two months ago. The fitness room had very old equipment. It would be far better not to have a fitness room at all than have guest show up expecting one and see that one. Lastly, the room was far from clean, but on a positive note the beds, linens and bath products are great. Although I know management can not do anything about the neighborhood that surrounds it, it will take a lot of money for upgrades and repairs to bring this hotel up to rating it gives itself.
