{"text":"Well!!!!! Well having just arrived at this hotel from San Diego (Tula Vista Comfort Inn) i can honestly say i am absolutley disappointed with this place. It is in a rough neighbourhood have no doubts a walk down the street will tell you this. It is not near to anywhere you will need a car to get anywhere of importance.Do not stay here if you are planning a vacation base because this is at the very west end of sunset boulevard nearly in the city of LA. We have just been into town to get something to eat the traffic is murder 1 hour in 1 hour back on an 18 mile journey. WOw give me London anytime. The room was dark it is a smoking hotel and the smell in the supposedly non smoking room was horrible. I wanted to be sick thats how bad it was. This hotel lets down badly the comfort inns around the whole area i have just spent 2 weeks travelling staying mostly at comfort inns for their value this is by far the worst and i advise anyone think again spend a few more dollars and stay somewhere more convienent and safer neighbourhood. As for the smoking side you can tell its a smoking joint know what i mean!!!!!!!!! The room is open plan there is not even a door to seperate the the wash room. Avoid if you are on vacation if you want a place to sleep late at night and leave first thing in the morning this is it. If you want a place to remember this is not it avoid!!!!!!!
