{"text":"Basic, Charming Hotel, Out of the Way Location A basic but almost charming hotel. Has plenty of character but the location and breakfast lets it down.This hotel is clealry aimed at North American visitors. The hotel is clean and well maintained but the decor is stereotypically chintzy and the style is dated. That said, it gives it character often lacking in chain hotels.The staff are friendly and eager to please when dealing with run of the mill queries but can be a little patronising and unwilling to help with more complicated requests.The location, whilst very quiet, is far from central. The nearest Metro station is a 20 minute walk and it's then a 15 minute ride to the centre of Paris.Whilst there's a restaurant next to the nearest Metro station, a dearth of any other decent bars, cafes or restaurants means not only do you have to travel some distance for the sights you must do the same for eats and drinks, too. (The hotel bar isn't inviting).We stayed in a superior room which was very comfortable and a good size with plenty of storage space. It was let down, however by the cramped layout of the ensuite bathroom. There was free wifi in the room (and thoughout the hotel).Breakfast was reasonable value (for Paris) at √à√\u2020√ü?2 each but the quality and variety was disappointing. There was a 'boil-your-own-egg' machine with no timer, the orange juice was from concentrate (not fresh) and the pastries were few in number, small and dry. Restaurant staff were very friendly, however.Leaving the hotel at 6:30 am on a Monday, the hotel were unwilling to serve us breakfast before we left, even in the room, which seemed to be a casualty of the place being a small, family run business.That said, the hotel was good value and the staff were more freindly and helpful than not. All in, if this hotel was more central, I would definitely stay here again. As it is, I think it's too far from the action for a repeat stay.
