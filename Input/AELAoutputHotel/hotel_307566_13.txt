{"text":"Wonderful Hotel We have just returned to Perth Western Australia after a wonderful ten days at the Patra. We were attracted to the hotel by the excellent reviews of it on Trip Advisor. The hotel lived up to all our expectations and exceeded them in many areas. We are a family of four and went there with my two young daughters aged 8 and 11. They had a great time in the the very large spotlessly clean pool which overlooks the beach and loved the delux suite which had two TVs with Foxtel. At the end of the day the girls could watch TV and we could close off their area with two sliding doors. Sitting near the pool overlooking the ocean was pure bliss! As mentioned by a few reviews on Trip Advisor, the delux suite has two very large rooms and is well designed, including a large clean bathroom. It is also designed in a way which provided us with privacy and peace. The gardens are beautiful and very well maintained. Our stay included breakfasts and every morning there was a big spread with all we could have hoped for. All the staff were excellent and could not do enough to ensure that our stay there was the very best it could be. On the final day we had a late flight and the hotel happily accommodated our request for a late 4pm checkout without fuss or any extra cost. We highly recommend the Patra and will be going back there the next time we travel to Bali. ","annotations":[]}
