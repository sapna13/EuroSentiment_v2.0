{"text":"Gotta love it if you want to party otherwise stay in the back rooms We stayed at the Bounty with our three teenage kids and two of their friends. Three of them had a triple share room which was very roomy and the rest of us had twin share rooms.You don't stay at the Bounty if you want 5 star accommodation as it is not a classy joint but if you come to Bali to enjoy everything it has to offer, then the bounty is the place to be. It was great to be able to walk straight out of the foyer and have everything at your fingertips....my 15 year old son had a ball at the small cafe over the road and all of the local retailers quickly get to know your name as well as who you are staying with.Anyway, back to the Bounty.....I found the staff friendly and cheerful, always able to help you out in any way. The breakfast was wonderful and the two pools were always kept immaculate.We chose to stay in rooms at the back of the complex near the rear pool to avoid the noisy late pool and 24 hour bar so there was no issues with noise. The only time we experienced any real discomfort was when a group of Year 12 schoolies arrived towards the end of our stay and spent every night running up and down the stairs and making heaps of noise.The rooms themselves were always clean and the airconditioning and facilities were quite adequate. The Friday night party was interesting, steer clear if you can't stand groups of young people drinking themselves into oblivion, otherwise it was great value, alll you can eat and drink for approx $30 per head.If you are not uptight about the classiness of your rooms, I would definately recommend the Bounty and will go back there again in a heart beat.
