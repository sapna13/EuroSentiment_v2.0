{"text":"Wonderful hotel in excellent location Just stayed here for 3 nights in a deluxe harbour view room as a stop off before travelling on to Australia. Exactly as everyone on here says, it's a wonderful hotel and the location is second to none. Ok, you're not in Hong Kong itself, but the Star Ferry terminal is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel and the trip across the river costs HK$2.20 (about 20p in UK money!). All public transport in HK is efficient. Leaves on time, is very reasonable and very reliable. Excellent way to travel around. Suggested trips - take the funicular train up to the Peak (or take a bus from the Star Ferry terminal in HK) - have a walk round the Chinese parts of HK and see the markets - take the hydrofoil to Macau and visit the Casinos - go to Landau Island and visit the Po Sin Monastery and the giant Buddha - 8pm light show viewed best from the Avenue of the Stars right outside the hotel. The list is endless....Back to the hotel.....great service, friendly and polite staff. Great breakfast buffet in the Waterside restaurant. Lifts very quick - never had to wait long. Airport transfer service very easy, and although more expensive than the public transport option it made the journey very easy.If I had to criticise one thing it's the lack of bathroom and toilet door locks. Fine if you're with someone close but not good otherwise!If you're going to Hong Kong - stay at the Intercontinental. Nothing else comes close.
