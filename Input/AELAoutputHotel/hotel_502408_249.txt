{"text":"Great place for frequent business trips I travel to Manhattan often for business, and the Affinia 50 has become my home away from home. Not only is it within walking distance of my office in Midtown, it is also close to many tourist sites, great shopping, and good eating.I particularly enjoy the Club Room at the Affinia. It is fun to lounge, read the paper, and unwind after work if my schedule allows. I also enjoy that I may visit the Club Room anytime I am in Manhattan, regardless of whether I am staying at the Affinia or not. The concierge has been very helpful, and the entire staff at the Affinia has always been wonderful.The beds at the Affinia 50 are the most comfortable of any hotel I've stayed in Manhattan. They are a welcome respite after a long day's work.If you choose this hotel, I would recommend requesting a room on a higher floor. The one time I had a room on the 2nd floor, my AC did not work very well. A colleague of mine, who also had a room on the 2nd floor, complained of something similar. When I've stayed in rooms on higher floors, I didn't have any trouble with the temperature.The fitness room is a bit meager and warm on occasion, but otherwise, it is nice to have workout facilities on site.I am a bit tired of the Affinia's room service menu ... but this will happen when staying at one place frequently.Overall, I am the most comfortable with the Affinia 50 out of the 4-5 hotels I've tried in the vicinity of my office. I would recommend it without hesitation.
