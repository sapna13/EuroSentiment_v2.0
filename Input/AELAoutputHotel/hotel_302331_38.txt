{"text":"Best value in Hong Kong We stayed for a week at the Harbour Plaza North Point, in January 2007. We booked a one bedroom suite and overall our experience was very positive.The hotel's location is way out in the suburbs on Hong Kong Island. Its immediate surroundings is mainly offices buildings and there are very few shops nearby. However, its only a couple of minutes' walk from MTR Quarry Bay station, there is a local supermarket directly opposite and a Cafe de Coral (cheap meals) next to that. The hotel is 7 MTR stops from Central, about 12 - 15 minutes' travelling time.The one bedroom suite is fabulous value for money. It has a living\/dining room, kitchenette, bedroom and generous bathroom. Unusually for a hotel room, there is stacks of cupboard space. The furnishings are quite tasteful, with the exception of a ghastly carpet pattern. Please, HPNP, do yourselves a favour and upgrade this! The staff were always helpful. When we complained of a bad smell in our initial room, we were promptly moved to a new room that was very satisfactory. We booked our room for about US$138 per night. This has to be about the best value anywhere in Hong Kong.A tip: Ignore the hotel laundry service. Go down the side street on the way to the MTR, and there are two laundries down there. We used one of them and paid HK$23 for up to seven pounds of laundry. Down the same street you'll find the most bakeries that produce fantastic rolls and buns that make a great breakfast, for absolute peanuts.We enjoyed our stay at HPNP and will go there again, for sure!
