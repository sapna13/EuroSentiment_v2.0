{"text":"I'd say average beach resort Due to the new passport regulations we booked this trip to Puerto Rico. Overall the resort was fine. Family of 4 enjoyed a week's vacation of fun in the sun. The hotel was clean and in nice condition although some of the grounds needed better care. Around the perimeter of the resort we noticed more trash under bushes than one would expect. My wife and I were a bit disappointed with the beach because it was so short. We like to take long walks on the beach. The pool area was spacious and we never had any problems finding chairs. The hot tub did get a little crowded on a few occassions, but it was manageable. I thought the pool side bar was a bit expensive. $6.50 for a Pina Colata with rum, $5.50 without. Breakfast and afternoon receptions were perfect.The golf course was in great shape. The adult rental clubs were top quality however they didn't have any junior rental clubs for my son. They did piece together 3 or 4 very old pieces of junk so that he could join me.We took cabs everywhere we went. Typical round trip ran $16. We encountered a wonderful cab driver, Louis Rosado - [--]. He provided wonderful history of the island, culture, buildings and people. He was very reliable. $60 fare from the hotel to the airport. I'd highly recommend his service. We'd call him, or have the restaurant call when we ordered dessert and he be there when we paid the bill.Staff (and infact all locals we encountered!) were very nice.
