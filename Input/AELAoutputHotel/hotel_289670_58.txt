{"text":"Nice features at the Gran Torre Catalunya After some considerable time trying to locate a good hotel in Barcelona, I settled on the Gran Hotel. I was attracted by the spa and other facilities, location and, of course, the price!Whilst central (it's right by the main train station (Sants) in Barcelona) and about a 10 minute walk to Placa Espana and a few stops on the metro to Sagrada Familia or Las Ramblas, it is not within walking distance to the main touristy area. However, if you don't mind travelling a bit then this is a nice hotel. An added plus is that one of the tourist tour buses stops near the hotel (but get to the bus stop early as that gets busy - goodness knows what it's like at peak times in the summer months!)Back to the hotel. Upon arrival, we were greated by a friendly welcome and given some useful information about the area and where to get food etc. Note that if you're not booked in for breakfast but want to be, it's cheaper to sign up for breakfasts when you check in than turning up each morning at breakfast. We were disappointed to learn that to use the gym\/spa etc we would have to pay locally. This was not mentioned on the website we booked with, nor on the hotel website. Had we known this, this could have influenced our decision to stay there.We had paid for an executive room and had a nice room on the 12th floor. We couldn't really fault the room at all - clean, well presented and modern. Tea and Coffee etc were provided (an added plus in Europe!) and the shower\/bathroom was to die for. Perhaps a small grumble was the lack of a proper second pillow for each of us (there was a large cushion) but this may have been able to be resolved by a quick call to housekeeping (we were too lazy to bother!).We weren't too adventurous on our first night, and went to the top floor hotel restaurant for dinner. Whilst expensive, the food was good (although of the no vegetables with main meals variety) and the views spectacular. Service was excellent until we wanted to pay. We would recommend this for a special occasion.Breakfast in the morning was what others on this site have described - plenty of variety to suit all tastes, possibly expensive (but convenient) however as previously stated, the hot food was cold. However, service was good and everything was replaced quickly. The view from that floor in the daytime is also good. Even if you decide not to go for breakfast\/dinner, definitely wander on up to admire the view from that floor.A good feature of the hotel is that you don't have to pay for internet access for the first 5 minutes of use. This means you can use the computers to check in for free.In the end, we didn't use the spa facilities (I objected to paying extra for them), but they seemed ok. The gym was quite small (as was the pool) but everything appeared to be in order.Generally we have no substantive complaints about this hotel. Service was good. The location was convenient (the metro is literally across the road from the hotel) and we could travel to everywhere we wanted too without any problems. As mentioned, we were disappointed to have to pay for the gym\/spa but perhaps we should have expected this. We would probably return to the hotel.
