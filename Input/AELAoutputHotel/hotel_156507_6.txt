{"text":"One step up from a hostel Based on the glowing reviews on this site, I had high expectations. They were not met. Many reviews mention the owner\/manager. He is great, all everyone says. But in 4 days there I only saw him once. The rest of the staff does not speak English. The rate they tried to charge for my room was higher than I had agreed to so when I checked out, it took quite some time to clear things up. The rooms are quite worn - old, concave mattresses, slight musty smell. Both rooms and bathrooms are clean, though. The area is just OK, definitely not as convenient as some other hotel neighborhoods. It is quite a hike to the subway and there are not many shops, restaurants, etc. in the immediate vicinity. My biggest complaint was that I was told by the front desk staff to tip my maid. If management thinks their employees deserve more money, they should pay them themselves, not tell their guests to do it for them! (I did tip the maid, as I think she did a good job in a challengingly small room, btw, my issue is with the concept of being instructed or 'reminded' to tip.) Overall, the level of comfort is the same as in the nicer hostels I have stayed in. If you want something a bit more comfortable, priceline has some 3 and 4 star hotels in more central neighborhoods for just a little more money. That's what I will do next time.
