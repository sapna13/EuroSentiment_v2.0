{"text":"Hotel Europa: A real treasure in Florence!! I have just returned from my second stay at Hotel Europa (4-day stay August 4-7th, 2007 and August 2005). Once again, I am extremely happy with this hotel that I felt I had to write a review to share the news. With all confidence I can say that when you visit Florence, this is the place you must stay!!! Here's why:1) Location: To your left, Il Duomo. To your right, the Galleria dell'Accademia (where Michelangelo's David is located). Across and down the street, Florence's famous outdoor market. 10 minute walk, the train station. A better location would be impossible to find!! And although everything is in close promixity, the street where Hotel Europa is located is quiet and quaint at night. A perfect 10!2) Facilites: Clean, spacious,  modern amenities located in a small hotel atmosphere! The Standard room that we stayed in was just perfect. Great size, air-conditioned, large washroom with shower, fridge, TV, great views of the courtyard and Il Duomo. And...the price is right! Affordable rates for superior quality!3) The Staff: To me, this is the final seal on why you should stay at Hotel Europa. I cannot tell you how kind, helpful, generous and warm Gassim  Maria are! (I have not met Miriam but I am sure she is just as wonderful!). A family-run establishment where you are treated with individual attention and care rather than just your typical revolving-door hotel. These people make you feel like you're at home in Italy; their home. By far the nicest people I've met in Italy (and I've travelled the boot from head to toe!).There you have it, short  sweet. Hotel Europa is the place to be when you visit Florence. Go see for yourself!! Arrivederci.......
