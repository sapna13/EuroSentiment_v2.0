{"text":"Great resort, beautiful grounds, busy beach Here are the positives about this resort.The grounds are beautiful, very lush and green, huge open lobby, nice pools, one large one that is very loud and busy, and then another one that is large and nice and has a few activities.Michael Jackson show is awesome!!Rooms are big and the bathroom and tub are great.The transportation that takes you from your room to the beach and the restaurants you wont wait more than 10 seconds for it.The staff are all very nice and service is good.The breakfast buffet is very good and has lots of selection.The steak house is great...good steak.(garden grill)Here are the cons.Maid didnt come for two days at all one time to our room.you have to have a towel card for your towels..make sure your towel doesnt get stolen.There is alot of upselling at this resort...lots of pricelists for many drinks that arent included, always a note at dinner that the wine recommended isnt included, and they have signs to get you to upgrade your room. plus the safe costs 35.00The beach is ridiculous there are literally about 500 beach chairs all over the place..and the water is really currenty and rough..i was scared to go in...although the beach is nice and the water a nice color and you can take a nice walk at night...this beach looks like Honolulu to me...and the safe isnt included..that is bad for a 5 star resort...you are protecting yourself against the cleaning people having a safe..and they make you pay for it..i have never ever heard of this before..we paid for the Royal Golden section and it still wasnt included..which is a complete burn.at the royal golden you get 15 min on the internet and they dont trust you and have to sign you in...i felt like a school kid.Overall..i enjoyed the food, the resort is gorgeous, the staff nice...oh i forgot to mention how rude and unwelcoming the check instaff in Royal golden were .... one in particular..Rose..oh my god..she never welcomed us....told us the safe costs 35.00, wouldnt help us book restaurants, told us to come back even though we were in the time stated you were allowed to do so, and at the end said...oh here is your welcome drink...and handed us warm orange juice as we were leaving.overall i would recommend this..I would definitely recommend Ambar over royal golden..you get turndown each night but best of all you get a private pool for that section..with no kids!!! they keep advertising it is 15.00 to upgrade...so i am guessing it is 210.00\/week extra per couple..i think we paid more to have golden..so we got burned..email me if you like reenak@shaw.ca ","annotations":[{"endOffset":154,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":150},{"endOffset":1245,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1241},{"endOffset":1275,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1271}]}
