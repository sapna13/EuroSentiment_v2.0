{"text":"Don't do it!! My boyfriend and I were very dissatisfied with the new Barcelo Raval hotel in Barcelona when we went on their opening weekend.We understand that the hotel was in its opening days and the staff were still being trained and getting used to the systems in place, however this does not excuse the attitude of some of the staff, in particular the concierge\/security and the service that we received.We arrived in the early hours of Friday morning, checked in and went to our room. I had a shower and it flooded the bedroom! I phoned down to reception and they said we had two options; we could stay in the room (why we would want to stay in a flooded room is beyond me!) or move. I requested that we move and we were shown to a new room along the corridor. This was a huge inconvenience as we had unpacked our belongings. The man that showed us to our new room also said that this had happened in various other rooms so I find it unbelievable that this wasn't checked in our room before we were checked into it.On Friday we arrived back at the hotel at approx 5pm and our room had still not been cleaned. The cleaner finally came round at about 5.30pm but we were in our room relaxing and didn't want to have to leave. This should have been cleaned in the morning and not in the evening. We wanted to hire bikes for the day on Saturday so on Friday pm I called down to reception and asked for recommendations for bike hire. I was told that they would look into it and get back to me. I never received a call back. Again very poor customer service for a 4* hotel.On Saturday morning we awoke at approx 10am and we had no lite breakfast waiting on our door. I called down to reception to ask where it was and they said they would send one up. 20 mins later we still had no breakfast so I called down again and once again no breakfast arrived. After a third call they finally managed to send up our breakfast 40 mins after we had to call and ask for it, which we shouldn't have had to do in the first place. I received no apology for this delay and when it arrived it was the same breakfast as the day before. I would have thought you would have provided a variety for the cost.On Friday night there was demonstration outside the hotel which was highly threatening and we received no explanation from the hotel staff as to what was going on. The hotel was being covered in graffiti, there were eggs and bottles being thrown at the doors and windows and it was a deeply unnerving experience. There were numerous guests in the lobby waiting to go out and we just got told to move away from the doors with no explanation or apology. We wanted to leave to go for dinner and were ushered out the back door as the front door has been locked and was surrounded by demonstrators. Again there was no explanation or apology and this was truly despicable customer service.On numerous occasions upon entering the hotel we were also asked by the concierge\/security where we were going and if we were staying there. It was the same man every day that asked the same questions and made us feel most unwelcome. If I pay to stay in a 4* establishment I don't expect to feel targeted by the staff and made to feel as if we shouldn't be staying there.I would also like to comment regarding the lighting in the rooms, there were too many gadgets and lights everywhere that make it very difficult to get a good nights sleep, also the soundproofing in the hotel is appalling and we could here the footsteps from the room upstairs, noise from next door and here the voices in the corridors at 4 in the morning word for word.The rooms also had no bins so we had to pile up our rubbish on the side, not only is this highly unhygienic, it is very unsightly and messy for guests. Also we had an espresso machine and tea bags, yet we had no mugs and coffee cups to go with it. Again this is very poorly thought out and bad customer service.All in all the stay at your hotel was unenjoyable and a complete farce and the fact that it was the opening weekend can not be used as an excuse.
