{"text":"Positive overall We stayed at the Icaria for a week in mid August, a family of five. On the positive, check in was fine  we found the staff generally friendly  helpful. Rooms were roomy  modern, a feature of the whole hotel  everything was generally clean. Breakfast was fine although cooked items tended to be cold. Other food provided was mostly good. The terrace area  pool were excellent  service quite good. There's a nice hot tub next to the smallish pool  constant steam room  sauna in the back areas. Location was good if you want to be near the beach  there's a decent choice of restaurants all within 10 mins walk. Taxis are cheap  only 6\/7 Euros into town. Internet access was very good.On the downside, no porter, you have to lug your own stuff around which was a pain. Coffe\/tea making facilities were advertised but no tea\/coffee provided  requests met with blank expressions. Luggage is stored in an area next to reception - not particularly safe  I noticed this was the same with all guests luggage. Major hassle was the keycard system, room cards were needed for the lift  along with almost every guest I spoke to it worked only half the time sending us all over the place. Health  safety check is required on the fire escape\/stair doors, floors 1  2 were sticking  would be dangerous in an emergency.All the family enjoyed the stay  we'd probably use the Icaria again.
