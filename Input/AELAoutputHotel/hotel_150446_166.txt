{"text":"Needs an update My husband and I vacationed at the Intercontinental the week before Memorial Day Weekend. Let me preface this by saying that the staff at the hotel couldn't be nicer. They were polite, helpful and friendly. The room, (we had a standard) could definitely use an overhaul. The size was generous, but the furnishings were tired looking. The couch was saggy, and the bed had the same tired looking bedspread that weighed a ton. I don't understand why a hotel in the tropics would not opt for lighter, more attractive bedding to enhance the appearance of the room.The bathroom ,again generous in size, had poor lighting. Ths shower was almost dungeon like. There was no magnifying make-up mirror, so ladies, if you need that to primp, you may want to bring your own. Due to the poor lighting, I had to purchase a mirror and apply my make-up at the the desk. The pleasantness came to a streaking halt as the Friday of Memorial Day weekend was upon us. Hello Coney Island! The guests that came at that point were loud, played radios on the beach, and left their garbage strewn all over the place. I felt sorry for the staff . At that point, I was happy to be leaving the following day. That same night, our neighbors were blasting music at midnight and proceeded to deny it to the security staff that I had to call. I would go back, during a quiet week. If you are looking to relax without the NY\/NJ crowd, make sure you do not going during a busy time. ( I am a New Yorker by the way)You may definitely want to try some of the local restaurnats as the hotel food is quite expensive. The nightlife at the El San Juan was a lot more lively on Friday and Saturday nights, so we found ourselves walking there in the evenings.
