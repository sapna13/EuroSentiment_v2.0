{"text":"Great budget option for higher-end travelers We just stayed at the Hotel Luxembourg Parc for a night in Paris on the way back from the south of France and were really pleasantly suprised. I wanted to review it especially for people who typically go for expensive hotels but are looking for something less punishing on the wallet in Paris, especially during high season.Last time in Paris we were at the Crillon and before that the Tremoille, but for this short stay we figured we didn't need all the extras for 800 euros per night (the rate quoted at the Crillon). At the Luxembourg Parc we paid 280 euros per night for an executive room and got a room nearly the size of our last room at the Crillon, furnishings along the same antique-inspired vein (even if less refined than those at the Crillon), and a very nice marble bathroom bigger many in Paris. Wood floors, old wood-beams on the ceilings (an old building). A nice room.Since our window faced the interior courtyard, rather than the rue Vaugirard, which is noisy, our room was quiet, though a tad dark. Free wireless access was a perk. The king-sized bed was awkward, not because they put to twins together, as many European hotels do, but because each side had its own mini-comforter. A big one would be better for a couple using a king-sized bed. But that was the worst complaint about the room.The hotel basically offers no real services; you pay for a nice room and that's what you use. No room service, unless you want them to bring you a continental breakfast in the morning. The breakfast downstairs is worth skipping, though I admit we decided this on looking not eating: croissants on a warming plate, tired-looking fruit salad, etc. We had a less expensive, fresh breakfast a few blocks away. The hotel was installing a gym while we were there, so that could be nice later. But basically this is a place to stay to sleep, bathe, rest, not to indulge as you would at a luxury hotel, and in that it provides quite comfortably.Last thing to add, for comparison's sake, is that we stayed here after having done a night 5 days earlier at the Duc de Saint-Simon, also a small left-bank hotel, very popular with American ladies, and geared towards the well-heeled going for a quaint budget option. Must say that we both preferred the Hotel Luxembourg Parc much more, primarily because the room was just that much nicer, and the Lux Parc was around $100 cheaper, too.
