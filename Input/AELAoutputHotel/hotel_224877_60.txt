{"text":"Great Stay in Downtown Miami We chose the Mandarin Oriental as we felt to old for South Beach and we were glad we made the right choice. The hotel is lovely - all rooms have balconies and we chose the Executive Suite - lots of space and a lovely bathroom. A cab to SoBe was $30 and if you're staying at the M.O. then this is a small price to pay. The service was very good, prices for meals and drinks expensive as you would expect - no point in whinging about a $12 martini if your paying hundreds for the room. For those of us visitors without cars, taxis were easy to get and there is a new complex called Mary Brickell Village which has some good restaurants and is a 10 minute walk away. The in-room facilities have it all, although no flat screen TVs yet. The amenities are Aromatherapy Associates of London - smell of lavender and rose - delightful, conditioner is great. Load of fresh fluffy towels.Pool is a bit small but adequate, the gym well equipped but not used much.Azul was a fantastic meal - delicious contempory food and slick service but the only detractor was that it arrived on a cold plate. The only other detractor was the bar - off to one side of reception and seemed like a last minute thought - slick service and a list of over 200 martini - we were sorry we didn't stay long enough to try them all.
