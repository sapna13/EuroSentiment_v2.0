{"text":"What a find, great neighbourhood too! We were late booking two rooms for the end of a recent roadtrip that tooks us from Phoenix to San Francisco. The only hotels that seemed to have availability were motor inns - we chose the Chelsea, having read previous trip advisor reviews. It wasn't what we were expecting, as we hadn't understood what a Motor Inn was - it has just a very small reception, and a car park (which was free and an absolute must in San Francisco, because buses, cable cars and on foot is the only way to do this city!)The only downside was that it was positioned on Lombard Street, the main road through the city to the Golden Gate Bridge and our room was quite noisy as it looked over that road. However, it was much more than compensated by the standard of the rooms that were roomy, extremely comfortable, spotlessly clean, and serviced every day (new fluffy white towels and crisp bedlinen). The hotel reception staff were very helpful and even booked us in on-line for our return flights. Having not been to San Francisco before, we had wanted to be either on Fishermans Wharf or near Union Square - thankfully those hotels had no rooms, or we would never have stayed in this part of town and never got to visit the local restaurants it had to offer, where the food was far superior to that offered by the more touristy restaurants (McCormack and Kuleto - for example, where the food was good, but not a patch on these locals). If you stay here, make sure you walk South on Filmore street (great restaurants on this street too) to visit Union Street - Cow Hollow - about three blocks down, where you will find fantastic individual boutique type shops and a very wide choice of restaurants. I loved everything about San Francisco, the city, the bay, the views, the people (who couldn't have been more friendly and helpful) and even the fog!! And I'm convinced this hotel's location is what made the experience even better.
