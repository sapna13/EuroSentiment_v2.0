{"text":"Customer Service is Tops at the Clarendon My party of four stayed at the Clarendon July 6-8 to attend the UOP graduation ceremony. Overall, we had a good stay. I enjoyed the color scheme of the rooms and the hotel in general as it reminded me of Southwestern flavors from my time living in California and Texas. The rooms were clean, the beds were extremely comfortable, and we enjoyed the continental breakfast. Customer service is great at Clarendon thanks to Justin - he is The Man. Clarendon offers free local transportation via hotel vehicle driven by one of their staff. Justin made sure that we were driven to breakfast, to the drug store, to Arizona Center, and later in the evening back to the hotel. When we wanted to switch rooms at 11PM because it was just too hot up on the 4th floor to get some sleep (we had a 6AM flight back - I have since been told by the hotel folks that they are putting a new roof on that will greatly reduce the heat on the 4th floor), Justin found us another room on a lower floor right away. And when my wife left some garments in the other room, he made sure we got them as soon as we alerted him to the situation. That Saturday, July 7, I think Justin must have worked 16 hours as another employee didn't make it in. It didn't matter if we needed him at 10AM or 11PM, Justin provided top quality service and our group appreciated his time and attention.I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable, clean hotel with staff second to none. I will stay at this hotel again should my business take me to Phoenix.R.L. JenkinsChevy Chase, Maryland ","annotations":[]}
