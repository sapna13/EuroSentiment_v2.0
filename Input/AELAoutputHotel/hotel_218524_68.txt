{"text":"Not the same the second time My wife and I just returned from Excellence where we stayed from 11\/21-11\/26. This was our second time staying at Excellence and was far less enjoyable than our first visit in July 2007. Here are some of the issues we noticed this time: * The pool chair\/towel insanity. As previous reviewers have mentioned, most pool chairs are reserved with towels and personal belongings by 9:00 AM and all towels are gone from the towel shelves by this time as well. So if you have a massage in the morning or go horse back riding at 10 AM or simply want to sleep in you literally will have no place to sit at the pool and no way to get a pool towel. There seems to be no recognition from the staff that this is a problem. * The food. While I appreciate the resort's variety of food options, including Asian, French, Mexican, pizza, hamburgers\/sandwiches, and Italian, the result is that none of the food is particularly good. The best food is the simplest, like breakfast buffet items and food from the Grill like hamburgers. Asking chefs in a tropical resort to be experts in Japanese or French food is going to lead to disappointment for most people. Some of the food was okay, but we left dinner most night unsatisfied and sometimes still hungry. Compounding the problem is that the menus are written by workers with a limited command of English, describing food that they probably don't have a good idea about. As a result you sometimes literally have no idea what you are ordering.* Sickness. Like others have mentioned, both my wife and I got sick during our time at Excellence. Since we never left the resort, we can only assume that some food or drink at the resort was the problem. We have traveled to various places in the Caribbean and to Tanzania in Africa and have never gotten sick like we did at Excellence. Not fun.While we enjoyed aspects of our trip, we were disappointed that we would have to deal with these issues at a 5 star resort.
