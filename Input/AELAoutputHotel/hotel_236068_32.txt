{"text":"Great Hotel We've stayed in February 2007 at the 'Hotel Washington'. The staff welcomed us professional  friendly during the checkin. We've been informed perfectly about the public transportation  sight-seeing in Amsterdam. Our room was a double room ensuite, which was located on the third floor (no elevator present, high dutch stairs!!). The staff asked us kindly if we needed help with the luggage  helped us up to bring the luggage to our room. We've understand that the stairs are quite normal  all standard in whole Amsterdam!The room was quite large  clean. It was equipped with a large bed for 2. There were towels  small bathroom-ameneties provided by the hotel, which was a nice service of them. Breakfast was including in the price, which was quite standard, but good enough to start your day. We've asked if the hotel could arrange us transportation for our checkout day, cause we had to leave very early. They've arranged us a fine  luxury cab, who brought us to the airport.We can't understand some bad reviews that have been written. This is maybe of the basic rooms they've got. These are without bathroom in the room itself (shared bathroom facilities, shared with 4 rooms)  they're located on the fourth floor.My question is: What are you expecting of a 2-star hotel ?? Hotel Washington is much above a 2-star hotel. It's clean, large, save  located in a quite area. If you require much higer service, you can simply stay at a 5-star hotel, for a much, much higher price!!! I will definitely come back to Hotel Washington on my next trip to Amsterdam  recommend it to everyone!!!
