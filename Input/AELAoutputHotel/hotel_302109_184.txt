{"text":"Shangri-La Fantastic Opulence at a Nice Price I have stayed at the shang a number of times for business and pleasure as my company has a good corporate rate. Myself and my wife were last there in November 06 and decided to go for a Horizon club delux room as all the tower wing rooms were booked out due to a media conference. Well the extra cost was certainly worth it. As always the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and nothing was too much. As I stated above we booked a delux room - and everthing was fine until we flushed the toilet! It overflowed and flooded the bathroom. Not very pleasant!!! Maintenance and housekeeping were prompt to attend to the issue. However, this happend on 2 further occasions. On the second day we had enough and complained that the problem was becoming intolerable. The Horizon club manager suggested that we transfer to another room and made the necessary arrangements. Well I must say that we were pleasantly surprised when we entered the room and discovered that we were upgraded to a Horizon club suite at no extra cost. We certainly were not expecting this.After the little upset with the toilet issue the rest of our stay was fantastic!!! The horizon club is excellent with complimentary cocktails and drinks each evening from 5 - 7pm, afternoon tea, free business centre and complimentary breakfast in the Blu restaurant over looking the city.For such a small island Singapore is a great place. We lived there for a short time a few years back and have travelled there many times for business and We are returing Singapore in early July to catch the great singapore sales and are booked into the Shangri-la. However, this time we have booked a Valley wing delux room with all the benefits! Can't wait !I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel! If you get the chance definitely stay there, its worth it just for the buffet breakfast.
