{"text":"Great holiday My partner and I and 2 friends returned from Ocean Sand on the 20th of December. We upgraded to First class on the First Choice flight which was great.Arrived at Punta Cana airport which all went smoothly, within half hour we had our luggage and was on the bus to our resort. The journey to Ocean Sand was about 35 minutes from the airport. Check in at the resort was quite quick as well, you are given your room number and your bags are bought to you within 15-20 minutes.The choice of food is fantastic, there is a main buffet, Route 66 (burgers, ribs, steak), Italian (pasta, lasagne), Mexican (tacos, fajitas), there were two other restaurants but I can't comment on them as we didn't use them as you have to pay a supplement. The coffee shop (Mike's Coffee) is a must, make sure you order the cheesecake!! There is also a Sports Bar which shows various sports and has a pool table.Staff were very friendly and its not necessary to tip, we tipped in total about $15 for the whole 2 weeks we were there.The beach is very nice, fairly busy but there were always plenty of sun beds available, same goes for the pool. If you walk towards the beach and to the left, you will come across some beach huts which sell a bit of everything - cigarettes, water sports, excursions, wooden models, henna tattoos etc.....The guys there can be quite annoying they shout out at you to get your attention, the best thing to do is either ignore them by not even looking by the huts or walk to the right of the beach instead!There is a dive school on the beach as well as my partner and our friend did their advanced open water PADI course but they did say there isn't an awful lot of fish to see. We had previously read in other reviews before we went away about how things were stolen from their rooms, we had no problems at all, we used the safe in the wardrobe which was perfectly ok. The rooms were quite big, we had 2 queen size beds and a sofa bed for the two of us! The jacuzzi bath was great. The only problem with the room was it smelt musty sometimes so you always had to keep the AC on which wasn't a problem but sometimes it got too cold! People have also mentioned about the poor lighting in the rooms, to be honest we never found this a problem, they could have done with being a little brighter but they were fine for us. There is also a TV in the room, plenty of storage space for clothes as well.The shop on the resort grounds sold a lot of different stuff including sun cream (approx $13 a bottle), cigarettes ($35 for 200), crisps, chocolate bars, every kind of medicine you can think of, souvenirs etc. There is also a jewellers, cigar shop and a small clothes shop. We went to the bowling alley which was good fun, and upstairs they have 4 pool tables.We never went to any shows or the disco so I am unable to comment on them.Please be aware that the resort grounds get very slippery when it rains as I found out! There is a shuttle bus that runs round the resort which is very handy when its raining.Quite a few locals turn up at the weekends so the pool tends to be a bit busier and they seem to all sit by the swim up bar which makes it a bit akward to get drinks.Overall we had a good holiday and would recommend it ","annotations":[{"endOffset":561,"mention":"burgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":554},{"endOffset":591,"mention":"pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":586},{"endOffset":600,"mention":"lasagne","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Lasagne"],"startOffset":593},{"endOffset":617,"mention":"tacos","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Taco"],"startOffset":612},{"endOffset":626,"mention":"fajitas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fajita"],"startOffset":619},{"endOffset":626,"mention":"fajitas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fajita"],"startOffset":619},{"endOffset":755,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":749},{"endOffset":775,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":769},{"endOffset":822,"mention":"cheesecake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cheesecake"],"startOffset":812},{"endOffset":822,"mention":"cheesecake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cheesecake"],"startOffset":812},{"endOffset":2548,"mention":"crisps","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Potato_chip"],"startOffset":2542},{"endOffset":2559,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":2550}]}
