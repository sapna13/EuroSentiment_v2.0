{"text":"Good but just short of great.... We stayed in the Argonaut at the start of a touring holiday of the West Coast USA, in September 2006. The booking was made via the Kimpton website as a package (deluxe room, valet parking and american breakfast).Having travelled from the UK we were a little tired and jet-lagged but the welcome upon arrival was very friendly. After handing over the car keys and luggage we went to check-in. We happened to arrive at the same time as the free wine session which was great fun, and value! The lobby is very well presented with a nautical theme, and all staff are very friendly and accomodating.Upon entering our room we found it excellently presented continuing the nautical theme. The bed was large and comfortable with a huge mirror on the wall. There was also a large cookie waiting for us, which didn't last long ;-)However, there were a couple of issues that could have been avoided but were probably exaggerated by our jet lag:- First off the room was supposed to be no smoking but you could smell smoke, especially when first entering the room. There was also ash just outside the bathroom on the carpet. - Secondly, the noise. We were facing the Irish bar and the rooms are not well insulated. You can hear pretty much everything including trams turning raound, music (that's ok), motorbikes and worst of all a dumpster which arrived at about 5am and seemed to be right outside our window for ages. Not good. Both nights sleep were heavily interrupted by the noise, which is a shame as it is otherwise an excellent hotel. We were staying with friends who had an internal facing room and they didn't notice any noise.Breakfast at the Blue Mermaid was good but not exceptional. The service was a bit patchy to be honest.So, overall a potentially excellent hotel let down by poor sound insulation and on this occasion incomplete cleaning. However, we would go back - but to an internal or ocean facing room only.
