{"text":"A little bit of perfection We stayed at the PC Princess March 3-10th...not a drop of rain for 7 days...it was so hot we sought shelter under the majestic palm trees for a little relief. We stayed at this resort 5 years ago and loved it so much we returned to the adult only side. The buildings and their warm bold colours stand out amongst the regal green palms and beautifully and immaculately groomed gardens. Everyone is busy working each day to clean walkways and the gardens...it's really breathtaking. We had a second floor room in block 4 ~ 2 double beds, sunken living room with day bed, lots of storage for clothes... computer in your room if you want internet access ($40 U.S. for the week) ~ Fridge filled with beer and water etc, large bathroom...it's all so clean and comfortable, but how much time do you really spend in your room anyway? The beach is like a photograph...warm turquoise waters...little seaweed...waves that encourage even the most timid to rent a boogyboard and try bodysurfing...it's so much fun. What can you say about the drinks...their pleniful, tasty and quickly catch up with you...before you know it the sun is going down, you've spent the entire day enjoying the hot caribbean sun and it's time for siesta. We tipped the bar tender each day a couple of U.S. dollars ~ this goes a long way to encourage quick service!! We used the buffet on the Caribe side...it's much bigger, better selection of food and a 5 minute walk....Al a carte were good...we tried Italian, Tex Mex and Chinese....everything is beautifully presented and taste excellent...not a wine drinker but I heard it was not very good...stick to the bahama mamas. Lots of activites around the resorts...tennis, volleyball, archery etc...staff is amazing...always friendly and smiling ~ the Dominican people are so welcoming. This was our 11th time to Punta Cana...no wonder we keep coming back. I would highly recommend this resort.
