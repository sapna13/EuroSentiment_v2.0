{"text":"Great Location, Great Price! If you prefer low price, seconds away from the beach and park, and a nice view from your lanai, then I highly recommend Park Shore. If you prefer georgeous rooms with great service, then I wouldn't recommend Park Shore.I believe the saying goes You get what you pay for Well, it depends how you look at it- if you were paying for the close proximity to the beach and breathtaking view of the ocean from your bed, then I think I got more than what I paid for for the 10th floor partial view room for only 85 dollars a night.If I ignore the fact that the beach is across the street, then I would say that the saying is true- Our family had 4 rooms- each would have simple problems but no big deal- our room- 1019 was really small (though coming from Japan, and after reading reviews stating the size, I didn't mind it), it only had a shower, and the floors were not so clean. Let's just say on the first day I didn't want to take my shoes off to walk on the carpet, but by the end of the week I was walking around all four rooms and the hallways barefoot. Oh, and when we arrived, one of the lamps had a busted light bulb, and another one busted when I turned it on, giving us all a bit of a jump! Oh, and the one bag of coffee a day seems to only be replaced with a new bag if you use the mugs. (I tried hiding the bag and the sugar and cream on the one day we didn't have coffee, in hopes that when the maid cleaned the room she would give us a new one, only to find later that she didn't---and on another day, my father gave the coffee from his room to my grandfather's room, then didn't get new coffee in his room the next day.) Room 1021 was fine- great view!!! missing one of the doors that hide the tv and fridge. Oh- it had a bathtub but you had to keed the water trickle out otherwise it sounded like a cat was crying!Room 1019 had a nice view too- and a bathtub-and had both the doors that hide the tv but one of them was broken! And the cord to the phone had to be replaced because the plastic thingy that hooks the receiver to the phone was broken off.Room 1007 had a full view of Diamond Head and the beach, though more expensive. In my opinion, the view from the partial view rooms were just as great, just no Diamond head from lanai seen, though easy enough to see from front door! No complaints were reported to me from my brother who stayed there except that he didn't get the big pillow that the other rooms had and when he called to ask for one, they forgot to bring it to him, but the next day, he called again and they brought it right away.All in all, it was a wonderful time for the price we paid.All in all- my family and I had a great time ","annotations":[{"endOffset":102,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":98},{"endOffset":1407,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1401},{"endOffset":1407,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1401},{"endOffset":1565,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1559},{"endOffset":1632,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1626},{"endOffset":1874,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1870},{"endOffset":1874,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1870},{"endOffset":1874,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1870}]}
