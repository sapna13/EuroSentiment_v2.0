{"text":"We miss Seattle... and the Days Inn!!! My wife and I stayed here in the middle of September on a 4-day trip to Seattle. I believe the hotel you stay at kind of shapes your vacation more than anything else, and the Days Inn really did that. I was very skeptical of the hotel after paying less than a premier price and reading some shifty reviews. I mean, it's not a 5-star $300\/night hotel, but it was a great little place to stay. The continental breakfast was very good... I craved the waffles for days after I got back home. The staff was also very accommodating. My wife is pregnant and got sick while we were there off some bad Chinese food. I asked the receptionist where the closest hospital was, just in case, and she pulled out a pre-printed mapquest map to the hospital and give it to us for free. Later on, on a whim I asked them if there was a Wal-Mart nearby, and she pulled out yet another mapquest map to the Wal-Mart and gave us that for free!!! The cleaning lady came in and cleaned our room every day while we were gone and did a fantastic job without disturbing the possessions we left in the room (we have bad experiences of our stuff being stolen by the cleaning crews of other hotels). Their parking is very accommodating, and they have a nice lounge in the breakfast area with a computer with internet access and a big TV. They also have a pool which doesn't look too inviting, but it was the fall when we stayed so maybe the 60-degree weather didn't put us in the pool mood. We will be returning to Seattle, and we will definitely consider the Tukwila Days Inn first.
