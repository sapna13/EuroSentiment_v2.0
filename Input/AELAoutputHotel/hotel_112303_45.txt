{"text":"MIxed feelings about the Diva The best things about hotel diva are the staff ( all extremely pleasant), and the location (right near Union Square). My husband and I arrived well before the appointed check-in time, and were very pleased to find out they could check us in (we figured we would just store our bags, so this was very nice). The room, however, was extremely small (shoe-box size, no room even to put our very small travel bags so we could open them) and smelled VERY musty. The bathroom was tiny and poorly designed (tub\/shower combo and toilet in the bathroom, while the sink was in the hotel room itself -- kind of gross in our opinion). The bed was very small (a double?) but we had reserved a queen. When it became clear that opening the windows was clearly not helping the musty smell, we decided to complain, as we were staying for 5 nights, and our rate was quite pricey (approx. $250\/night). The gentleman at the desk was quite receptive to our complaints (his name was Jay) and he offered to move us the following day and to send up someone to febreeze the room. This helped a bit with the odor, but we were told this happens a lot in the back rooms of the hotel when it rains (and it rains a lot in San Francisco -- so beware these rooms!). True to his word, Jay did indeed move us the following day to a more spacious, better designed and clean smelling room. I felt very pleased with the solution and felt the hotel took our complaints seriously. All in all, not a bad hotel, but nothing special. The rooms are rather sparse (ok in the sense that we liked the minimalist, modern decor), but there are few perks -- not even a minibar fridge in the rooms and very bare bones furnishings. Not a luxurious hotel by any means and nothing standout or amazing about it. ","annotations":[]}
