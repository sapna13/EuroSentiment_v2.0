{"text":"Nadia is N-I-C-E I was there with my wife and a group of friends. We had 3 rooms total. two doubles and a single. I am from the USA and they were from UK. We stayed a total of 7 days and some had to leave in 4 days.I had a very nice room, although small as all Amsterdam Hotels are unless you are willing to pay 200 euro per night. I also must add the only time you will go to the room is to sleep and how much room is necessary for that. There is a safe in the room and a hairdryer. It was a bit dark and I asked for a lamp and it was delivered. They advertised wireless internet but at first it wasn't working. I must say that the owner\/manager along with some outside help worked around the clock to make it work perfectly. So if wireless is what you need they have it and it was fast.The room was clean and we had a beautiful view of the canal with windows that opened, that made it even better as the church bells were very pleasant to listen to. The room was cleaned every day and the entire staff was very friendly. The beds were comfortable and the pillows just the way I like them. I felt very much at ease and comfortable here. The same 7 days at a few other places were 800+ euros and we went and looked at them. We found that we were winners at 650 euro. The only bad part of the whole experience is the steep steps, but if steps don't bother you as they didn't our 40-50 yr old group, then you won't have a problem. It was sort of an experience and a good laugh when you see the steps. Also if you like hot breakfast go across the street to Jennifers and tell the gentleman running the place you want Over easy Eggs like Angelo as he now knows what they are. Please Tell the Nadia owner Angelo, sends his regards. I will stay there again!!!
