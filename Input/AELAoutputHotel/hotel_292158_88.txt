{"text":"Great hotel Me and my wife stayed at the Palladium Punta Cana from June 7 to 12th. Due to a medical issue we had to leave early but for the few days we were there we were thorougly impressed. The airport in punta cana was a breeze to get through.. No problems at all the the resort was about 30-40 minutes from the airport.The grounds were beautiful. Lots of palm trees and flower beds. The workers always kept things looking top notch.The rooms were very nice. The first room we had, the air conditioner didnt work. We couldnt adjust it. So we had a new room the next day with the help of our Westjet Rep Dominique Gosselin. The new room was basically the same thing, except the AC worked (trust me, you'll need it).Most staff were friendly but a few of the reception staff were somewhat rude and seemed like they didnt want to help you.All the bartenders and waitressing staff always had glasses full with drinks. Never had a problem getting drinks or waiting in lines.Food was definatley just alright. Breakfast and lunch were great. But we really had to stretch it at dinner to find something we liked. There was always fries, pizza, pasta, bread, fruit but that can get old really fast. We never left feeling hungry tho!Beach was beautiful but not very big. Sand was a very soft white and the ocean was a beautiful blue. Couldnt ask for anything more. The pools were always clean and maintained. They were shocked every night and filled in the early morning. We never had a problem getting benches to lay on at the pool or beach. Just get up a bit early and put your towels down just in case.All in all the hotel was great. Could have had a better selection of food but it wasnt that bad at all.Would definatley consider this resort again in the future if travelling to the dominican!
