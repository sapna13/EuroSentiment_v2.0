{"text":"Great place for relaxing and having fun We just spent a week at the Paradisus Punta Cana with two other couples. The resort is beautiful and the staff was always friendly. The grounds are huge, but there is a bus that travels through the grounds that you can hop on when it drives by.We normally spend a lot of time around the pool, but the beach was so beautiful we spent all but one day on the beach. They had great lounge chairs as well as huge mattresses that were great for catching an afternoon nap. We normally hit the pool late in the afternoon for a few drinks around the pool bar.The rooms had two queen size beds and then a few steps down to a sitting area with 2 love seats. Plenty of room and lots of closet space. Our room was cleaned and replenished everyday, plus turn down service at night.They had a great variety of restaurants and we never at at the buffet once for dinner. We recommend the Chinese, Japanese and Romantica restaurants. The food was good, and no one had any stomach problems. They tell you up front not to drink the water out of the tap in your room, but there is bottled water everywhere and our room fridge was restocked every day. The also have room service, which came in handy for late night pizza.The staff at the bars was always friendly and upbeat. The drinks were strong, especially late afternoon at the pool bar. There seemed to be live music somewhere everynight, or you could just find a quite lounge and visit.A lot of the staff did not speak English, but hey you are in their country, learn a little bit of Spanish and creative hand gestures we had no problem communicating.The guys golfed three days and said it was a great course - 27 holes. We walked down the beach to town one day - its a good hike. There is also a small shopping area about 1 block from the hotel entrance. There is a complementary bus that goes into town every two hours.It was a great trip and one of the better All Inclusives we have been to.
