{"text":"Great Location I took this hotel on a recommendation via the Tripadvisor forum. The stay was booked a few months ago, just before the credit crisis was in full blown mode, so at the time I thought my successful bartering of a $15 discount on a queen room was a coup. Maybe the way things are $149 a night might get you a bit more, I don't know. Anyway, by pre-crash standards its a good deal. Location is great, rooms are modern, clean, good spec, loads of TV channels. Rooms are small - even the queen rooms, but that's already well documentedThe breakfast and lounge for us are a bonus (I use the present tense as I'm writing this up during our stay). Two free to use high speed internet terminals (always available, never a queue) is something not always complimentary. The breakfast also saves you a few bucks on your holiday budget and for most people the breakfast would be fine. A previous reviewer described it as little more than hard bagels and bitter coffee, but that is unfair. There are muffins, fresh bananas, apples, oranges, doughnuts, tea, orange juice and cereal. The fruit and beverages are available free in the lounge 24 hours in fact, plus the daily papers. There are no egg\/quarter of a pig options, so if that is what rings your bell then the breakfast will be no bonus to youTraffic noise is something that seems to divide opinion, and I can say that from our sixth floor front facing room you can in fact hear the sounds from the street, but they are by no means insufferable. I guess it depends on what you are already accustomed to. I do appreciate that some people will be used to deathly quiet nights and a small amount of noise can be very unsettling. But that's a city centre location for you, nothing to do with the hotelReception\/front desk staff? Some say can't do enough, some say cold and frosty. Well ... I can see both sides. What they do is get you what you want and answer all your questions without any fuss, what they don't do is fawn all over you, so again, if this is important to you ...All in all because of the location and general specification in context of a very competitive rate, I'd certainly stay here again ","annotations":[{"endOffset":950,"mention":"bagels","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bagel"],"startOffset":944},{"endOffset":968,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":962},{"endOffset":968,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":962},{"endOffset":1007,"mention":"muffins","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Muffin"],"startOffset":1000},{"endOffset":1050,"mention":"doughnuts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Doughnut"],"startOffset":1041},{"endOffset":1055,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1052}]}
