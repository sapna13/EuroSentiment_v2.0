{"text":"Loved the Oceans Sands We have been to Punta Cana many times in the past and this by far was the best resort we have stayed at. The food was excellent, especially the steak at the Italian and the ribs at Route 66. The pool, rooms and restaurants were all very clean and neat. We had a room in building 10 facing the pool and the ocean and it had a jacuzzi tub and a king size bed. We could see them cleaning the pool from our room every morning, so we knew it was safe for swimming. Mikes was the best, we went there everynight after supper for our cappucinos and dessert, it has a really nice atmosphere. My only complaints were the room could have had better lighting and the time share people at the main buffet, but thats their job and their offices are right adjacent to the buffet so thats why they are always bugging you there. The staff everywhere were very friendly, the maids work hard and the help in the restaurants was fantastic, and the bartenders were the best, if you gave them a tip the first night they remembered who you were and you would get great service for the rest of the week.The main buffet for breakfast was excellent, the buffet at the beach had the same food everyday but it hads enough variety that you could still find something different everyday. We didn't have the best weather but that we had no control over, we made the best of it. All in all we had a great weeks holidays and would recommend the Ocean Sands as a great place to go.
