{"text":"fantastic First time in the Dominican. Stayed for 6 days in Royal Service the last week of April. Traveled with another couple. Airport was fine. You get off on the tarmac and have to pay $10 per person to enter the country. It is supposed to pay for the highway. The ride to resort was fine, about 25 min, and we had a mini bus with ACRooms were very clean and AC worked great. Maid service did a great job and left whatever we asked for. The main advantage of RS is that you are close to the beach and they have another option for breakfast , lunch and a happy hour in their lounge. There is also a smaller RS pool which is nice to go to because it is not as crowded or as noisy as the main pool. If you get RS, tell them immediatley upon arrival at the resort because you have to get a ride to the other side to check in, NOT at the main lobby. Don't waste your time standing in line as we did.We spent most of our time at the RS pool but the main pool seemed to be more fun at the pool bar. The drinks were plentyful and strong at both. The beach was the best part. It was very clean, white sand, blue water, and palm trees. There were plenty of chairs but you had to get up early to get a Bali Bed, which is a necessity. The sun is very hot and it is nice to lay under the grass huts in the shade. Try to get both if you can. Bring sun screen. You definatley need it and it is very expensive at the resort.There are 9 places to eat. We liked every one that we went to. There are alot of choices at the buffet. I was a little worried with some of the reviews on the food but we did not have a bad meal the entire time. The best place for lunch is the buffet at the beach restaurant. But if you want a quick burger or hot dog, go to the main pool bar. We thought all the dinners were good. Especially liked the Steak House and French. We had wine at every dinner and got great service. Make reservations the first day if you want to eat at the French or Japanese restaurants. The Japanese was good but it is like every other one around, and I would have rather tried the Brazilian or Mexican.Not much of a night life. They have a show starting at 10 PM every night in the main lobby area. They also have one bar there and they play latino music. We saw three shows and they were just OK. The magic show was the best. We enjoyed going to the beach bar at night and relaxing.Are main purpose of this vacation was relaxation and it was the perfect place for it. There was planty to do during the day if you want to, like horse back riding, snorkeling, excursions, water activities, but we really enjoyed lying at the beach or pool.You do not have to tip, but we did. I don't know if we got any better service but the staff really work hard. We gave a few bucks to the maid every day and tipped the waiter at dinner every night. We would defininatly go back to the Paradisus. We heard nighmares on the way back from other travelers that their hotels had bugs, leaky roofs, poor food. Just remember, a 5 star hotel in the DR is like a 3 star in the US.
