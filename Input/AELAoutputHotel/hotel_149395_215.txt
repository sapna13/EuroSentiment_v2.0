{"text":"Fabulous wedding  We just returned from our trip to the paradisus punta cana. We hosted our wedding there with 34 of our closest family and friends, ages ranging from 28 - 70 years of age. A fabulous time was had by all. I did not visit the resort before chosing this location for the wedding, over the last year I read ALL trip advisor reports. I tend to disagree with allot that was posted. Here are my thoughts on the hotel.Royal Service - we upgraded since it was our honeymoon as well. The lounge with breakfast, snacks and dinner was nice, although we very rarely used it. Private pool and beach area was cozy - great beds! Free internet in lounge, conceirgeassistance there was great for activities and restaurant reservations.Our Room - we had a ocean view royal service Jr. suite. Room was very clean, air conditioning work just fine. We did not see one bug in the room. Additional beverages we brought quickly when requsted. We received little gifts each night,Beach - Bavaro beach is one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen, and I have traveled to quite a few Caribbean islands. There are no rocks, shells and very little sea weed on the beach. Most days the waves were quite large.Restaurants - They have a great variety and all were pretty good.I had low expectations being it is a all inclusive resort so I was plesantly surprised. We enjoyed the hamburgers and grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch when we didn't want to the leave the beach or pool.Hotel Staff - I was also extremely surprised that they all were amazing after reading so many negative reports. I speak very little spanish and language was never a barrier. You are always greated with a smile. We did try to tip a little but no-one appreared to be searching for a tip.Activities - We took advantage of the snorkling and horseback riding on the beach. Both were very fun. There is allot you can do there without spending additional $$I hope this helps some of you looking to visit the resort. Oh I forgot the only negative thing I experienced all week....bug bites,they were not mosquitos but sand fleas I think. I kept getting more and more over the coarse of the week I was there. Pretty amazing trip being this is the only real negative I can think of.
