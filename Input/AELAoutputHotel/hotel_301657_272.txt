{"text":"View not as great as in December but wonderful aircon This is the second time I stayed in this hotel and it was as good an experience as the first time.Although rooms are on the small side the quality of mattress is excellent and the insonorisaion is faultless. Having stayed 2 weeks altogether I was never woken up by a toilet flush or a running bath.During Winter, you can enjoy spectular views and see FujiYama very clearly.This hotel is very central and is 10 mins walk to Ginza where all the best craftmen and luxury brands can be found. Even the old Tokyo Asakuza can be reached in 20 minutes by public transport: you never need a taxi when staying at this hotel.Although the breakfast is expensive at the hotel (~√ä√£¬¢12), the Shiodome will offer all the variety you may be craving for from Indian food to Cheese cake. Another bonus the monumental painting of Taro Akamoto about Hiroshima nuclear bombing is on display until end of August and literally 5 minutes walk from the hotel.To beat the jet lag on arrival, have a walk at Hanna Park ( just behind the hotel) a traditionnal Japanese park with a tea house on a small island in a middle of the lake. If you do wake up early in the next morning do go the fish market ( 15 minutes walk).On your way back to the airport, the hotel organises a limousine shuttle ( coach) stopping only at 2 other hotels in the immediate vincinity for just √ä√£¬¢15. If you have not checked out 1 hour before the time you booked, they will even wake you up to ensure you are not going to miss you flight: this is what I call service!
