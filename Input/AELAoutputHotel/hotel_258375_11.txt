{"text":"A Very Pleasant Surprise We stayed at the Strozzi Palace from April 27 to 29. It was at the end of our family trip to Italy, and it perfect for us.I booked the Strozzi based largely on reviews posted on TripAdvisor. Even though most of the reviews were positive, I was a little concerned by some of the negative ones. However, the deciding factor for me was that the hotel offered a family size room where the four of us could sleep in one room.We drove to Florence from a villa we were staying at in Tuscany. It took us an hour to figure out where the rental car office was located because there was a lot of road construction going on and key roads were blocked. After a lot of frustration returning our car, we took a taxi for the short ride to the Strozzi. The first impression of the hotel is not good; as mentioned in other reviews, the entrance is narrow and dark, and you have to climb a short flight of stairs to get to a very small elevator. Once you take this to the first floor, where reception is location, you are greeted by a very unimpressive looking lobby. So after a long and tiring day, I was a little apprehensive about the hotel.However, our fears were banished once we got off the elevators to the floor where our room was located. Oddly, everything above the lobby level is wide open and newly renovated. Our room was absolutely gorgeous -- huge, with high ceilings, nice decorations, very large windows opening up to the street, and a spacious, newly renovated bathroom. We let out a sigh of relief and took a much-needed rest before heading out to see Florence that night.Besides the rooms, the big appeal of this hotel is the location. It is situated right in the middle of historical Florence; every major sight, the Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio bridge, the Duomo, is pretty much a quick walk away. We only had two days to experience Florence, so the location was perfect for us. The downside is that our room was a little noisy at night, but that could only be expected. The other aspect we loved about the hotel was the very helpful staff. They made dinner reservations, told us where the best place to get gelato was, and tried to make ticket reservations for us at the Uffizi (unfortunately, it was impossible since we only told them a day in advance). The hotel also thoughtfully sent a bottle of wine to our room since it was my wife's birthday. The breakfast at the hotel was adequate.Overall, we would recommend this hotel highly to anyone looking for a clean, safe, centrally-located hotel in Florence. If this hotel would invest in renovating it's entrance, lobby and common areas, it would really be a homerun.
