{"text":"Great Experience We just returned from 10 days at El Conquistador. Everything was just perfect. We stayed in Las Casitas but had been at the hotel the prior year. Both are great although we liked Las Casitas more because of the privacy, the larger accomodations and the quieter atmosphere (although still close to the hotel).Especially great are the people there. Our butlers Manny Santiago and Wilfred couldn't do enough for us - reservations, shopping, renting a car, advice re: local restaurants, visiting old San Juan, dealing with a couple of glitches in the room, room keys, etc and giving us advice on where to go, etc. They practically became part of the family. Very professional, kind and effective.Also, the Golden Door Spa\/Fitness Center is like an oasis of great karma. Everyone there is gracious and first rate as are the facilities. Rita Maldanado and Juan Perez, the personal trainers are the best in every respect - they are true professionals, as well as inspiring, encouraging, etc . Juan designed a personal fitness program and then throughout the stay he and Rita helped refine it. I worked out with them several times to get the program into a fluid routine. Rita and others also led some wonderful Yoga and meditation sessions which the entire family enjoyed (2 adults, 2 teenagers). One could spend all day at the Spa\/Fitness Center. Sofi Valentin, Guest Services Manager of the Spa was equally terrific.The 9 pools and numerous retaurants provide a great variety of atmosphere. Palomina Island is a good beach and fun. There is lots to do and it's just as easy to do nothing all day.The wide variety of restaurants are all great as well. We'll probably go back next year - for our 3rd annual visit. ","annotations":[]}
