{"text":"Vacations are what you make of them.. To those who are thinking of travelling to the Dominican Republic, moreso, Occidental Flaminco Punta Cana please read on: My girlfriend and I just returned from our week long stay at the Occidental from June 7-14 and are hereby giving an honest review of our stay. This resort has its up's and down's as I'm sure all resorts do. Let's start off with the pro's as this resort has many. The clearest winner is the appearence\/esthetics of the resort. Absolutely Georgous! The grounds are very well maintained, healthy, vibrant and visually stunning. The Lobby, (where you will no doubt spend time, before and after dinner) is very large, with an open concept, with lots of people and energy. It also boasts the best bar staff on the resort. The Beach however is breathtaking. The photos submitted by guests don't do it any justice in comparison to standing with your feet in the hot sugar white sand, the clever blue\/green ocean water rushing past your legs with a stretch of magnificent palms lining the sorrounding peninsula. Wow is all I can say! There is a nightly show that is mildly entertaining but not nearly as relaxing as walking back down to the beach and cuddling up on a lounger. Free yourself of your everyday tension as you listen to the water crash while watching the brilliant stars as you search for a comet to zoom across the majestic black sky. If you are looking for some real 'peace and quiet' this is as good as it gets. To my surprise no other vacationers shared this experience except a lonely security guard.Food wasn't fantastic but it was satisfying for the most part. Some people may find it bland but the selection is good. We tried 4 a la cartes. Notably the Italian, (try the Lasagna, superb!), and the Oriental. I would pass on the Mexican and Brazilian. Our room on the third floor exceeded my expectations, however, the washroom was a disaster. The room was very clean, the maids where fantastic. Note: Tip the maid and leave a note (spanish prefered as English is limited) and ask for beer to be put in your mini fridge! The Bathroom, as previosly noted, was not good at all. We had one hot shower all week. The tub wouldn't drain efficiently. And we had ants on the floor and occasionally on the counter. We could have requested another room but we aren't the type to let little things bother us. I could mention many other great things about this trip and I could also dwell on some rather negative issues, but all in all, we had a great vacation. We probably will pass on staying at the occidental a second time, but we will keep our vacation in our minds as a wonderful time that we spend together.  Good luck vacationers!And remember, your vacation is your responsibility. Don't expect other people to make the time good for you, it's up to you to create your own special vacation!m ","annotations":[{"endOffset":929,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":924},{"endOffset":1061,"mention":"peninsula","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Peninsula_Hong_Kong"],"startOffset":1052}]}
