{"text":"Relaxing Vacation This is our 4th trip south and our 2nd to Punta Cana. We always book at 4 or 5 star resorts.Go and have fun. The resort is fine an the service is good. The culture of the Dominican people is to be laid back, so relax, walk slow and enjoy.CHECK INOur room was not ready so we went ahead and had a drink and some lunch. We also went to check out where our room would be and it was going to be on the first floor. We went back and asked to be moved off the ground floor and we were accomodated and went to 3rd floor, building 4.ROOMOur room had a nice view and very high ceilings being on the top floor. It could use some fresh paint for sure and sometimes the tub leaked but that didn't bother us. Room was always very clean. If on day one you leave an extra dollar by the mini-fridge and let the maid know what you want (in Spanish), your fridge will be restocked with an extra beer or two! Some days the towels came around 4 or so but that was okay since we always went to supper around 7 or 8. Balcony was pleasant to sit out and we enjoyed it. In one review I read about too many birds ---- it is tropical - of course there are birds!!FOODBuffet was fine - typical of any the resorts we have been too. Beach restaraunt was very relaxing for breakfast as it was quiet and you were looking out over the ocean.TexMex\/American Grill. Excellent. We ate there 2 nights. Very good food and very good service. Italian. Excellent as well. Ate there one night.BEACHES AND POOLSWe visited all. If you need a hut for shade - get up early. If not you can always find a chair at a good location any of the places. Beach is beautiful and being next the the marina you have lots to watch with boats, etc. Also very close to food, drinks, etc. which is nice.Adult pool. Nice and quiet for reading or napping. Nico, the bartender there, is the resorts best!Other pool. Lots of activities if you want - noisier because the Animation Team is always doing something. Swim up bar - what can you say - a swim up bar is always great!SUNWINGVery good service and Antoine was very helpful.OVERALLThere is alot of other things about the resort I could go on with but basically the grounds are beautiful but some of the buildings are getting a little old. Overall, we had a great time. It is not perfect, but if you are pleasant with the staff, they are very pleasant and helpful to you. You're on vacation - relax and have fun.
