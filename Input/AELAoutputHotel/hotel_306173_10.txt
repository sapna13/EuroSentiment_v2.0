{"text":"If you don't mind damp bedding then this is a wonderful hotel I've never felt strongly enough to review a hotel in all the years I've used this site, but the Fullerton changed all that.This hotel is a beautiful building and ideally located in the business district. However, there are some serious issues with the dampness of the hotel.After a few days of mild dampness, we started noticing that paperwork was damp to the touch, and our clothes (in the wardrobe) were also damp. The bedding, even inside the bed, was by the third night unacceptably damp, accompanied by an overwhelming smell of dampness, causing us to complain.We were shown 4 other rooms ending at midnight, when we gave up and went to sleep in our dank bedroom. The highlight of the 4 was a room on the front of the building which did not smell of damp like the others, but which had condensation 'inside' the double glazing, obscuring the view of the very noisy road below.We checked out this morning and moved to the Fairmont. Instantly more friendly than the staff at the Fullerton, I felt welcomed right away and have been upgraded to the executive floor. I have a view of the water and the city, a balcony, and DRY BEDDING. What more could you ask for.I wouldn't say never stay at the Fullerton as it is a nice hotel in a good location, but make sure to complain right away if you have any problems with dampness and make sure they put you in a room to your liking.PS: The 4th floor seemed particularly prone to the smell of damp. Perhaps one to avoid. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1284,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1280}]}
