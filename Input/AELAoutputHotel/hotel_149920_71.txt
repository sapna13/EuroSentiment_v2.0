{"text":"Great Hotel! Just got back from a 5 night stay in San Juan. We couldn't have been more pleased with the Marriott. First of all, the location is fantastic. The Condado district is just 10 minutes from the airport, and 10 minutes from Old San Juan. Within a 4 block radius, there must be at least 25 restaurants to choose from. All types of cuisines, Sushi, Argentinean, Italian, Mexican, and Puerto Rican. There is also a small grocery store\/liquor store and a Walgreen√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ within a block or two.  The hotel itself was very comfortable. The room was large and comfortable. It looks like it had been recently renovated. Very comfortable bed, granite counters in the bathroom, small refrigerator, and a large plasma TV with about 30 US satellite TV stations. The in-room wireless internet was as fast as back home.  The pool area was very nice, and well maintained. There was never a problem getting a chair by the pool. The beach was beautiful. It was very easy to get beach chairs and an umbrella. Even though the waves were a bit rough, there were plenty of people swimming in the ocean. The bars in the pool areas were great. Never a problem getting a drink, and made a wide variety of tropical cocktails.  We ate at the La Vista restaurant for breakfast. They had an $18 breakfast buffet option, that was very good. Made to order omelets, Belgian waffles, fresh fruit, pastries, OJ, very good coffee. There were so many other dining options surrounding the hotel, why bother eating at the hotel for lunch or dinner.  The casino was very good. It was open 24 hours a day. They had about 10 blackjack tables. Several at the $5 and $10 level. With good blackjack rules (dealer stands on soft 17). They also had a $5 craps table. Sign up for their player√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ club when you get there. We earned about $75 in food comps, just by playing a couple of hours a day. All in all, a great place to stay. An great value at $250\/night (including the daily resort fee) for an ocean front room through Expedia.
