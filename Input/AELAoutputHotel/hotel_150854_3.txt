{"text":"Best rum in the world!! This resort is really awesome. The staff are really friendly and really nice. The rooms are amazing and very well kept. The liquor wells are fantastic, and the in room fridge is well stocked. Just ask the beverage cart man for some rum and you will never drink anything else. It is the most amazing rum in the world. I brought 12 bottles back with me and want to go back for more. This resort and the other hotels associated with it have some really nice shows and entertainment at night. The jazz group is amazing and really friendly. The Michael Jackson show is outstanding and the all inclusive part tops it all off with free drinks and food. Although, dining at night can be a little troublesome with having to make reservations at each restaurant, but when you do the food is really good. Also, shopping is really close and really affordable. The casino is just fair but is a fine place to spend some time. Don't play the slots just the table games, the slots are tight but the table games are ok with their standards. Finally, during the day around the resort they have games and competitions that are well worth the time. they are very fun and the staff outside is awesome. and if you win, you get more rum. The rum is great! All around this experience is awesome and something that should be enjoyed and taken in instead of nit picking little things. if you find little things just drink more rum, it is everywhere and the rum is great!
