{"text":"you can definitely do better We spent 3 nights in Hotel des Arts, in a shared room and it was the most disappointing accomodation experience of the 17 nights spent in the USA, including cheap road side motels, hotels, etc.It is safe and it has a great location, near Union Square and China Town, but as others before have put it, it is an overpriced dirty motel, trying to fool you with art. Some rooms may have art, and there is definitely an artistic vibe in the hotel, but our room was just a strident eye-soaring grafitti. I'd say there is more pretence than the real thing in there.The room did not have A\/C and in a hot July, this was really unpleasant. The second thing that most disturbed me, is that most things in the room were old, worn-out, shady and----dirty!! The old sink was dirty, with a crust of soap and...other things and the shared shower was a disaster, I was really freaked to go inside there for a second time. I am really not the very pretentious type though:D. The hotel itself had this aura of old, worn-out, shady.The breakfast is just a broken promise, old bagels and some coffee....The staff was OK, I guess, no major issues.These were very basic conditions (CLEAN is the first thing I expect in any accomodation, before it has arts, food, ammenities and God knows what) sold at not-so-very-basic prices. We will not go there again, I am sure we can find better or cheaper accomodation. It was not the most terrbile place on earth, but the price\/value was really unfair ","annotations":[{"endOffset":64,"mention":"Hotel des Arts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hotel_des_Arts"],"startOffset":50},{"endOffset":64,"mention":"Hotel des Arts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hotel_des_Arts"],"startOffset":50},{"endOffset":1092,"mention":"bagels","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bagel"],"startOffset":1086}]}
