{"text":"Would stay here again in a heartbeat We decided on Hotel Stellar as the place to stay while celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and were very pleased.Arriving at about 7.30am off the night flight from Perth, the receptionist directed us to a small bathroom where we could freshen up before storing our bags prior to check-in. Check-in went smoothly, we had booked through an online site and there were no hassles.The room was large and very well maintained. There was a small kitchenette with refrigerator, microwave, tea and coffee making facilities (with bonus coffee plunger and real coffee), plates, cutlery etc. The bathroom was spotless. No views, but we weren't there for the views. In the lobby area was a number of internet PCs available for a small daily fee, as well as a sitting area with couches, TV, books and magazines etc.The staff were fantastic and quick to assist with any request. On our anniversary night it was pouring with rain and the taxi we had called for to take us to the theatre had not arrived. Without hestitaiton the receptionist grabbed an umbrella and went out into the rain to the main cross road and brought back a taxi. Unknown to us, our daughter had contacted the hotel and asked for champagne and Swiss chocolates to be delivered to our room on our anniversary, which they arranged for a delightful surprise.We found the hotel was a reasonable walk from many of the places we wanted to visit in the central part of Sydney, and close to the train for everywhere else. In fact, we arrived and left on the train from the nearby Museum station. We didn't have any qualms walking around at night, admittedly this was mid-week so perhaps the clubbers were at home.Again perhaps due to being mid-week, the night club in the hotel posed no problems for us. One of us is a VERY light sleeper, and had no issues with noise.The only thing that did disappoint was the paucity of room service meals. Due to the rain we decided to stay in for dinner one evening and could not get a meal delivered so we tried room service. Unfortunately they did not have an in-house kitchen so our choices were a lavash wrap sandwich or a microwaved lasagne. The evening receptionist was very apologetic and said this situation was being reviewed so it may have changed by now.We felt the Stellar was indeed stellar and would have no hesitation in staying there should we visit Sydney again.
