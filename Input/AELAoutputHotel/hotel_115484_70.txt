{"text":"A great getaway in Phoenix! I was planning a big 30th birthday party and wanted to go to a spa resort in Phoenix. My mom wanted to go to the Arizona Biltmore, as she had been there a few times before and loved it. I booked the hotel and got a pretty good rate with my AAA membership. I was apprehensive about going to the hotel after reading the bad reviews here, but my friends, family and I had a great time! First of all, I don't know why people are saying the rooms where bad. We stayed in a resort King, and it was really nice. Nice bed, big bathroom and everything was clean and comfortable. It didn't seem outdated to me at all. My family's rooms where even better than mine! The hotel is divided into cottages and different room buildings, and our building had its own little pool which was quiet and nice. The hotel was pretty crazy, as we went Memorial Day Weekend and there were two or more weddings taking place, but I thought it was really fun. The large pool is a mob scene and people come and stake out pool chairs at around 7 am! If you come after 8 am, forget about finding pool chairs. It's a fun pool with a swim up bar and a water slide. My friends and family and I decided to hang out at another pool- the Arizona pool- on our first day. It was smaller and more mellow, but it had a bar next to it and was quite nice. They even had a barbeque going and we all had great burgers, chicken  fish. When my husband picked up the tab, we were amazed at how cheap it was! The total bill for our lunch for eight was under $80.The hotel also has a lot of fun activities for kids, and great extras that make it fun for all ages. On Friday night we went and had s'mores by the fire pit. They had an amazing setup of s'more stuff, lemonade, cider, and popcorn, and even had a cowboy come and sing some songs for the kids. This was a totally free event, and really fun. There is also a movie night by the pool, which we missed, and croquet, a putting green, and a large checkers\/chess board by the pool.All eight of us also went to the spa for massages and hot stone pedicures and one facial. We all tried different types of massage, and everyone had a good experience. It's not the fanciest spa and in a town of great spas I'm sure it's not the best one, but it was clean, there were great drinks and snacks, and all of us enjoyed our experience there.The other issue that someone mentioned is parking. There are two self parking lots when you pull up to the hotel. One is to the right, and closer to the lobby, and the other is a parking garage that is a bit farther to the left. We found parking in the close lot a few times, despite it being a busy weekend, and the other times we parked in the garage. Yes, it was a little farther away, but certainly not a mile, and not a big deal.I think my only complaint would be about the resort charges which are $20-$25 per day, but other than that I had a great time at this hotel, and I would certainly go there again!
