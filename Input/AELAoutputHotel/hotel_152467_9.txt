{"text":"Good hotel, good location, different than the rest For my recent business trip I tried to stay at my usual favorite hotel in Mexico City, Condesa DF, but it was booked solid for the week. So I read the reviews here at TripAdvisor and picked the NH Mexico City. Having read the warnings about the non-renovated rooms, I paid up to a higher rate US$140\/night and got a nice, renovated room. The rooms are nicely decorated and the bathrooms are stylish. I've stayed at other NH properties in Amsterdam, Madrid, Buenos Aires, and elsewhere, and I've always appreciated the design of the rooms and the style of the lodging. I would have to say that the NH Mexico City is consistent with the chain and I would stay here again. If you're in a renovated room, you have access to the Club NH on the 14th floor, which was a very nice lounge with a beautiful view of downtown Mex City, flat screen TVs, and nice furnishings. They have an ok breakfast buffet here, but it's way overpriced, at 140 pesos plus obligatory tip bringing it to over US$15. The only other complaint I have, and it's actually one that might keep me from staying here -- the internet connection. They have WiFi access, but the connection itself was unreliable and even when it was working, the throughput for downloading files was unimpressive. I do a lot of moving of files and I could not successfully download a 100MB file on the connection because it was so slow, and it would cut out at times. To have paid more than $11\/day for a connection so unreliable felt like highway robbery. Curiously though, they only billed me for two days when I used it for four days. PROS:--Good location--Reliable service--Stylish, clean accomodations--Larger rooms than other Mex City hotelsCONS:--Overpriced breakfast (but you could eat in a restaurant nearby on the street for much less if you want).--Slow internet connection (also MXN120 per day).--Most confusing hotel invoice I've ever received...the numbers didn't add up, and there were confusing taxes all over it.
