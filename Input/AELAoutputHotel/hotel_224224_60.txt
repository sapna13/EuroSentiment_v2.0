{"text":"Too many mistake for a Ritz Carlton My wife and I just returned from a weekend stay at the Ritz Central Park. We requested and recieved a park view room on the 10th floor. The room was great and the view was worth the extra expense. At first we were impressed with the attentive staff and the overall ambience of the hotel. We requested tickets for a sold out show and the concierge came through albeit at a significant premium. The stay would have been prefect if not for three problems. First, the only belt I took was missing after the housekeeping staff cleaned the room. We looked everywhere but the belt never appeared. We certainly do not think it was stolen but feel that it was gathered up in the linens and mistakenly taken from the room. We reported this to the front desk and so far they have not found it. We requested dinner reservations at a new restaurant on the hotel's recommended list. The conciere desk printed out a confirmation which included an address for restaurant. Infortunatley, the address was incorrect and we did not realize it until our taxi had dropped us off and left. We finally made it to dinner 45 mintutes late and our table was gone. The next morning before leaving for the airport, I pointed out the problem to the concierge. While he was apologetic and expressed a desire to compensate us for the mistake, he did not offer to do anythihg. I would have thought he would have offered to take us to the airport in the hotel car. Finally at check out, a bar tab that was not our charge was on our bill. GIven the price of the room, (over $1000 a night) three significant mistakes in two days is not acceptable and not up to the standard of a Ritz Carlton.
