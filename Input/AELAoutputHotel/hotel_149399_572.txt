{"text":"Awful Service !!!!!!!!!!! I just got back from Punta Cana, We stayed at this hotel and the service .....well, there is NONE!We arrived on a bus from Santo Domingo (the capital)The ride was great, nice bus. I told the driver that we were staying at the Melia Caribe, he said no problem we'll stop at the entrance of that hotel. So he did, we got off the bus right at the entrance of the Melia complex where you can find the Melia Caribe Tropical and The Paradisus Palma Real. We asked the guard to please have someone come to pick us up to take us to the lobby, it was a ten minutes walk, it was 2 p.m (very hot) and we had our lugagge with us. To this request he replied that they don't do that. I was shoked !!! He told us to call a taxi to take us in from the entrance to the lobby, I asked him to call the reception desk to confirm that we could not be helped, and sure enough they said...take a taxi. The guard then said that if we were paying extra for the premium service or if we had been staying at the Paradisus Palma Real that they would had come to pick us up. Great !!! I came all the way to the DR and paid this hotel to remind me that I am not special during my vacation stay because I am paying the regular rate instead of the upgraded????What??? The guard called a taxi, the taxi driver found the ride so ridiculus that he did't charged us (we gave him the fare anyway US$5.00) This was the first day of our vacation, to say the least, not very relaxing and enjoyable. The hotel was O.K. (I've been in better) the food was mediocre, and did I mention the service? Really bad !!!!! We stayaed for four days and I found 3 cocoroaches in my bedroom. You'll say...it's the Caribbean, it's normal. I can qualify myself as a Caribbean expert, I have traveled to almost every single island of the region and I can excuse one cocoroach one day, but 3 out of the 4 days!!!! I don't even want to imagine their kitchen area!!! YUK. To me the overall experience was terrible, I think that for the money I could of done better in Jamaica, Cozumel, Playa del Carmen or Cancun. As a matter of fact...I am done with Punta Cana, pretty beaches but the service it's not there.
