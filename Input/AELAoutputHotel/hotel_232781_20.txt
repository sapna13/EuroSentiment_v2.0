{"text":"Middle of the road This hotel is about as average as can be. The reception is very nice and depending on when you arrive you'll either be greeted by a nice young bloke or a grumpy old sod. (Manuel doesn't work here, he must still be in Torquay.)Either way, after an efficient check-in (it's 50-50 whether or not you get a smile) your first impressions will probably be dictated by your experience with the lifts. They are only suitable for a contortionist (only one person and a suitcase at a time) but if you're hoping to get close to your travelling companion, make sure you don't take the stairs, you'll literally be all over each other.The rooms are functional but small and the bed is hard. There is a bar with no atmosphere on the first floor but this hotel is generally quite cramped and you probably won't want to spend much time here. Location is OK but not as good as all the reviews make out - there are better located hotels all over town. Barcelona is not really a value for money city, but I think this hotel is over-priced. It is basic and generally OK, but I have had much better hotels elsewhere for the same sort of money. Also, this hotel didn't even include breakfast in the price, which was a bit mean.Pluses? Free internet access in the bar and the nice receptionist says the hotel is undergoing work to expand it next door to add a swimming pool and gym and more space, so maybe this is one for the future. (By the way, we never heard any work going on and traffic is bearable - for us it was the bed that made sleeping uncomfortable.)You could probably do better, but if you're OK with average then this mediocre hotel will do.
