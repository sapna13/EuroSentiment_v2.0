{"text":"Fantastic Intercontinental We stayed at the Intercontinental for two weeks at the end of September\/October for our first wedding anniversary. We booked Club Intercontinental and it was worth every extra penny. Upon our arrival at Denpasar we were greeted by three staff and taken immediately to the Intercontinental Lounge. We handed over our passports and money for our visas, given a drink and left to relax. A short time later our passports were returned with visas sorted. Our luggage then arrived. There was no queueing and no waiting for our cases - all done for us which was a great start to out holiday. It was worth every penny not having to queue for a change.A ten minute drive to the hotel and wow! Once past the security (they even check under the car with mirrors) you enter another world. The hotel grounds are immaculate. We got to the Club Lounge and check in was so relaxed and accompanied by a wonderful ginger\/lemongrass drink. We were taken to our room by our butler and everything explained. And what a room. Fantastic marble bathroom with separate bath and shower\/separate toilet and bidet with Aveda products - the rosemary and mint shampoo is fantastic especially for a sun tender scalp. The bedroom was huge with flat screen tv. The bed was enormous - 7ft wide and very comfortable. The air conditioning for a change was quiet and they even provide a plug-in mosqiuto killer.Club Intercontintental has its own pool and the reserving of sunbeds is frowned upon which makes a change. We did not see anyone placing their stuff on beds and disappearing for the day - if you do then your stuff gets moved. Water is provided around the pool together with a bowl of fruit. During the afternoon fresh melon is brought around.At lunchtime we ate at the Club Lounge. There is a menu of five items all quite substantial with soft drinks aplenty. From three o'clock afternoon tea is available. All the food we had here was excellent. All of the staff here are fantastic and a real credit to the hotel. We have to make a special mention of Eka who was our waiter during our stay - genuine warmth and hospitality from him.At night we ate at all of the hote;s retsauramts. The Jimbaran Gardens does Indonesian food or international stuff. The beef rendang was fantastic. Go for wine by the glass - works out cheaper than a bottle. The Bella Singaraja italian restaurant was probably the best Italian food we have ever eaten (especially the homemade ravioli and insalata caprese). The Japanese restaurant Ko also deserves a mention. We ate in the private dining room and in Tepanyaki and the food and service was great. All the meals are inexpensive and fantastic value.As per previous reviews we wanted to take a tour with Wayan Sueta however despite several e-mails\/completing booking forms on his website we heard nothing from him (does anyone know whether he is still offering tours?). Instead we booked the hotel car to take us to Ubud and the monkey forest\/around Ubud and the rice terraces. This worked out at $25 for the first hour and then $10 for every hour afterwards. Excellent value. The monkey forest was brilliant - buy some bananas and watch them cheeky monkeys help themselves! Our holiday at the Intercontinental was brilliant. We would also mention the hotel manager who came and introduced himself to us and enquired regularly how our holiday was going without being intrusive. That's what this hotel gets spot on - first class service without being in your face.We will definately be returning!
