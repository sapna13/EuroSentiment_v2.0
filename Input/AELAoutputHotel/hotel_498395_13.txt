{"text":"The rudest staff I have ever met!! I live in Asia and have travelled loads in this region but have never come across a hotel that were SO unhelpful. My friend booked it as a little change to the budget style accomodation we had previously been staying in. We moved from a very friendly budget hotel in Singapore to the Perak Hotel, which turned out to be a huge mistake.I was shown the room and the amenties within that room when I arrived, when I tried to use the safe I found that I was unable to open it. I called downstairs to ask for some help where I was told to read the instructions. I explained that I have already read the instructions and would appreciate some help the lady on the phone groaned and said ok. When she arrived at my room to assist she was extremely truculent and apeared bothered by my request. Later that day I asked one of the staff to turn the temperature of the ac unit down as I was too hot. He scolded me in a very loud voice saying √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??he temperature of the room is fine, it is hot outside. It will go down later√à√\u2020\u2022?When I told him that I thought he was very rude and that I certainly didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ appreciate being shouted at. He chuckled and said he didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ shout then left the room without adjusting the ac.Later in our stay we returned to the room to find that the cleaner had thrown out a large stack of wedding photographs that belonged to my friend. I went downstairs to find out what happened,only to be told by the gentleman behind the desk that it was √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≤ot his problem√à√\u2020\u2022?he said he wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ the manager and could do nothing about it. He also said that if you left your belongs on the floor then they would be thrown out.(The photos weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ on the floor) What was very confusing was the actual garbage in the room wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ removed during our entire stay! I asked to speak to the manager on the telephone, a request that was of course refused. Eventually the produced a cleaner who denied throwing out any photos but as he couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ speak any English and I couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ speak Chinese I was unclear about how much of the situation was undersood by him. I definitely wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go back to stay in this hotel nor would I recommend it to others. ","annotations":[]}
