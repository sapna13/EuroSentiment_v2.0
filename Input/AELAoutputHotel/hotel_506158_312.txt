{"text":"Really Impressive My wife and I stayed at the 1898 at the start of October 2006. It's a fantastic hotel - in many respects a 5* experience, though perhaps falling short of an official rating on one or two technicalities. Things that you may find useful when considering booking are : * Roof Terrace - Gloriously quiet with panoramic views of the city, nice bar, but no food. (note you can zip out and get a salad in 5 minutes and bring it back without any eyebrows raised!)*Concierge - are very efficient and booked us into some unbookable restaurants at short notice (including Moo which is a must if you want to indulge!). Also left a note in our room confirming this had been done* Location - is possibly as good as it gets. You can pretty much get anywhere you need with ease. Bus-service reliable and easy to work out. We explored a lot and the only cabs we got were to and from the airport. * Agree with the earlier post about the noise from the maids which is quite loud (but the earliest we heard was 9.00am and our room was right opposite one of their base rooms). The rooms were spotless though. * Spa - Pool small but fun, sauna and steam rooms both fine, clean etc. Again if you want to indulge massages were very good. * Price - in response to the other poster who said that the hotel charges for everything, i'm a little surprised. True that there is no kettle in the room but my wife and I asked a few times at the bar for hot water and milk which was provided for no extra cost. Maybe it was the room service delivery element that caused them to be charged. Also, breakfast cost is pretty competitive for a hotel of this standard and of good quality. I've stayed in similar hotels across the continent where a similar spread has been a lot more expensive. Overall, this place is highly recommended and all the positive reviews below, which prompted us to book, are spot on! Enjoy!
