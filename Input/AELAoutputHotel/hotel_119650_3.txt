{"text":"Traveler Beware We booked this hotel as suggested by Hotels.com while planning a trip through northern California. We should have taken a hint when we arrived and the manager, Mayher Patel was arguing and yelling with a customer. After kicking out the customer, the staff didn't even apologize for the problem or acknowledge their behavior. Later in our room, we noticed a smoky smell coming into our room. I called the front desk a couple of times with no answer. When someone finally picked up the phone at the front desk, I asked about smoking in a non-smoking hotel she just said Okay and hung up the phone. The smoke seeping into our room was getting worse. My throat was starting to burn and and I was starting to get a headache. My husband went to the front desk and spoke to the woman. The staff refused to come and check out the smoke and said she would call our neighboring room. The staff member called the room next door and the neighboring traveler said that he would take care of it. A few minutes later this guy next door walked out of his room with backpack and a hooded jacket covering his head.The odor was so awful that we had to leave the room. The manager\/staff member, Mayher Patel, said there were no other rooms available. Mayher Patel refused to give us a refund because we booked it with Hotels.com. We left because it was unfit to stay and we were concerned of the chemical smells coming into our room. We are still trying to get reimbursed for the room the night we didn't even stay there! The hotel does not want to reimburse us and neither does Hotels.com because of their policy. Beware of hotels and their booking companies. Absolutely not worth it. ","annotations":[]}
