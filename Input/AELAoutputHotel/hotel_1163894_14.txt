{"text":"Very nice hotel.......just too big! We stayed at the 'Punta Cana' Gran Bahia Principe from 27th November for two weeks and overall it was a very good hotel. On arrival we couldnt believe how big the complex is.......its huge!!!!Our room was nice......spacious and clean. The bathroom was large and the bed was comfortable. We had a ground floor room with a terrace. There were only two problems with the room:1: Our terrace looked out over a small access road that staff used to get around and overlooked the building site next door......lots of noisy vehicles moving around early in the morning.2: As it was a ground floor room all the higher floors had to come down into the groundfloor area to leave the block. As there is only one door seperating each room from the communal area this could be very noisy early on a morning........we could hear every word said outside our room and every step taken on the tiled floor.The shuttle service running from each end of the complex is excellent...they leave every few minutes and operate from 0600 - 0300 every day!!The beach is as you would expect in the Caribbean.....excellent!!!!! the hotel's part of the beach is huge. Dont make the mistake of staying around the busy bit as you first get there.......walk along and it is much less crowded.....the only problem being that to get a good spot at the beach or pool you have to be up early as sooooo many people reserve the best beds with towels and stroll up a few hours later!!The watersports at the beach are ok....the non moterised stuff is free for guests...the banana boat was quite cheap √ä√£¬¢6 each.Walk along the beach to the right (when facing the sea) for a mile or two and you come to a row of shacks selling all the local stuff. There are similar stalls at the hotel selling all the same stuff. Both will try and rip you off at first asking for around $100 for somehting they will sell to you for $5 if you haggle. If unsure of the prices the shops around the stalls in the hotel are pretty cheap and dont hassle you at all. The stall sellers are just way too pushy!!The buffet restaurant was ok.....nothing special but not as bad as others have made out in other reviews. The food was just a bit repetitive after two weeks. Lots of pasta...meat.....burgers...hot dogs etc. Thought plenty of healthy stuff....salad's and fresh fruit. My girlfriend loved the desserts......at EVERY meal!!!The a la carte restaurants were very good. The Japanese was one of our favuorites......we sat next to a Canadian couple who didnt like chicken, Beef or rice. Bith strange picking the restaurant if they dont like the food in the first place!!.The steak house is nice and the meat is decent quality....just dont have the mixed grill as the pieces are so small....apart from the HUGE black pudding sausage!!We were really surprised how much we liked the French gourmet restaurant.....we wouldnt normaly have chosen it but gave it a go and loved the calf fillet and duck we had.The service in each of the a la carte restaurants was much better than in the buffet's. Its true what others say that most of the staff speak very little or no English but a little effort goes a long way...........Ola = Hello.......Bueno dia\/tardes\/nochas = good day\/afternoon\/evening.........gracias = thank you......por favor = please.The excursions that we did were good....but quite expensive. The Bavaro splash was good with a two man speed boat ride followed by snorkelling. We bought the DVD on sale there for 1300peso (√ä√£¬¢26) its ok but a lot of the footage is from other groups that day.The outback safari was better...the guide, Eddie and the driver, luis were very good and made sure that everyone had a good time. We visited a typical Dominican house producing coconut and vanilla oil. We went to a place that had crocodiles and massive crabs selling chocolate, coffee and givng a demonstration about how they are produced. A rum shack, a dominican school and a beach where were were given boogie boards..........look out for a pair or black 'Police' sunglasses in the sea as mine were lost there............ we also met an 86yr old woman with 26 kids!!!!!!The best trip for us was the sunset horseride at the 'El Pat ranch' along the beach. We liked it so much we went back the next day to do it again!!! Staff were good and the horses were well looked after.Overall the hotel was nice...the staff were helpful (once they understood what you were asking for)....the excursions are good.....the food is ok.......the beach is lovely................... but i wouldnt go back again...........just too big and too many people for us.
