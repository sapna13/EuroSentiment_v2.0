{"text":"I liked it This was my first trip to Hawaii and it was wonderful! I booked a 7 night stay at the Aqua Palms  Spa based solely on reviews here on tripadvisor. My husband worried a bit that I wouldn't like it because I can be picky at times, but I said I just needed a clean hotel with a decent bed and good shower. Aqua Palms was a great, comfortable stay and met my expectations! The room was a decent size, but on the smaller side and we didn't have the greatest view. I would've asked for a room facing Ala Moana Blvd to get a better view of the water and Diamond Head, but we were satisfied with it. I think that the better view also makes you more susceptible to street noise from what I heard, but not sure on that. I think it's nice that they offer breakfast; they do that as a courtesy and it's basically just muffins, fruit, and juice, but I don't understand other reviews complaining about it when they don't HAVE to provide anything. It was nice to know there were free muffins downstairs every morning. The lobby was nice, clean and cute, nothing fancy. The staff was super friendly as was most everyone we met who lived there -- the bus drivers, the people working on the tours, etc... -- very nice people. Our bed was comfortable, we had internet access, they had nice big LG flat screen TVs mounted on the walls, and the bathroom was new-ish looking and clean. I especially liked that the water pressure in the shower was nice and strong (I've had hotel experiences when the water was too weak). There's coin laundry on the 3rd level too. On the downside (but very minor): the furniture was a little old and worn and the carpet had a few stains. Also, the pool was extremely small, so if you're dying to book a hotel with a great pool this isn't the one for you. The beach was great though and very close by. That's about it though. Despite what other reviews said, I thought the elevators were fine and came fast enough. The hotel also offers a shuttle for $10\/person I think to take you to and from the airport so call and ask about that if you need transportation.You can walk across the street to the Hilton for beach access or to eat and shop that their many little shops, walk to your right out of the hotel lobby about 10-15 min to get to Ala moana Shopping Center (a mall) and there's a park, Ala Moana Park, right across from there where we watched the most magnificent sunset. You can rent a car or buy a 4 day unlimited bus pass from ABC for $20. I'm glad I made the choice to stay here.
