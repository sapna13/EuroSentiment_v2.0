{"text":"The sign reads Welcome to Paradise (It's true) Having stayed at the Sheraton Laguna in Krabi last year Nusa Dua had a lot to live up to and it did. The hotel is top line from the moment you arrive. The welcome was warm, friendly and the check in was as smooth as the silk the dancers who welcomed us were wearing. In no time at all we were escorted to our room and our bags followed just a few moments later. Although we had a standard room the view from our balcony was fine. I had considered an upgrade, but was glad I had resisted the temptation.A large flat screen TV, spacious room, excellent bathroom and everything worked. The butler service is great. Lift the phone and prepare to recieve a quick, polite and efficient butler at your door within minutes. We have seen better beaches, but that would be too critical. With your own private beach and you own private lagoon (almost) you don't need it. You have to see the hotel lagoons to believe it. If you want privacy and relaxation this is the place.The food too was excellent, although a little fancy for my taste. The prices were in keeping with the standard of the hotel.High for Bali, but reasonable compared with UK. If you want to go cheaper a 15 min. walk will bring you to a whole range of resturants the will collect you and take you home if you book a table.A meal for two and a couple of beers about √ä√£¬¢20with a great atmosphere, which was lacking in the hotel resturants because of the lack of patrons. Would I go back, I certainly would. The bales,massages,good food. You bet I would go back. ","annotations":[]}
