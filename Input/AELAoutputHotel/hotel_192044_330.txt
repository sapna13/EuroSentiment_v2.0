{"text":"The excellent staff at the london bridge we stayed here in January of 2007 while on a trip to attend a friends 60th birthday celebration. The hotel is lovely--though pretty busy (we were told we couldn't gt an early check in but on hearing that our bankcards had both been cancelled by the bank because the bank suspected fraud and we had NO money--and the bank in NY couldn't be reached until 1 pm London time--they worked hard to get us into a room early so we had somewhere to spend the time (we were jet -lagged and very few coffeshops take credit cards!)anyway, room was lovely, a bit small by US standards, but that is the norm--however, it really is the staff that make this place extraordinary (as noted above) --i had to compose a 'song' for the party and was running a bit late --but also need to make 100 or so copies of the song--which was on a macintosh--the concierge was able to convert my file to windows and took it to the business center and made the copies gratis--just before we were to leave for the party my husband discovered that he had forgotten his tux shirt--again a concierge to the rescue--he called nearby stores (that were closing in 5 minutes!) told them my husband would be arriving and my husband found a shirt (not a tux shirt, but at least a white shirt that did the job) had we not had this intervention the stores would have been closed and my husband would have been in a t-shirt. There were numerous other small niceties from greetings to thoughtfully answered questions that make the staff at this hotel stand out.Also, the location is great, it is near the tube and the bridge (obviously!) and near a great food market that has lovely cafes and restaurants. really a great place to stay.
