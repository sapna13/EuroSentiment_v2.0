{"text":"First class all the way Being conveniently located in Ark Hills right near a subway station and an Airport Limousine dropoff was my original reason for staying here, but I've since stayed here two more times. Service and room accommodations are Westernized, but with Japanese style and the highest level of quality applied to every facet of the hotel.I think the original Cascades waterfall was more beautiful back in 2003 as it had marble streams that flowed into the lobby. It's still quite magnificent, though the 'streams' are gone. But with the remodeling came some very futuristic additions - electronic placards display hotel events  restaurant menus, digital world clocks, and an array of artistic images electronically projected on large screen monitors.The main restaurant offers breathtaking views of Tokyo, complimented by a piano bar and other live venues on the occasion. One night the pianist played something quite familiar - the Brady Bunch theme!Strange, but amusing.The only real meals I had during my multiple visits was breakfast, which were all fine continental affairs with the addition of traditional Japanese fare. Business kept me away during dinner time, but I'll try next time.The rooms are smallish, but well appointed with wide screen LCDs, every digital appliance you could need, a wet bar, and a firm mattress with buckwheat pillows.This was also the first time I've ever used a bidet, though it took a few tries to operate it without getting doused, as the instructions were in Japanese. The multi-lingual hotel staff was quite helpful, and the currency exchange was quite fair, unlike my experiences in other cities where you would expect to take a beating for the convenience. I can't really say anything negative about the ANA Hotel. I fell in love with Japan here, and the pleasant memories linger. ","annotations":[]}
