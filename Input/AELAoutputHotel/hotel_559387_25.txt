{"text":"One of the best hotels I have stayed in I tend not to stay more than one or two nights in any one hotel. I only use hotels if I am on the move or staying for a short break. Otherise I prefer self-catering. So if the hotel has a flaw - noisy, bad beds, not clean - I don't have to put up with it for too long. On this occasion I stayed five nights at the Hilton Diagonal Mar and loved every minute of it. I have stayed at a number of Hiltons, many of which are not of great standard, but the standard of this hotel is very high indeed.Rooms - big, clean, with silent air-conditioning. The hotel goes up to 23 floors, but mercifully our room was on the 9th with a lovely sea view. Staff - As befits the hotel chain of the english-speaking peoples, all the staff spoke english. Everyone was very pleasant and efficient.Restaurant - We ate in the restaurant one night on the terrace and it was a good experience, although the portions are pretentiously small. The crema catalana is recommended. As always, the food and drink in the Hilton hotel is overpriced, but there is plenty of choice round about.Pool - the pool area is wonderful. The pool is not large, but there were never many people in it so it did not feel crowded. Plenty of comfortable loungers and seating and good bar facilities. Location - despite the fact that it is out of the centre, I liked the location. It is quiet and well laid out. There is a very large shopping centre directly across the road with a whole level devoted to eating so plenty of choice for meals - including McDonalds for those with difficult to please children. There are also some smaller restaurants, bars and cafes in the surrounding area. The shopping centre has a large supermarket downstairs, which is handy to know. The beach is only a few minutes walk away. The metro is easily reached and takes only about 15 minutes to reach Passeig de Gracia. Also plenty of taxis available outside the hotel all day long. We took a taxi to Park Guell for about 8 euros.Another great feature of the hotel was the other guests. A really great mix of considerate, friendly and (dare I say it) unrowdy people, including many families with amazingly well-behaved children. This all contributed to making the experience so enjoyable.The only complaint is that there is not tea or coffee making facilities - but when I asked for a kettle one was brought rightaway.
