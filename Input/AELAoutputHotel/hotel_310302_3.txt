{"text":"They really preforms their 3-star hotel's characteristic - NO SERVICE This is my leisure trip and travelling with my husband.It is far away from subway station and shopping area, we need to walk around 15 minutes everyday. So you did exercise enough on every day eventhough they don't have GYM Room.If you are a foreigner, they had strongly and highlight to put the signage\/note to ask you go to another corner for the check-in arrangement. It looks like isolated. As their Front Office Ladies is so cool and shouted to me - ask me move front for check-in. However she can be more polite to escort me to walk front for check-in (Do I too demand or this is basic service?) If they can be more polite then they can make me feel more personal service - I think that is their mangement's original concept. But their staff cannot perform it.Room size is small but most of the hotels are like this in Tokyo so I understand and accept.Location of this hotel, no comment as this is fixture, cannot change, unless they can provide complimentary shuttle bus servcie between hotel to shinjuku subway station. They had check-out machine in lobby, which you can make the check-out procedure and no need to talk with their staff. So don't expect they will say Good Bye or Look forward to welcome back you soon. As I mentioned that in the sujbect - they highlight their hotel is no-service provider's hotel.Anyway, if you can afford to pay USD30 more on everynight, why not choose the hotel (Shinjuku Prince Hotel) which is near by the subway station, shopping area and they just completed the renovation for the guestrooms.
