{"text":"Good but not great! Just returned from Gran Bahia Principe, Bavaro. Spent 2 weeks over Christmas and New Year.Nice hotel very impressive on arrive, lovely large rooms although we requested a high floor and got a ground floor. Stayed in Diamond Club section.No explaination on check on what the different colour bands mean especially that you may have restrictions. Never mind Spanish speaking staff 90% of the guests were French and we later found out this is a very cheap holiday if you come from Canada unlike if you are coming from the UK.The staff had very poor English which is expected although I do believe the reception and customer services in the Diamond reception to be able to converse clearly, which they could not, if you want international guests unfortunately you need to provide the service.Most importantly if you pay any money absolutely must get a receipt, we paid $96USD in the Diamond Reception and when we went to check out they had no record of it even when we spoke to the lady we paid she conveniently could not remember and we ended up having to pay it again.Irrelevant of your band colour everyone and their uncle uses all of the pools event though they are not supposed to, so I would not bother paying the upgrade.At 11pm everything closes only option is to go to Pueblo Principe, we went there on New Years Eve and there were young guests stealing bottles of Champagne from behind the bar which was unneccessary as the drinks were free but made you wonder what else they might try to steal so we did not go back there again.Italian restaurant for breakfast was ok but dont ask for a cup of tea, it is totally alien to them, they are only ok with coffee and when you finally get yourself understood, even in Spanish, you get a cup of hot water with no milk!.Mexican was very disappointing, I love Mexican, it had no atmosphere at all and only served beef fajitas and I dont eat beef.The beach pools and the beach were like sardines in a can, it was very loud and if clubbing or playing bingo is your thing then you will love it.We stayed at the Diamond\/Hacienda pool that was much quieter but is supposed to be for those guests only but all guests were using it. We did the helicopter flight it was excellent and Dolphin Island although you have to be quick to get anywhere near a Dolphin.Dont go to Manaty Park it is awful and if you have young children dont go to Soana Island, it is a very long day and there is no shade on the speed boat and it is very bumpy too.Overall, I would not recommend this hotel based on my personal experience, the resort is too large so if you like the personal touch there is not one, the small buses need to be changed to electric or battery operated as they choke you with fumes if you can stay on long enough. I would rate it as a 4 star and that is being generous ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1624,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1621},{"endOffset":1683,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1677},{"endOffset":1683,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1677},{"endOffset":1892,"mention":"fajitas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fajita"],"startOffset":1885}]}
