{"text":"A Nice Place for Families or Business We stayed at the Hampton Inn pre-cruise so decided to try the Embassy Suites post-cruise. This Embassy Suites is located very near Isla Verde Avenue which has many places to eat, drink and gamble. The hotel also is very near the airport (5-10 minutes max). Cab from the hotel to the airport (4 people, 5 bags) was $18.00. Cab from the Royal Caribbean pier to the Embassy for the same person\/bag configuration was around $25. The hotel had flawless checkin and allowed us in earlier than the posted 4 PM checkin. The courtyard area was great. The casino is smaller but had lots of people playing. Live music was in the casino later at night. The pool was very pretty and had a nice hottub area as well but we did not have time to use it.We used laundry onsite which was adequate. The health club is fairly small for a business hotel but had a couple of each of the most popular machines.The rooms have an older decor but were clean and well maintained. It seems that the bathroom in ours was newer except for the floor tile. Again, still very nice and clean.The beds are not yet converted to the Embassy Suites style in the states as they still have bedspreads. I much prefer beds with duvet covers that get washed every stay vs bedspreads.The free business center was great as well as the wireless internet available throughout the hotel. It was nice to get back in touch with people after being on the cruise.Noting that San Juan is a very expensive place, the manager's reception with snacks and drinks held even on the Sunday night we were there was a nice freebie. The cooked to order omelets and other hot breakfast items were all very good and add to the value of this hotel. The breakfast \/ reception area is large at this Embassy allowing ample seating for many guests. Given the choice for our next stay, we'd choose this over the Hampton Inn even though it is slightly more expensive.
