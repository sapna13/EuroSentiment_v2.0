{"text":"Nice Place with a Few Glitches Stayed here recently for 6 nights. Overall I liked the hotel and would stay there again for the same price ($200 US) but there were some issues, mainly poor housekeeping. The room was clean upon arrival but it ended there. Crumbs on the floor were not vacuumed up the entire time we were there. Bathroom floor was not vacuumed and the sheets were not changed despite leaving numerous notes and requesting a sheet change at the reception. The excuse given was that the maids don't speak any English so they couldn't read our notes. Well if they don't speak English shouldn't they bring a note written in English that a guest leaves to someone on the staff who can? Not very customer service oriented I suppose. I ended up getting my own sheets and changed them myself.The rooms are quite small. We actually got lucky and got room 423 which apparently is larger than most due to it's location at the end of the hall. I think 323, 223, etc. are all similar in size. I was able to go into a few other room with different bedding set-ups and they were smaller than ours. The bathrooms were also markedly smaller than the one we had. So, try and get one of the 23 rooms. That being said, we would have been fine in one of the smaller rooms as we weren't really around much. We faced the front of the building and the noise wasn't a huge issue for us because we were on the 4th floor and we live in a big city so we are used to noise. Didn't really hear our neighbors. I almost forgot, one of the things I really liked about the room was the ability to open our windows and get fresh air. This isn't always possible at all hotels.The reception staff were extremely nice and helpful. One even came to our room one night to offer to change the sheets herself because housekeeping kept missing it. That's when I thanked her and took the sheets and changed it myself. However, the gesture was much appreciated. We were able to check in around 10:00am on a Monday. The concierge staff didn't seem to be all that interested in being helpful or even saying hello. The one time we did contact them they sent us to someone else who sent us back to them.Breakfast was fine. Actually given the prices in London (from a US $ perspective) it was good because it was included in our rate. Nothing spectacular but the setting was nice. The items on the buffet never changed so after 6 days it does get a little old. No soy milk or soy yogurt offered so if you are allergic to dairy, you're out of luck. The location was great, especially given that we flew into Gatwick. There is an express train that stops at London Bridge station and the hotel is very close, not even a full block's walk. There is a post office literally around the corner. There is a Boots pharmacy at the train station to pick up snacks. They had great prepackaged fruit and veggies. We also were able to walk almost everywhere from the hotel. We did use the tube but we like walking and London is very walkable. Don't miss the Borough food market around the corner on Saturdays. It was great. Overall it was a nice visit and for the price it was a good deal considering the quality of other accommodations available at the same price. The housekeeping issue was just an odd thing given the more upscale feel of the hotel and hopefully it was an aberration.
