{"text":"Excellent Hotel! I booked this hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor and I am so glad that I did. My husband and I spent a night here last weekend for our anniversary. We got a great rate and I couldn't have been happier with the hotel. I have lived near NYC all my life and worked there for about 8 years, so I am familiar with the city and the prices, and I have to say this was a great deal for the money - especially compared to the overpriced mid-town hotels.First of all, the service was amazing - everyone was so friendly and helpful. So much so that the place really had a small hotel or inn feeling about it. Parking was super convenient and inexpensive for Manhattan. The location was wonderful - nice neighborhood, a couple blocks from the Seaport and a couple blocks from the subway. And it is convenient walking distance from anything downtown - Seaport, Battery Park (Statue of Liberty Ferry), Ground Zero, Little Italy, China Town, etc.We had a room on the 8th floor. The room was small (typical NYC) but very nicely decorated - everything looked updated - and immaculately clean. We had a small balcony off our room from which we could see the tall ships in the Seaport and part of the Brooklyn Bridge. Nice bathroom amenities, flat screen TV in the bedroom, beautiful linens on the bed, wireless internet access. The hotel also has a complimentary breakfast each morning which was very nice and 24 hour coffee service. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!
