{"text":"Pluses outweigh minuses I stayed at the Doubletree over a long weekend. The hotel itself is nice and well layed out. It is very easy to access the Mass. Turnpike (I-90) which helps for arriving and travelling in the city. Unfortunately there isn't any public transportation within a 20 minute walk. The closest option is the red line from either Harvard or Central Square. Both are a hike. The hotel maintains a shuttle service that will take you into the city for site-seeing. I did not use it but other members of my party did and seemed quite satisfied.The room itself was very nice. It was a suite-style room with both a living room and a bedroom. The bathroom was in between and the bedroom had a door, which was nice when I had a coughing fit and could go out into the living room and close the door so as to not wake my wife up. The air conditioning was central rather than unit based which cut down on the noise and made it easier to adjust the temperature. It tended to get a little cold at night but was perfect during the day.There is a problem with the room doors. They are self-closing and seem to be weighted improperly. If you let them close on their own they slam shut. This was at first just slightly embarrassing but when the teenagers in the room next to me repeatadly allowed their door to slam shut beginning at about 5 in the morning it was supremely annoying. They seemed to be checking out so there wasn't really anything the staff could do about it.That was the only real problem though. Otherwise the staff were uniformely helpful and friendly. The price to park ($20 per day) is a little steep but is comparable to lots in the city. ","annotations":[]}
