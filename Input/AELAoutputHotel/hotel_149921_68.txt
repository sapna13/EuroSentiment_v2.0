{"text":"Loved the Caribe Hilton Stayed this past weekend at the Caribe Hilton and absolutely loved it. Arrived around 2 PM but was advised that the room wasn't ready yet. The woman at the front desk advised that the standard check-in time is 4 PM but gave me a card with a phone number to call to find out if the room may be ready sooner. Sat down in the lobby and within 10 minutes one of the managers came over, saw the card, took it, said he would check for other available rooms, and came back with 2 card keys and directions on how to get to the room. That is what I call service and paying attention to detail as well as to your customer. Was placed in the Main Hotel. The room and the hallway had been renovated but could tell there had been some water damage in the room. No mold or stale smells though. Bathroom had some upgrades but could use some more work to give it a more polished modern look. However, it was clean and nice size and after a day some of the older features had developed a certain charm. No complaints on the room, everything up to date (minus the LCD TV), extremely comfortable bed, balcony with table and two chairs, and refrigerator (a microwave would have been nice too). Ate at Palmeras twice and had the buffet. The restaurants like most hotel restaurants are pricey but the food was good. For those without a rental car, there is a subway and a ice cream shop at the end of the block. Went there a couple of times to help offset the more costly meals. Also, took a cab to San Juan ($22 round trip) for sightseeing and to try some other restaurants (about a 10 minute ride there and 15 minute ride back due to the increased traffic). The recreational areas of the hotel were truly spectacular. From the tranquil garden area to the pool and beach areas. The hammocks and the fish feeding pier were nice extras. Always plenty of staff in the pool area adding chairs as needed and keeping things maintained. I will definitely be back!
