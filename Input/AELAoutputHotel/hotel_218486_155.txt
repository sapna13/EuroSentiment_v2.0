{"text":"Give the Barcelo time I am going to start off we travel every year and stay at all different * resorts in different countries. We are not fussy people what we look for is clean, good air conditioning, decent food, everything after that is a bonus so when I do have a complaint it is justified. We believe you can break a holiday quickly by complaining so we just let things slide and enjoy ourselves.Check-in was long and we only had two families get off our bus. 1 1\/2 hour later we did get a room, with the maintenance man fixing our patio door. We arrived after 5 pm so that wasn't the problem they just told us to sit and wait so we sat at the lobby bar until they found rooms for us. Room was clean and decent, bathroom had mold on the shower curtain and on the shower wall. Oh well the air conditioner worked great. My sons room had mold also and water leaked from light fixture in bathroom he had problems with his patio door but didn't bother maintenance with it. We couldn't get a key for the room safe for three days this was an annoyance because we carried our money and passports with us and that isn't safe also. They don't have enough keys for the amount of room safes so we had to check back every day until they had some. Same with remote controls(no big deal for us) The Barcelo is still getting things done when we were there we were the first ones with new pillow tops on our mattress it was wonderful. They also were changing furniture. I loved the fridge and left notes for the maids what we wanted in our fridge (beer, water and diet coke) they had it right all week. No face cloths or clocks( not a big deal for us but some people were very upset) Towels were a hit and miss thing sometimes we got them when they cleaned the rooms sometimes later in the evening sometimes we were lucky to get a bath towel (yes we did tip)Beach- nicely kept up and lots of lounges. Punta cana has wonderful water and sand.pools- nice clean lots of chairsGrounds- Again Barcelo was adding more flower beds, painting and cleaning the ponds. Very nice. Food- Ok like I said we like decent food our first night at the buffet the choices were lamb, blood sausage and pork trotters(yes pig feet) the sauce for the pasta was a fish base. So I did have salad and the cream sauce for pasta. My son and husband would have liked meat. Every night I checked the buffet one night it was a hamburger bar. I don't mind a hamburger for lunch but not for supper. One night it was seafood and they BBQ lobster the one I had was great my husbands wasn't cooked long enough. Watch all your meat lots of the hamburger is not cooked thoroughly same with chicken. But the a la carte restaurants were great we ate at all of them and all four of us had only good things to say. In the morning for breakfast we always had trouble trying to get coffee and water you can't help yourself you have to have an employee help you. The pizza snack bar the workers were great and the pizzas good. We loved the coffee house and their desserts were great. My son and girl friend loved the sports bar and met lots of the bar tenders he had a great time in there.Bars all were good.This is the forth time to the Dominican our second to Punta Cana and I think the Barcelo will be a wonderful place in a few months when they get it back to there standards. We have always loved the Dominican people and found them friendly but not so at this resort it could have to do with them changing over and some people were loosing there jobs for Barcelo people. Don't get me wrong we met some wonderful friendly people but not as many as we usually do at a resort. Lots of time I felt like I was bothering them going to the buffet.I wouldn't recommend this resort to friends and family because of the buffet but I really do believe it will get better.
