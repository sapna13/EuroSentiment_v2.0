{"text":"A good hotel in a super location This was our fourth visit to Amsterdam, previously staying in two tacky low-budget boutique hotels and then an executive room in the Marriot ,which was excellent. We opted for the same area as the Marriot (Leidsersplein) but chose the American just for the change, and while I would still give the Marriot a higher mark, we were overall not disappointed. We stayed from May 10th to May 15th.Service at check in was top rate, the bellboy service excellent, the room very pleasant, though smaller than the Marriot, and the view over the canal and a small park just what we wanted. It wasnt double glazed, so was consequently less well soundproofed than the Marriot from the traffic noise and the occasional midnight singing of football songs by lost and drunken Englishmen on the weekend.We had breakfast in our room each morning which is very expensive but as we were on holiday we thought so what ? We had dinner in their excellent art deco Cafe American restaurant on two nights, again pricey, but if you can afford it, well worth the experience. The hotel decor throughout is both stylish and elegant, all very art deco.Leidserplein is a fantastic location for all of Amsterdam, with everything walkable or easily accessible by any one of the three tram routes which pass right outside the hotel and a host of reasonable restaurants nearby. Would like to recommend the Indian restaurant Maurya just around the corner in Korte Leidsedwars str. - wonderful experience.Vondel Park is nearby and great to walk around no matter what the weather - and a good place to hire a bike and ride around if riding a bicycle takes your fancy but the idea of riding in traffic scares the living daylights out of you like it did us !All in all, a good hotel, in a super location, in a fantastic city. If and when we return to Amsterdam, I would probably just give the Marriot the nod for its bigger rooms and bathrooms and generally quieter environment, though the American is by far the more stylish and elegant hotel.
