{"text":"Terrible I stayed in this hotel with my husband and 8 more friends from USA for 5 days 4 nights. We had a bad time in this place. there was discrimination against non-white clients. they mistreat their own domincans guest that travel from another country. The group that went to this hotel with me was from diferent nationalities:, dominicans, puerto rican, african american and caucasian. There was never reservations available for us, at the restaurants, but as soon a caucasian family or group ask for reservation, there was always space for them..Including guest from Spain. the Food was always the same and cold and terrible at the bufet restaurants. night entertainment was also bad...front desk staff was unfriendly due to all the complaints people was making during our stay. AHHH, before i forget, BEACH TOWELS... you never found beach towels in the morning.. we have to waited for 4-5 hrs and the girl from the beach towel dept was very racist.. she took care of the white guest first and to the rest was very rude.. I said that because I am dominican and she did it to me and other non-white guest, and my husband is caucasian and he was not treated the same way i was. If you try to complain with supervisors on duty, they always make excuses for their racist employees.I do not have any thing positive to say about this hotel while i stayed there. I wanted to leave the place however the hotel do not give your money back...so we stayed. most of the beach was dirty with sea weed. MOST OF THE GROUP AND OTHER GUEST HaD STOMACK PROBLEMS.If you support this behavior I guest you dont care about the way they treat other guest that are paying money to be there too and have the right to be treated with respect and dignity. God bless you and have a safe trip where ever you travel.
