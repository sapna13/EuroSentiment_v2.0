{"text":"Worst stay of the trip. We just returned from a 10 day trip to the Hawaiian Islands and The Breakers Hotel had to be the worst experiance in those 10 days.The owners of this place are undoubtably waiting on the big offer for their property because they are doing nothing to fix it up or improve it.Parking is a joke. There are only seven spaces and most of these are for the staff. You will carry your luggage a distance and noone will offer to assist you.Our only vanity in the bathroom was the top of the toilet tank. The sink is only crotch high. The shower makes a noise like a car starting.The bed linens are super thin and the pillows are almost non-existant.The TV had a converter box on top that you had to change the channels by hand, no remote. I think we had like 10 channels.Their web site advertises WiFi by the pool but when I inquired I was told they were waiting on parts. That is so much bull. You can purchase a wireless setup anywhere and have it going in 1 hour.Another problem we had is that in the European tradition they want you to leave your key at the desk when you go out and pick it up when you return. The desk is on the opposite side of the complex from the parking so you have to walk about a block to drop off and pick up your keys.Never ever again would we stay here. ","annotations":[]}
