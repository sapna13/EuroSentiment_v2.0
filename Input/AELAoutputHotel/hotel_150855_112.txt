{"text":"Not a 5 star My Boyfriend and family stayed at the RIU TAINO from February 18th- 25th 2007. Perhaps it is because we had awful weather that we noticed so many problems with this resort. First, our room was falling apart. None of our doors functioned properly, cracked ceilings, and missing handles on almost all drawers. The matress was paper thin and the sheets were awful and moist. It was 2 twins made into a king so If u rolled to the middle u would be in a crack. The food was not great at all. They state to have many restaurants around but every buffet served the exact same thing..crappy food. The Steakhouse was by far the most awful meal. we actually took one bite and spit it out and left to go to the buffet. my boyfriend survived on french fries and cucumbers for 7 days straight. The Entertainment was just ridiculas.. After every sentance they went into this stupid dance over and over and over again. They didnt even know the moves so just to introduce the guests participating in the game took 40 minutes. One night they asked the crowd where they were from and 90 percent that evening was from Canada or the U.S and they then did a 30 minute comedy show in spanish. Many of the European guests were downright rude and had no respect for the people around them or the resort itself. To top it off on the last day they state you can have a courtesy room to shower and change before u leave and instead made you go into a gross communal shower of sorts.....just disgusting.. I had to throw away my sandals after that. My main issue with all this is that we were under the impression that this was a 5 star, If we went there thinking it was a 3 star it would have been fine. But to be let down day after day u need a vacation just to forget you were ever there.
