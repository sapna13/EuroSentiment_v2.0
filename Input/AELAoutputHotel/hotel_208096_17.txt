{"text":"Our stay was wonderful! Our stay was July 2nd to 6th\/08 and we were quite surprised by how wonderful everything was. We stayed in a studio apt. #1316 which unfortunately didn't overlook the Seine, but the apt. was very clean, well stocked with two comfortable single beds. I found the front desk staff polite, but I was very impressed with their concierge - he was just wonderful. I was unfortunately pick pocketed at the Pont Neuf (beware of them - they are everywhere) and the concierge certainly went beyond the call of duty helping me with phone numbers and dialed some of the numbers himself and gave me directions to the police station and embassy, he was very concerned, and I just can't say enough on how comforting it was to have his help as I don't speak French. Another wonderful perk was their computers in the lobby - there were 3 of them and it was great to do research and keep in touch with friends. We really didn't have to wait for the computers - there always seemed to be one that was free - plus they also had a printer which was of great help - all free. In the lobby they also had a coffee machine and it also made cappacino and hot chocolate - we found that was a great money saver.I must add that the apartment had a well stocked galley kitchen and eveything was clean. There was a dish washer, stove top, microwave and a small fridge. We bought groceries and the apt. is spacious enough to eat a meal in - after a long day of sight seeing - we did stay in one evening and had all this wonderful gourmet take out and a nice bottle of wine. The TV was a good flat screen and we were able to watch CNN every evening before going to bed.Also as everyone else has stated - it is in a wonderful location close to everything - some great restaurants within minutes - we had a lovely meal at a Guy Savoy restaurant just a couple of doors down - it was called Les Bouquistes - they probably had the best polenta (served with lamb) that I have ever had and my appetizer was a lobster ravioli that was perfect - it was a lovely meal.I highly recommend this hotel.
