{"text":"Believe all the negative reviews Before booking this trip, we read many reviews, mostly all bad but chose to believe the few good ones. #1 mistake.We booked through travelocity, they never had our reservation at the hotel, waited in line 6hrs, staff ignored us, I was hysterical, they ignored us more. We had to pay for a room and decided to deal with travelocity when we got home.Airport arrival, they only take US Dollar, nothing else. We had no cash, our mistake, but we figured we could hit an ATM and get cash, sure but only in PESO. Airport staff HARRASS you, everyone has different price. We arrived at the Caribe-Beach, got out, and the taxi driver told us we needed to go to Beach since this place was closed for renovations, ok, why are there 500 people in the lobby then?We get to Beach, another 500 people in lobby.Check - in staff dont care, they ask for voucher, which in US they dont give you, then they check it in computer then walk back to this office and come back and help someone else. Very rude, very little english.Room - OH MY GOD!!!!! We were upgraded to ocean front for our 6hr check in problems, room was ok, basic, bathrooom - DIGUSTING. Ceiling leaking water, water damage everywhere, old, nasty. A\/C did not work. Called guest services, said they would send someone, 3 hrs later, boiling in our room, called back, they sent someone. They knew exactly what to bring and what to fix, hence this must have been problem many, many times before. Duct tape and thats it. They claimed it was fixed, it was barely on low for us. We were so happy to finally be checked in, we didnt bitch. By 6th day, the A\/C was broke again, they came to fix with same materials and it broke again at 2AM and we had to suffer all night because guest services closes at midnight, and you cant get any service after that. We asked to switch rooms for the last night since our A\/C was now broke, the tub was clogged with water and the toilet had proceeded to overflow all over the floor. BELIEVE THESE REVIEWS.Food - the food is pretty good, the buffet is sketchy since they dont believe in ice like we do, but if you are careful with what you pick, you should be fine. this is not to say we all didnt get the runs and one of us in bed for 24hrs with violent stomach pains.Oh and the maid stole our entire box on Immodium.Booze - 2 types of beer and the rest fruity drinks, it gets old quick. And they dont pour heavy either.Staff - barely speak english, they work their butts off though and get paid nothing for it. But they choose to do it so oh well.Wedding - we got married there, it was planned 6 months in advance, the wedding planner, Maricruz should be shot. They sent the flowers and champagne late, they decorated the wrong room and they got our dinner reservations and wedding cake date late so we had neither. Oh and when we got back to the room, the A\/C was broke. Great wedding night. They also told the photographers onsite not to photograph us since we didnt buy the photographer package.Airport depature - the staff open up the taxi, take your luggage without asking then carry it for you to the line, we didnt ask, they just do it then stand there and wait for tip. Very very pushy too.There was no airport depature tax like they say, so I dont know where people get that from.Back home in US, it feels really good to be home.I would not choose this resort or the Dominican Republic for vacation, go to Mexico instead.
