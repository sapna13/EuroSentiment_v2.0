{"text":"Nice Hotel, Great Location My husband and I stayed here for a long weekend. We had an ocean view room with beautiful views! Room looked exactly like the pictures on the website. Staff was courteous and helpful. The beach was small, but never crowded. There were two pools: one that was really shallow but had a swim-up bar and slide for kids and another, salt-water pool that was deeper, probably 6-8 ft or so. The hotel is not very far from Old San Juan. My husband and I went into that area quite often. It was a quick and easy drive. We also rented a car and had no trouble in the self-park lot underneath the hotel. Parking was $15\/night which we thought was pretty reasonable.I did, however, have some concerns: - the hotel restaurants were horrible (the poolside restaurant was decent) and do not reflect the upscale feel of the hotel generally; you would do better to eat at one of the fabulous restaurants in Condado (all walkable), Old San Juan or at the nearby Caribe Hilton - the concierge desk could use some work; it would be helpful if the concierge had menus for the area restaurants available and had printed directions to some of the popular tourist spots like El Yunque, Bacardi Factory, etc. - the smoking; I can understand why smoking would be allowable in the casino and in the lounge, but at the pool, at the swim-up bar, in the lobby, etc. Not only is it nasty but again, it does not match the upscale feel that the hotel is trying to createOverall, though, I would still recommend Condado Plaza. The hotel is still renovating and I think that it will be an even better place to stay next season!
