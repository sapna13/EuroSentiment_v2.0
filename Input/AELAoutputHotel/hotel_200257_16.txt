{"text":"Nice, but a bit boring...... As the Ritz Carlton was fully booked one of the 3 nights in Berlin, we decided to try the Dorint. Well, we actually found ourselves hanging out having a drink and smoking a cigar, at the Cutain Club at the Ritz anyhow :-)The Dorint has a great location, right at the historic Gendarmenmarkt in Old and historic Berlin. Houses may be reconstructed, but the feel is great. Our Favorite spot for meals and great wine (Lutter  Wegner) is just two steps away.The service at the Dorint however is invisible The staff invisible. Not that we did not get the service we needed, but a true great hotel has alway warm and attentive staff placed here and there.Your lucky if you spot any other staff than in the reception. There is no place to hang out, no real lobby to lounge in, or to enjoy a drink. The public spaces at the hotel are simply so boring, that you will fall asleep after five minutes of hanging out in the reception-area or walking around.zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......... boring. The rooms are rather small though very well designed. The design is modern, clever and boring. The TV-set should however be replaced. It was a great laugh.On a positive note,The place is clean and well run. Staff friendly when you actually meet them. THE SPA AND GYM IS MAGNIFICENT. TRULY GREAT! I must say, the spa and gym is one of the best i have ever visited. Really nice. But beware, its mixed and naked. (Just like all other german spas.)The restaurant next door (Aigner) is great. Breakfast at the hotel is rich to say the least , a buffet that beats everything i have seen in any hotel. The room in wich its served is also very cool, but we ended up having breakfast on town anyway, it was simply too boring as we were just a few guests and the atmosphere too sterile.All in all its a OK place to stay in, if you get yourself a good rate. We did, and slept well, in a great location. Nothing else. Eating, drinking, laughing and hving a great time, we did on town and at Lutter  Wegner.
