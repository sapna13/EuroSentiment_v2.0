{"text":"Room was ok We stayed at Outrigger Luana for 5 nights in June 2007. The hotel is located about 10-15 minutes walk from the main beach at waikiki. It was an ok walk, past all the shops :)The hotel has parking available underneath the hotel (keycard activated). It was safe parking, we always managed to get a parking spot, but we often took the last one. Parking is US$18 a day too.We had a partial ocean view room. The view from the window was nice. we were on the 14th floor. We could see over the park out to the ocean in the distance. The hotel is right next to the main road though, so with the window open it was very noisy. The air conditioner was noisy too..so a bit of a no win situation there!The room was large, and included a kitchenette. The bed was a queen bed, but it was not comfortable and the sheets were not big enough for the bed. The bottom sheet was not a fitted sheet, but a flat sheet, and it constantly came up leaving us sleeping on the mattress. The staff didn't make the bed very well each day either, but this could have been because the sheets were so small.The overall room seemed a bit old and in need of a face lift. The bathroom was bit old. But it all worked as it should. Free internet in the rooms too (with your own laptop).The pool was very nice. Lots of lounge chairs for sun baking.Overall, the hotel was ok. Staff were friendly. There are so many hotels in waikiki though, you could no doubt find somewhere better. ","annotations":[]}
