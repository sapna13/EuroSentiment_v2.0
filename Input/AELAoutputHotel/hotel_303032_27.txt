{"text":"Good cheap hotel Stayed here from 9th to the 12th of January and was pleasantly happy with our stayGood points: - Near metro station to get to everywhere else as although this is not a bad location it would probably take about an hour to walk to the likes of the eiffel tower. The room size was really good considering it was Paris. The rooms were very clean with towels changed daily and a nice warm heater on.The quietness of the room was amazing considering we where only on the second floor overlooking the road. I don't think it would be good in the summer with the balcony doors open though as the road is mega busy.The location for shops, restaurants and cafes is great.The price is the best thing of all. We paid about √ä√£¬¢65 a night which is fantastic in paris!Very nice staff who spoke great english and lent us an iron, let us leave our cases on checkout day and even found a mobile in our room and packed it in our waiting cases.Bad points:- The hotel is dated and not in a good way! The hotel breakfast was supposed to be included when we booked, but an e-mail later on informed us that was a mistake, so check if you book direct with the hotel that its not still saying that brekkie is included. We then ate outside the hotel.Lack of facilities - no bar or anything, but don't really need it with everything that is on doorstep.The shower was tiny in the bathroom, but very clean.All in all I would recommend it to fellow first time travellers to paris for value for money, it cannot be beaten!
