{"text":"Outstanding in every way My husband, two middle school aged children and I had the great pleasure of staying at the Omni San Francisco for four evenings (two on the front end of our drive North on Highway 1 and two on the back end of the drive before our return home). This is simply a gem in the heart of San Francisco. One of the cable car lines runs directly in front of the hotel. Our room was perfect. Comfortable, all of the amenities, quiet. Housekeeping is friendly, gracious and respectful of guests' privacy. We even had complimentary milk and pastries at bedtime. Every staff member we encountered was well-trained, genuinely concerned about our comfort, always offering a smile, exceptionally polite. We'd be remiss if we didn't single out 'Dorian', a bellhop who took considerable time with us to offer kid-friendly (and parent-friendly) touring suggestions. He didn't steer us wrong. We took his advice and road bicycles across the Golden Gate Bridge. We went to the Monet exhibit. 'Dorian' greeted us as if we were old friends. When we encountered a glitch with our rental car (it didn't arrive as scheduled for our drive North), 'Joey' arranged for a complimentary (delicious!) breakfast in the hotel restaurant while we waited. And, as if that wasn't enough, he presented us with a cooler filled to the brim with juices, water, and soft drinks for the drive. Now that's first-class! The only thing I would add to this wonderful experience is a gift shop (there isn't one). The nearby Walgreen's closes at 7pm and a place to shop for a few snacks (other than the room mini-bar), and even a San Francisco souvenir would be a delightful addition.
