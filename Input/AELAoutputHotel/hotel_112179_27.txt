{"text":"Solid choice for a non-resort It deserves mention first off (because one might not know by looking at the hotel website) that not only is this not a resort, but there are no grounds to even speak of (what with pictures of grass and trees and a large pool terrace). The pool is located on the roof of the first floor and is not a concrete pool -- it is a fiberglass pool measuring about 15'x30' and not even 4' deep, and there is no jacuzzi. The fitness center adequate, furnished with newer cardio machines, some weight machines and older looking free weights and a couple TVs. Do not expect individual screens or flat panels or even flat screens. In defense, most business travelers (the Ritz's target demographic) probably don't care much about individual TV screens and free-form infinity pools and rock formation hot-tubs.What I would imagine business travelers care about most (I was visiting for a football game -- business in its own right) are beds, internet access, and showers, in that order. The beds are phenomenal -- so plush I fell into a euphoric bliss. They feature down pillows, quality linens, and the most overstuffed featherbed on which I've ever slept. Each room also features a quality Panasonic clock\/radio\/cd player which sounded good (a poor-man's Bose Wave Radio). The internet access ($9.95 per day) is wireless in the room and presented zero problems. As good as the bed is, the shower is a close runner-up. Many up-market hotels are opting for rainfall showerheads, which seem appealing in theory but often miss the mark because of poor water pressure. This bathroom had an older looking (though premium quality) standard-size showerhead, and it was perfect. It maintained a more than sufficient amount of pressure without stinging or creating a windstorm. Kudos on keeping it real with the old-school showerhead.The guestrooms also feature an ample-sized desk, complimentary coffee\/tea\/water with a sleek new coffee maker, and early-90s TV set. My only gripe with the room is with the television - it simply doesn't fit with the rest of the room. The in-room dining menu could definitely use some tweaking. Prices are pretty standard (dare I say reasonable?) for an upscale hotel, but menu offerings are pretty limited (I didn't order anything so I can't comment on the food itself). While the outdoor public areas are totally forgettable, the lobby and lounge area exude an old world ambience without the stuffiness one might expect from a luxury\/business property. The staff overall was pleasant and accommodating (they granted me a late check-out without flinching), but the ladies in housekeeping and doormen deserve special recognition. The room was spotless for the duration of the stay, the rollaway was brought up when requested, and the two times I approached one of the ladies for extra towels or shampoo they were so genuinely happy to help. The doormen were also great with directions and recommendations around Phoenix.In closing, I would advise that if you are looking to relax and unwind, you might wish to look elsewhere. However, for a weekend trip or business excursion, it's hard to beat the Ritz. It's centrally located (near food, lots of bars, shopping, stadiums, the airport) and provides everything necessary for a great night's sleep.
