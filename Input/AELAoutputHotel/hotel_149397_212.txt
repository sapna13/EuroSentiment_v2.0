{"text":"Service a BIG problem My family and I have travelled throughout the Caribbean, but this was our first trip to DR. We chose this resort because it was a Special Deal from Air Canada Vacations. I had read the reviews of this hotel, but we decided that it was worth going (despite the reviews) because it was so inexpensive.Luckily we had the Platinum Package. This was absolutely worth it because we had a private lounge, free dinner to the Licey Restaurant, and we were very close to the beach. Also, the AC rep (Catherine) was often in this lounge, and she was extremely helpful if you needed anything.We had two rooms. Both rooms were quite big and clean, but they could use some sprucing up. The paint was yellow in spots, and the bathtub could use a refinishing (the enamel was chipped in spots). One room smelled nice, and the a\/c worked well and silently. The other room's a\/c was EXYREMELY noisy (ear plugs were needed to sleep at night), and the room always smelled musty. In both rooms the water pressure was better if you used lukewarm water, but quite low or non-existant on certain days if you went to warm (hot is not an option!) The food was good. We only went to the buffet one night. The a la carte restaurants varied in quality  taste, but overall were good. The Licey is excellent, as is El Pescador. Breakfast was good, and lunch was hit or miss. The biggest problem when it comes to the restaurants, whether sit-down or buffet, is the service. It is quite bad. At breakfast, we would have to ask the wait staff several times to bring us coffee. They would either ignore us or roll their eyes. Only after asking repeatedly would we get a cup. Forget about refills! It was slightly better at the main buffet, but the beach area buffet was terrible. In fact the worst service was always at the beach area restaurants. At the grill, people would be waiting for many minutes to place an order while the cook ignored the fact that people were standing there waiting to order a hamburger or hot dog. You would only get served if you just ordered want you wanted in a loud voice. Then he would pretend he hadn't seen you (or the other people standing at the counter). You need to be VERY careful with the hamburgers!! The person working the grill takes frozen patties from the freezer, and cooks them on a very hot grill. This results in the hamburger being burnt on the inside but raw inside. NOT HEALTHY TO EAT!The beach is gorgeous, but absolutely no service. No one comes around asking if you would like a drink (a mainstay in most resorts). If you would like a drink, you have to get up and order one. The bartenders at the beach area are not very polite, and if they think you don't speak Spanish they will insult you or call you names! Unbelievable behaviour!There are not enough beach umbrellas. Unless you get to the beach before 7am, you will not get one. I would not go back to this hotel. Although the beach is beautiful, I do not like feeling frustrated on holiday. The service REALLY needs to be improved. If I had paid full price for this hotel, I would have asked to be transfered to another hotel. There are no excuses for wait staff to ignore a client. The idea of wait staff rolling their eyes or insulting you is inexcusable.
