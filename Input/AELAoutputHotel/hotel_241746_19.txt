{"text":"First time in Florence Recently I visited Italy (Florence) for the first time. I was looking for a hotel to stay in and did not know which to choose because there are so many. Fortunately I have an Italian friend who lives in Florence who arranged for my wife and I to stay the in the Hotel Botticelli. All I can say is you can't beat local knowledge or advice. The hotel was situated in the centre of Florence on one of the off streets which meant it was very quiet at night so we always got a good nights sleep, but you just walked out of the hotel door turned the corner and bang you were there in the mix.The room that we stayed in was gorgeous, spaceous and most importantly clean. One day we had a lie in and didn't expect the room to be tidied, when we returned that evening the room was spotless the cleaning staff waited. The staff were very polite and very helpful when it came to advising us of the places to go and see and where to eat. I was a little embaressed because my Italian was pathetic by comparison to the staffs mastery of English.I've already recommended this hotel to family  friends and I will being staying here again when I return to Florence.If the rest of the country has hotels and staff like the Hotel Botticelli then I will make Italy an annual vacation for me and my family.LeeWest Yorkshire ","annotations":[]}
