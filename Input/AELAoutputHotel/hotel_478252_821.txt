{"text":"Beautifull resort, Great staff but My wife and I just came back from a week ( 12 Mar. 07 ) at the Grand Bahai. The property is very well kept and beautifull but a few things could be better, first -hide some towells in your room has we found that you do not get fresh towels until after supper, so when you come to your room after a day in the sun you have no towels to shower with before supper, we had to phone three times for towels. No complaints about the food, Buffet had lots of choice, the French and Japanese A la carte restaurant were excellent, The staff is great our maid tried all she could to get us towels but it was not her fault that the clean towels were not delivered to her until after supper. Wanna and Victor in the lobby lounge were excellent and very entertaining, say Holla for us we miss them already. One big problem is too many familly with kids ( babys to 5,6 years old) don't get me wrong we also have children, but when you spent that kind of money it is not to lesson to other kids, and why spent that kind of money and not relax with-out them. The other problem is the resort althought beautifull it is too big and their is too many people ( 5000 +\/-). Have to get up every morning at 7:00 to 7:30 to reserve a couples of chairs at the pool or the beach has some people do the same and do not show up until late afternoon, there is a 2 hrs limit on the chair reservation as per resort rule and be considerate to other people.
