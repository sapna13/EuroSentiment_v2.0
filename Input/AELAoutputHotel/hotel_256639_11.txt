{"text":"Superb, old world hotel in excellent location; splendid staff This is a superb, elegant, oldy world hotel at a great location at Circular Quay, near to the Rocks. Expensive but value for money given the quality and location of this hotel. We booked online and got a good deal.Right from the friendly welcome from the staff on arrival, we had a great 2-day whistle-stop stay. Check-in was a breeze. Our heavy luggage was whisked up to our deluxe room by a friendly, customer-oriented (elderly) bellman who delighted in showing us all the 7th floor room√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ facilities down to the splendid view of the harbour (and opera house), and the handy golf-size umbrella in the cupboard. The room was spacious with a lounge settee and chair, desk, broadband, and a large bathroom with two basins and appointed in Carrera marble. The bed was comfortable, large, and not too soft. Every time we passed a staff member, we received a friendly smile and solicitation. Even arranged late evening room cleaning while we went to dinner, after we forgot to take off the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≠o Not Disturb√à√\u2020\u2022?sign on the door!We did not try the elegant restaurant for dinner √à√\u2020\u2022?but breakfast offered good, wholesome, hot and cold food with a wide variety of choices, including good back bacon (not the cheap streaky\/fatty stuff offered by US hotels). We also did not have time to use the swimming pool.In the 2 days we spent there, we visited the New South Wales Parliament (personalized tour, even though they had just closed!), the Barracks Museum (showing convict archaeology and history), St Mary√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Cathedral, and the outside of the Opera House (really one of the greatest twentieth century buildings in the world!) Had dinner outside at the East China restaurant on the Quay with a great view of the bridge at sunset. (Some of the best Chinese food we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe had + a good wine list.) Second day (Good Friday) was overcast and cooler; we visited the grounds of Government House (the House was closed) and then did the tour of the Opera House (a must) and the ferry to Manly, enjoying great views of the Bridge and the Opera House on the way (Get a seat at the stern.) Manly is a favourite short-range destination for Sydney folks on holidays. At Manly, we visited Oceanworld to see the sharks and other exotic fish in a glass tunnel. Despite fearing it would be cheesy, it was a real eye opener, and not at all cheesy. (You can even don a diving suit and check out the fish on a more personal basis. We were told the sharks didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bite, but didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to take the risk!) Back to Sydney, then spent a couple of hours just walking up and down George Street and around the Rocks. Wonderful.When you check out, do check your bill carefully to ensure you are not charged for the inclusive breakfast and broadband, if it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ supposed to be included in your package. The hotel sorted it out √à√\u2020\u2022√ä√®?ventually.One more tip: if you take the shuttle back to the airport, be sure to leave yourself plenty of time and confirm 24 hours in advance. The shuttle arrived at the hotel on time but after picking up other passengers and what seemed like a complete tour of Sydney, arrived at the airport half an hour late.
