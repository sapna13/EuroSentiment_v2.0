{"text":"Wonderful weekend at Pointe Hilton The Pointe Hilton was a great place for a girls weekend getaway! We arrived at night, and in the morning we walked the property to get our bearings. The resort is gorgeous! Our suite was on the 'mountainside' area, very quiet and up on the hill. We walked down the hill, found the pools, workout area, and restaurants. Our suite was very nice, well decorated and very clean. The staff at this resort couldn't have been more pleasant, from check in to room service to the concierge. We did use the free shuttle service to get around the resort a few times, and this was easy and quick.We dined at Pointe in Thyme upon our arrival, for a late snack and drinks, and I would recommend it (except for the occasional smoker!). For breakfast, we had bagels and cappucino from the lobby store, and brought these out on the patio overlooking the adult pool. And our last night, we dined at Different Pointe of View at the top of the cliffs. We had early reservations, 5:45, so that we could see the sunset, and watch the city of Phoenix change colors. The restaruant is a bit pricey, but the food and service were excellent, and the view.... perfect!We enjoyed the pools, and went to the Falls pool (a little noisy) and the lower pool (very quiet). We recommend the strawberry margaritas while lounging by the water here.Other recommendations while in Phoenix: hike Camelback mountain early in the morning, visit the Phoenix Museum of History in Heritage Square and have lunch in the Arizona Center close by, visit Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin West, and if you're a pizza lover as we are, definitely go to Pizza Bianco, also in Heritage Square! It was wonderful and worth the 1 hour wait!
