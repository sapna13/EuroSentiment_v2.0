{"text":"Great location. I really enjoyed staying here.I booked this hotel on [--] for a four day sightseeing trip to Barca. I paid √ä√£¬¢350 for four nights (2 people) including breakfast and taxes.The hotel is in a great location only 5 minutes walk from the best shops in town. Prada, Gucci, Armani etc etc. Placa Catalonia is only 10 mins away too so that was spot on.The hotel itself was good, rooms were not very big but spotless and cleaned everyday. Lovely fresh towels and a superb bath and monsterously powewrful shower.Breakfast was superb and served 7am to 10:30am so good for early risers and those who have a few beers the night before. If you love your tea take some of your own english teabags as those served at breakfast were rubbish. We had the set menu in the restaurant one night and it was really nice. Three courses, including really fresh seafood, water, wine and bread for only 18 Euros each. We both felt it was well worth it.The only critisisms I have is that the room doors slam shut when people arrive\/leave. This was particulary annoying at 6am when some people left early. Our door was the same and if you didn't control the door as you left it would slam behaind you due to not having those bracket type things that slowly close most doors.Also when I was there the air conditioning was not working in the room which got quite warm at night. I was told at reception that it does operate at this time of year. (March) I would have liked it on.The hotel is on a busy junction but the traffic noice is completely cancelled out by the double set of windows so this was not a problem.Overall, I would stay again if they sorted out the slamming doors on the 5th floor.
