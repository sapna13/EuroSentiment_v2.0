{"text":"Not what we hoped for ... OK, we get it, Hong Kong is expensive! :) The Marco Polo Prince is an entry level upper-ish tier hotel in Kowloon, so our expectations were at least above average. If you pay that much in a city like DC or Boston, you get a pretty decent place. Plus it's not that much less than the Sheraton down the road in Kowloon ($30\/night less or so), so again, we were hoping for a nice place to spend a romantic vacation. (BTW, after the first night we would have moved in a jiffy if the Sheraton had rooms).While the lobby is nice, the hotel rooms feel OLD. They are tiny. The view was of a building right across an alley. We were on a rare vacation and wanted a view, so we called down politely asking if we could move, even if it meant paying more. We were told no, there were no rooms left in the hotel. I got internet access ($18\/night BTW), checked online, and found that there were indeed other rooms available in the hotel for THAT night at a range of rates. Whatever.The electronic circuitry is old, so much so that there is actually a sign in the bathroom saying that the plug there is ONLY for razors because anything that draws more power will blow a fuse. My wife was looking for a blow dryer, which we couldn't find, so we called the reception desk. They told us to look in the drawer of the desk (the one the TV is on top of!), where sure enough an antique blow dryer lived. It was wired\/attached directly into the desk (you couldn't remove it), so you were in the odd situation of drying your hair with nothing to look at except the TV. An amenity in the eyes of some, I suppose.We were there in January, so the weather was a bit cold at night. The heating system was at least 20 years old, and its controller was simply an Austin Powers era 4 push button deal (off, low, medium, high) with an odd little dial that you could twist towards + or -. We tried all combinations, and while the fan worked, none spat out any heat at all.One night we tried to watch a movie ... the Pay-Per-View didn't work. We called reception, who sent someone who confirmed it wasn't working. They were very helpful, but I had to stop them from sending in a repairman at 11 pm ... thanks but no thanks (probably should have bought a $2 DVD off the street instead).Plus two mornings in a row they tried a ploy to charge more $. They left a message on our voicemail. I called and got a friendly recording reminding me of the increase in rate that night. Huh? My online reservations said nothing of this. It turns out they were about to charge us an extra 100 HKD for a breakfast we didn't ask for. I told them the first time that we don't eat breakfast, and they assured me they would remove it. It happened again the next day, and I again called them to ask them to remove it (somewhat annoyed I wasn't spending this time out enjoying myself). They said they could do it for day #2, but since I never asked them to remove the charge for day #1 (!!!), they had no choice but to charge me for the breakfast I didn't have yesterday. I argued, and they did eventually remove both mornings. But for $200 a night, should you have to put up with this crap?My strong advice is get a bargain hotel that actually goes for a bargain price, or pay the small extra and go for the Sheraton. Forget about Marco Polo ... it ain't worth it.
