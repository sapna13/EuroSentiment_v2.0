{"text":"Amazing Time at the Gran Bahia Principe I just reluctantly removed my wristband this morning from the Gran Bahia Principe, and I must say, I miss it already! We had the most perfect November weather, only rained one day. The people were just superb and so friendly, especially my maid, Gladys. I wanted to adopt her and bring her home. The finishing touches on our room with the pretty flowers everywhere and the towel shapes... just so nice. The BATHROOM at the resort -- GORGEOUS!! Marble everywhere, great shower - nice and warm. Big, huge jacuzzi bathtub. Just perfect!!! The grounds.... I have never seen a hotel kept up so beautifull, IMMACULATE, and manicured. There were people working around the resort it seemed, like 24 hours a day. The pools were so nice, and crisp, and relaxing. The beach was gorgeous, and the snack bar facing the ocean was a HUGE plus. I enjoyed the Steakhouse ala carte restaurant the most. My husband and I didn't care at all for the Seafood Restaurant El Pescador. I say avoid it! If I had any complaints whatsoever, I would say that the cooks at the restaurant need to be better trained on the international cuisine that they are preparing, such as Italian dishes, American dishes, and European dishes, even Pizza. I think a little training by some top chefs or a school in these types of cuisines would help them prepare dishes that everyone would enjoy!!! The actual dominican dishes were FANTASTIC! I love spanish food, and the rice and beans and other tropical dishes were right on the money!! But a little training in other cuisines would be great, and you wouldn't get so many complaints about the food from people (which we heard a lot of!!!). All in all, the stay was great, the weather perfect, the resort gorgeous, and I miss it already.....Next stop: Gran Bahia Principe Cayo Levantado!!!!!!
