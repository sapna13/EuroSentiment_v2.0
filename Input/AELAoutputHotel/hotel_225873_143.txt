{"text":"Great location, good value... We have just returned from our first ever trip to the USA. we had a three week itinerary part of which included two night stopoever in Boston. After reading reviews, we choose the Charlesmark. The hotel is well located and its an easy walk to all those places you want to see. We had travelled by train from NYC and the hotel is only a short walk from the Amtrak station.The hotel is of the informal boutique variety and also has a public ground floor bar area. Reception was friendly and welcoming and we were assigned our standard room which was on a rear corner of the building on the fourth floor. Being on the corner meant we had two windows which gave a feeling of extra space to the rather small room size which others have commented on but is perhaps what is to be expected in a busy City. Having said that, they have made the best use of the space and the room and bathroom are clean, comfortable and well equipped and should suit most people for a stay of upto two or three nights.A continental breakfast is provided but some may decide that it isnt worth bothering with. Cooked breakfast can be had at keen prices at local eateries and the hotel recognises this in its room literature. The lounge area has two internet terminals for those essential emails home to friends and family.All in all a good value comfortable hotel in a great ,convenient location.
