{"text":"Beautiful place but very big We stayed in the RS section of this hotel for two weeks at the beginning of April. We travelled there with our 4 year old son. The rooms are beautiful - we stayed in an RS master suite. Separate bedroom, kitchen, dining area, pull-out couch, king size bed, jacuzzi tub. Our butler\/conceirge (Edward) showed us to our room, brought up our luggage, we paid him $25 US hoping that if we took care of him that he'd take care of us - well we never saw him again. We did call him to arrange dinner reservations, golf reservations, spa reservations, etc. however we had to leave messages and he never got in touch with us. We ended up doing everything ourselves. The butler\/conceirge aspect that they market is quite over-rated.We chose this resort in part because of the kids facilities - climbing wall, trampolines, jungle gym, etc. however we didn't get the opportunity to use them. As our son is 4, he was not old enough to do a lot of the activities. We did go to the kids club one day for an hour just to hang out and play with the kids but there were so many mosquitos there in the morning that we left. Bring bug spray.The resort is huge to say the least. While we had stayed in big resorts before (there are 1100 rooms), we thought we were prepared but this property is quite spread out. There are lots of pathways and it's easy to get lost. Big resort brings lots of dining options, pool options, etc. but be prepared to walk in the heat. The resort is separated into 2 sections (Caribe  Tropical). The restaurants are in one sort of walkway at the entrance which is linked up by the two lobbies. The buildings are spread out over many acres and the beach is at the other end. The RS section is off to the side. It is nicely secluded and great if you plan on staying put.Food - The food at the RS section (Gabi Club) is really, really good. Breakfast and lunch is buffet and dinner is buffet plus a la carte. Rib eye, lobster, stuffed chicken breast, duck, etc. Lots of seafood but lots of other options as well (for both adults and children). The other end of the food saga - dinner reservations. We booked into the RS section so we would receive the benefits of not having to call the dinner reservation line with the rest of the 1100+ rooms in the hotel. We couldn't get dinner reservations some nights and other times we were told we had reservations and when we got to the restaurant, well we didn't. Not too big of a deal because we always had the Gabi Club to fall back on but if this sort of thing happens to the RS people imagine how the rest of the regular folks felt when this happened to them. Pools  beach - There are many pools throughout the complex. We stayed at the RS pool most of the time - nice size pool - not too much of a shallow end other than seats along one side so if your child can't swim - bring water wings! There is a small children's pool there which is knee deep. Getting an umbrella at the pool or a cabana is a huge ordeal - the hotel really needs to improve where this is concerned. We would set our alarm (on vacation) and go down and put our towels on a couple of seats and an umbrella at 6:00am every morning to ensure we got one! Crazy! We did venture over to the pool at the Tropical side of the hotel where the kids club is but it's a walk from the RS side and can be very busy.Overall, the complex is beautiful. Lots of greenery, wildlife, sand and surf. The language barrier can sometimes be an issue, especially when you need something. Being from Vancouver, it's a really long day of travelling (2 days - there and back). While we enjoyed our stay there, 7 days really would have been enough. Was it worth the extra $200 a day to stay in RS - I don't think so.
