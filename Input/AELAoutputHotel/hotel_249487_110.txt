{"text":"Cool, but loud\/expensive My fiance and I recently stayed at the Water Club. The staff, for themost part, was extremely friendly and strove to be helpful (especially the doormen). The space is very chic and cool, which I really liked, even if the blue lights in a lot of spaces can get to you a bit after a while.The place is extremely cool, as I said, if expensive. It has clearly been renovated pretty recently. We didn't have a chance to have dinner there, but we did have breakfast in the main restaurant, and it was excellent (again, though expensive). The cosmo I had at the bar wasn't great (especially for $14 each), but my fiance said that his specialty drink was good and was plenty strong. The beach outsideis gorgeous, as is the view from the top floor. If you want to check out the other big hotels around, it's not a bad location from which to do that - the Intercontinental, Holiday Inn, San Juan Casino Hotel, etc. are all within easy walking distance (even in heels).The biggest problems:1) Noise: We were on the 10th floor. We had a fabulous view as a result, which was great - but we also had to listen to ALL the roofdeck noise. Since they have a club space, bar, pool, etc. up there, this was no small matter. Both mornings, we had to listen to them scraping furniture around starting at 6am - and I do mean LOUDLY! It was a bit better the second morning after we said something to the front desk, but we still heard it, and it still woke us up. And this was after listening to the club music until almost 1am, preventing us from going to sleep!2) Expense: Even though we got a good AAA rate, it was still quite expensive for the small (though cool) size of the room, and given the noise issues.3) Not much to do in the immediate vicinity: The hotel only has one main restaurant and a brief sushi bar time upstairs. If you just wantto walk to other hotels, you can do that, but there isn't much past that.I would say that this hotel would be good to stay at if you sleep deeply, like cool decor, want to be right on the beach, and will be busy most of the day. It's probably not a bad base if you're seeing friends or family in the area, have business nearby, or will be taking many day trips. But this is definitely not a hotel for someonewho wants to hang out there and have enough to do in or near the hotel. I would also say that the younger adult crowd (late 20s-early 40s) would probably be most comfortable here.So... when I return to San Juan, I will definitely eat at the Water Club, but I am not planning on staying there again. Everything taken together, the good food and cool ambience just can't outweigh the drawbacks of expense, noise, and limited available activities nearby.
