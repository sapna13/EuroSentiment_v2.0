{"text":"Nice location, great service Just returned from the Marriott Waikiki and overall I really liked the hotel, but thought it lacking in some polish for a hotel that advertises (and charges) as a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√®each Resort and Spa√à√\u2020\u2022?yet doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ quite always meet those high expectations.CHECK-IN\/SERVICE: easy enough, and staff was very friendly and helpful. Especially if you are wanting an upgrade. Seriously they will be happy to sell you an upgrade on the room. Side note: We stayed here redeeming hotel points, and since I was not the redeemer, I cannot complain much. But I do take exception when you have redeemed points for a category 6 hotel, but get basically a category 3 room, and are talked into upgrading to the more expensive room. It is a smaller nit to pick; I just get bugged by all the nickel and dime business, especially when you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe already paid that much more for a room. That said the service (concierge staff, bellmen and housekeeping) were all very good and helpful, worth the tips.RESORT: lovely, open lobby with waterfalls, tropical flowers. The hotel is divided into two large towers, that even if off the street, most rooms should provide some view. I say off the street, because it is not on the sand; it is at Waikiki Beach, not on it. You must cross the main street, which while not a big deal is worth noting. It is closer to the Diamondhead end of the strip, which offers a nice protected section of beach and smaller crowds. There are two small (not uncommon for the area) but nice pools with nicer deck chairs, a pool bar, a hot tub and cabanas (for a fee), a small but highly promoted spa, a garage ($18\/day fee), internet access (for a fee) and a small gym (no charge!). The public areas all were very nice and impressive-the website photographer did an excellent job of making everything seem bigger and better-the halls standard Marriott with brightly colored carpet done in a tropical print. There was an open courtyard with some shops, and several average hotel restaurants. DINING: We only tried a couple places there, just for convenient meals. Most were the standard hotel fare, serviceable and overpriced, such as the Kuhio Grill and Pool Bar for dinner\/lunch. My sister liked the cheaper Run sushi place, and we had good luck at the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√∂talian√à√\u2020\u2022?cafe. We did not try any of the nicer restaurants as we were trying more of the local places and usually ate a store-bought breakfast of cereal\/muffins\/fruit in our room.ROOM: We were on a corner ocean side room on the 15th floor. There is a large picture window and a nice balcony offering SPECTACULAR views of the beach and water, and Diamondhead. There is a small refrigerator in the TV cabinet, and we requested a small microwave as well. The TV was small, and with fewer channels than almost any hotel I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe visited, but with it being Hawaii and all, I guess they save on the cable knowing that most guests do not spend much time in their rooms. Even being that high, you could hear noise from the street and the pool deck below, so if you are a light sleeper, see if you can go even higher.Our corner √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºuite√à√\u2020\u2022?was basically a larger room with two queen beds and a sleeper sofa. The beds were comfortable and well-made with nice white linens, but overall the room appearance was lacking. If you look at the pictures posted by others, you will see the older furniture, dated fixtures, which are cheapened by the bright green\/yellow accent colors of the curtains and minimalist d√ã√\u2022√ñcor. The bathroom was basically a standard hotel bathroom which is fine for a standard price, but not for the upgrade to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??iew-Suite-Third person-Resort√à√\u2020\u2022?price. It also needs an update, as there were scuff marks, and peeling enamel or tile on the tub, and the dimmest vanity light I have ever encountered. They have to think the women will use the desk as their make-up\/hair area. Another nit to pick-there was a single light control for the bathroom, so if you turned on the light in the tub\/toilet area, the light would also come on in the sink\/vanity area bothering people in the night\/morning as there was not a door to block the admittedly dim light.I feel like I am being overly harsh as the hotel is very nice and we REALLY enjoyed our stay, but Marriott could\/should do a little better to stick with the claim (and price tag) of √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√®each Resort and Spa.√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/> ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":1426,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1422},{"endOffset":1530,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1526},{"endOffset":2589,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2585},{"endOffset":3269,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3265},{"endOffset":3275,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":3270},{"endOffset":3269,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3265},{"endOffset":3275,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":3270},{"endOffset":3269,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3265},{"endOffset":3275,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":3270}]}
