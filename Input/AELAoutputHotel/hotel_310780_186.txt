{"text":"Top everthing! The Hotel Europa was the first of five hotels my mother and I stayed at on our trip through Tuscany and Umbria and it set the mark so high that none of the others was able to come close. I can only rave about everything. Our room was beautifully decorated, spotless, and completely quiet despite its central location. The mattresses were excellent (and I am picky). Water pressure was great and hot water plentiful. The breakfast buffet was more than ample (with great coffee and even a better smile from Gassim).Which brings me to the real selling point of the hotel--the staff. Gassim, Miriam and her husband (I believe his name is Robert) are by far the best hosts I've ever experienced, and I do travel a lot. I arrived in Florence at 6:30 am after an overnight train ride. My room wasn't ready yet, but Gassim let me leave my luggage at the hotel, freshen up in the common restroom, and sit down in the lobby\/ living room area til I was up to facing the city. Then, armed with the map he provided me with, I was off to explore. When we left three days later, Miriam also let us keep out bags there, and when we came back to get them, provided us with juice and sweets before we left. Everyone we came in contact with, from the housekeepers to Miriam's lovely daughters, shared their genuine smiles and hellos with us. They went beyond being hosts-- I left with the feeling of wishing I had more time to get to know them better.And all this for the best price in Florence. What more could you want?
