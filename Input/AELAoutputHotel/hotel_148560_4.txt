{"text":"Spectacular Hotel Stay All in all, the location was excellent with the ocean no more than 10 yards from the hotel itself. The water was amazing allowing for swimming, and bogey boarding. The waves varied in size, and at times they were pretty big. The beach was great. Kids were building sand castles, while others were laying in the sun.The hotel itself was very nice. Of course there was sand throughout the hotel being right on the beach, but the staff did a great job keeping the building looking nice and tidy. Rooms that we stayed in were your standard hotel rooms complete with fridge. We also had a small porch overlooking the ocean and the restaurant patio.The bar in the Hosteria was a little pricey, but they made excellent pina coladas and other drinks. Also, the deserts were to good not to order them all (I recommend the sorbet).The hotel was located in an area called Ocean Park (Kind of a gated community from the rest of San Juan) which is about a 10 minute taxi ride from the cafes, shops, attractions  fort in Old San Juan.Be careful, though, I heard a story about a girl who was staying at the Hosteria while we were there: She decided to take a late night swim, and left her purse on the beach which was picked up by a passer-by. Ocean Park has its own security, but I wouldn't recommend leaving valuables on the beach at night ANYTIME.I had a great experience at the Hosteria Del Mar in San Juan, and I would recommend it to anyone. Great water, great location, great beach = Great Time!
