{"text":"Excellent hotel - incredible value for money. Book there NOW!!! I ve stayed at the Ambassador Sorat Hotel in August 2006 for a 5-nights city break. I have only good things to say about the hotel (and the lovely city of Berlin - but thats somehow irrelevant I guess :-) First of all I got a great price of 72 euros\/per night for a single room. My other options started at about 100 e+ and I seriously doubt they were any better. The location of the hotel is almost perfect. Its about 100m from a central U-bahn station (Wittenberg Platz) which serve 4 lines! The 'platz' itself is very nice and spacious with 4 'imbis' ( wurst stalls) at its 4 corners. I had a delicious curry-wurst every night on my way back to the hotel! The KaDeWe store is at the side of the square and Kurfurstendam with its loads of shops begins just 500m away.So, the location is very central, with very easy U-Bahn access and some sights right at your doorstep, like the KaDeWe and the Ruins of the bombarded church (cant remember the name right now). Also do try the wurst in the imbis you meet when exiting the station and going to the hotel! The room was very spacious (for european standards at least).It had a king size bed ( I guess it was really a double-bed ), it was very clean, had a mini-bar, big screen TV ( not the usual 14), nice ambient lighting, a sparkling clean bathroom with excellent shower water presure. One thing that I ve never met before was the fact that it had double doors! There was an outer standard door with the lock and then another one with no lock. The double doors worked very well in blocking noise from the hallways. I really liked that feature. The only thing missing from the room was air-conditioning. I think there are ACs in the more premium rooms, but mine being a basic standard one, lacked it. However that didnt turn out to be much of a problem since the weather was cool enough, even in the middle of August, that I didnt really miss it at all. And I m someone who normally has the AC working 24\/7 during the summer, but in Berlin there was no need for it. The staff was friendly enough and replied to my requests. The breakfast was good, although nothing really special.Overall it was a great experience and I ll defenitely stay there again, should I return to Berlin.
