{"text":"Your second home I stayed in Al Ponte Antico from 20.08.08 to 24.08.08. I can easily say it was a wonderful experience. I always try hard finding good accomodation and my priority is 'a special atmosphere' if not too overpriced. Thanks to many reviews of this site and my own research, Al Ponte Antico was probably the best possible choice. Hotel's website give a good idea of what can be expected: Smallauthentique hotel which you fall in love at first sight. As for the price, not too much for Venetian accomodation standards around Grand Canal. After my wonderful experince in Prague (Alchymist Grand Hotel and Spa), I was afraid of being disappointed in Venice and Al Ponte Antico. Thanks god, it was far from being the case: Both the city and the hotel fullfilled all my expectations.As those who already visited know, Venice is a very interesting city from the moment you land. You have to reach your hotel via sea route. It took around 30-40 minutes with a not-too-crowded seabus of Alilaguna Lines (which you can immediately buy tickets for 12√à√\u2020√ü?at the airport). A faster option is watertaxi which I find too expensive (100√à√\u2020√ü?. You land on Rialto stop, 5 minutes walk to Al Ponte Antico. When arriving, pay attention and spot the hotel, as when you land it's extremely easy to get lost in Venice, you'll find it difficult to find the place. Al Ponte Antico is at the end of a small street. Greeting at Al Ponte Antico was very nice and warm, which I liked much. Whether Armando, Oliviero, Tommaso or David are in the reception doesn't change things much as all of them are kind, friendly and warm-hearted. They do everything for you to feel at home and they succeed. Specially Oliviero (bornraisen in Venice, as he says) helped me and my girlfriend about the city and interesting places everytime we saw him. And when talking about people in Al Ponte Antico, how can one forget Matteo, the owner of this magnificient place? Probably the most kind, hard working and down to earth hotel-running-guy I ever met. He always ask about your plans for the day, make small recommendations, try to help you about the city and at the evening and finally not forgetting what you told him, asks you about your view on places you were. Not to even mention omelettes he makes himself, with eggs from his grandmothers village...After so much praise for the staff, the reader probably wonder about the room. The room I stayed was a small one, not having a view of Grand Canal but it was very nicely decorated, just like a bedroom in a private mansion. The bathroom is as big as the room itself, with very nice hydro-massage present.And finally the main 'trick' of Al Ponte Antico, the terrace in which you can have your breakfast. It have probaby the best of views for the Grand Canal. A very delicious open-buffet breakfast (thanks to Rosalba for excellent service and fantastic coffee) accompanied with Matteo's yummy omelettes and the dreamy view of the canal is worth every penny you spend even without further beauties of Venice! Shame there isn't dinner at the hotel but you can enjoy the terrace every hour of the daynight. It's a place you will like to spend time in.To sum up, if you look for hotels with high-end facilities, look elsewhere. But if you seek warm approach, family like treatment, special atmosphere, exclusiveoriginal accomodation and a small exclusive place like those in tales, books and films, Al Ponte Antico is the place. When your holiday ends, you won't only have unforgettable memories, but also new friends!
