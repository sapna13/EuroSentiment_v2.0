{"text":"Just a Fantastic Hotel Booked up for 3 nights at the Chancellor for the penultimate leg of our honeymoon fly drive. And like most people we booked up on the strength of Trip advisor, loving the fact that the almost legendary Wes Tyler takes time to answer his critics and tell it like it is!Location is superb - slap bang in the middle of town just off Union Square. People have spoken about the noise - it was no louder than any other major city - and if you want quiet go to country retreat: We came to San Francisco for the bustle! Having said that we had no bother sleeping - quite the opposite. The beds are superb and the refurbed rooms very comfy.You want shopping? Then Union Sq is on your doorstop and Market St just 5 mins away. The trams pass outside the front door and will take you to Fishermans Wharf where you can bike the Golden Gate. A host of restaurants and bars all within 2 mins walking distance - you have to try the cheesecake factory on the top floor of Macy's - leave some room for desert!The service here is brilliant - you can happily use the internet for nowt and even print off what you need too. The front desk staff were both welcoming and helpful. The bar was well stocked and the barman friendly but my only possibly gripe would be to keep it open longer! I tried the breakfast at the restaurant and it was quality. All in all Mr Wes I would say don't change anything. This place has real charm, character and you cannot fault the service or location. As for the price? Bargain - cheapest hotel of our honeymoon and the one we enjoyed the most. If you are planning to stay in San Francisco then you must give this place a try!
