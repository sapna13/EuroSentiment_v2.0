{"text":"A true cultural experience I stayed four nights at Hotel Aprile in November 2007. As a single traveller, I was expecting to stay in a broom cupboard and was pleased to be given a small double room on the top floor at the front, looking over the terracotta roof tiles of adjacent buildings. The decor was plain, but the room was very comfortable and well appointed. It was particularly nice to have tea and coffee making facilities and a decent mini fridge. The bathroom was well appointed with good quality toiletries supplied.The hotel has been created in an historic palazzo, and there are many reminders of its heritage around the building, particularly the remnant frescoes. The writing table in my room presented a number of publications about the history, and on some evenings there are talks on the heritage of Florence in the guest lounge. The hotel owners are proud of its history and are part of a group of hotels which support restoration projects around Firenze. I particularly enjoyed a small book of poems written by a woman who stayed there some years ago and which the hotel has published. It is this devotion to heritage and culture which sets the Hotel Aprile apart from your usual tourist accommodation.The reception staff were friendly, courteous and most helpful at all times. The hotel has an attractive guest lounge\/bar and two rooms for breakfast. The breakfast buffet was generous and wait staff were attentive. All of the hotel staff were fantastic, and made my stay as a solo traveller much easier.Hotel Aprile is only about 250 metres from the railway station, and is within reasonable walking distance of many of Firenze's great attractions. It helps to have a decent map, as some of the small streets in this vicinity can get confusing. Around the corner, Santa Maria Novella is the nearest landmark, with its great artworks. There is a cheap internet\/telecommunications shop almost next door, and a really good laundromat about 12 doors along Via della Scala. A less known heritage site very close to the Hotel Aprile is the old Pharmacy of Santa Maria Novella. It is located at No 16 Via della Scala and is well worth a visit for exquisite toiletries and perfumes.
