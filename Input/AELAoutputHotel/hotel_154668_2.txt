{"text":"Decent value for money We stayed in the hotel for two nights last week. I'd say it's a decent 3+\/4 star hotel, a good value for money (we paid US$75+18%tax). We had a double room booked via a travel agent, but upon check-in we were told only twin-bed rooms were available so we took it. Staff - very friendly, speaking very good English (we had very different experience in another hotel in Mexico City). The best thing was that they allowed us a very late check-out (6pm as our flight was at 10pm) at no extra charge (!!) - we were really pleased. The car we were offered to drive to the airport was not overpriced, maybe due to the fact that we already knew what the charge should be - we just said what we were going to pay (same price as official pre-paid taxis) and it was accepted. Room - large and clean. Unfortunately, beds were too hard - in fact, the hardest we experienced in Mexico (and we usually prefer firmer beds). The room was right next to the elevator so I had to sleep with earplugs, but my boyfriend did not hear anything and even mentioned how peaceful and quiet it was there!:-)Breakfast - whilst it was not the most delicious I had in Mexico, it was decent - fresh fruit, filter coffee, bread and eggs+tortillas+frijoles. As it was included in the room price, we both though it was a good value. Location - lively and busy Zona Rosa, close to metro, cheap taxi (25 pesos) ride from Paseo Reforma to Centro Historico. We did not go out at night in Zona Rosa on this occassion but it is full with bars and restaurants so you won't stay hungry\/thirsty. It's also a short walk (15 mins max) to Condesa, which is lovely.Overall, we thought that Marco Polo was a very good value for money.
