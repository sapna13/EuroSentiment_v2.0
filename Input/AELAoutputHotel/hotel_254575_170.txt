{"text":"Good value, great location! My husband and I stayed in this hotel for our first visit to London. We had just spent 6 days in Paris, so we were accustomed to the rather small size of European rooms. We had a very nice stay at the Luna and Simone. We took the Underground from Heathrow to Pimlico station and with a little help from the locals were able to find this hotel a few blocks away. The hotel was quite affordable by London standards, very clean and the room and private bathroom were both adequate in size for the two of us and our luggage. The only complaint I have is that the platform-style bed with its futon mattress was rather lumpy and probably the most uncomfortable bed I slept on during our vacation. We did not mention this to the front desk, so I'm not sure if this problem was unique to our particular room (#8) or if they would have offered to move us. One nice feature about room #8 is that we had our own private little balcony overlooking Belgrave Rd. There is quite a bit of traffic- vehicular and pedestrian, along this street, but with the windows closed it did not keep us awake at night.  Everything else about the hotel was great. The breakfast every morning was good and hot, your basic English breakfast of ham, eggs, beans and toast. The staff were friendly and helpful with booking tours and even letting me use their printer to print out a voucher for a tour I had booked online. They also have a computer for free internet access although it is often busy. Probably the best feature of this hotel is its great location in the neighborhood of Belgravia. We were close to a variety of good pubs and restaurants. We were also a 5-10 minute walk away from the Sainsbury's market where we could get a hot pizza and beer for a cheap dinner. We were a 10-minute walk away from the Victoria train, bus, and Underground station. Also, although we did not go to a show, there are a couple of theaters next to the Victoria station with good shows like Wicked playing. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonably priced room in London.
