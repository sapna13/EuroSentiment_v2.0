{"text":"Very Enjoyable Stay!! Save money and go local to eat My boyfriend and I booked a 6 night stay through Cheapcarribean.com at the Rio Mar in March. We had a wonderful time! The room (standard) was beautiful and spacious. We didn't have an ocean view, and we didn't mind at all because the view of El Yunque from our balcony was breathtaking. The pool and beach areas were clean, and well maintained. It gets crowded fast, so if you want lounge chairs or an umbrella get there early or send someone ahead. The breakfast buffet was incredible, but it was around $25 pp and if it hadn't been included with our room we probably would have gone else where to eat. The restaurants on the resort were all pretty expensive, same for the drinks at the bars around the pool area. I would highly recommend renting a car (valet $20 per day) to venture off to local restaurants. Richie's was fantastic, we ended up going there 2 times. Also Brisas del Verde was a great cheap lunch option (I think we paid $12 for a chicken, 2 sides, and 2 beers). The kiosks near Luquillo beach were great too, in particular we liked La Parrilla. Isamar bakery was great for sandwiches. If you have the time and the patience, do the timeshare talk! We got free massages and a free 3 night stay at any Wyndham hotel. The staff at Rio Mar were very friendly, and helpful with recommendations and giving us directions. Just an FYI, there isn't much night life out in Rio Grande. Rio Mar has a small-ish casino, and a bar area open late, but outside of that it came to a lull. We didn't mind so much though, after a long day of being outdoors, we were happy with the down time.
