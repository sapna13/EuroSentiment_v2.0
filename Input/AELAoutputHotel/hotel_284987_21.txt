{"text":"I give it an A-plus I booked my stay thru back to the caribbean. They did an amazing job. the resort was one of the best I have stayed in during my 26 years of much traveling. I have not one complaint. Staff was fantastic,pool the best i have ever been in .(and I was in it at 8am and 11pm) . Nearby beaches are better for swimming.However the pool backs right up to the beach so its palm trees and ocean views as you swim or use one of the many whirlpools .Many of us travelers talked one evening about reviews we had read, and we couldnt imagine what they saw we didnt . I give this a 10 out of 10.I guess if you are like a friend of mine who has a fit if he gets any sand in his exspensive loafers, than no place will ever be good enough.. But if you want a grand, elegant,classy resort this is it.And if you want a place where you can relax, wear a swim suit all day, have a great lunch and drinks at the pool , take out a paddle boat , and watch the beautiful sun set in a hammock on the beach ,this is also it. I agree the resturants are a bit pricey, but my meals were great. I could go on and on,I recommend the spa highly.Use the car rental and excursion packages on site. they saved us money and hassels. For goodness sake go and have a great time, you won't regret it. ","annotations":[]}
