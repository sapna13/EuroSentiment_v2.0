{"text":"Staff friendly but hotel rooms a bit tatty Recently stayed at the Chancellor as part of a large group. We booked 7 hotel rooms in total. On arrival we checked in and the girls on reception were really helpful, however only 2 of the 7 rooms were ready for us. We were disappointed as it was after 2pm so we did expect the rooms to be ready, so we ended up dumping all the baggage in the 2 rooms so we could go out.All the rooms were really small and as 2 of the rooms had babies in them and therefore needed cribs (which resembled something out of a orphanage but were clean and comfortable) there wasn't much room at all. Although reception were pleasant and helpful they did not really allocate the rooms acording to who was staying in them, as the largest room was given to one of our group who was staying on his own rather than being given to the family who has a baby. So we swapped rooms between ourselves.We stayed in room 906 whcih was clean and tidy and had a bowl of sweets, which was a nice touch. However the bathroom was old and tatty and in need of some renovation, also I was convinced I could smell vomit in the room. The location of the hotel is very close to Union Square which is excellent for shops. Howvever there seems to be a lot of homeless people hanging around this area, (much more than when I visited San Fran a few years ago) this was very intimidating at night, so next time I would be tempted to stay near the Wharf rather than Union Square.The hotel lobby has free tea and coffee and cookies (which were lovely) and there was a residents bar which did great cocktails - however this closed really early (around 9.30pm) which was a bit disapointing.Had breakfast once in the hotel and the fried eggs over easy were delish!. Also there is a fab restaurant next door that did fantastic fillet steak.All in all I enjoyed it but would not stay there again.
