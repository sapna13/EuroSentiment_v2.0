{"text":"Beware - windowless rooms ! Hong Kong is tough for hotels, and if you are caught out, as I was on this Fiday evening, then you are stuck with places that have significant problems, like this one. There are two key problems with this hotel, the first one - location - I didn't care about and reasonable due diligence will tip off the prospective guest. It's in Western District, about 10 minutes from where you would probably want to be, but that's OK. The second one, however - lack of natural light\/windows in the room - was shameful and quite a nasty shock to me when I booked in. I can only assume that the hotel has given up on trying to nurture guest loyalty, and is just milking it for what it's worth through first timers who naturally assume that the hotel room will have a window. To hotel management: guys, it's perfectly acceptable to sell a box without a window to your paying guests, but completely unacceptable to neglect to let people know about this fact when they book the room on wotif or whatever booking site they use. Shame on you. I was in the middle of a somewhat stressful project when I camped here for a night and I needed a windowless room like a hole in the head. Thanks a lot guys. I am so disgusted that I am now going to go out of my way to turn people away from your hotel and will waste plenty of management time with complaints to Ramada regional management. Have you no sense of decency ?!?!? I really hope your hotel goes down the tube and rest assured I will do what I can to help it on its way. ","annotations":[]}
