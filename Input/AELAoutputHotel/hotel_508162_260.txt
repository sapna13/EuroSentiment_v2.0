{"text":"Honeymoon from hell Where do I even begin. We went to dreams for our honeymoon and the trip was far from a dream, it was more like a nightmare.We had problems from the moment we stepped foot in the resort. The front desk is so rude and unfriendly. The first room we had the ceiling was falling down in and they did move us to another room. The furniture is old and worn and some of it is falling apart. The bed was as hard as a rock. We were ripped off at the spa, we went for a 50min couples massage we were back at the reception desk in 30 min. I had to argue w them to get some money back. The food was terrible we both got sick for 2 days running in and out of the bathroom. The place was under construction and everything was a mess. there were wires hanging from the ceiling in the lower lobby and tarps and tools all over the floor wich we had to walk over. One of the resturaunts was closed the entire week we were there. There is no italian rest. it is in the world cafe on the side they put red and white checkered table clothes on and pretend its a different restaurant. We tried to pay and have a romantic dinner on the beach, we got down there and it was like a restaurant, 15 tables llined up and no privacy, then a quad came riding down the beach and was fumigating right onto us. We left it was absolutley rediculous. Our whole trip sucked and i would not recomend this resort to anybody not even my worst enemy. ( well maybe).
