{"text":"Nice Boutique Hotel - Great Value! I've been to SF many times and usually stayed at one of the 'big name' chain hotels. This time I was more interested in a smaller boutique hotel at a better price. I was not disappointed with my choice.The hotel has a great location, close to Union Sq, the theatre district and Market St. Yes, you'll find homeless people asking for change on your way there, the same ones you'll pass as you come out of the Hilton directly across the street. This is SF; if you want to stay downtown, deal with it.The hotel itself is charming, from the lobby to the small bar at the back. I was surprised how busy yet welcoming it was as I came in one evening.There is only one elevator, so be prepared to wait, or take the stairs. The Mark Twain is an older hotel and preserves some of the orginal charm. I think trying to put in another elevator would ruin that feeling. Once upstairs, the rooms are nicely appointed, if not very large. I didn't come to spend time in the room or bath, so why complain? Everything was clean and orderly when I arrived, and just the same after daily housekeeping. Additionally, all the towels were brand new as of my stay, and there is an environmentally-friendly option to keep the same towels for a multi-day stay. There's no a\/c in most rooms, but the ceiling fan worked great, and this was during the hottest week of the summer.The restaurant attached to the hotel was very popular and crowded every night. One night there was even a private function attended by several high ranking Law Enforcement Officers.The staff was ALWAYS friendly and helpful, even when a busload of Italian tourists arrived and filled the lobby. I never felt like I was bothering the front desk staff, and I tend to ask a lot of questions. Special thanks go out to Kevin, the marketing manager, who was more than helpful even with his busy schedule, and to Sean, Maria and Rudolph at the front desk.
