{"text":"Fantastic little gem I booked this after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor - and am glad to report that everything good that I read is true. We stayed for just two nights precruise. The hotel is a short walk from Piazzale Roma over two small bridges, right opposite the train station. The staff are as friendly and welcoming as everyone has said. We were offered a choice of rooms and chose the smaller room with the 'view' of the canal.The restaurant that the hotel recommended was so good that we went there two nights running - Osteria al Vecio Pozzo just a few streets behind the hotel. Good cooking and the house 'white' wine [which is really a Prosecco] slid down easily at √à√\u2020√ü?3.50 a litre! Another very good restaurant we found was in San Tome Square right by the San Tome stop on the Grand Canal. Tables set up outside the church in a quiet area of town - well worth it.One reviewer was moaning that this hotel was not near St Marks Square and I can only say thank goodness it wasn't ,as that area was absolutely heaving with tourists, and the restaurants that we tried in the area were not as good and charged considerably more!The breakfast was good, ask for a proper cappucino instead of using the machine [no extra cost], and they are happy to serve drinks until the small hours in the small area outside! Hope you get your #1 rating on TripAdvisor back soon!
