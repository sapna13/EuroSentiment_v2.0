{"text":"WORST Hotel in Singapore I had been to many hotels in singapore and this is by far the worst hotel i had seen. Writing a review is difficult as it is so terrible that I just don't know where to begin.First I would not call this a hotel, it is not even a motel it is just a rented room. I made a mistake of booking it for 7 days and pre paid it. If I had not pre paid the room charges I would have move after first day.Ok back to the room. It got nothing. There are just 2 towels and a soap dispenser. NOTHING else not even toothbrush. You would have expect such are basic for any hotel. There are not even any slippers in the room and when I ask the front desk, they answer me in a manner that they do not even bother to look at you when answering you.The room is so small that I would not even call it a room and they only have a 14 TV set which was so out dated. And no bottle water provided too. Honestly this is a first time that I had seen a hotel not providing all this. I had been to 2 stars hotel which is even much better than themRoom is dirty and overall it is simply terrible. Even Hotel 81 is much better than them.If you ever want to visit singapore, please do yourself a favor and never go to Robertson Quay Hotel. ","annotations":[]}
