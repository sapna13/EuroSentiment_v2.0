{"text":"Painfully Small **Bigger is Better...We had read that it was small but weren't prepared for the size and inconvenience of the rooms. I was on submarines in the Navy and had more storage room! even some well placed hooks would have helped. **Staff...I am not sure who the people were talking to when they talked about the friendly staff. I would rate this one in the lower tier of my European travel experiences. They weren't necessarily unfriendly but they didn't seem happy to work there and you had to ask for everything. I wanted to bring a cup of coffee up to my room and that set off a rash of phone calls and they weren't sure what to do. Finally they decided that if I did it again I would need to buy the complete breakfast-hardly a rationale outcome. **Construction Update...As for the construction activity they started on the top(5) floor and are working their way down. They are now on Floor 1, so most of the rooms you would get are now the newer rooms they show on the website. They are trying to make them slick and modern but instead have made them slick and impractical. It's a little noisy during the day but not unbearable. Try to stay as high up as you can because the lobby is next! **Summary...The only thing this hotel has going for it is location. It is throwing distance from Rue Cler so that was very convenient for us. We would not stay here again. There are other hotels in the neighborhood that are better-Valadon, Muget, and Champs du Mars among them.
