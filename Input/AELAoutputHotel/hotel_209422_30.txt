{"text":"Really Enjoyed Our Stay My wife, two children and I stayed for 4 nights, arriving Sunday, August 10th. Our flight came in a little later in the evening than expected but check-in (around 10:00 PM Honolulu time) was a breeze. Desk personnel, for the most part, were very pleasant and helpful and took the time to provide us with detail on the local restaurants, prices, food quality, etc. Our room was on the 20th floor, Mountain\/Golf side, and had an excellent view of the city and the mountains off in the distance. Although our days, obviously, were very busy seeing the sights and visiting the beach, we did get a chance to see the sun set one evening which was awesome. The room was very well kept but a little on the small size for a family of 4. The balcony and open view of the mountains made it appear larger which was a big plus. Having a 42 inch LCD television to watch the Olympics live on our return from the day's activities was also a treat for the little (and big) kids. The bathroom was spacious and well stocked each day but for one set of towels (only 3 sets were provided), although another set was given us by staff when asked. My wife wasn't thrilled with the cracked glass wall and blinds that separated the bath from the bedding area, but the rest of us thought it was great. The closet in the bathroom was also unusual but didn't bother us as I noticed it did other reviewers of this property. We used the pool and hot tub on the 10th floor every evening on our return; it was never crowded and quite relaxing at the end of a busy day. We did not find the Concierge that helpful as she seemed to want to push guided tour packages. Although, as others have pointed out, public transportation was convenient and in expensive we were glad we rented a car. It gave us the flexibility to see the Island on our time and make the most of our stay. One tip on parking - the $25 parking fee on this property is stiff; if your on a budget as we were, we found parking at the Banyon hotel next door for $10 a real bargain - it also was a self-park eliminating the wait time to get to your car. Another tip, eating at this and other hotels in the Waikiki area is expensive unless you eat smart. We ate at several very nice restaurants in the area but chose their bar menus, where offered, and saved us about 1\/2 the cost of the same dinner items offered in the main dining area. P.S. The beach and all the great shops along the Waikiki strip are within a short walk of the hotel - take the time to visit the market place for some nice negotiated bargains. In closing, we had a AAA rate which made this an exceptional bargain for a Hotel I would give 4 stars as a frequent business traveler. Aloha from 4 very satisfied New Jersians.
