{"text":"Great for Budget Travel My husband and I are in our 40s and we went on this vacation knowing it was to be a trip on a budget; therefore, we had no preconceived notions. We found that a little bit of Spanish was appreciated by at least the activities staff. What a way to make a living, having fun all day. Try some volleyball or catamaran sailing. It looked like a lot of fun. I tried parasailing for the first time and had an enjoyable experience.I had a great time just people watching and trying to meet and communicate with people from different countries. Try all of the ala' carte restaurants. The Mexican food was excellent, sounds like the steakhouse is hit or miss but I had one of the best steaks ever there. The Italiano had great food also. The best part about the buffet was lunch. All the cold salads and fruits were very refreshing with it being so hot there. We didn't overeat or drink too much. In the heat there, that's almost asking to be sick.Do some exploring to the other Riu resorts. The bar at the Riu Bambu had some refreshing and freshly made frozen drinks in the evening. Walk the beach both ways-great exercise.We usually take excursions while on vacation but due to the mixed reviews we decided not to book any but there was so much to do at the resorts-didn't feel like we were missing out.The internet rates are reasonable. $5 for 25 minutes is a good deal.I must be a prude because at first I was quite uncomfortable with all the topless beach goers but it became routine after a while.In the room-it is advertised that the bar\/fridge are stocked every other day and it sounds like if you didn't tip then that's exactly what happened. In completing a survey, we suggested stocking more frequently and an in-room coffee maker. There is no room service either which was disappointing so you have to trudge down to the restaurant to get coffee in the morning. Nature lovers will love to sit out on the balcony and check out the birds. That was a very relaxing part of every day.
