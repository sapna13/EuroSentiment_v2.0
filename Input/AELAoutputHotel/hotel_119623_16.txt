{"text":"Comfortable, clean and great location. Best value in SF! We love visiting the Cow Hollow neighborhood and this inn, and it's sister property, The Cow Hollow Inn, are great places to stay.What we liked:-Newly renovated. Decor is tasteful and classic. Warm wood furniture, neutral tones in keeping with the English theme. No cheap prints on the wall, very nice.-Clean and well kept. No funky hotel smell. Maid service was great.-We had a corner room facing Lombard so we had a larger sitting area which I loved. Nice to open the curtains and soak in the city views.-Parking is included which is a MAJOR plus in SF!-FREE Wi-Fi. It was great to be able to use our lap top.-LOCATION! This is the best feature. This inn is in the heart of Cow Hollow so the trendy Marina district and upscale Pacific Heights are all walking distance. If you love to walk you can see multi million dollar homes, visit quaint and hip shops, and sample great neighborhood restaurants (don't miss Amicis East Coast Pizzeria a block away). The Palace of Fine Arts and Exploratorium are less than 1.5 miles away and the #30 Muni Bus stops a block away from the inn and will take you through North Beach, Chinatown and Union Square. The only time we drove was to visit Muir Woods which was across the Golden Gate Bridge, about 1\/2 hour away.Needs improvement:Only knock I have is with the staff who although helpful, could be friendlier and more attentive (i.e. stop the office chit-chat when the guests are waiting at the front desk.) However, this was a vast improvement over the staff at the Cow Hollow Inn where we stayed a few years back, who were just downright rude,Overall the Chelsea Motor Inn is an outstanding value at $89 per night. Our 11 yr old son loved the 'Diagon Alley' look of the exterior. The street side rooms are very noisy so if this bothers you either book a room facing away from the main street or bring earplugs for sleeping. We love watching the traffic and people down below and seeing the city lights so earplugs worked out well. This is our favorite area in SF and will definitely be back.Word of caution: Avoid the Taco Bell across the street at ALL costs!!
