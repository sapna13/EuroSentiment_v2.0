{"text":"Old, but Good We spent 2 nights at Pendini and were pleased with our stay. It is located right on a main square and within easy walking distance of everything there is to see in central Florence. There is no parking on site, but they have a valet service that will pick up your car and store it until you are ready to leave, then they will deliver it back to the front door of the hotel. The cost was about 20 Euro's per day. If you arrive by car, as we did, you will definately want to use this service.Our room was very large with two beds in it, one king and one twin. It was on the top floor and over-looked the square out front. We even could see the top of the Dome. The bathroom was adequate, especially by Italian standards. The hotel is located on the 4th floor of the building. When we were there the small elevator worked ok, but we've heard that it does go out from time to time which would be terribly inconvenient for checking in\/out and after a long day of walking around town.I have also seen complaints about the noise from the square at night. We didn't find that to be a problem. The first night there was a large gathering of young people in the square that turned into a street party with dancing and music. Florence is very much a college town with students everywhere so you are going to have some issues like that, especially in the city center. It ended by about 1 am though. We are younger people (early 30's) so we usually didn't get back to our room until after 10 anyway and didn't mind the music. The second night there was no real noise at all. We slept very well both nights.Florence is a must do and the location of Pendini was tough to beat. It is just 2 blocks from the Cathedral and about 4 blocks from the Ponte Vecchio. Our longest walk was about 10 blocks to the Pitti Palace on the other side of the river. There are nicer hotels located on the same square and also some located with great views of the city and on the river. But the combination of price and location made it easy to overlook the minor imperfections of Pendini.
