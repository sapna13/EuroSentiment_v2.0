{"text":"Good price - nice location We stayed at this hotel in February 2007, and the prices were really great. We payed 89 euros for a triple the first night (w\/ 3 people), and 65 euros for a double the second night (w\/ 2 people). I give this hotel 4 out of 5 BASED ON THE PRICE. It wasn't the most fantastic experience, but for the price it was definitely better than expected. LOCATIONThe location is very handy - you can walk to the museum district and there are loads of restaurants within a few minutes walk, and the neighborhood feels safe. The central station was about a 10 minute tram ride away. COMFORTThe first night when we were in the triple room, the bed was pretty comfortable for a hotel bed. The second night, the bed was ridiculous, like a half-deflated airbed. So it will depend if you are lucky or not how comfy your bed is.The first night in the triple our bathroom and shower were very cramped. The bathroom in the double was much better, still small, but you could move in there.The walls of this hotel are pretty thin. if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs!EXTRAS + STAFFThe staff were helpful, but not the most social sort, especially for amsterdam where people tend to be so friendly. They loaned me a hairdryer each morning, which was handy. The breakfast was very basic but decent - an assortment of cereals, some bread, cheese, jam, coffee, tea, orange juice. There is a computer down there off the lobby where you can use internet for free. Overall, the hotel seemed clean enough, the people nice enough, and the comfort tolerable enough for a weekend visit - plus the price was really incredible. If we go again, we'll probably try and check out some BBs earlier (they were all booked when we went), but I thought this place was pretty decent and would definitely consider it again when looking around.
