{"text":"Great value for the money!!!!!!!! Just got back from Europe with my 13 yr. old daughter. We stayed at the Apex in London. Very nice hotel for the money. Literally 2 minutes to the Tower of london, 3 minutes to the Tower Bridge, and 2 minutes to the Tower hill entrance to the underground. The hotel is in the middle of the financial district on a little back street (very quiet). If you want to be in the middle of all the action, stay in Picadilly Circus, but for a very nice hotel in a quiet area stay at the Apex. I only have one complaint. I like my room on the cool side (70-74 degrees F) and for some reason the air conditioner would not get that cold. the manager tried to have it fixed but to no avail. They did give us a couple of fans and that did the trick. Overall it was a good choice in hotels. Now, in London you have to get the London Pass with the transport option (good value) we were able to skip lines (queues) and really see alot of the city with the pass. We spent 6 days there before heading off to Ireland. One last thing, I have to comment on a free bicycle tour we got from the London Pass. It was given by the London Bicycle Company on Gabriels Wharf by the Tate Modern Museum. Now I don't generally ride a bike and I'm not in that great a shape (male, mid-thirties with three kids and a busy career if you know what I mean), but, my daughter talked me into going on a bicycle tour of London with this company. The tour was guided and took 3-4 hours. This was the most memorable thing we did on our entire trip. It is an easy ride, lots of fun, and very educational (the guide stops along the way and gives you a bit of history about each location). if you go, tell Gunder ( I think that is how you spell it) we said thanks, he was our tour guide..
