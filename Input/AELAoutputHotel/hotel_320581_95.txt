{"text":"Not above average, but good three star comfort at a reasonable price We stayed at this hotel for one night. The hotel has a very nice and modern Japanese interior design with lots of wood and stone. We booked a double room. Upon checkin, we were given a so-called semi-double room which was very small and had a 140cm bed. Since we are not semi-people we went back to the receptionist who offered us an upgrade to a double room at 2400 YEN. That room was basically the same room than the semi-double, with the only exception that the bed was 160cm (Queen), which still was rather small. We would have accepted that one as a normal double room as booked, but not as an upgrade after having paid a surcharge. We therefore went back down a third time and finally ended up in a twin-bed room with two 120cm beds and a nice view from the 12th floor (Room 1212). The interior of the room appeared to be brand new, with flatscreen TV and good quality matresses and pillows. The room was very quiet and we did not hear anything from the street or neighboring rooms. On the second floor they had a lounge with free internet terminal and coffee\/tea, accessible with the room key. The location is not bad as it is very close to Shinjuku station which gives easy access to\/from the airport. We had a hard time finding the hotel, since we took the wrong exit at the station. I would recommend that you take a Japanese printout of the hotel name and adress with you. We didn't and as a result people on the street couldn't help us much to find the place, although we were only a few blocks away.We can recommend this place because of its location and price, but would not stay there anymore ourselves, due to their business practices. A hotel should either sell single or double or twin rooms, but not invent so called semi-double rooms, only to charge people extra upon check-in to receive what they originally booked - a room with a decent sized bed for two people.
