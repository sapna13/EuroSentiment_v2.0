{"text":"AC OK! We stayed here for 5 nights in November 2007. Our room was on the 9th floor and despite being next to the service lifts we didn't get any noise through interconnecting walls (except in the bathroom) and we didn't have an interconnecting door. There was, however, a bit of noise from the hall - so if other guests on your floor come back late you'll hear them, and the housekeeping staff start vacuuming at around 8am. We also had the comedic experience of hearing a man enjoying the throes of passion as we were walking past his room :) That said, this is a hotel mainly aimed at business travellers as it's quite far out of the centre, directly adjacent to the huge Forum conference complex and a big shopping centre. Although I was tagging along whilst my partner went to a conference, I found getting around from this location easy due to the multiple public transport connections. The room was nice and spacious enough for two people; plenty of storage although no safe (there are safe deposits downstairs). The bathroom was big with a large bath and a shower with fantastic water pressure. The whole hotel is quite 'mod' in its styling and the fittings are better than some I've seen. The seal on the window seemed to be damaged as there was a draught and a fair bit of noise despite the double glazing. The beds were two singles made up separately and pushed together. The mini bar (with one small beer) is free and there is wireless access for √à√\u2020√ü?2 a day. On the 13th floor there is a nice gym, pool (not heated), jacuzzis (indoor), and two small saunas and steam rooms. The breakfast was very comprehensive. Staff didn't fall over themselves to be friendly but were nice enough. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1507,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1503}]}
