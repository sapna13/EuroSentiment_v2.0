{"text":"It was fine - I'd stay again Stayed for 3 nights at a rate of GBP95 per night (incl breakfast) in early Dec. The conference was at the Hilton (about 5 mins walk away) and the conference rate at the Hilton was a lot higher.Its in a good location (if you want to be in that part of town) and a perfectly good hotel - despite the reviews :~) Some points to note:The hotel provides a discount for the car parking facility next to the hotel. But it still cost me 22+ euros for the night (only had a car 1 night).The room was great but too hot and adjusting the temp didn't appear to make much difference. The water pressure was extremely high. Turn on the shower and the head promptly flies up (under the water pressure) and shoots water all over the towels at the end of the bath. 1st night I dried myself with a hand towel. It would be a minor thing to prevent this with a better quality shower head fitting and I can't understand why they don't. There were several wifi networks around. I found one which let me on free - no idea whether it was legit or not.The 2nd night I got back after a hard day at 8:00pm and found the room hadn't been made up. The soaking towels where where I'd left them in a pile under the sink. A call to reception sorted it.Breakfast buffet was adequate. A reasonable selection of cold meats and cheeses. The hot stuff look 'tired'. If it wasn't in the rate I'd have gone out as it costs 10 euros.Smoking: there were ash trays in the room but there was absolutely no trace of smoke and I have a very sensitive nose for smoke. The only time I notice anything was the last morning when there was a vague smell of smoke in the corridor.No iron or coffee making facilities in the room.A perfectly fine stay and I'd be happy to stay there again. It would have had four stars except for the shower and room make up issues. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1675,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1669}]}
