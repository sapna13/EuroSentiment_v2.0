{"text":"Ambar Upgrade, Loved every minute ! We stayed at the resort from the 17 to the 24 of May.  Like you I have read many reviews about the resort prior to my stay. I would suggest you stop now if you have already booked at this resort, reading too many reviews can definitely take the wind out of your sails and leave you with tons of useless information. All you need to know is to bring lots of sunscreen, 20 bucks each to get out of the country, under pack your bags, and that the hotel is amazing food, service, facilities etc. Anyways, our stay was excellent! We had requested online prior to arrival an ocean view room, which we received. When we checked in we immediately were upgraded to the Ambar adults section which was awesome. I would suggest this upgrade to any adults traveling without kids, you get your own buffet, restaurants, pool, bars, tram etc. You can also use any of the other sections facilities (bravaro, and punta cana) except the buffets. You have to use your buffet, which is the best of the three anyways. The service was exceptional with only a few minor complaints. Maid, very nice all the staff was very friendly, language barrier an obvious issue but nothing you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ manage. Our Sunwing rep was very helpful and made our stay easier; Sunwing in general was very good. Food is good, a lot of selection and some favorites for me. You do need to keep in mind that you are in another country and that the food generally tastes different. Presentation at the restaurants a big wow, which is a good thing but they are not like restaurants back home. Drinks also very good, enjoyed the beer and the red wine for dinner. I tried everything and then some, I suggest you do the same since you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e a paying for it. Never was sick or any diarrhea which I was surprised considering I ate and drank like a champ for seven days straight. Facilities, lots to do. Beach front is nice however swimming and snorkeling is limited due to boats passing by. Pools, clean and very refreshing. Yes limited shade so do the towel thing before you attend the buffet breakfast. Day trip. Country safari, was okay, slow pace yet very informational. Being our first trip the hotel overall was exceptional, weather was excellent and would not blink an eye if asked to go back.
