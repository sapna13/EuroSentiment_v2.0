{"text":"Back to Back Stays I stayed in this hotel for two nights commencing December 26, 2006. I checked out on the 28th, but business required that I stay another night - so I checked in for a second stay on December 28.I found the hotel generally lovely. The room, while small, was very pleasant, with top shelf finishes - elegant window treatment, interesting lamps, very nice bathroom (large walk-in shower only) with two nice bathrobes and a very good hair blower. I found the bed comfortable. I was not told that there were complimentary waters in the refrigerator - would have been nice to know. I thought the Irish bar did not feel very Irish, but other than that, it was a nice stay and when I checked out I remarked to the front desk staff that I was looking forward to another stay. Little did I know that I would be there back that night. Here's where the review gets mixed. The room was actually dirty - a bottle of hand creme overlooked on the floor under the sink, papers overlooked on the floor under the desk. There was only one robe, a this robe can be bought notice hung from an empty hook. The bed linen had a hole in it (see review below) and there were hairs in the bathroom. The walls are thin and I heard a child crying nearby. On the positive side I ordered room service at 10pm, asked if I could get breakfast, and was sent the most perfect light dinner of two eggs and french fries (with two sodas - $30). Breakfast the next morning in the restaurant was very good - although in an otherwise totally empty restaurant we were initially given a tiny table for two. I have stayed in many Boston hotels and I can see why this is well-regarded. It looks new but I understand it is a couple of years old.
