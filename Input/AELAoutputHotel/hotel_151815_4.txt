{"text":"Older hotel with average amenities Based on prior reviews, I was a little skeptical of this hotel, but my husband had stayed here several years ago and had a positive experience. I have to say that overall, I was okay with the choice, but if left to my own devices I probably would not have picked the Melia. This is an OLD building with a good location right in the center of Ponce and across the street from a nice park. It is nowhere near the water and the entrance to the hotel is more than a little confusing, as is the parking. The amenities were minimal, continental breakfast very basic. If you are used to the US 5* rating system, you will probably give this hotel a 2*, but for the area it is better than most. Not super clean, but no bugs or anything that you would notice if you aren't super picky like I am. The bathroom was tiny with old fixtures and limited hot water. I would not recommend for a young crowd however as this hotel appeals to a quiet, seemingly older crowd . The elevator is extremely small also. The pool area looked nice, but we didn't use it as it was pouring rain the entire time. There was a basic continental breakfast on the rooftop that would have been very nice if it had not been raining. Staff at the front desk were helpful but they recommended a few restaurants within walking distance that were closed (We didn't know that lots of places are closed on Mondays). After we walked to both of them and realized they were closed we also realized that we probably shouldn't be walking the streets at night. Lots of local loitering going on and there is an increase in crime in Ponce over the past several years. Overall I would say this would compare to a 2* hotel in the states.
