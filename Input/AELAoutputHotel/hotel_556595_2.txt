{"text":"Okay My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Donatello for three nights. The hotel staff was not very nice and were rude at times. The room was spacious. The first night, however, our room was a little musty, but then the musty smell went away after the first night. The room was clean- one of the hotel's strong points. The location was also good. Very close to the Accademia (to see the statue of David) and the Duomo. Also, Ponte Vecchio and the Uffizzi were not a far walk. We were very pleased with the location. The breakfast was included, but it was probably the worst continental breakfast we have ever seen. The hotel did not have enough breakfast food to accomodate their guests, and their selection was poor. My husband and I basically had bread and cereal each day. All the other hotels we stayed at in Italy had much better breakfast and variety. We had Choice Hotel points, so our stay at the hotel was free. We do not think we would stay here again unless we were able to get free nights again through our hotel points. Word of advise-Florence is beautiful and full of art. If you are not much of an art person, the Accademia (with the statue of David) may be enough and you can consider passing on the Uffizzi. I would however look at the sculptures and the statues of the famous artists\/scientists from the Tuscany area that are outside the Uffizi though. They are marvelous. Also, it is not always necessary to get a guided tour or an audioguide of these museums as there are many signs in these museums that describe the art. ","annotations":[]}
