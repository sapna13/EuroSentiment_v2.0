{"text":"Great long weekend! Stayed here for 4 nights for a long weekend getaway in mid-September. The stay exceeded my expectations.Check-in was fast and efficient. We were early, but they had another room that was ready so we could go right to our rooms. Lobby was typically Ritz furnished, the 2 story central area with a view out on the pool and garden was very nice.Our room (7th floor, Oceanfront Balcony room) was very nice. Typical Ritz room, very comfortable bed, enormous bathroom. The only downside was a lack of comfortable places to sit. One upholstered chair with ottoman and a desk chair, neither was super comfortable. I spent more time sitting on the balcony however. Complimentary bottled water in the rooms both for drinking and for making coffee. Room was serviced twice a day as expected, room was very clean, no odors or anything. Complimentary high-speed internet (wired) in the rooms, wireless was available in the lobby.I must admit I was concerned by reports of the construction noise. It did not start until 10 AM on the weekdays, and there was none on weekends. It was occasionally a tad loud lying by the pool but it was not bad and did not detract from the stay in any manner. I never heard any noise in the room from construction.Pool and beach service was excellent. Staff remembered our names, brought extra towels and such without prompting and offered to bring water, coffee, floats, etc. There were cabanas available for rental but other than having better lounge chairs they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ seem worth money (the lounge chairs by the pool were completely adequate). Being September, there was never any problem having our pick of locations around the pool; if anything there are too many chairs. Probably not on a busy weekend in the winter.Restaurants:We had breakfast in Mares every day but one. It was excellent, ample, and the service was outstanding. On our first day my partner ordered a glass of milk with his breakfast. On our last morning, the waitress who had waited on us that day (who had not been working the days between and was not out server this day) saw us and came to greet us and offered him milk. The food was all very good, the Guava Pancakes were outstanding. The cost, although high, was not unreasonable for the quality and variety. Champagne was even included.We had lunch at Mares one day and it was also very good.Lunch by the pool was fine, if uninspired.We dined in the hotel only one night, at BLT Steak. It was mostly empty. The food was exceptional. There were some local twists to some of the items, such as the sauce for the wagyu skirt steak I had. The only item that was not great was the Parmesan gnocchi side dish that had way too much nutmeg grated on it.Casino:I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not much of a gambler when vacationing, but I did venture into the casino one night. The casino was nice, large and clean. If I wanted to spend any time gambling I would prefer the casino at the El San Juan, solely because of the ambience.Overall:I would not hesitate to recommend the Ritz-Carlton San Juan to friends. We had a great time. I prefer the Ritz to the El San Juan, the only other San Juan hotel I have stayed at. And, the ease in flying to San Juan from the US makes it an easy escape.
