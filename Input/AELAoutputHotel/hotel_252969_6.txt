{"text":"Helll in Fllorida Absolutely the worst hotel stay of our lives, We were originally scheduled to stay on the 11th and 12th, I needed to cancel the 11th because of no shuttle running to pick us up, I told them to only cancel Friday eve. When I got there on Saturday they had canceled both of the nights and took the liberty to rebook me for Saturday at a higher rate then I originally booked on the internet. Both the front desk staff and management were extremely rude, So I was stuck paying the higher rate. We also had booked for our return stay on our cruise on Jan 20th, if we would not have been there with a group of people I would have left immediately and never returned, false advertising on their website says 5.00 port shuttle and when you get there they tell you it is 10.00 per person, the bathrooms have walls crumbling down, mold everywhere, (I took pictures if you want to see them) Lights and outlets that weren't working or safe. , This should be reported to the health department and shut down! No one should ever reserve a room there again, you don't pay the amount you reserve it for or pay for what is advertised, (port fees). On top of that we were only allowed two towels in our room and had to go ask housekeeping for washcloths, we were given one to share!!! This property should be torn down. DO NOT STAY THERE IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR HEALTH AND SAFETY!! ","annotations":[]}
