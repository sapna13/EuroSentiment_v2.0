{"text":"Kind of luxury hotel Haven't stayed in hotel myself but booked for close people one night for 2 persons and 2 nights for one. Interior of the hotel is really nice and historic. Check in was quick and without problems. Having chosen run of house option while booking at hotel web site I hoped for the best they have, however as we arrived early (~10 a.m.) we were given quite modest standard room which might be good for 3-4 stars but for 5 stars hotel it needs some cosmetic renovation. There was a small window with view on flower market a bed of good size, a bit small bathroom. Air conditioner was producing sounds as if it was 20 years old. Lift which we used was very original - with soft bench. Another word about hotel's restaurant - we booked a table on the terrace, but without telling us in advance they closed it because there could be rain (there was no rain at that evening) and placed us in the center of the hall (not very pleasant). Sommelier was very helpful and helped us to choose the right wine, pianist was brilliant. Waiters were not so we had to pour that wine on our own. Food was of average quality - that is no bad but not very tasty. For 3 persons we've spent 268 euro. There is a very nice Freddy's bar with always fresh Heineken beer (3,5 euro per small glass). In general experience was more or less positive and in we paid 275 for first night and 268 for next 2 plus 12 euro per day of city tax. Breakfast was 25 euro per person but we haven't tried it.
