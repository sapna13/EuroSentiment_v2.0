{"text":"Convenient, bot not for apPerson in a wheelchair First of all, this is a nice hotel. Every inch is freshly painted and wallpapered. And it is convenient to airport travelers. But it reminds me of when I was a kid and would get a toy that was made in China. It looked good, but upon more careful inspection, it had little problems here and there that just drove you crazy. And this hotel had a few delights too.1) They have a wake up service, just like any full service hotel. But they also have alarm clocks that you can mess with if you're bored. They guy next door checked out, but he had set his alarm clock to go off AFTER he left. We had to call the desk, and they promptly came up and shut it off. Ridiculous.2) They gave us a room on the sixth floor. No problem. Until we realized that they must have added thee sixth floor onto a five story hotel at one point. We had to take the elevator up five floors, then walk down a short hallway, turn the corner, then board another elevator to go to the sixth. Not bad, unless you're tired, impatient, drunk, etc.3. Free wireless access on one of their PCs in a small PC room. Very nice.4) Without going into needless specifics, it is very difficult to deal with this place if you are in a wheelchair\/scooter, especially if you are traveling alone. Once you find out the ins and outs, its too late.5) Few planes take off or land at night. But when they do, you can hear them. But they aren't flying ten feet over the hotel, so it's not bad.6) I thought the continental breakfast buffet was above average.7) Each room has a flat panel TV, which is cool. But it is about the size of your pillow. (Obviously, they are not trying to wow you. They just don't want to take up space in the small room with a table\/dresser and TV.8) I was satisfied with the staff.9) The bar\/cafe was sparse, and didn't really look like a bar or cafe. Maybe it wasn't enclosed enough. But they had real drinks there. At one point, they had one staff person for each person. I think the Asian guy was making sushi.We stayed here because we were coming in off two flights to make a cruise. We didn't want to do a lot of further traveling. Next time, we may stay in Old San Juan instead.
