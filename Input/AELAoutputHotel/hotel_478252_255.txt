{"text":"Helicopters flying overhead ! Stayed from MARCH 3rd the 10th.Golden club section near the beach.Food at restos not bad to good.....Buffet just ok..always found something to eat and enjoyed.Never had problems finding chairs at pool or beach.Friendly staff...easy check in and check out.Some good shows at night.MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT;those helicopters continously flying overhead at the beach and pool.They fly too low and too close and too often ! I'm from a big noisy polluted city and when on vacation, I want to hear the wind thru the palm trees and the waves crashing on the sand.At times I felt like I was lying on a beach bed in the middle of an airport !The banana boat with its noisy motor and stinky gaz also comes in too close to where we swim in the ocean.They are several other caribbean destinations where such noise polluting activities are not allowed so close to the resorts.I dont mind the music and\/or the organized pool activities at the resort..because they are of short duration and you can always find a quieter spot around the pool or go to the beach.But ,you cannot get away from the noise flying over you nor that stupid banana boat going back and forth....if only it go further outwards in the ocean like at many other resorts in the caribbean ,then it would be more tolerable.Would I go back ? Probably not...much easier to find an equivalent 5 star resort in the caribbean or Mexico without the air traffic and polluting banana boats.
