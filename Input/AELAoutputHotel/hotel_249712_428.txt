{"text":"Great hotel, Great location!! We stayed at this hotel twice. Before and after a cruise on the eastern coast. I am a Starwood Prefered Guest and used points, so the room did not cost me anything.We only stayed one night before boarding our cruise ship. We arrived at the hotel at around 5:00pm and were given a roon quickly. We were placed on the 29th floor. Excellant view in a spacious room. The only thing we did not like was the sink. It is a stainless steel sink which doesn't provide much room for your toiletries. However, they do provide a shelf to put things on. The flat screen tv's, heavenly bed and shower were the rooms biggest assests. We did eat breakfast at Sula's the next morning, it is located inside the hotel. Very expensive, but you do get a lot of food. I would suggest splitting a meal or go somewhere else. There are several other resturaunts close by that are much cheaper.After our cruise we returned for a three night stay. This time we were given an upgrade to a 43rd fl corner view room. However, since we arrived early (9:30 am) from the ship, the room was not ready. We left our bags with the bellman and decided to go for a walk. However, it was raining. No problem! The hotel offered us use of their umbrellas without even asking. Now that's great service!When we returned about 1:30 our room was ready. What a fantastic room and view. We did not want to leave. This hotel is in a perfect location. A block from Times Square. A short walk and you are in the middle of everything. Actually the sidewalks are packed, but that's what Times Square is all about, right?Within the hotel is Chevy's mexican food. Very reasonably priced and good food. There are also theaters in the hotel. We did go to Shula's (famous for their steaks) for dinner. The prices are outrageous! It was about $150 for the two of us and that only included one glass of wine, but did include a couple of sides and desert. The sides are huge and should be shared. The desert was fantastic. Just watch out for the prices.The hotel's location is key. Right across from the port authority and next to the subway. We took the subway down to battery park to catch the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. If you want to go into the base of the statue, go early as the tickets sell out by 9:00. We then walked to ground zero, to take a moment. We returned to the subway and made our way home. Oh, I forgot to mention John's pizza. It is world famous and right around the corner from the hotel. It is so good we ate there twice. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. If I ever return, I will be staying there again!
