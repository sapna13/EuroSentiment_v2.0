{"text":"ICH San Juan shouldn't be part of the ICH group of hotels! Being a Royal Ambassador member and having stayed at nearly a dozen ICH Hotels around the world (Bali, Tokyo, Seoul, Chicago, NYC, Singapore, Bangkok to name a few) I was appalled by the deteriorated physical conditions and lackluster service of the Intercontinental San Juan. I stayed here with my husband from in October of 2006 as part of our anniversary weekend celebration and we were both astonished to see that a hotel of this quality could considered a member of the ICH Group. The place is in DESPERATE need of a face lift. The quality of the room and bathroom finishings are more like those of a 2-star hotel rather than an Intercontinental Hotel. Furniture is worn and beat up and carpets are old and stained. Bathrooms could definitely be gutted! Furthermore, when we visited the pool was still under renovation (after several months of work!). Mini bars are poorly stocked (beverage and food selection was PATHETIC!). More importantly, I was quite underwhelmed by the level of service. Upon check-in I asked the receptionist twice to confirm that I had been properly upgraded to an Executive room or a suite (standard privileges of Royal Ambassador status). She assured me that I had. To my dismay, she had put us in a standard ocean-front room and not in an Executive room or suite. Given that she spoke Native English, I doubt that there was any miscommunication on my part. When I called the General Manager I was put on hold for nearly 30 minutes until I got the right person. I was then informed that I had not been properly upgraded, but that I could move to a junior suite in 20 minutes. We finally moved, but the suite was showed similar signs of deterioration. We never intend to return to this particular ICH hotel and have advised all our friends visiting San Juan not to do so either. If you plan to be on Isla Verde, stay at the Ritz or at the Wyndham instead. ","annotations":[]}
