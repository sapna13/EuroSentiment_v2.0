{"text":"Good resort, value for Monay We travelled with 3 other families all with pre-teen kids from Sunday 23rd March to Sunday 30th March on Sunwing from Toronto. Canada. We make this annual trip to different parts of the Carribean and this was our first to the DR. Resort: Nice layout, although the rooms are in a building' format with inside hallways (some might prefer 4 unit blocks). advantages - right on the beach and everything is close by - could walk the whole resort in 5 minutes - great for finding the kids! Some buildings have older rooms which are much the worse for wear (like Building 3 where we stayed) but buildings 1 or 2 have been done up and the ground floor rooms on the North have a walk out to the lazy river pool. Airconditioning, washrooms , water pressure etc were good, and other amenities acceptable for a 4 star. The always stocked Mini bar was a good plus.Check-in and out was smooth and efficient and although we did meet Caren we did not need her help as the desk staff took care of our requests to get rooms together (and on the ground floor). Suggest to take your own recognizable beach towels and use them to secure good locations on the beach early morning. Some people tipped hotel security to hold prime spots, but we were not that particular. Beach: Good for short swims and canoing\/catamarans etc. need to book early for the catamarans, but we had great weather and enjoyed them all. Also paid $ 10 each for the kids to ride the Banana boat and they loved it. Plenty of seaweed, but not a show stopper, and if you wear water shoes does not bother you much. Walk North past other resorts for a better beach, South past the small village for a lovely walk or bicycling trip. Food: Overall was above our expectations, with choices to suit everyone. Loved the Beachside buffet for lunch, Windows was good for Breakfast and occasional dinners, and we managed to get bookings for all 4 A-la cartes. Italian and Japanese were excellent, Tex Mex good and Aqua below par (poor service, bad location with no proper air circulation, food nothing to speak about). Drinks were generally good, but the red house wine was terrible if not chilled. Made friends with some bartenders and waiter so got premium drinks and special cocktails. Used our insulated mugs on the beach, mostly for Beer or the Caipirina cocktail we all loved. (Lemon juice and bitters with premium rum)Did 2 excursions: Bavario splash speedboats (recommended) and Bavario runners (buggy tour) - Not recommended. Will write a more details review of these in the excursions forum. also did the horse riding next door and Entertainment: amusing and entertaining, and good fun if you go with the right expectations. Disco ok, Piano bar acceptable (with no Piano) and Spa\/Gym\/games area ok for 4 star levels. Overall: Go with the right expectations (this is a good 4 star, and don't go looking for problems), plan your time well, do not overindulge in food or drink and you can have a great time - as we all did.
