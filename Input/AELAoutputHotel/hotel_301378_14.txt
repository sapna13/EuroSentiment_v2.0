{"text":"great location, carnival like atmosphere I stay at the Shinagawa Prince at least once a year when I travel to Japan to see friends and relatives. For my purposes, the location simply cannot be beat because Shinagawa Station, which is literally across the street, is on the Yamanote loop and is also a Shinkansen station, which I use to travel to southwestern Japan. The hotel is not without its problems though. Be aware that this is a huge complex with four separate towers, as well as an aquarium, a movie theater, and a bowling complex. Throw in the usual shops and restaurants, and all you really need to complete the picture is a strolling mariachi band. The towers vary greatly in quality. On a previous stay I had the misfortune of staying in the North Tower, which in my opinion is nothing more than a dirty little business hotel with tiny rooms in dire need of renovation. Or better yet, demolition and reconstruction. Since then I always request a renovated room in the Main Tower, preferably on the higher floors. My room on my most recent visit was approximately 200 sq feet (10X20), with the bathroom occupying about 33 sq feet of that. Small, but reasonably clean and serviceable.There is a tiny little refrigerator for you to use, as well as a small safe, but it's not big enough for a laptop computer. Also be aware that their high speed internet access will cost you an additional 1050 yen a day (~$10). Thumbs up: location, reasonable value for Tokyo if you don't get stuck in a tiny, unrenovated room, generally good service from all employeesThumbs down: small rooms, hard beds, carnival atmosphere, unrenovated rooms are dingy and dirty with circa 1975 furnishings ","annotations":[]}
