{"text":"Iberstar Bavaro We returned form Iberostar Bavaro last nite. This was our third stay at this resort, and were there from 2\/6 to 2\/14. I could have stayed longer. See my review from last february under zvago. I say ditto to all of that. New remarks: Checkin was smooth and fabulous. Book your dinner reservations ASAP, although, if you eat earlier (by 7:30) there will be no problem. We LOVED the Japanese restaurant this time, as did 12 of our friends who were there before us. A little hint , with ALL of the restuarants, if you show up early for your dinner, they will always accomodate you. Breakfast was wonderful.....Always go to Marisol??? for omelets. As you enter the buffet, she is at the station to the right. She is quick and cooks to order. Very pleasant. There were fewer bus people at the buffet, so I found one had to flag down waiters for coffee. That was my biggest problem. Watch for slippery walkways.....The last nite we were there, they had resurfaced the bridge leading to the main building. Many people fell on it. Be alert, Americans, watch for walkways and ramps. The Dominicans expect you to look out for yourself, NOT take care of protecting you from dangers. There are no cones, yellow lines on steps, or railings where we would expect them. There were many more American couples at the hotel then previously.Being American, this was NOT what I was looking for.Also, many more children than usual. Most families with children , however,were European, and I found them fascinating. The children were ALL so well behaved and soft spoken I NEVER heard children screaming or parents correcting them. Admirable.!Many more peacocks than before,,,,to the point of being annoying.******************There is construction of a new hotel going on to the right of the property(as you look at the beach) Do NOT accept rooms on that side of the property. In addition to the BANGING BANGING BANGING you have to endure the strong SMELL of concrete all of the time.Our weather was iffy. Very strong wind for the entire nine days. Rain ususally at nite. My brother was there the week before, and it was the same. The week before that, there was rain all week. So good luck you are due for good weather. We still had a ball. As usual, the drinks at the pool bar are slop----better to drink at the Main Lobby bar. Ask for brands. Feel free to contact me.
