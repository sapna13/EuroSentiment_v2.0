{"text":"Wow!....But! Wow!....But!Wow!!Returned on Wednesday from 5 nights in Singapore√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Shangri La where we celebrated our 25th Wedding aniversary. Our first impressions were Wow! We arrived on the 16th November and stayed in the Horizon Club Premier Room and it was fabulous. Huge room and bathroom with everything you could possibly need at your finger tips. The staff were so friendly and the pool and gardens are magnificent.But√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®?!!On Sunday the 18th November things changed dramatically. We discovered that the ASEAN Summit was to be held at our Hotel and our paradise very quickly became a prison.To get out of the hotel we had to fight our way through crowds of reporters and photographers in the lobby.To get into the Hotel was a nightmare with security inspecting every thing and every one.The Hotel and its surrounding area was heavily patrolled by armed police and the army personnel. Taxis√à√\u2020\u2022?were reluctant to go through the security inspections to get to the hotel.We tried to work our activities around the shuttle bus only to find the Rasa Sentosa Resort\/Shangri La Hotel shuttle that was advertised did not operate any more and on Monday evening the city shuttle was cancelled with out any prior warning.What did the hotel do to compensate its guest √à√\u2020\u2022?you may ask?On the first 2 days of the Summit there was a team of hotel personnel who stood at the exit of the security screens. They came up and offered an obviously pre-instructed sincere apology for the inconvenience and that was it!With the taxi situation we were told rather secretively by the commissioner that he could be arranged a car for $25.00 for what we then found was only $6.70 taxi ride. The same guy also pushed a Limo service for an extra fee and slipped us a piece of paper with his name and number in it.Sunday pm I consulted reception with concerns about the environment we found ourselves in - hoping we could transfer to the Rasa Sentosa Resort (Shangri la) but was told that there was nothing they could do because we were booked through a travel agent. I did not pursue the matter as it was obvious the staff had bigger fish to fry and we just had to do the best we could.We have returned home feeling a little bitter from the experience. This was a special occasion for us and the atmosphere at the hotel was extremely tense and uncomfortable. I just wish we had prior warning so we could make other arrangements ","annotations":[{"endOffset":245,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":241}]}
