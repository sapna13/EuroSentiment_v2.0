{"text":"Fab resort BUT keep your eye on your handbag This was my 2nd visit to this resort (1st in 2004) Still as impressive. I visited this time with my Daughter (15) and a friend both of whom had not been outside of Europe before. They were instantly blown away with the beauty of the resort. Our room was on the tropical side, very nice, clean and well equipped. Maid service was excellent too. The Staff were 1st class in all areas, pools, bars, restaurants and not forgetting Becky  James the reps who offered a ' help your self to sun cream' that others had left behind when you realise your factor 30 is not doing its job in the first few days! It gets very hot. One word of warning, keep your eye on your bags when on the beach or by the pool areas. Mine was snatched from the side of the parasol on the beach and 4 of us were on the sunbeds along side at the time, extremely clever thief. Things tend to be taken during the weekend when the Dominicans come to stay with their families! Hotel staff did all they could to help with the situation and I did have insurance but I was upset with the fact that I had lost all my photographs of our holiday as my camera was taken, complete with memory card! 11 days in. Those I cannot replace! So, we will just have to go back and do it all again! It has not put me off staying there at all, and the Dominican Rum helped me sooth the loss! Trips we did were the Outback Safari which is brill plus you gain an understanding of the culture and have an opportunity to make a few purchases. Saona Island is an absolute must, its quite a long drive out to meet the boats along very very bumpy roads. Again it was my 2nd time to Saona but it is a place you never tire of and the natural lagoon makes the bumpy roads a distant memory.
