{"text":"Highly recommended Found this hotel on Trip Advisor, seeking best value or best hotel I could get while staying in the lower price range. Had a couple others higher on my list but were booked out....in hindsight I'm very glad for that! The last hotel I stayed at in Paris was much more expensive and not nearly as nice or accommodating. I explained to the staff that it was my first anniversary and wanted a view of the Eiffel Tower and they obliged; it was very nice of them and my wife loved it.The Good:Very hospitable staff!!!! They helped us in every way possible.Clean. Maid staff works hard. Found for $132 Euro\/night on a European travel website. Reletive bargain to what else is out there.Free wireless highspeed internet access.Great location. Food and stores are right there; close enough to most attractions to walk; 2 short blocks from metro which is also very cheap  convenient. Superior room was very spacious for Paris hotel.Hotel staff gave suggestions of things to do and made reservations in advance for us at Florimond  Moulin Rouge. The Florimond is ~5 minute walk from hotel and very good food at reasonable price. The Bad:Not much really, but if I were to nitpick...I read reviews of large bathrooms with 2 sinks but ours was smaller and only had one sink. That said, it was still larger than others I've seen in Paris hotels. There are no no-smoking rooms, which is normal for there. They did clean the room and air it out well as I couldn't tell and I'm very sensitive to that sort of thing. However, on our last night people were smoking in the next room and it was wafting through the door.Breakfast is 13 Euro for basically bread\/coffee, eggs\/cheese\/ham are sold individually on top of that price. The quiches, pastries, etc. at the bakery adjacent to the hotel are much better option; much less money and very fresh.
