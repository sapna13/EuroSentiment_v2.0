{"text":"Bahia the Great - Punta Cana Chose the Bahia Principe on the recommendation of a travel agent at Itravel2000. Travelled with a girlfriend who had never been to the Carribean (she was a Florida girl). We were there one week from 5 November to 12 November 2006. It was excellent....though the resort was a little big for my liking. Room was awesome, with balcony and sitting area, large shower, great closet  bureaus...Service was great, food excellent, 5 star all the way. Though the Japanese a la carte was a bit rushed - would not do that again. The french was excellent. Book early, they fill up fast.Shows were better than average - for the most part - though you will get mosquito bitten (take some bug juice and use it every night). If you don't want to walk, there are little carts that travel through the resort every 5 or 10 minutes. The upgrade to diamond club was offered and we turned it down - but felt that we were well treated anyways. Make sure to get over to the Village Square just outside the gate on the right and see the live band there after dinner...it's very nice. There's a casino there, shops, internet, and a karaoke bar (where nobody sang)...This property is new and nice - but some part of me wants to see the ocean from my room when down there - not possible in a property like this...just too big...very few ocean front rooms. Also, there were lots of kids. And, finally, topless people everywhere. So as long as that's not offensive, you're o.k. This is a stay on resort property - not a get out and explore place. Overall, it was everything it was billed to be and I would go again.
