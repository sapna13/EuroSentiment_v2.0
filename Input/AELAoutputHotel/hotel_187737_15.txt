{"text":"Depends on What you are looking for!!!!!!!! I booked this hotel as a birthday gift for my partner along with tickets for Chelsea flower Show. Like a previous review I was very excited by the wonderful trip advisor reviews and although we had a great time it was VERY expensive and I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel it really lived up to its cost. The rooms were very large although I was surprised that the suite did not have a separate living area again slightly disappointing for the standard of hotel. It was the little touches which were missing no welcome flowers or wine in the room, no chocolates at the very early turn down time of six o clock. On the first day after spending a full day out and about in London we showered and changed and went down for the free champagne ( a really nice touch) I asked the staff to provide clean towels for our morning shower when we returned from the theatre this had not been done. I had to call down and request them again. This is not the end of the world but not the standard of service you expect at these rates. On the second night when we went down for the free champagne there was no one to serve us and only when the clock struck seven and the time for champagne was over did a member of staff arrive who did serve us then. It was just missing that something special. We are in London for the weekend again in a few weeks but I am afraid thid time it won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be at the draycott.
