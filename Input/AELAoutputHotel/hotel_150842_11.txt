{"text":"Relaxing vacation We just returned from a week at the Iberostar Dominicana. Our family of 5 had a great time. The ride from the airport to the resort was very nice, not at all bumpy like many other reviews stated. We actually didn't see any potholes at all.  Check-in was very easy and fast. After we checked in we made our restaurant reservations, that was not so fast. It actually took about an hour. The woman at the desk was doing other things in between. Room - Our rooms were very clean and spacious, we were on the top floor and we had very high ceilings. The air conditioning worked very well, it was a great feeling stepping into our room after being out anywhere else in the resort. There is virtually no air conditioning anywhere else, except the casino and a couple of the specialty restaurants. The only problem with the room was that we had tiny ants on the dresser and in the bathroom. I bought bug spray with me and I would spray the dresser every day or so. These little ants were also on the balcony and in the buffet restaurants (many times you would see them on the tablecloths and even in the glasses and on the dishes-just be sure that before you take a plate that you look at it closely). The buffets were very good, so much to choose from. We actually preferred the buffets to the specialty restaurants. We ate at La Pagoda-Oriental, didn't particularly care for it. Portions were on the small side. La Cana - steakhouse, my rib steak was tasty but very fatty. Everyone else in our family got the sirloin steak and everyone found it very tough. La Miramba-seafood, this was actually pretty good from the appetizers to the dessert - the chocolate hazelnut cake was delicious. The Star Rock Cafe is also a sit down restaurant - you don't need reservations for this one. We thought the food was very good and we liked the atmosphere. There is an air hockey table and a pool table there, I believe it is $1.00 to play. We were warned to not drink the water, but we did anyway. We asked a few waiters and they said that the water on the resort was purified. I'm not really sure about that, being that my husband and youngest son got sick towards the end of our stay. I drank the water, as well as my 2 other sons, and we did not get sick. So, I'm not sure if it was the water or the food, even though we found the food to be very good overall.The Beach - absolutely gorgeous!!No problem in finding shade, you may have to walk around a little bit, but we never had a problem. There are women that go topless, so if you have small children, you might want to let them know beforehand. The first day, my 9 year old thought it was weird, even though I told him that many people do this. By the third day, it didn't even faze him. The Pool - very big. The only problem was that it was way too warm. The other thing that We didn't like was that the pool closed at 7:00 pm. This was very odd, as we like to hang out by the pool in the evening when we're on vacation.Star Friends - GREATThey were so energetic all the time and so, so nice. Romeo is a blast!Tipping - Be sure to tip the maid a few dollars a day, and also anyone else who makes your stay alot nicer. Everyone really goes out of their way to make you comfortable. Nightly Entertainment - Just Okthis could use much improvement. The shows were very amateurish for the most part. Some of them were just okay. Also it is very HOT in the lounge.Drinks - very watered down. We drank, but never got a buzz.The bar in the lobby makes better drinks, if you want premium liquor, you have to ask for it.Safe in room - very handy. Some other reviews say that it is $2 a day, but we were not charged.Overall it was a very nice vacation. Would definitely go back again.
