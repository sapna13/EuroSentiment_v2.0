{"text":"Copamarnia - Clean, Quiet and Relaxing The other reviews of Copamarina tell the story very well. We stayed there in the end of March and it met our expectations based on other reviews I read on Trip Advisor. A couple of points I will add:We did not do the all inclusive package and I was worried that there would be no place for my kids to eat outside of the Copamarnia resort. There really isn't any other place to eat without driving. However within 5 miles, in Guanica, there is both a McDonalds and a Burger King as well as a food store. There are restaurants in Guanica but they didn't look inviting to me. There are a number of typical strip mall businesses (K-mart, Walgreens, KFC, Quiznos, high end food store, etc) about 10 miles away in Yauco.If you ask for directions at the front desk there is an area down the coast a bit (20 min) that has lots of restaurants right on the ocean. It is a bit of an adventure if you are up for it. It is not too hard to find but it is further then their map would lead you to believe.The resort is off of a long (3.5 miles) narrow curvy road which makes driving in an out a bit of a hassle but the road looked freshly paved. Speaking of roads, I was amazed at how nice the roads in general are in Puerto Rico. We did eat once at the resort at and had the steak and Lobster ($35 a plate) and it was very good. Outside you can have more casual food like fajitas hamburgers etc for reasonable prices $8 to $15 a plate.Don't pay extra for a Ocean view. All of the rooms have an Ocean view. There are only a couple of rooms (less then 5) that do not have a good view. The view will be better from the 2nd level but having a walkout room is really nice for going to and from the pool. There are 2 pools, 2 hot tubs, 2 kiddie pools, game room. Both pools are large but one is larger and nicer then the other however, that pool is further from the restaurant.The staff is friendly and they speak english. Although I never saw a security guard, I felt very safe there. Someone wrote a review and complained about too many kids and this not being a good place for a honeymoon. I have to disagree. We were there at spring break and the place was dead. There were other families with kids but you often had the hot tub to yourself and 80% of the chairs by the pool were open.There were organized games for the kids during the day but no action at all for kids or adults in the evening. This is not a good place for singles looking to party with others.On our way home we took a different route. We took route 10 up from Ponce across the island. That was interesting but don't do it if you don't have a lot of time. A large part of the trip was on small mountian roads that weren't well marked. However, you are up in the mountains and the scenery is really tropical and pretty.
