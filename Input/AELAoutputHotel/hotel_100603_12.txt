{"text":"Great Seattle Welcome at the Hampton Inn Sea-Tac Stayed at the Hampton Sea-Tac for one night prior to an Alaskan cruise. This Hampton had probably the best and friendliest service of any hotel I've ever stayed at.The hotel is near the airport, obviously, and offers a free shuttle between it and the airport and restaurants and shopping near it. At the airport shuttle drop off\/pick up area, I just had to use the free shuttle telephones and dial 46 (I think, or 43) to ring up the Hampton. They confirmed my reservation and sent out the shuttle. It arrived about 10 minutes later. The shuttle driver, Tim, was very friendly and had a fun personality. He also took us to a restaurant later and when we called, he picked us up within 10 minutes.We also used the shuttle the following morning to go back to the airport and then take the cruise transfers to the pier.The front desk was also very friendly and outgoing. Check in was quick and so was check out. The desk will give you a map showing nearby restaurants if you ask. You can also ask for a complementary bottled water.The hotel itself was clean and well kept. The amenities were standard Hampton. The complementary breakfast was also standard Hampton, though it lacked fruit unlike others. The food was kept up only by one elderly man who had a hard time keeping up.Overall, I recommend the hotel highly. I had read that the area was so-so and was a bit afraid to stay here after that but the area looked fine to me. ","annotations":[]}
