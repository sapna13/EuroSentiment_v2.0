{"text":"Great valuefor your money! I am a flight attendant, so I have stayed in many hotels worldwide in my life, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised wth the Carabela. Yes, I too read reviews before leaving and was skeptic, but I went with my mom, a very critical person, and she loved it. The food was exceptional, never got sick, and really enjoyed the A La Carte seafood restaurant. The room needed repairs, but who goes to the islands to stay locked up in their room? My 7yr old son, wasn't keen on the beach, but he loved playing ping pong every day and mini-golf too. There wasn't much for kids to do, but most children love pools, so that wasn't a big deal.We did a couple of the excursions. I do not recommend the one about swimming with the naturium for the elderly or the too young who have problems swimming. You must swim from the boat to the naturium and then back to the boat. So I spent $200 for 3 of us to stay on a boat for 5 hrs along with a few others who couldn't get off the boat due to medical issues. They were not impressed either. The inhabited island tour was beautiful. Went on a catamaran and spent the day on island and in natural pools in the middle of the ocean. Unbelievable! we could touch the bottom.Overall, I must say that out of all the hotels I have stayed in the Caribbean including some high end ones in Mexico, this one is great value for your money. To those people who expect to find the same amenities that they are accustomed to at home in a third world country, let go and enjoy yourself.My mom is planning her trip again, and she is definitely wanting to go back to the Carabela. Peace, quiet, great food, lovely beach, and great massages. ","annotations":[]}
