{"text":"Functional but good enough for a pleasant stay We stayed 3 nights at the Agon Frankfurter Allee in Berlin. It's spotlessly clean, nicely renovated inside and out but it is also largely functional.I'll deal with the negatives first. There is no in-room safe (just a big shared safe at reception), no fridge\/mini bar (which we like to use to chill our own soft drinks and water), no air conditioning (just heating, so there's no fan\/ventilation unless you keep the windows open which would then be occasionally noisy at night with the passing cars, people etc).There is no lobby with sofas - just a bar with high stools so there's nowhere to sit and relax before\/after you've checked in\/out.Breakfast is only so so. Cheese, cold meats, yoghurts, tea\/coffee. No nice pastries, v little fresh fruit, v little cooked food and the juices were very watery. It's basically a very cheap spread.As for the room, the pillows were thin and the mattresses very soft providing little support.Those are the negatives but there are plenty of positives.The room was large, the bathroom was very clean and everything worked well. There was plenty of hot water at all times of the day and night. No plumbing problems etc. The bathroom floor was heated which was a plus. There is also plenty of car parking in the inner courtyard.The main plus for us was that the front desk staff were very helpful and polite. All of them were very good to us and that definitely helps.By the way, there is free internet access in the reception but the computer runs on linux (not Windows or Mac) and it mysteriously does not allow access to yahoo mail for some strange reason.When we were booking, we found hotels to be expensive for what you get in Berlin which is why we settled for this one. Whenever we go on a city break for 3 nights, we usually aim to spend around √ä√£¬¢100 per night. What that gets you definitely varies quite a bit from one country to another in the EU. For that money in Italy you can get a really chic 4 star hotel (e.g. the Starhotels Excelsior in Bologna for example). So Berlin is certainly somewhere that one has to pay a premium in order to get a comparable room. But, did we enjoy our stay in Berlin and at this hotel? The answer is yes to both of these.Given that Berlin seems to be somewhere that one has to spend a premium to get a really decent hotel, this hotel represents good value for the typical cost conscious visitor.
