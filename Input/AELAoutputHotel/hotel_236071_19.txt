{"text":"Fun and strange! Well Just back from another fabulous holiday in the Dam. It was my eighth time but first time in a hostel.I was very apprehensive as i have always stayed in pretty nice hotels and some of the reviews were quite scary.Found hotel no problems and we were able to lock our bags in hold until 2pm. Not too impressed with security but thankfully everything was ok.There were 11 of us in our party ( all hard working nursing staff ) so we were looking to party obviously! 8 had the dorm downstairs, small room with 4 bunk beds in and a small toilet.I had a twin room but someone dropped out so i swapped with two others and had a double room to myself. Both private rooms were very funky and both very different in there design and decor.These rooms were about the same size as the 8 bedded dorm and i think had a bigger bathroom.Rooms were clean and showers great. New towels every day which is nice.We spent alot of time in the downstairs bar which was pleasant and comfortable. Some good offers on, such as two for one on stella and jack daniels. Some of our party loved this!We were quite loud and boisterous at times and were told to behave! Staff do need to chill out a bit ,as we were spending a fortune so they should have been delighted! Also there was a staff member who obviously thought he was a policeman who when questioning one of our party about if she had a key, he shouted into her face  its the law  Jeeze!Location is really good and you can walk to all attractions in a short while.Quiet enough late at night apart from the odd people shouting outside but the worst noise came from the ringing of church bells outside ( Xmas tunes ) from about 6am.It drove me crazy.All in all really enjoyed holiday and hostel was pretty cool.
