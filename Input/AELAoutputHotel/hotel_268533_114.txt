{"text":"Doggone GREAT! My husband and I and our two 50 pound mutts have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Argonaut. We chose this hotel because of it's great location at the end of Fisherman's Wharf and because of the Kimpton Hotel's fabulous pet friendly policy. When we checked in, we were offered pet beds and feeding bowls...no extra charge! No extra charge for the pets, either! There is a nice park right next door, so very convenient for doggy walks. One of our boys, Buster, was freaked out by the very highly polished wood floor at the entrance, and after dragging him the length of the lobby on his belly, we opted for the stairs instead. Problem solved. We had a king suite towards the rear of the hotel on the first night (Saturday), which was a bit noisy for us early to bed types, but the next morning we asked the front desk clerk if we could move to a quieter room. She was very gracious and offered us another suite at the front of the hotel, which was much quieter and had a spectacular view. Still noisy in the afternoon with the outdoor entertainment in the adjacent courtyard, and if we return we will ask for a room on the Hyde St. side of the building, which faces the park. The suites were HUGE, spacious and comfortable, and the jacuzzi tub was big enough for a family to paddle around in. New York Times  SF Chron delivered daily, great service, smiling employees, relaxed and welcoming atmosphere...it doesn't get much better than this in SF!
