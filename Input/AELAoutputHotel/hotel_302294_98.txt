{"text":"Absolutely wonderful Just returned from a week's stay at the Pan Pacific and strongly recommend this great hotel. If you crave superior customer service as well as first class facilities this is the hotel for you.From the moment we arrived the friendliness of the staff and the quality of their service was apparent. From the door men to the personal check-in to our room the level of service exceeded all expectations. We really appreciated the friendliness and help received from all staff during our stay.The rooms have been tastefully refurbished and have a contemporary feel. The LCD tv was a nice touch and the king bed was huge and well comfy. We felt very comfortable throughout our stay. Another nice touch was the option of clearing out the bar fridge and using it to store your own beverages etc. Very helpful.We ordered room service on a few occassions and the timing was impeccable, most efficient we have experienced. The food was good too and the fact that the in room dining menu includes items from some of the hotel's in house restaurants is fantastic.The location of the hotel couldnt be better. The hotel is linked by walkways, overpasses etc to the major shopping centres (Millenia Walk, Marina Square, Suntec City) and hotels within Marina Bay. You are basically a few minutes walk to great shopping and food. If you like to walk the Esplanade is a 10 min walk and a futher 10-15 mins will take you to Boat Quay, the museums etc. If walking isnt your thing then jump in a taxi from the hotel foyer. We never waited for a taxi no matter what time of the day and normally spent between $5-10 a fare, the furthest we travelled was to Orchard Rd. Cheap in our eyes.We had an absolutely fantastic time in Singapore and the fact that the hotel is in such a great location and the facilities and staff exceeded our expectations it just made our trip that bit more memorable.
