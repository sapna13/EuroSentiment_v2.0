{"text":"Very nice Booked this hotel through Expedia and think the price was quite heavily discounted, 5 nights in a 5 star hotel for 500 GBP.Hotel is in a nice quiet street a few hundred yards from the red light district - everything is within easy access.We are staying on a room only basis, charge for breakfast in your room is a whopping 30 euro, not sure how much it is in the restaurant but it will be expensive.We have had room service, 2 x burger and chips and a bottle of wine for 60 euro - not a bad price, excellent quality.We are staying in the main block of the hotel, room is large and has everything you need - TV, safe, mini bar (mega expensive), tea\/coffee making facilities, free wi-fi, trouser press, desk, arm chair etcRoom and bathroom are really clean - read some negative comments relating to the toiletries provided but they seem fine to us.Bed is comfortable and the linen is really good quality.Hotel staff are very friendly and attentive, they have helped me obtain a rollator\/wheeled walker and seem very knowledgeable about all things relating to Amsterdam.Taxis ordered by the hotel are great, so far we have had a nice big BMW and a Mercedes, nice to travel in luxury - fares are reasonable too.We even had a phone call from the manager asking our opinion on the hotel with regards to cleanliness, concierge, movies, food etcReally cannot fault the hotel in any way, we are used to staying in top end hotels in the USA such as Sofitel, Loews etc and this is on a par with them.
