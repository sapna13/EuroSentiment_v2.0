{"text":"Lovely, Hip Hotel in Great In-Town Neighborhood My husband, 12 year old son, and I visited San Francisco on a long weekend the first part of October. We stayed at the Hotel del Sol, based on reviews that I had read on TripAdvisor. Well, let me say, that the reviews were right on the money! We loved the Hotel del Sol, and highly recommend it! It is located in a GREAT, safe, in-town neighborhood that is close to everything, but far enough away from the noise and tourist traps. It is located in the Marina district, which is home to great shops and restaurants....all that you can easily walk to. We loved to explore the different streets with the neighborhood restaurants...plenty of outdoor cafes and coffee shops. It is in an upscale, residential neighborhood that was alot of fun. The hotel staff was young, very helpful, and friendly. They gave us lots of great recommendations for restaurants, etc. The rooms were done in bright colors, just like it shows on the website. I don't think you could get a better value for the money in that location. We took the city bus (a stop is located just 2 short blocks away) everywhere. It's easy to get around in San Francisco without a car! One thing we did that was awesome was.....rent bikes from Blazing Saddles Bikes and bike across the Golden Gate Bridge to Saulsalito! What a fun day we had! You can take the ferry right back across the bay to San Francisco. It's a beautiful boat ride across the bay. We will definately return!
