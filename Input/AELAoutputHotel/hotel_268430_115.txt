{"text":"The good and the bad We just got back from 5 days in Puerto Rico- traveling with our 19-month-old. Here is the rundown of the good and the bad of the Courtyard Marriott there in San Juan. After having gone to St. Kitts and Cancun the previous two years- staying at Marriott√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ at both location- I put San Juan as third on my list of places to visit- especially with a child.The Good√à¬£¬©?Pool is great. They have a nice pool with a swim up bar. They also have two other kid pools. One is a pool perfect for kids who have just learned to swim. It isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ very big, has a slide, and has seating for parents. They also have a baby pool, which was perfect for our son. There are plenty of chairs around each of three pools.√à¬£¬©?They have a nice playground.√à¬£¬©?I really liked how you could see the ocean from the pool and you were just steps away from the beach.√à¬£¬©?They gave my son a bucket, shovel and beach ball when we checked in. They never left his side.√à¬£¬©?The breakfast buffet was really good and priced reasonably at $13 per person.√à¬£¬©?The food you can get for lunch throughout the hotel is okay. Nothing great but nothing too bad.√à¬£¬©?There is a pharmacy within walking distance to get snacks, floats, soft drinks, etc..√à¬£¬©?There is a grocery store within walking distance- about 15 minutes or 3 minutes by cab. We walked it and it is doable despite what they tell you. But if you just need small stuff go to the pharmacy. If you do buy milk, buy a √à√¥√ú gallon √à√\u2020\u2022?a whole gallon won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ fit in the fridge.√à¬£¬©?The rooms had DVD players.The Bad√à¬£¬©?The hotel is the last hotel in a line of hotels. You have about a 10-minute walk to other restaurants\/hotel restaurants. The sidewalks are not very stroller friendly√à¬£¬©?If you do go somewhere else close by- like a two minute cab ride, you are looking at a minimum of $6-7 each way. It was about $35 roundtrip to old San Juan. It adds up after a while and can be difficult to do with a car seat.√à¬£¬©?The food at the hotel at night isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ very good so you have to go out and most places- even American chains- are about 50% higher than what you would pay in the states.√à¬£¬©?I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel the service was that great at the hotel. I had to call the front desk a couple of times for things and it was like they could have cared less- they had a take it or leave it attitude- despite the letter you get from management when you check in. √à¬£¬©?The people in San Juan weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ the most helpful people either. I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel like they were really into being a tourist destination. Being that I live in Maryland and it is really cold here in the winter- I would only go back if it were a really good deal getting there and staying there at the Marriott. Otherwise I would look for a hotel on Isla Verde but further down the strip.
