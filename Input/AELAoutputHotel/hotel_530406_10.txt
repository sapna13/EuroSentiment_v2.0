{"text":"I'd return, Len We visited Dec 1 - 8. We had read the reviews and found some to be too picky. We went without expectations and were thoroughly impressed. I spend about 60 days a year in hotel rooms with my work, so seeing the type of room and cleanliness, I was impressed. True, they clean your room late afternoon, but that is not a problem because you are out and about all day. The time share folks are a bit obnoxious, but a stearn look and no solves that problem. The beach vendors can be the same but the deals you can barter make up for it. The vendors have their own shops in one area and do not bother you outside that area. We went on the Saona Island expedition, all I can say is do it. The bus ride is an adrenalin ride in itself! A whole day experience and worth every penny.The buffet is excellent and varies every day. (breakfast, back left corner of buffet has champagne and orange juice). The Italian restaurant is the best and only one I would return to. The house wine is to be avoided at all restaurants, they give it away for a reason. The D.R. does not have a dairy industry, so a glass of milk is out of the question. Mikes Coffee house has to be experienced. There can be no better coffee house on earth. Loose 10 lb. if you plan to have the deserts there every day.Our only complaint of the trip was the airline. Never, ever, will I travel with Skyservice again. Trust me, eat before boarding a Skyservice flight and bring your own water.Vladamir the bartender at the swim up bar is my amigo for life.The main tip for all travellers - read their name tags and address these hard working service people by their name, it goes a very long way. It's also the courteous thing to do. Leaving $1 tips in the morning and afternoon for the various workers is a small extra for the smile you receive.
