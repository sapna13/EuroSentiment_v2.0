{"text":"overall a great trip hi everybody,we just returned from our trip to Punta Cana.It was a week of relaxation and enjoyment,but let's take it step by step.We arrived in Punta Cana arround 9pm,after an awfully long flight(7 hours aprox).Right after the airplane door opened a nice,warm and humid breeze hits you. It's quite a nice feeling if you are living in a cold place.We retreived our luggages and were directed to a bus wich took us to the resort.The trip took like 40 min and passed through the town of Punta Cana ,giving you the posibility to see the life as it is in the Dominican Rep. Once arrived in the resort you are pampered in all ways.Our room was in the 3000 building , very close to the pool and beach.Nothing special,but nice and clean. One thing disturbed us,wich is the smell of chlorine and bug spray that's filling the room.We can still smell it on our luggages after 2 weeks.We took a short walk in the resort and its just amazing.Very nice maintained,clean,a real piece of paradise.In the resort there are 3 hotels ,and you can enjoy all of their amenities at no extra charge.A mini-train takes you around the resort,making it a nice way to see the whole resort without getting tired.The train is coming every 10min ,so there is not really lot to wait.As far as food and drinks,there are lots to try.You will find to be too many restaurants.The nice thing, though,is that every day is another menu.For ex. Monday is mexican day,Tuesday italian day,dominican,american,french,and so on.So,you really have the chance to try out a bit of everything.Drinks are beeing found at every 100m,or so.They also have 2 theatres wich have shows every night beginning at around 10pm,sports centre with mini-golf,soccer field,tennis,basketball,archery,ping-pong,a disco club for singles,live music in the hotel lobby,and night beach entertainment.The theatre shows we have to say are quite crappy,but the guys are really putting a hard effort to make everyone happy.The choreographer though,not so good.Day time a lot of entertainment on the beach and at the pools.Oh,there are 2 pools at the hotel,both with swim up bars.The entretainment consists of aerobic lessons,different contests,dance lessons,and all sorts of funny games like beer drinking or kayaking in the pool....all beeing organized by a team of around 10 local guys and girls who are very very funny.There is one thing wich is really annoying and we found it to be rude;people reserve the beach and pool chairs very early in the morning,by placing a towel on the chair.Of course,if you want to come to sit around the pool about 8 30am, you will find no chairs available, but lots of chairs with towels on them but no one there. And same people reserve at the beach as well as at the pool and never use them for the day. Unfortunately, you will have to find a way to reserve a chair very early in the morning.We recommend you purchase a medical insurance. We didn't do that and it costed us 200$ US the doctor visit and a cream in the resort. Maybe it's a good idea to mention that on the beach you can find sand flies easily. And they bite:))some people are allergic to their bite,like me,some not....like my wife.Also on the beach you will find some shops from wich you can buy souvenirs of all kinds.One thing to be aware...we found out that bargaining it's a must in Dominican Rep ,as well as a social activity.:)For example,I bought some cigars 10pc for 10 $US,after a hard negociation....wich brought the price down from 70$US:))so..I let you decide how much a product is worth.Defenetely,they will ask wayyyyy more money than its worth.They are very nice people overall,but we found them pushy too.And we mean,they will do anything to get some money form you.Weather its for a souvenir or for some excursions outside the resort,they are not letting you go until they sale you something.But,eventualy ,you get used to that and ignore it with a smile and a NO,gracias!Music is good,athmosfere is awsome,one week in wich we really felt no stress whatsoever.It's worth it,we loved it and would defenetely go back there with pleasure.Adi(28) and Emilia(29).
