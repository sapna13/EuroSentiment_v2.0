{"text":"Nice Place, Skip the Food We just stayed at Melia Caribe for our honeymoon. The resort was gorgeous! Marble floors throughout the lobby. Very friendly staff! Watch out, because they will all try to get you to take an invitation to meet with them at a later time for a information session about becoming a member. They will not leave you alone all week. Besides that, the staff was great! We had a Royal Service suite. I haven't been there in a regular room, but I am guessing that it was worth it having the Royal Service. Our room was a small apartment, with a huge bed, a private porch, two plasma tv's, a living room, a kitchen (full), and jacuzzi and a beautiful bathroom. The whole apartment has marble floors. The maids come to the room twice a day (never at times when we were in the room). The come once in the morning to clean and make up the bed. They come again while we are gone for dinner to turn down the bed. Outstanding! The beach a about a 10 minute walk from our room. We had the option to either walk, or flag down one of many golf carts driven by service staff to take you to the beach. They also have a 'train' that constantly goes around the resort that you can take.The beach has a section that is private to Royal Service guests. It is quiet. There are cocktail servers that come around to you at the beach, or you can walk up to the bar on the beach yourself. Oh, by the way, be prepared to see many women topless on the beach.There is also a private pool area for Royal Service members. We did not like this one as much as the other pools, because it was too quiet with not enough going on. The upside of the private pool is there is a complimentary snack bar.Now, the negative. FOOD! If you are thinking about purchasing All-Inclusive.....don't! The breakfast and lunch buffets were equivalent to a college cafeteria buffet. There are just a few Dominican food items available, and they aren't very good. At breakfast, the rest is just regular breakfast food. At lunch, there is a decent variety of items, but again, it is the quality of a cheap buffet. Very disappointing! If you want some juice with your breakfast, they have a great selection, but it is not kept cold, so enjoy a warm glass of OJ! At the Gabi Club (Royal Service pool area) you can get comp. food at the snack bar. I would be wary of the hamburgers. They cook them ahead of time and keep them in a pan filled with hot water until ordered! Disgusting!Dinners.....oh boy.......There are 8 or 9 different restaurants on the resort, all with a different theme; American, Dominican, Thai, Japanese (teppanyaki), Mexican, Italian, French and so on. Don't get excited! I would equate this food to a frozen dinner at best! Even the Dominican restaurant was bad! I was excited to go there so I could have some real Dominican food, but not so much. Even American food....how can you mess that up? I was unsure whether I wanted Salmon or a regular Cheeseburger, so I got both. The salmon smelled and tasted sooooo fishy! I could not take more than one bite for fear of getting sick. So I turned to the burger. I think that this burger was cooked the same way as the one at the Gabi Club. Nasty!Oh, and you need to have reservations for each restaurant. Why, I dont know because the restaurants were more than half empty each night at 7:30 when we went in. What happens if you get there early, you ask? Sorry, your reservation is not until 7:30. With all of the empty tables, they will not let you sit early. And when you do get sat, the restaurant service is not so great. Eventually someone will fill your water, and then someone else will come up and take your order. Of the week we were there, twice they got our order wrong. The last night of our stay, we decided to go eat at Hard Rock Cafe instead because we couldn't stand it anymore! The hard Rock is in a mall on the resort grounds, along with Tony Romas, a Sushi place and a Pizza place....so there are options nearby if you don't wanna eat the nasty food at the resort.Great place, bad food! It is worth it as long as you dont get excited about the food!
