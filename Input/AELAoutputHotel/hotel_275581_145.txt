{"text":"Amazing value for money Thank you Tripadvisor! We booked this hotel solely based on Tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed. Its like a proper hotel at Travelodge prices - we paid around √ä√£¬¢80 per night for a double room. The staff were the most helpful I have come across at a non-luxury property and the rooms were amazingly well equipped for the amount we paid - internet access, air con, dressing gowns, cd and dvd player, well stocked minibar, comfortable chair, white company toiletries, full tea and coffee making facilities plus biscuits - need I go on?The bathrooms were quite small but the showers very powerful and they had everything we needed. Everything was very clean and quiet and the rooms felt spacious. Some of them must have great views over London if you get a room on a high floor. The only negative comment I would make about the room was the bed - although we did sleep well the mattress was a bit softer than I would have liked. But you can't have everything at this price! We had breakfast in the hotel both days and the selection was very good although we did feel it was a little bit pricey at the weekend. Top tip - they do an a la carte breakfast menu so if you just want a coffee and a croissant, that's all you'll pay for. They had an outside seating area which looked as though it would be really nice in the warmer weather. The bar was very funky and we used that one evening after coming back from the theatre. It was surprisingly full and lively for a hotel bar - plus they did fantastic cocktails!The only thing I didn't like so much was the location. Although it is pretty central, Pimlico is not a tube station that will get you to many places without a change of line. You can however easily walk from the hotel to the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey etc. Also - the staff were very good at getting taxis if you need one. Despite the location, I would definitely stay there again because I thought what you got for the money was amazing value.
