{"text":"The nightmare-hotel We came to hotel Rialto an evening in may for a longweekend. The room was small and shabby, but we just unpacked and left our suitcases open at the small bed (120 cm for two persons...). Big mistake. Huge. Cause when we came back after dinner four hours later the sprinkler above the bed was full on and our room totaly soaked and wet. All our clothes, our laptop and cellphone - wet and out of function. So we called the reception and told them what happened. Their answer? Sorry but we can√à?√¨t help you now. The sprinkler was still on and the room looked like a bathroom. At least we got another room - but it STANK of mould. So we asked the frontdesk if they had another room were we didn√à?√¨t got mould poisoning, so they removed us to a little cubby-hole. Next morning we asked to see the hotel manager to discuss the damage at our luggage, but the frontdesk was extremely uninterested and just ignored us. The last day we finally got to see the management staff and filled in insurance papers and discussed the accident. They promised to compensate us within the next month. But we never heard from them so I called the hotel manager after three months - and he just hunged up on me, twice. This was the worst hotel we ever had stayed in, of many reasons: the disagreeable reception, the lying management, the filthy rooms with the stank of mould and the present renovations that made a constant noice. The location is however great, but that√à?√¨s the only positive thing we can mention about this place. We will definitely return to lovely Barcelona, but never ever to hotel Rialto - a park bench seem to be a more attractive alternative rather than that hotel. ","annotations":[]}
