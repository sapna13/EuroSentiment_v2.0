{"text":"Nice, trendy hotel. Yet not completely satisfying. We stayed at the Hotel Jazz during a weekend visit to Barcelona. The pros:The rooms are really beautiful. Trendy, attractive and comfortable. The staff was also welcoming and helpful. Although, we asked for a restaurant suggestion and I was not quite happy as they sent us to a super touristy area. Location is good. There is a metro stop just a few steps away and it is in close proximity to some sites as well. There is also a great view from the rooftop pool which seems well maintained and a nice refreshing way to end a long day. Check out is 11am which is good as we like a later checkout. The cons:Breakfast is expensive. And is fine. But not impressive.We stayed on the 4th floor but at times, could still hear the metro running past below. It didn't disturb us really but it might do on lower floors. The airco works. Yet, it was directed just at the area where your head lays on the pillow. Rather uncomfortable and not good for the sinuses. The pool is far too small for the number of guests in the hotel. We had to hang around for nearly an hour before even getting a chair. When we finally did get one, it turned out to be broken. Plus, there seem to be a lot of guests who just place a towel down to reserve a chair, then never return.All in all I'd say it is a nice hotel and certainly worthy of a 3.5 star rating. But, when I go to Barcelona again, I will likely look to see what else is out there as I feel there may be something more satisfying.
