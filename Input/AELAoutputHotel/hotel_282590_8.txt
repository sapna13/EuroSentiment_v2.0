{"text":"Lots of memories We stayed at this hotel last spring based on positive reviews from Trip Advisor. This will add to those positive reviews. The hotel room is very comfortable and very modern chic - you have to like bold colors to stay here. The bed was cozy and there was a large plasma screen tv. I loved the floor to ceiling windows; we had a view of the street and thought it interesting to watch people come and go. Our room was on the third floor so we didn't have any problem with noise from the street. The toilet and shower are separate from the room but there is no door for privacy. This wasn't a big deal for us. However, the sink was a strange size - it was unusually large and, being short, I had a difficult time reaching the faucet handles. I thought the corridor from the elevator to the rooms was too dark but I guess this was part of the whole mod look. We didn't go to the bar since there was too much cigarette smoke for my comfort (the lobby which is right off the bar also smelled smokey). We did try the breakfast buffet downstairs, which was delicious though a bit pricey. Other days we just walked down the street to a cafe and had coffee and pastries. We liked the location of the hotel which was close to the museums and the subway. It's a great hotel for couples or singles; not for families. We would definitely stay here again if we're in Berlin.
