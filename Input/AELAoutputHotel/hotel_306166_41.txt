{"text":"Almost fabulous We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Conrad Singapore. All in all it was a great trip and I would have given this hotel 5 stars but for 2 aspects:(1) The phone system in the room did not work - calls came through but confusingly on 2 separate lines, voicemails were left for me but no light ever came on to indicate this (there is a designated red light on each of the 2 phones to show messages). This caused me a lot of confusion and stress as I had to keep calling down to the lobby to see if any messages had come for me. I ended up missing a few friends' calls and hence did not get to meet them on this trip.(2) For some reason this is the only hotel in Asia that I have stayed at (of the 5 star variety) that did not have a steam\/sauna room in the changing rooms\/ spa near the pool. Ok, I accept that it is a business hotel, but there were many other family types staying there as well - would have been a great addition. The gym was fantastic and very extensive so this would have helped.Apart from these 2 minor hiccups, the hotel was fabulous. The staff were truly friendly and were great with my baby daughter, giving her alot of attention, toys and one maitre d even carried her off for a few minutes so we could take our breakfast from the buffet! The rooms were clean, fairly large (although nothing beats the Conrads in Bali or Bangkok for sheer size) and good views of Suntec. All in all, I would probably stay here again at least location wise because it was the best located of all the Marina hotels I think - directly attached to a mall, and close to the link to City Hall MRT.
