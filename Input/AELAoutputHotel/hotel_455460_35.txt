{"text":"A Feast in the Eye - The Luxe Manor Hotel HK Be impressed with the hotel's lobby - from the bell-adorned huge doors to the artsy mosaic floor, the unusual chandeliers and surreal sofas. The room decor and furnishing is funky, you will not mind the size of the room. Flat screen TV framed like a painting is creative and the faux fireplace is so cool. Bed linens are of high count to ensure sweet dreams. Bathroom design  fixtures are modern with clean, fluffy towels. Room amenities are complete - wifi internet connection, wireless phone - you can't ask more. Turn in service can't be more pleasing: it includes bite-size cookies and cakes for midnight cravings. The Aspasia restausrant is tastefully decorated and the food and service is superb. Just behind the hotel is Knutsford Terrace where you can find a variety of good restaurants and bars. Conveniently located, the Kowloon park (where you can go swimming in the public pools) is just a walking distance. So is the the TST MRT station, China Ferry terminal, star ferry terminal and the world of shopping. Best of all, it is moderately priced. This boutiqe hotel sure provides the best value! The interactive TV is not very user-friendly. No CNN, MTV or HBP\/movie channel. It takes time for you to get used to security elevators wherein you have to swipe\/flash you room card before you can take the lift. Very minor setbacks.I am recommending this boutique hotel to everyone who's wary of the usual, standard hotels in Hongkong. For a change, this hotel stirs up some excitement! Even their website is unique. Check it out!
