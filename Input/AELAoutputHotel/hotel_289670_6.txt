{"text":"Excellent 4* value We had never been to Barcelona before so were really taking 'pot luck' when choosing a hotel. My research indicated that Barcelona hotels tended to the higher price range and I would normally have restricted my choice to the 3* hotels which I have always found more than adequate for a short sight-seeing holiday (after all we only sleep and have breakfast in them).In this case my return flight from Reus airport was early morning which meant that we had to be on the 0615 train to arrive in time. As I wanted to avoid travelling across Barcelona this early in the morning and risk missing the train I restricted my choice to hotels close to the Sants train station.The Gran Torre Catalunya is right on the station's doorstep and after visiting their website I took the plunge and booked into this 4* hotel, especially as the room rates were noticeably lower than the other Barcelona 4* hotels we viewed. We were not disappointed - it was everything the website implies. The staff were wonderful, the views over the City breathtaking and our standard room was extremely spacious and quite luxurious. The breakfast was absolutely amazing - held in the top floor panaromic restaurant and providing the widest choice of self-service food (cereals \/ English  \/European breakfast \/ savouries) than any other European hotel we have stayed at. After breakfast we didn't even think about another meal until early evening!Despite the disastrous √ä√£¬¢ \/ euro exchange rate, the hotel was worth every penny and we would definitely use it again when we return to Barcelona in the future.
