{"text":"Disappointing bed  I recently stayed at the L'Abbaye on an long (2 week) buisness trip to Paris. It's a pleasant, quiet, clean hotel, as one would naturally hope for an official four star (the above info is incorrect). Every other aspect of my stay was however frustrating; added up I was ultimately very disappointed in my stay.- My booked double bed (I'm very tall) turned out to be two singles pushed together, with single sheets. I asked for a proper large bed and was told there wasn't one available (and that two singles was the default in France?) but they could remake the bed with double sheets. I later taked to the manager and was moved to a (slightly inferior!) room with a decent bed. - When I rang to extend  confirm my booking (the hotel did not respond to emails to their published address) I specifically asked whether internet (essential for my work) was included in the price (the website is ambigious on this point). This was confirmed by the front desk. I found a paid wifi service on my arrival. I was then told there was free wired Internet but the wall jacks in both rooms in which I stayed were dummies (no connection pins). The manager gave me a very limited time wifi card in compensation; I ended up spending an extra 150 euros over my stay (I didn't bother trying to get this back as work paid, but still vexing).- The included breakfast is very limited; a hot drink, and small glass of juice, and some pastries\/bread\/jam. The quality is decent but no options, nothing savoury, no fruit, no refils. It's the worst hotel breakfast I've had at several hotels in Paris. ","annotations":[]}
