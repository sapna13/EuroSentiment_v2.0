{"text":"This is not a 5 Star This is our second visit to this hotel.We had been here 3 years ago and since my husband likes all-inclusive and we were looking for an affordable holiday, fast, we decided to return to the Palace Macao.I was extremely disappointed. 2 nights out of 7, our room was only being cleaned at 6:00pm. 1 day out of 7 it was cleaned before lunch.Bath tub had black mould in the corners; pillows smelled like dirty sweat...I even grabbed the extra pillows in the closet...they didn't smell as bad. The beds are the hardest bed I have ever slept (tried to sleep) in. The property needs a good sprucing up and defiantly new mattresses.The food at the buffet is always the same for lunch and breakfast. Dinner was o.k. But it is no longer what is used to be...just like a boring all-inclusive...The Speciality restaurants....well the Japanese was O.k....the Caribe was a joke. On our 5th day, during breakfast at the buffet restaurant I saw a couple of ladies jump and walk away, fast, this was near the cart with cheese and Fresh fruit, at the far end of the restaurant, when I approached, I saw the reason they had jumped was because of the huge cockroach was crawling near the cheese.We have been to other Riu resorts, and let me tell you that if you really want to go to Punta Cana, then do go to the Palace√à√\u2020\u2022?it is not a snooty hotel, but simply what the Palace Macao used to be. The Palace Macao does not deserve a 5 star rating anymore.Internet access√à√\u2020\u2022?$8.00 for 1 hour√à√\u2020\u2022?good and reliable√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√∂√ÜOWEVER if you take your laptop, you can walk to the sports bar in the Palace Punta Cana and surf for FREE. They have Free Wireless service in the Sports Bar area√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√°nd nobody will kick you out. You are simply not allowed to order food or drinks.The beach is nice, BUT crowed. IT is nothing out of this world or breath taking. Same thing you find in Mexico or Cuba. Beaches in the Bahamas, Antigua, St. Marteen, British and US Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos are nicer. Yes, if you compare it to Cuba and Mexico it is better, but if you are a seasoned traveller, and\/or simply looking for a nice vacation, perhaps you should try elsewhere. I will not be returning.E.D.
