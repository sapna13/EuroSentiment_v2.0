{"text":"Really Quite Overrated I booked this hotel for a short business trip based on the numerous glowing reports from this site. I should make clear that I have been fortunate to stay in some of the finest hotels, but I am equally happy in medium-class hotels if they offer more than the price would lead you to expect. I appreciate that, by HK standards, this is not a particularly expensive hotel, but it really was quite disappointing. There were no huge flaws, just a number of small annoyances which added up to a rather unsatisfactory experience. The most important problem for me was noise. In a hotel of this class, especially a new hotel, you don't expect to be able to hear the TV in the room next door, or the occupants coughing  talking. This is a pet hate of mine, and is just not acceptable. The other guests were also very noisy, and I was woken up on Friday  Saturday nights after 1am by guests returning to their rooms, laughing  talking loudly in the corridors. I know the hotel can't really be held responsbile for this, but that is the kind of clientele it attracts.Next complaint, the location is certainly not ideal. For those who don't know HK, Mongkok is really a bit far out from the action - certainly for tourists. I did know this, but read that the MTR (subway) station was close, and so wasn't concerned. However, whilst the entrance to the MTR is in the shopping mall attached to the hotel, you have to walk right through the mall and down several levels to reach it. This is a good 10-15 minute walk, and so not as handy as you expect. If you want to walk to Tsim Sha Tsui (the part of Kowloon adjacent to HK island, where the 'tourist' area is), you will be walking for more than an hour.The lifts: You will think I am mad, but this hotel has the slowest lifts ever. On accasion, I was waiting for over 5 minutes for a lift to arrive, which is infuriating if you are as impatient as me. I guess there are simply not enough lifts to service the rooms effectively.On the plus side, the rooms are well equipped, with large plasma TVs, and sumptuous bathrooms - the huge rain showers are nearly powerful enough to knock you over. The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and they offer a wide range of pillows to ensure you have something to cover up the sound of the other guest arriving back (or just to sleep on perhaps).The Spa is impressive, and they do offer a very nice massage to ease away the aches of the long flight. However, the pool tends to be surrounded by Spa guests on loungers, so you may feel uncomfortable using it if you are a bit self-conscious. The service is also quite good, but I have never found poor service yet in any hotel in this part of the world.I am sure those with different expectations to mine would be happy here, but I recommend you pick a good hotel closer to, or on, the island instead.Simon ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2418,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2414},{"endOffset":2418,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2414},{"endOffset":2418,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2414}]}
