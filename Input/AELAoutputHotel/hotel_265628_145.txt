{"text":"Not comparable to other 4 1\/2 stars Stayed at the Sirenis Dec 20-27th,2007.4 adults, (39,43,62,61) 2 children (14  11)Felt the 4 1\/2 star was not warranted.I have travelled to DR 4 times. Stayed in other 4 1\/2 and 5 star resorts. Beach was nice. No complaints. We experienced some large waves but no serious undertoe to be concerned about.Chairs were impossible to find on the beach. Huts were reserved overnight so that was rude. We were lucky enough to have shade 1 day by getting to the beach by 7am and getting the last hut.Pool was enjoyed by all. Again the whole chair thing was crazy. I could handle sitting on cement but older travellers had a hard time. Huts were impossible if not at pool before 7.Staff were great and very friendly. They loved our attempts at Spanish, especially the children ordering in Spanish. Loved the service.Rooms were very dated. Actually I would even call them not nice. Mold in showers etc. I would just appreciate having a clean bathroom like I would have at home. The maids did clean our room each day, no problem with towels. Brick mattresses but the pillow were fantastic. Made up for the brick we slept on. Not a big deal just an interesting point.Overall the food was ok. Each and every person would have no problem finding something they liked. Just repetative. Not very flavourful. I would say the food was the most disappointing. I had issued with the hamburgers always looking pink. I do not eat pink hamburger as I would not take the chance that it was raw.The lobby area had a very bad smell. Musty. All the wicker furniture smelled this way. Our room also. I get it. I know all about the humidity etc. Just curious why this hotel was so bad. The others I have stayed in had similare furniture and no smell. My whole luggage and all personal items smell horrid. Very noticable once I arrived home. Again I have not experienced this before.My family and I enjoyed our time in the sun. Children enjoyed their first time away. I would not return to this resort as I do feel it is tired. I think for the value I would have stuck with Bavaro Beach. Maybe even paid the extra and gone back to a previous resort.
