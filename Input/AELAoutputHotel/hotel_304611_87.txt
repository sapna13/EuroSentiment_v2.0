{"text":"Club room represents great value for drinkers! I am writing this review from inside my room - using the free internet provided and getting ready for the cocktail hour starting shortly. Because I'm already here and don't need to worry about getting a booking I feel I can let you in on a great deal in Singapore.(Can be tough to make a reservation here, as since the recent renovations and their 'Carousel' restaurant winning the best newcomer buffet for 2007 award, this hotel is quickly growing in popularity) I travel with my husband a lot for work, and between us we have visited many other hotels in Singapore before finding this one including: The Meritus Mandarin (incredibly noisy and appalling service) Copthorne Kings (simply awful) Novotel Clarke Quay (OK, but just another hotel nothing special) Marina Mandarin (was OK, but have not gone back) Hilton (needs serious refurbishment and quickly) and many others that I can't even remember now....So, on with the story.The Royal Plaza on Scotts keeps drawing us back as it represents good value for money (talking about club room deal), is in the centre of town right near Orchard Road for shopping and keeps us both happy.It has recently been refurbished, so all of the rooms feel clean and new with flat screen TV's, king sized beds, a comfy blue velour chair in the corner to throw your clothes over. lol. and the bathrooms feel clean and have a separate bath and shower (a must in my books. I do not take showers in a bath). There is a glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom so the room feels bigger (can pull down a blind don't worry) and everything just works.You get free internet throughout the entire hotel at all hours (wi-fi or cable, with cables provided in the room if you're not up with the latest technology). This level of service is great and means I can relax by the pool with my laptop if I want to.The pool is pretty basic as is the gym, but that's not why we stay here. We come here for the club room food and drinks deal.We always upgrade to the club room for an extra $60 per day for two of us which gets us the following: 6.30am - 10am - Full breakfast either served in the club room upstairs (if you want to avoid the rif-raff) or downstairs in the public breakfast lobby if you want slightly more choices, as the buffet is huge. There is a full cooked section with eggs any way you like, pancakes, waffles, curries, fish, mash potato, noodles, chinese dumplings, congee... you get the picture. A cold section with fruits, cereal, yoghurt and a bakery section with pastries. Coffee and tea is free flowing as are the many juices. 3pm-5pm - Afternoon tea served upstairs in the club room (no rif-raff). More hot food selections like noodles, prawns, fried dumplings as well as cakes, scones, cream, jams, lemon butter, desserts, fruit, water, tea and coffee. BTW, when I say water we're talking bubbly Perrier served in a glass with ice and a slice of lime, not tap.This is the best bit...5.30pm-8pm - Cocktail time!!! Served in the club room, with all of the other happy guests. Fab hot and cold canapes served on spoons and mini dishes just like at a nice function - all alongside a table of breads, cheeses and desserts. The menu changes every night and for example last night some of the cold spoons were smoked salmon rolls topped with sour cream and chives,thai influenced beef rolls, chicken breast with tomato salsa dressing and the hot dishes were sauteed fish with lemon butter sauce and capers, mini lasagnes and prawn skewers wrapped in turkey bacon with a triad of sauces. AND ALL OF THIS IS SERVED WITH FREE FLOW SPARKLING WINE, WHITE WINE, RED WINE, BEER and BASIC SPIRITS for the 2.5 hour duration. Ths is very exciting to drinkers like us who pay a minimum of AUS$60 for a bottle of wine out at dinner in Singapore. Between the two of us we easily make our club room money back on drinks during cocktail hour and we can't recommend this deal enough for drinkers visiting Singapore. (If you haven't been to Singapore before and you're a foodie from Melbourne, prepare to die at the price of wine and 'high end' food BTW)In fact, we often make reservations for dinner and come 8pm, we cancel because we are completely stuffed from the canapes....So there you have it. The club room deal just keeps us coming back again and again! Hope this review has helped!
