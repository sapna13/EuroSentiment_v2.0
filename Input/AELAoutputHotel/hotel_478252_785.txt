{"text":"Looks like a 5 star...but something was missing... We are a Canadian couple in our 30's and we stayed here end of March 07. Booked through Sunwing. One comment on Sunwing. While I realize this is a charter flight and flight times are subject to change, we purchased our package based on some great flight times, a 6 am departure and 9:15 pm return. Both got changed to our disappointment and to our disadvantage. We ended up departing Halifax at 10:15 am and returned at 3 pm. We felt like we lost out on time on our vacation and we had paid a small premium to book with this tour operator based on the flight times. Not cool Sunwing. It felt a bit too suspicious to us, like a bait and switch, which, of course, they deny.  As for the Bahia, we stayed close to the Club Diamond pool, about midway down the resort, in between the lobby and the beach and it was a good location, I felt. Let me start off with the good:1) Check in was done on the bus trip from the airport by Michael, a very nice guy from reception. Very very convenient.2) The beach was fabulous. Large, long beach with beautiful water and soft white sand.3) Our room and the whole resort were very clean. No musty smell in our room. Staff working non-stop.4) Although the resort is very large, the trolleys run non-stop. I didn't mind the walk sometimes.5) Lots of pools, restaurants, bars, a spa, a little shopping and entertainment square on site. No lack of amenities here.6) Internet available all around the resort. 15 minute time limits, but convenient.7) Book the French, Italian and Garden Grill restaurants, the Italian was our favorite, both for service and food.Here's the not so good.1) The food was so-so. Wednesday night at the buffet was very good, nice rib-eye steaks and good variety. Otherwise, too much repetition from night to night at the buffets, it all feels the same.2) Animation staff, with the exception of Kassandra, is unmotivated and pretty lazy. There was stretching, aerobics and dance lesson on the beach, but it was the same every day, no attempt to get to know you or liven things up. I was a little caught off guard when one of the dj's asked me to get him some drinks for himself and another one of the guys. I'm the one on vacation, and he asks me to get him drinks??!! Give me a break! I should've reported him but I guess that's not in my nature, I can't stand the thought of costing somebody their job, even if he did that.3) There was a bad smell in the Bavaro lobby buffet. Especially noticable at lunch times.4) The staff was just okay. They seemed generally unmotivated and unhappy. There were of course some exceptions. Victor and the whole crew at the lobby bar were awesome.  5) The entertainment was really bad. Comedy night especially horrible. The dancing in the Michael Jackson show was good. The lip-synching was hilariously bad. We enjoyed the later entertainment at Pueblo Principe more.6) Avoid the Dominican and Seafood restaurants at all costs. Both are horrible. We had some bad luck and hit a week of not so great weather. It poured buckets for almost 2 whole days and was windy the rest of the time. But you can't control the weather.In all, the resort is nice for families, I wouldn't recommend it too much for couples looking for a romantic getaway. It looks great, and has all the amenities of a 5 star but the personalized attentive service was lacking, the warm and cozy feeling that we have experienced before wasn't there this time around. Would we returrn? Not unless it was with our kids and we got a smokin deal. We enjoyed the Mayan Riviera more.
