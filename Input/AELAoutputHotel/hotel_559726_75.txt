{"text":"Outstanding Value My wife and I stayed at the Aqua Palms and Spa for 7 nights in mid-June 2008, and found this property offers an outstanding value for budget minded Waikiki visitors. We had a room with the recently upgraded bed\/bedding and flat-screen television. This is added to the walkout lanai, free in-room internet (wired), refrigerator, and microwave. All of the staff we encountered were friendly to us during our stay; and the manager, Ms. Kahea Doss, personally hosted a get-together by the pool on Wednesday afternoon. She also uses the reviews on this site as a tool to improve her hotel. The hotel is directly across Ala Moana Blvd. from Hilton Hawaiian Village (HHV) and the adjacent Hale Koa Military Resort, which share one of the better stretches of beach in Waikiki. The walk from the hotel to the beach is about 5 minutes, and there are several accesses to the beach through HHV. Military connected visitors can also use many of the Hale Koa facilities and parking garage ($7 daily). Aqua Palms and Spa is also within easy walking distance (about 5 minutes in the other direction) to the Ala Wai Marina, Ala Moana Beach Park, and Ala Moana Shopping Center. These are locations where locals and visitors both go, and present a more realistic view of Honolulu life than does touristy Waikiki.The downsides we found are generally related to Honolulu being a big city. The traffic is heavy on Ala Moana Blvd., and there is presently construction going on at HHV and on the utilities that run along the center of Ala Moana Blvd.. Both of these projects look like the noisy phases should be completed soon. The construction noise doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get started until about 8:00 AM through about 5:00 PM, but late\/light sleepers should consider asking for a room on the Ewa-side of Aqua Palms and Spa. Also, as it is in most of Waikiki, the parking at the hotel is tight and expensive ($18 daily).
