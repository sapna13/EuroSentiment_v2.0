{"text":"A perfect sanctuary in Paris We just spent 8 fantastic days in Paris and stayed at the charming Hotel de Varenne because of the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. The reviews were right on. The staff was great, including multilingual and helpful Beatrix and the night man we called Alfred (cuz he looked like Bruce Wayne's butler).The rooms (Superior) was spacious with a comfortable king size bed, easy WiFi access (12Euro for 24 hrs of on time) and large modern bathrooms with full size bath and shower.The hotel is located in the quiet 7th district. This is mostly government offices so after 5 it is nice and quiet. The Metro is a 5 min walk and Les Invalides is about the same distance.There is a fully stocked mini grocery store across the street and an upscale wine store a little further down. Pastry shops and cafes are nearby.We ended up ignoring the advice to avoid the breakfast and chose to eat in the hotel and get it out of the way. Although the continental breakfast, at 10 Euro, is a bit steep, for 6 euro you could get 2 eggs, coffee and the ever present baguette. Not a bad deal and no leaving the hotel required.The rooms were air conditioned so you can close the windows at night. The windows were all new, so street noise was minimal.And at the end of a long day of looking at wacky French art, make sure you plan to meet in the cozy Varenne courtyard with a bottle of St. Estaphe, a wheel of stinky fromage and yes, a baguette. (and throw a few crumbs to the resident pigeon, who we named Abindicator)All in all, a great, charming hotel at a decent price. We will come back.
