{"text":"Fun Experience My sister and I stayed at the Iberostar Resort (in the Dominicana) from December 16th to the 23rd. We somehow got upgraded to suite room, which had its own balcony. Our friends stayed in one of the buildings on the Punta Cana side and their room was a bit smaller than ours. The good thing is that we didn't have to use the elevator, as our friends saved 9 people that got stuck in theirs. So if are able to walk, please don't use the elevators, you never know how long it might take for people to get you out.Food - The food choices during breakfast at the buffet were good. We only ate lunch at the beach buffet and everything was fried and choices were limited. We had dinner at the Mexican restaurant - we loved it, then Tropical place - AVOID if you can and the Lobster - very good, although got mixed reviews from others. The food on the Bavaro side was much better and I was able to sneak it at one point, they had much freshes choices. They make everybody book the restaurants, but then they turn out only 1\/4 full...i don't understand why they don't let more people come.Entertainment - SUCKED! Even though a few of the nights it was fun, we only got one professional looking show. The disco was fun, if you are young and trying to hook up!Beach - Make sure you get their early to get chairs. Even though it says that you can't save them, people still do (yes, i was one of them;-) Topless nudity - if you don't want the kids to see, sit further away from the beach.Overall, it was a much needed vacation and we made the best of it. If you can, stay at the Bavaro side, they have better food and their own shows. ","annotations":[]}
