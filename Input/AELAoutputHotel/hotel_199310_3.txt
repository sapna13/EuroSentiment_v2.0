{"text":"nice hotel, pleasant service and good location i stayed at hotel national for one night as i was just passing through frankfurt briefly. this hotel is quite nice. the location is excellent as it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ close to the train station. very convenient if you are just passing through. it seems like they get a lot of business travellers there. i got to the hotel very early around 9am and my room was not ready yet. though regular checkin time is 2pm, they were apologetic and told me to come back in a couple of hours. i did and it still was not ready so i came back a couple of hours later. i was very tired and jetlagged and just wanted to lay down. i finally was able to checkin at 1pm. they gave me a voucher for a free drink and breakfast. i was pretty sure when i booked through my travel agent the price did not include breakfast so i think they gave me a complimentary breakfast because i waited for so long for my room. normally breakfast is 8√à√\u2020√ü?i think. though i would√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe paid that for the breakfast. there was more offered then i expected. including a variety of hams, cheeses, smoked salmon and hot eggs and sausage. as well i had booked a single room but i discovered they upgraded me to a twin one which was much bigger. the room is very nice and clean with really high ceilings. the bathroom as well is very clean and modern with shower. the area itself isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ the quietest as it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ close to the train station but it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother me that much. there is free internet in the lobby. and a nice bar and breakfast room. walking to the shopping and tourist areas is very close abour 15 minutes. for a pleasant and convenient stay i would recommend the hotel national.
