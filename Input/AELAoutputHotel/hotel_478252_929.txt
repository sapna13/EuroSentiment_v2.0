{"text":"Great Hotel I went with a few girlfriends to punta cana and stayed at the club diamond bahia principe (dec 24-jan 1st) inclusive. Our stay was wonderful:Rooms:Beautiful, spacicious, clean and there is NO musty damp smell I usually experienced when staying in resorts like Cuba or Mexico. The bathrooms are large, with a jacuzzi, i didnt want to get out of the shower. We left nice little gifts for our maid daily and it was appreicated: extra towels, extra water, etc. We made sure we had an in-room safe to keep all of our valuables. We had no problems with security and felt safe. My weird expeirence was a maid knocking on our door early at 8am three times and then entering. When i said ola she left! Were they planning on cleaning the rooms this early? Also the other weird part was that the maids seemed to be cleaning the rooms more than once a day. I mean, i understand how cleanliness is huge at this hotel, but I felt odd that they just came and went when they pleased. Please be wary of this ---we experienced no theft or anything, but still....Food: The buffet was large, expansive and impressive. They could easily serve the same food everyday but they had theme nights and you could always find SOMEthing to eat. The service is excellent. We booked four a la cartes right away to ensure availability. All were very good, nice dining experience (mexican food not teh best!). If u are club diamond, nobody told us that you get to eat a la carte at the italian restaurant for lunch everyday. Make sure you dont forget this! We were stuck at the beach grill eating the cold fries and undercooked burgers until we realized. Nightlife:Not much in punta cana--at least not on the resort. The karoke piano bar is quite lame. The casino is small and the disco is more for the younger teenage crowd experiencing tequila and grinding on each other for the first time. I guess that happens when you travel during winter break! We went a few clubs off the resort, which were not bad --mangu club has great music and a good crowd ($10 cab ride and $5 cover with a drink ticket). Drinks are cheap too. Riu disco wasnt bad, not as hype of a crowd.Day Trips:We did the outback safari tour and dolphin tour. Both were very good. Open bar on the back of the safari jeep, and the tour guides speak very good english and show you a good time. Also went to the spa--a bit pricey for 30 mins but very very relaxing and clean services!Overall service:You give people respect, you get it! We enjoyed the service at this hotel, these workers dont get paid much, they work very hard and always are smiling. We made sure to leave behind gifts and tips. Somebody did something right when they built this resort. As for the negative reviews, things are not perfect: but when you make a huge deal out of not getting enough towels on your vacation, lack of english in a country that YOU are a guest in, not enough good wine (this is not naples!) you are obviously not going to have a good time. Cheers.
