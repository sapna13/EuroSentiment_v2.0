{"text":"Very happy at the Mayflower My husband and I stayed at the Mayflower for 5 nights, including New Years. We had a wonderful and wouldn't have picked another hotel. A little background: my husband and have lived in big cities including Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco. My husband lived in the Russian Hill area of San Francisco for over 2 years just a few years ago.Now for the review: the hotel was very clean, including our room. When we checked in we were given a tour by the owner's (Nancy) husband. He showed all us all the different rooms, and gave us a choice of what room we wanted. It is a good idea to do this as all the rooms are bit different and you may find one you like more than another. For example, some rooms have newer refrigerators than others, different cabinetry, etc. They are in the (slow) process of remodeling the wet bar in each room and when they are all done they will look great! Currently, most of them are quite old, but still in good condition. We really enjoyed having a mini fridge and microwave in our room and was one of the many reasons we chose the Mayflower.We also picked a room on a higher floor, as the first and second floors are more open to street noise and are also colder. Since we went in the winter, we wanted to be warmer without using the heat (to avoid stuffiness). We kept the window open most of our stay and the noise was negligible. My husband sleeps with earplugs and is an extremely light sleeper and we both slept well. The bathroom fixtures are new, with old and neat bones still in place. The entire hotel is like this really, with the lovely features that old buildings have still in place, but modernized. We found the staff very helpful and friendly for the most part. Some of the night staff were kind of disinterested, but at that point we were heading to bed and really didn't care. The breakfast that some people raved about was just so-so in our opinion. It's great that they offer it, but we weren't impressed. It's a nice continental breakfast, don't expect more than that. We didn't, and weren't disappointed because of it. Previous reviewers were not kidding about the size of the garage. It is so narrow you have to see it to believe it. Our rental ford focus barely fit, and I mean by mere centimeters. We switched cars mid way through our stay and our Toyota Corolla was a better fit, but not by much. The garage has to be opened manually, and if you come and go frequently, it can be a bit annoying to stop and get out of the car, have someone open the garage and drive it down, but it's not that bad. Especially when you consider the price, the narrowness and slight inconvenience are all worth it.Our room's walk in closet had a funky odor, but I didn't find it obnoxious or offensive. I think it's just from being closed and not often used. Just sort of stale smelling. I hung my clothes in it and they didn't absorb any of the odor. The water pressure in our room was fine, we didn't find it weak at all. The linens were clean and very homey. The neighborhood is just fine. We came and went at all hours of the day and night and encountered no issues whatsoever. The hotel is near the area aslo known as the noberloin or tendernob, a blend of one of the sketchiest areas in SF and one of the ritziest. You turn one corner and you're in sketchville, you turn another and you're surrounded by high end restaurants and hotels. But the Mayflower is closer to the Nob than the Loin. The hotel is locked at night to make sure only guests enter. We walked to Union Square, and Nob Hill and I am in not such great shape, and it was not that bad. The previous poster who complained about the distance and hills - puhlease! If you like driving everywhere, go visit a suburb. We walked up two giant hills to get to Nob Hill and survived. It was fun. The area is good. And for the price, I would say the area is great. I think you would be hard pressed to find such a good deal any where else in the city.
