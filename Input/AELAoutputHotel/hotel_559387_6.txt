{"text":"Enjoyed My Stay Stayed here for 5 nights in November as I was attending a conference next door at the CCIB.If you are to ever stay at a Hilton, join the HHonours club as it is free and you get little upgrades which are handy.The check-in was quick and easy. The chap who booked us in spoke excellent English and was very polite. He even turned someone away who pushed infront of us! I liked that :)The room I had was very nice on the 12th floor. It had two single beds (fine as I was a lone traveller) and flat screen TV and a view of the port \/ sea. Don't be fooled by the photographs on the Hilton website - the hotel is a fair few metres form the beach...there is a big road to get past first!The bathroom was big and clean with nice towels, two dressing gowns and slippers. One thing that did put me off was someone had graffitied the word DEATH on the architrave in the bathroom. This kind of shocked me when I noticed it at 1 in the morning after a few beers! Hilton - please sort this!!!!On one day the hotel lost all water \/ water pressure, which meant I had an awkward shower! The hotel did apologise with a letter and box of chocolates which as okWorst thing about the hotel is the prices. 24 Euro for breakfast is a con, 27 Euro for internet access (which was rubbish) and 7 Euro for a beer. Extortion! The shopping center across the road is really good, loads of restaurants and shops - enough to please everyone.All in all a good hotel - I'd definitely come back, but not to pay for breakfast or use the internet!
