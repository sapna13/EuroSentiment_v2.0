{"text":"Great location. We had based our selection of this hotel, for our family visit to Paris, on all the very positive reviews that we had seen on Tripadvisor website. As a result, we had high expectations prior to arriving. We got to the hotel from CDG Airport, by train\/metro in about one hour, after getting a Carte Orange travel pass in the RAPD\/RER sales desk in Terminal 2. The nearest stop is La Motte Picquet-Grenelle, about 200m from the hotel. The hotel is located on a quiet side street, off the busy Boulevard de Grenelle. The location is excellent, eg. only a 15mins. walk from the Eiffel Tower. There are many restaurants and shops nearby, including all the usual department chain stores located on Rue de Commerce, such as HM, Monoprix, Promod, Sara, Pimkie, Celio, Gap, Etam, etc.. In addition there is a supermarket, Le March√ã√\u2022√ñ Franprix on Avenue de Motte-Picquet.We arrived at 6pm. Our check-in went smoothly. The boutique hotel theme hits one immediately. We stayed in room 32 for the four nights. There were four of us, i.e. my wife, two teenage children and myself. The room felt small for the four of us. The bathroom too was small. The decor was nice however, and very up to date. Versace tiling etc..One strange thing was that there were some flies in the room. Both my wife and son, woke up after the first night's sleep with multiple insect bites. I swatted all the flies subsequently. The flies may have come in via the air-conditioning system, or the window, which was a little loose and not double glased.We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, as we suspected that it was too expensive at √à√\u2020√ü?5 per person. We found an excellent boulangerie chain outlet at 10 Rue de Commerce, called Brioche Doree - Le Fournil de Pierre, opposite the HM and Sara stores, only 250m from the hotel. Its breakfast was only √à√\u2020√ü?.90, and included an orange juice, a croissant with jam, and a coffee. Before we found this, we also tried Le Bouquet de Grenelle across from the Metro stop on the corner of Boulevard de Grenelle and Avenue de Motte-Picquet. It worked out at √à√\u2020√ü?0 per person minimum.There were many restaurants in the area, eg. French, Indian, and Italian. There was also a MacDonalds and a Pizza Hut. We tried only one, Le Suffren (about 250m in the Eiffel Tour direction, at 84 Avenue de Suffren), as we were on the move each night. It was okay. All in all, we found it a nice hotel, well centered, and nicely decorated, but expensive.
