{"text":"Absolutely Amazing Just got back from my 4th of July getaway to San Juan and I stayed at the Condado Plaza Hotel. A decision I didn't regret. It is the low season, and I got an amazing rate of $99 plus all taxes and fees. (note that the taxes and fees are pretty hight. Puerto Rico has a 9% tax for hotels without a casino and 11% on hotels with casino. Also the Hotel charges a Resort Fee of a whopping 14% of the rate per day.)The location has its pros and cons. On the western end of the Condado, there is no real beach. There is a small beach that is public right outside the hotel. It's not a bad little beach, but not as nice as other beaches east. On the plus side, you can walk to anything in the Condado. and for Old San Juan or Isla Verde, there are always a lineup of taxis outside day and night. A better option is the bus. The B21 line runs right past the hotel. This line runs from Old San Juan to the Plaza Las Americas mall, so it's easy access to both of these areas. To get to Isla Verde, take a taxi or a 15 minute or so walk to Ponce de Leon avenue and catch the A5 bus to Isla Verde. Remember all bus service stops around 9pm. They are renovating the hotel. Most of it is done, but the lobby and common areas in the main building are still being worked on. You have to enter and at the Lagoon Building across the street where the front desk is temporarily located and take the walkway to the main building's 2nd floor to access the casino, restaurants, and rooms. The rooms are absolutely enormous. I got a room on the 10th floor with the view of the lagoon, Miramar, and the mountains, and it is a gorgeous view. The rooms on the ocean view side of the hotel have balconies and are much more pricey. The room had a sofa and living room area, and a king size bed. the bathroom was equally gigantic, with a glass walk in shower stall right in the center of the bathroom. The shower stall could easily fit 3 people in it with room to spare! In the separate dressing area of the bathroom was the closet and drawers, with iron and board, and a small counter with coffeemaker and a refrigerator underneath. The other side of the bathroom had a huge marble counter with sink and hairdryer. Every amenity imaginable was in this room. Internet connection, plasma screen tv, huge marble desk, down bedding and comforters, and the enormous window that took up the whole wall giving a beautiful view of the highrises of Miramar and the mountains in the distance. Service is fantastic in this hotel! Everyone is very friendly and bends over backwards to help you.The casino is pretty nice too. One of the larger casinos in Puerto Rico, this still is nothing in size compared to the casinos of Vegas. There are about a dozen or so table games, and the rest is slots.However, what it lacks in size it makes up for with quick friendly drink service, friendly dealers, a smoke-free environment, and much lower minimum bets than in the high-end casinos in Vegas.Since there is not a huge, beautiful beach on premises, this hotel goes out of their way to make their pool area and gardens as nice as possible. There are 2 pools in the main building, and beautiful gardens with hammocks overlooking the ocean. Pool service is quick and friendly. Food is not bad at all but the restaurants and drinks are really overpriced. Eat elsewhere if you can. Overall, this hotel is best described as a 5 star hotel in a 3 star location. No you are not in Isla Verde, but you are in a convenient area, the rooms are luxurious, and the service here is truly first class.
