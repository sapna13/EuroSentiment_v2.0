{"text":"Nice-Looking Hotel but Way Too Many Drawbacks We were very disappointed in the B-Hotel. Yes, it is very sleek and modern-looking, but they sacrifice convenience and comfort for this modern look. Who wants a bathroom that you can see through and hear everything out of? And the lights, while not that hard to figure out, were definitely more annoying than clever. Some of the problems: Our phone didn't work the first night we were there and no one could figure out what to do, not even a manager, even though the problem could apparently be remedied by three keystrokes into the computer downstairs; there are no clocks anywhere in the room and the front desk did not give us the wake up call we'd asked for (even though we went downstairs and asked personally, and in fluent Spanish) so we almost missed our flight home; there is constant construction going on outside and while it's not too loud to sleep through for a girl like me from New York City, it was annoying to hear jackhammering early in the morning; the hotel does not have an operating restaurant or bar (unless it was just closed for August?) and the neighborhood's choices are pretty bleak - you have to take the Metro if you want to eat somewhere nice.We booked B-Hotel because the great reviews here on Tripadivsor made it seem like we'd be getting a great hotel for a cheap price, but I was very disappointed: $120 a night might not be a lot for a hotel in Barcelona, but it's too much to pay for a hotel with so many inconveniences that's located in a neighborhood you can't have fun wandering around in after dinner.
