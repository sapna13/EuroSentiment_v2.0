{"text":"Not at the top of list, but so so close Brilliant From arrival to departure, 12th to 26th september, the staff were excellent. Always on hand to help. As usual one or two rose above the rest, so these were the ones that got the regular tip. The rooms, as mentioned before are basic, but as also mentioned before, as it's clean and functioning as it should be, they are more than ok. You only sleep in them.Food, for the life of me i cannot understand how anyone can moan about the food. IT'S FRESH, IT'S HOT and there IS a good selection to choose from. Oh the BBQ chicken excellent, go on try some.Grounds, kept spotless and look really good, spacious.Pool, one of the best i have seen, with the exception of LTI Costa Caribe in Margarita.Excursions, i recommend Picaso. He walks around the grounds. He will probably come to talk to you, don't forget your skin may free of a tan, so he will pick up on this, and know that you are new arrivals.Beach, about the best by a long way. Only one other compared to this and that was in Cyprus.Golf, Just down the road if you would like a swing or two, but not cheap. 18 holes plus clubs $140.Casino, just outside the hotel, pongs alittle when you walk in, but i came out the winner so soon forgot about the smell.If you require anymore advise please do ask, i will always give my honest oppinion. Will post some pictures later as i am now back at work.. ","annotations":[]}
