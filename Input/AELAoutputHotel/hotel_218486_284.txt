{"text":"Beautiful waters and Island, boring resort. I am a teenager and i stayed here for about a week. even though i am a teenager i know a good hotel. There wasnt much to do at night especially becuase we werent in peak season. my parents complained that the casino was closed i dont know what the was about.. the food was okay nothing special i ate at the japanese, brazilian and bucenero. All decent nothing great. although my parents complained about the food it didnt seem that bad to me and my friend. (we are 15)... We were in the elite club it was nice spacious rooms with beautiful ocean views..the ocean is beautiful and i would suggest going to the sport hut and renting a boat and going scuba diving it was so much fun. (when you are on the boats ask the guys to take you to the nicest beach around) we did and it was gorgeous!There isnt much to do at night. At all especially for us teens we were usually asleep by 11 to save ourselves from bordeum.the beach was nice it could get seaweedy but it didnt matter to me that much. and a guy comes around with diffrent animals once in awhile and takes picture. i got to hold a monkey! there was also a snake and iguana ... probley more.as for the islanders... they were VERY friendly.. a little too friendly sometimes, to the point where it got creepy but if you just ignore it and tell them to go away and dont give off the wrong signals it would be ok.i was american and there were not many americans there. mostly italian and spaniards... i found some of the itlians to be very rude but i rubbed it off.overall it was a good vacation. i woudlnt stay here again but it wasnt anything horrible.i loved this island it was amazing.
