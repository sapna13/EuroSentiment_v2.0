{"text":"A Wonderful Vacation! We just returned from our vacation at the Riu Macao - Punta Cana 30 March-April 6! We had a WONDERFUL time and would go back again! After reading the reviews over the past several months there were times I was seconding guessing our choice and times I couldn't get to Punta Cana fast enough. We booked our vacation throught our travel agentApple Vacations. We flew USA 3000 - great service - the plane was a bit cramped for my husband, but for the kids (14\/12 yrs) and myself we were confortable. Upon arrival at the airport after retrieving your luggage, we were greated by a Apple Representative who directed us to our bus. The bus ride to the hotel is roughly about 35 minutes to the hotel. Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by the front desk with a smile and tropical punch. The room was spotless but did smell a bit at first. No problem - opened the sliders to the balcony and lit some candles that we had brought along with some fabreeze sheets for the closet (a suggestion I got from this site). We never seem to have the smell the rest of the trip - when we were in the room we always had the sliders open. The room was SPOTLESS and we all found the beds  pillows surprising comfortable - many complained the beds were too hard - we like a firm mattress so there was no complaint there. There is something to do for EVERYONE of EVERY AGE. The Activity Directors had plenty of things to do for everyone. ..volleyball, dance lessons, darts, bocce, ping pong, aerobics, etc. You can choose to participate or not. The beach is absolutely BONITO! The pool is also enjoyable ...we NEVER ever had a problem finding a chair at the pool or the beach and we were not down at the break of dawn for reserve a chair for 4. The food is good with the buffet offering the most variety for everyone. Sometimes some of the meat was overcooked, but there is some much to choose from fish, meat, pasta, salad, fruit , cheeses, etc. and service with a smile. Everyone was pleasant ,spoke English and gave us a chance to practice our Spanish! There were visitors from all countries US, Canada, England, Germany, Italy - a nice diversity.Just a hint in regards to water sports and tennis - you need to reserve early (the day before most likely) if you want to make sure you get a sailfish, paddleboat, etc. and court. Excursions we participated in and enjoyed was the Jungle Safari ask for Danny Boy (the guide) he is fabulous (enjoyed the most), The snorkeling\/swimming w\/ nurse sharks\/ray and the Quad tour. Would go back in a heart beat!
