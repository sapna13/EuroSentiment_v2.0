{"text":"Don't miss this experience We arrived in Singapore to stay at The Regent on the start of our Australian visit for a four night stopover enroute. It was a wonderful haven of peace and tranquility after a long journey from Scotland. Thankfully, after eating a great meal in one of the hotel's restaurants we slipped between crisp cotton sheets and with the hum of the airconditioner slept a deep and refreshing sleep in an incredibly comfortable double room. We were just coming in from China Town the next evening when we got a call to say my husband's mother had just died in South Africa. My husband decided to go immediately to South Africa and we decided that I would travel to Perth, Australia as previously planned. The hotel management could not do enough for us - they gave us free internet access, sent up endless trays of coffee, tea and chocolates etc, sent faxes and generally looked after us. When my husband left they took it upon themselves to look out for me too and I got wonderful, warm and compassionate treatment from not just the management but from every member of staff I came into contact with. All in the beautiful setting of the Regent hotel. I have to say they went way over their normal duty of care for their clients and we appreciated every single thing they did for us. On our return from Australia a month later we had booked to stay with them again, and found the same warmth and hospitality that we had previously experienced. The rooms are divine - cool, calming and comfortable with cable TV, lovely bathrooms and a well stocked mini bar. Each night when we were out, our rooms were freshened up, and we came back to, once more, order, calm and comfort! The hotel is immaculate with fabulous bars and restaurants and if you want to spoil yourself at a comparatively small cost, try the wonderful hotel buffet which is on every night - we couldn't fault it. The pool area is being renovated but you would not have even known that and they had reciprocal agreements with the Trader hotel next door if you needed it. The location is great, just on the corner of the famous Orchard road, two minutes from the Tanglin shopping mall where you can eat if you choose or shop, and a couple of minutes from the Singapore Airlines hop on\/hop off bus stop (look up Singapore Airlines website for this great facility). Failing that, the doors were always opened by smiling, gracious staff and a taxi hailed right to your feet by obliging doormen. The Concierge facility at the hotel is great - they can answer anything!So, as you can gather, we loved The Regent and feel you could not go wrong with this choice - everything about the hotel is designed to pamper the client and they do it so well.Special thanks go to all the staff there but especially to Roslee Ashari, Assistant Front Office Manager, the lovely Afiza, Duty Manager and Jayabalan at the Tea Room restuarant, we won't forget your kindness.
