{"text":"Best Hotel in the Dominican It was our 4th time to the Domincan, this hotel was by far a superior class. Resort: A very private resort where noise is kept to a minimum as it is chidren free and geared towards adults. Plently of places to relax so it is not over-crowded. There were lots of different seating ranging from loungers to four poster beds both on the beach and around the pool, with plently of towels. The reception is large and spacious and very comfortable. The reception staff are very helpful, especially charismatic Edwin. The unique design of the resort means that you don't get wet walking from the rooms to the restaurants during the tropical showers.Rooms: There was a 4 poster bed, luxury furnishings and it was very comfortable. Well maintained and clean. It was a spacious room with good seperate shower. DVD players in the room. The TV channels are limited and very geared towards the US market, no English footie or news.Facilities: There is waiter service wherever you lay your hat. They will take drinks orders as well as deliver pizza on the beach. There are 8 restaurants for the evening dinners to satisfy most taste buds. If you have any special food requirements e.g. vegetarian, see Ramon, manager of Barcelona restaurant, he will make anything for you. (Thank you Ramon, you made our holiday). The head chef, Mr Dettweitler is world renown and ensures that all of the food is of the highest quality, they are very lucky to have him there. The breakfast and lunch buffets are fantastic offering a large choice of food. Felix the manager of the Toscana is very polite and helpful. The gym is the most modern we have ever seen in a hotel with state of the art equipment and it is well maintained.General: They create a very comfortable atmosphere and nobody violates your space in any way, but they are always there if you need them. It is a very easy place to settle in to. Go for it, you will not be disappointed!
