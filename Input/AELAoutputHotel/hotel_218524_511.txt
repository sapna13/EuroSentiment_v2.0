{"text":"Best time ever at excellence punta cana My husband and i stayed at Excellence from 3\/20 to3\/24 and it was the best vaction yet. I booked the trip in November so I had plenty of time to read the reviews. Some were very informative while others were just over the top. Yes the ride to the resort is bumpy, but considering the time we had it was well worth it.The people at the resort were the best they really know how to treat people. The food was good too. Our favorite was the grill and chez Isabell. We chose the Excellence Club but really didnt need it. There was more than enough food and drinks that your cup never went empty. The shows were good too. We met some really nice couples who also loves the place. I must address the beach it really was as rough as other have said . There lobster house features a Dominican lobster so if your use to maine lobster this may be a little different. We also had ants on the vanity in the room, but was address right away.We cant forget to say hola to joel and carlos of the entertainment team and jose the funniest bartender at the cafe bar. we had a great time laughing with you guys . Keith the cigar guy says hello.We will see you guys again. Despite the small stuff Excellence is truly paradise. I cant wait to return. Excellence is truly the most beautiful resort on the island. Take the professional pictures they are really beautiful and they made our anniversay one to remember.Thanks Excellence ","annotations":[{"endOffset":530,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":526}]}
