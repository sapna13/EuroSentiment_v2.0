{"text":"Great staff The Hampton Inn is a new hotel built to look like it has been there awhile due to NYC code requirements. It is not your standard Hampton Inn. It is a 9-story hotel with 65 rooms in Lower Manhattan. There is no real lobby but rather just a small sitting area, the walking area to the elevators and ground-level rooms, the front desk, and the breakfast area. You will not pay standard Hampton Inn rates as you are within walking distance to Wall Street. In my experience, the rooms are more expensive Mondays - Thursdays. For example, I've seen a Tuesday night rate of $399 and a Friday night weekend rate of $219.The hotel is in a great location if you have business in Wall Street or at the U.S. federal courts (only a few blocks away). It is also very convenient to subway and bus stops. The hotel is located at 320 Pearl Street at the corner of Pearl Street and Peck Slip (an old cobblestone street which has lots of restaurants). The hotel is close to FDR Drive and the Brooklyn Bridge. The hotel is easy to miss. I drove by it twice because the Hampton Inn sign is very small and there is no hotel half-circle driveway entrance. There is no parking at the hotel but a parking garage a block away is available at a reduced charge for hotel guests. Wireless internet is included in the room rate. It worked great during my 3-day stay. My room, though small, had a nice big desk.The staff was very friendly and helpful. They really made the stay. Breakfast is included Mondays - Fridays and was a step above your standard continental breakfast as there were two hot items every morning. One morning there was pancakes as well as scrambled eggs. There was also fresh fruit.As stated, the rooms are small but it is New York so that is expected, and some rooms are larger than others. My room was very clean. Some rooms face Pearl Street and others do not. Some of the rooms not on Pearl Street and on the first six floors face the back of a building. I think that some of these ground-level rooms may have their own private courtyards. Other rooms on the back of the hotel face the river but ONLY those rooms on the top three floors (7-9, I think). What is really neat is that some of the top floor rooms have small terraces. These rooms are not really bigger than the others but you have the great views. There are some terraces on the Pearl Street side of the hotel but unsure as to the river side.As mentioned, the hotel is close to many restaurants. It is also within walking distance to the South Street Seaport which has even more restaurants. One great restaurant is a new French restaurant right around the corner at 259 Front Street (it used to be a Mexican restaurant). The food was very good and the staff very friendly. It has tables on the sidewalk so you get the cafe feel. All in all, I highly recommend the Hampton Inn Seaport.
