{"text":"Definitely staying here again I usually don't spend my time writing reviews, but wanted to compliment the staff and let people know of The Courtyard Marriott Ginza.This hotel lived up the positive reviews that I read here before going on our trip. We often stay at Westin Tokyo, but we had points at Marriott so decided to give it a try. At $250 per night for the room that we had, compared to Westin Tokyo's $400 per night, this hotel was every bit as pleasant. The service, cleanliness and convenience was a nice surprise. The only drawback to this hotel is that the rooms are much smaller than the Westin, but the Courtyard is located in Ginza which has the most expensive per sq. ft property in the world! The rooms seem to be recently renovated and have a nice modern decor.The subway is only one block away while our favorite Westin Tokyo is a long 15 walk from the Ebisu station. Doing that walk a few times a day gets old. :(Because the Courtyard Ginza has fewer rooms that hotels like the Hilton, Hyatt, and Westin, the lobby was always empty with no lines to the front desk and the concierge was alway readily available. Be sure to make good use of the concierge for info and tips. The speak english well and are VERY attentive and helpful. The free wireless internet in the lobby is perfect for people traveling with their laptop or iPhone or you can use the business center.We are die hard Westin travelers, but the price, convenience to the subway and attentive staff can off set the smaller rooms and convince us to stay here again.
