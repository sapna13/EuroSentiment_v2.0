{"text":"great service and value We stayed at this hotel 12\/17-12\/20, and had a wonderful time. As mentioned in numerous reviews, the staff goes out of their way to be accommodating. We arrived at 10:30am on Sunday, well ahead of the 3pm check-in time, and I expected to store our bags for a few hours. The front desk took our bags, insisted we go upstairs to Rick's Cafe to unwind after our ride, and they would see if they had a room available. They did, and delivered our luggage before we were able to get to the room ourselves.Our room was small, but functional, and spotless (especially the bathroom!). No noise problems whatsoever. Upon check-out we decided to have lunch at Tony's (next door -has an entrance through the hotel). We sat back with a couple glasses of wine, and my husband went to check us out. As our car had not arrived the front desk staff stored our luggage, and insisted that he go back over to Tony's while they checked us out. They came over to the restaurant to settle the bill, give us our copy, and even make change. Finally, when we went back over to the hotel for our car, they insisted that we wait in Rick's cafe again, which would be much more comfortable than the lobby. We relaxed until they came up to tell us our car was ready, and then helped us into it. A very stress-free way to end a trip.We booked a car back to the airport through the hotel, and although about $25 more expensive than other options, we were able to put this charge on our credit card (it included gratuity and tolls), the car was clean, provided mints, water, and magazines, and came with a very professional suited driver who didn't try to make small talk. Very nice way to return to the airpot.Highly, highly recommended.
