{"text":"Great location, great fun, great staff There's a lot of choice in San Francisco, not least determining the area in which to stay. Having decided what the hell, I'm a tourist, so don't be ashamed to do the touristy stuff, I put my trust in the Tripadvisor reviews which rate this hotel so highly and was not disappointed in the slightest. I booked the A Discovery Awaits package which included Valet Parking, breakfast at the Blue Mermaid Chowder House, and Cable Car\/Bus\/Tram passes. I upgraded our room in advance to a King Bay View room on the grounds that several reviews complained the rooms were on the small size. So I can't comment on the standard room - however I can highly recommend this kind of room, although it is pricey. Be aware that the view is partial and certainly not uninterrupted. However the room is large, spotlessly clean and full of quirky touches, colours and furniture. Staff were absolutely delightful, made us feel so welcome and nothing was ever too much trouble. Breakfast was fine - of course you can get better, but it was included in our rate and was well cooked, with friendly service. Parking is expensive if not included in your rate. The Powell\/Hyde cable car turnaround really is close - in fact it was under our window, less than a two minute walk from the front of the hotel.I'm sure there are many excellent hotels in SF. We took a chance with the Argonaut and it delivered on every level. It was so refreshing to stay somewhere where you didn't feel the interior designers had borrowed the Holdiday Inn decor guide (even the themed Vegas hotels can be formulaic in their layout and decor). Some may find it a bit OTT - we thought it was cool and we'll be back.
