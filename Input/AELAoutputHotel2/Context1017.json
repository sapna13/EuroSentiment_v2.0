{"text":"Great rooms, decor etc. The self contained facilities were a great addition (tea\/coffee making\/fridge\/microwave) too We did have problems with the electrics in our room the first night but this was dealt with promptly and we were moved to another room, which was even bigger, so more than happy with the resolution. Was a nightmare getting a taxi in the evening, the security guard\/reception guy didn't seem to know how. He eventually booked for us but the taxi didn't show and when we went out to reception, the guard was nowhere to be found. I ended up getting the Hailo taxi ap and booked one myself, which arrived in a couple of minutes.","annotations":[{"endOffset":5,"mention":"Great","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Great_%28supermarket%29"],"startOffset":0}]}
