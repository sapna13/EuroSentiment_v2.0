{"text":"The staff were fantastic, they were friendly, helpful and sorted everything that you needed, I was very impressed. The hotel was modern, clean and catered for all my needs. Once I checked out I had to stay on in the area and then work from the hotel and all the staff were so helpful and accomodating during my stay. I thought the rooms were very nice and I was impressed that they had Sky TV. Free wi-fi throughout the hotel allowed my business trip to run smoothly. My shower didn't work very well. The size of the room was very small. It was fine for just me but not the best for a couple.","annotations":[{"endOffset":9,"mention":"The staff","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Staff"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":124,"mention":"The hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Hotel"],"startOffset":115},{"endOffset":392,"mention":"Sky TV","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sky_TV"],"startOffset":386},{"endOffset":398,"mention":"Free","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Free-to-air"],"startOffset":394}]}
