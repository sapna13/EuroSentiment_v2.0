{"text":"We enjoyed our stay at the Bloomsbury, all the staff were polite and very helpful, the hotel was well sited and it was always warm and friendly to return to, we enjoyed smelling the lovely scented candles in the foyer. We hope to return this year. Our only negative comment would be, we would have liked a small breakfast option for less than 15.00 per head, perhaps a set option served at the table.","annotations":[{"endOffset":37,"mention":"Bloomsbury","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bloomsbury"],"startOffset":27}]}
