{"text":"The neighbourhood is quiet and it is very close to Pimlico tube station. One can also walk to Victoria station in about 10 minutes. The enormous central courtyard makes one forget that one is staying in the heart of a big city. The apartments have lots of natural light, one can open the windows, and they are very good value for money. Unfortunately the pool was not in operation when we stayed.","annotations":[{"endOffset":58,"mention":"Pimlico","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pimlico"],"startOffset":51},{"endOffset":76,"mention":"One","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/One_%28Bee_Gees_album%29"],"startOffset":73},{"endOffset":110,"mention":"Victoria station","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Victoria_Station_%28play%29"],"startOffset":94},{"endOffset":242,"mention":"The apartments","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Apartments"],"startOffset":228}]}
