{"text":"I brought my father here for his 60th birthday and we had a fantastic stay. The staff were brilliant and the upgrade to a 2 bed apartment was a surprise and lovely! The location was perfect for our plans and easily within walking distance. We were disappointed that the spa was closed during our visit.","annotations":[{"endOffset":85,"mention":"The staff","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Staff"],"startOffset":76},{"endOffset":177,"mention":"The location","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Location"],"startOffset":165}]}
