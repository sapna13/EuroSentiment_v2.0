    "text": "Rooms were excellent. House keeping do a great job! Reception area not very practical. Staff friendly enough but still felt like I was a task to be dealt with rather than paying customer. 1 hour wait to check in (Apartment not available until after 4pm). Apology didn't come across very sincere. No reason given. No direction given other than wait. It would have been nice if we were at least offered a cup of tea or wifi in recompense.",
